 Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues strongly to adopt  this amendment.   Attorney General Sessions' recent announcement to expand civil action  forfeiture really allows local law enforcement to bypass State laws and  seize property from people with the lowest possible burden of evidence  and without concern whether the person is eventually charged or  convicted.   While some will tell you this is necessary to go after big drug  cartels, the reality is the median value of the adoptive forfeiture  seizures has been around $9,000--not exactly the sign of any major drug  trafficking operation.   These adoptive forfeiture efforts tend to target poor neighborhoods.  Between 2012 and 2017, the median value of assets seized by Cook County  police was just over $1,000. In Philadelphia, in 2015, the median value  was $192.   This policy does not discriminate between the innocent and the  guilty.   With the responsibility on private citizens to prove their innocence,  rather than law enforcement to prove guilt, innocent people without  legal representation often never see their money or property again, and  even those who are proven innocent have no promise that their property  will be returned.    Mr. Chairman, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution  exists to protect the citizens of this country from being deprived of  life, liberty, or property without due process of law. In practice and  principle, adoptive forfeiture is a violation of that Fourth Amendment.  I urge my colleagues to support it.
