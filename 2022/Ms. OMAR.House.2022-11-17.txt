 Madam Speaker, I want to start out by thanking my community  for reelecting me to serve Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District.   Our State continues to have the highest voter turnout in the Nation.  It is one of the easiest States to vote in and should be a model for  States across the country.   In my district, we increased our voter share by 10 percentage points  from 2020, and we got more votes than any other House candidate in  Minnesota.   Beyond that, Minnesotans voted to flip the Minnesota Senate, creating  a Democratic trifecta for the first time in nearly a decade.   We also voted for incredible new leaders throughout our State that  have many firsts behind their names.   Bobby Joe Champion will be the first Black president of the Minnesota  Senate.   Zaynab Mohamed will be the first African-born Somali woman and Gen Z  member to be elected to the Minnesota Senate.   Along with Zaynab, Clare Oumou Verbeten and Erin Maye Quade will be  among the first Black women elected to the Minnesota Senate.   Samantha Sencer-Mura will be the first Japanese-American member of  the Minnesota House.   Leigh Finke will be the first trans member of the Minnesota House.   Mary Moriarty will be the first openly gay woman elected to be the  Hennepin County attorney.                                time  1045    Representation matters. We know none of these candidates ran to be  the ``first.'' They ran to make a difference for their communities.   When I was first elected to the Minnesota House, I was the first and  only Somali-American legislator. Now there will be 11 Somali-American  legislators across the country. It is often said, you can't be what you  can't see. I am incredibly proud that we, along with so many others,  have been able to inspire countless people to run for office. So now  many more people will finally see themselves reflected in various  places and positions of power.   I also want to take a moment to honor two of my mentors,  Representative Jim Davnie and Senator Patricia Torres Ray, who are  retiring from the Minnesota State House and Senate. I thank them for  representing our communities so well over the years. I can't wait to  see the work they continue to do to make sure our State thrives.   As we get ready to welcome in new leaders throughout our State, this  is our time to deliver meaningful changes for Minnesotans. Now is the  time to deliver affordable childcare, lower healthcare costs, invest in  K-12 and higher education, combat the climate crisis, and legalize  marijuana.   Minnesota nice is leading with compassion and getting things done.  Let's get to work.                International Parliamentary Inquiry on Myanmar     Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the situation in  Burma.   It has been my honor this year to be a member of the International  Parliamentary Inquiry on Myanmar. Our group of lawmakers representing  Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America released our final report  earlier this month, which I will submit as an extension of my remarks.   The tragedy of the Burmese military coup is immense, but the  resilience of the Burmese people and their movement for democracy is  deeply inspiring. The United States must recognize the National Unity  Government as the legitimate government of Burma and never give  legitimacy to the coup leaders.   But we should also be clear that the National Unity Government must  include Rohingya representation to be legitimate. The international  community has not done nearly enough to support the democratic  aspirations of the Burmese people. We must lead by example while we  still have time.                            ____________________
