 Madam Speaker, what America makes and grows, makes and  grows America and grows our middle class. Thus, let me applaud the  Biden administration's decision to utilize the Defense Production Act  to reshore the domestic manufacturing of essential medicines critical  for our national security.   This move is a strategic response to the challenges America faces,  particularly keeping inflation in check and healing the vulnerabilities  in our pharmaceutical supply chain.   The book, ``China Rx,'' highlights the growing number of our  country's reliance on foreign-made medicines, particularly from China.  They pose a significant national security risk to both our military and  civilian sectors.   The Defense Production Act offers a vital tool to onshore and  increased domestic production of essential medicines. In a world where  the availability of essential medicines can be a matter of life and  death, our Nation must take strong measures to resecure our domestic  pharmaceutical supply chain.   The Defense Production Act is a significant step toward achieving  this goal. What America makes and grows, makes and grows a stronger and  more secure America.                            ____________________
