 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, by a wide bipartisan margin,  the Senate began considering this year's National Defense Authorization  Act.   The Senate has passed an NDAA each of the last 58 years. We authorize  the resources, the equipment, the support systems, and the pay that  keep our All-Volunteer Force the strongest in the world.   From the outside, this process may look routine, but as our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee know best, keeping America  safe takes constant hard work and innovation.   We have all seen the recent headlines: ``Russia `successfully tests'  hypersonic intercept missile that can shoot down Western weapons,''  ``China's Military Technology Now Close to Parity With U.S.''   In just the last few hours, Iran shot down an American surveillance  aircraft in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz.  Fortunately, the aircraft was unmanned.   Let me say that again. Last night, the Iranians shot down a U.S.  aircraft in international airspace.   It could certainly not be clearer that we need to keep modernizing  our national defense, continue rebuilding our readiness, and persist  with our new national defense strategy.   Fortunately, this legislation includes billions of dollars for  modernizing our capabilities, restoring the Navy's fleet strength, and  investing in the latest generation of combat aircraft. There are  billions more for critical research weapons aimed at keeping U.S.  weapons systems on the cutting edge and ensuring American  servicemembers never enter a fair fight. It prioritizes greater  efficiency and transparency at the Pentagon so we can better support  military families through the sacrifices of service.   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack  Reed for guiding the committee process. I hope the Senate can work  through this legislation swiftly and give it the overwhelming  bipartisan vote it deserves.                                  Arms Sales    Mr. President, on a related matter, in addition to completing the  NDAA, the Senate will today have to dispense with several more  privileged resolutions concerning arms sales to close American partners  in a troubled but important region.   These close partners deserve our support. I am glad we secured a  bipartisan understanding yesterday to expedite their consideration so  the 22 separate resolutions which Members have introduced will not  jeopardize the Defense bill or the emergency border funding we must  also consider next week.   Today this body, yet again, will debate and cast votes concerning our  relationship with Saudi Arabia, just like we did in March and December  and the previous March.   I think the vast majority of Senators share serious concerns over  some of the policies and actions of our Saudi partners, but rejecting  long-planned arms sales strikes me as an overly blunt tool with several  unintended consequences.   For example, the arms sales affected by this vote are not just for  Saudi Arabia but also for the United Arab Emirates, and they include  sales that affect Israel, India, Korea, and Jordan.   Last December, the Senate passed a nuanced resolution that delivered  exactly the message we wanted to deliver: our fury over the murder of  Jamal Khashoggi, our concerns about the war in Yemen, and our desire  for more accountability. That was the right approach.   There is no shortage of tools available to the United States that are  more appropriate to communicate frustrations and urge better behavior,  whether from the administration or our partners.   Senators could meet with Saudi officials to directly express their  concerns. They could travel to the region to see firsthand complicated,  fluid situations.   Rapid societal and economic change is providing Saudi citizens with  unprecedented political openness but also troubling human rights  concerns and erratic policy decisions. The dynamics at play are not  black and white.   We can best shape these dynamics by working closely with our partners  to encourage them in the right direction, rather than turning our back.   Concerned Members might also begin giving fairer treatment and more  prompt consideration to the well-qualified experts who are waiting to  contribute to our diplomacy. Recall that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Near Eastern Affairs just started his job last Monday after  he had been held up for more than a year. The top State Department job  in the Middle East was held open for more than a year.   The nominees for Ambassador to the UAE, Egypt, and Libya are having  hearings today. I hope their confirmations will move more quickly than  those of other senior diplomats who languished for months.   So there is no shortage of productive steps at Members' disposal, but  recklessly canceling U.S. arms sales to key regional partners is not on  the list.   So the question the Senate will soon consider is really this: whether  we will lash out at an imperfect partner and undercut our own efforts  to build cooperation, check Iran, and achieve other important goals or  whether we will keep our imperfect partners close and use our  influence; whether we will push Riyadh and Abu Dhabi away from the  United States and push them closer to Moscow and Beijing or whether we  will stay engaged and help our partners course-correct where we can;  whether to signal at this hour of tension that we cannot be relied upon  to stand with our friends, sending a message that will embolden Tehran,  or whether to find more private, effective ways of encouraging better  behavior while sending a message of solidarity in troubled times.   The situation in the Middle East, as we speak, could hardly be more  fraught. The timing could not be worse for the Senate to send the wrong  signal.   In just the last several hours, we have seen reports that a missile  from inside Yemen has struck a utility plant in Saudi Arabia. This is  after other attacks--almost certainly from the Iran-backed Houthi  forces--on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including attacks on civilian  vessels and on a civilian airport.   Again, just last night, Iran shot down a U.S. intelligence aircraft  that was flying in international airspace. So the Senate could hardly  pick a worse time for clumsy and ill-considered resolutions that would  hurt key relationships in the Middle East.   Let's not cut ourselves off from our partners. Let's not undercut the  administration at a time of such delicate diplomacy and tension with  Iran. So I ask my colleagues to vote down these resolutions.                       Nomination of Kelly Knight Craft    Mr. President, on another matter, I had the opportunity to introduce  a skillful leader and fellow Kentuckian before the Foreign Relations  Committee only just yesterday. Kelly Knight Craft was confirmed by  voice vote in 2017 to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Now she  is the President's choice to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations.  [[Page S4133]]    Ambassador Craft's success in representing American interests in  Canada certainly rewarded the Senate's vote of confidence. During a  dynamic and sometimes challenging period in the U.S.-Canada friendship,  she has navigated it with care. She has helped to shepherd the USMCA.  She has helped to secure cooperation on sanctioning Russia for its  aggression against Ukraine and on pursuing democracy for Venezuela. She  has spoken out forcefully, when necessary, against China.   Not surprisingly, this talented diplomat has earned great respect  both at home and abroad.   The Premier of Ontario has said:         Every premier I know thinks the world of her. . . . She       really proved herself over some tough times.    The former Deputy to Ambassador Nikki Haley has described Ambassador  Craft as a worthy successor--``smart, capable, and knowledgeable about  the foreign policy challenges facing our country.''   This body confirmed Ambassador Craft to her current post by voice  vote. Since then, she has only gained even more experience, further  refined her expertise, and demonstrated her talent even more clearly.  Her testimony yesterday reinforced these things even further.   President Trump has made an excellent selection to serve our Nation  in this critical role at the U.N. She deserves bipartisan support from  the Foreign Relations Committee and, when the time comes, a swift  confirmation here on the Senate floor.                               Border Security    Mr. President, on a final matter, for nearly 2 months, my Republican  colleagues and I have come to the floor constantly to raise the alarm  on the humanitarian crisis down at the border. Record numbers of  migrants have pressed upon the U.S.-Mexico border, including never- before-seen numbers of families and unaccompanied children. The  agencies that care for these individuals and the facilities that house  them have been stretched dangerously thin.   We all know this. That is why the administration requested  supplemental funds 7 weeks ago. It is why agency heads and law  enforcement officials have literally begged Congress to act. Yet, until  yesterday, we had not seen progress, which leads one to ask why. It is  because--stop me if this sounds familiar--the Democratic House of  Representatives has been more interested in denying this White House  whatever it asks for, however necessary it might be, simply because it  has been this White House that has been asking for it.   My friend the Democratic leader has acknowledged publicly it has been  the Democratic-controlled House that has been the hurdle. One House  Democrat from a border State has likewise admitted that it has been the  left flank of his own conference that has been the stumbling block.   As the press has noted, some leading Democrats have let partisanship  so cloud their judgment that they have actually called the humanitarian  problem a manufactured crisis or an artificial crisis. Really?   Well, these 7 weeks of wasted time have made two things abundantly  clear--that partisanship doesn't change the facts and that ``the  resistance'' doesn't pay the bills. The House Democrats have failed to  get their act together, so now the Senate is going to move forward.   Yesterday, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Shelby and Senator  Leahy, the Appropriations Committee approved a significant funding  measure by an overwhelming vote of 30 to 1--just the kind of big,  bipartisan vote we ought to see in this particular situation for  noncontroversial funding for necessary programs to mitigate a national  crisis.   The Republicans have been urging this kind of consensus literally for  weeks, and now the Senate is finally rising to the occasion. We need to  vote on this legislation before we recess at the end of the month.   The Senate should not let even more time slip by without addressing  this crisis head-on, and if we receive the same kind of bipartisan  cooperation that was signaled in the committee vote yesterday, we will  not have to.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 88, 90, 92, 93, 334, 195, 196, 197, and 287.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume  legislative session on the motion to proceed to S. 1790. I further ask  that notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on S. 1790 expire  at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, June 24.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate this  year's winners of the Congressional Award. Established by Congress in  1979, the award recognizes the achievements of young Americans between  the ages of 14 and 23 years old and celebrates their accomplishment in  four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development,  physical fitness, and expedition/exploration.   The award challenges participants to set goals in an area that  interests them, encouraging them to pursue new interests and grow along  the way. If they successfully achieve their goals, they earn bronze,  silver, and gold certificates and medals. Through the program, these  young Americans gain new skills, earn greater confidence, and position  themselves to be productive citizens.   Today, recipients of the gold medal will be presented with their  Congressional Award at a ceremony here in our Nation's Capital. On  behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to congratulate all of the  winners for their accomplishments and for the example they set for  others. Among this impressive group, my State of Kentucky is home to  eight gold medalists. Through their efforts, the recipients of the 2019  Congressional Awards are strengthening their communities and our  Nation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of this year's  recipients of the Congressional Award Gold Medal be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Alabama: Warren Griggs.
