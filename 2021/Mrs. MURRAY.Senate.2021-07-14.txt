 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon  disposition of the Nanda nomination, the Senate resume consideration of  the Liang nomination at 5:30 today and the Senate vote on the motions  to invoke cloture on the Liang and Remy nominations in the order  listed; further, I ask that the cloture motion on the Cunningham  nomination ripen upon disposition of the Remy nomination.    Madam President, I was proud to vote to confirm Jocelyn  Samuels to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year when  she was confirmed in a bipartisan vote, and I am proud to do so again.   The EEOC has a critical role to play in protecting workers' rights  and addressing inequities in our economy which disproportionately  disadvantage women, people of color, people with disabilities, and  more. For example, it is responsible for enforcing discrimination and  harassment laws and works to address the gender pay gap.   Workers need a champion at the EEOC fighting for them, and Ms.  Samuels has proven over her nearly two decades of experience with the  Federal Government and her recent service as a Commissioner of the EEOC  that she is that champion.   From pushing to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as vice  president of education and employment at the National Women's Law  Center to leading civil rights efforts at the Department of Justice and  Department of Health and Human Services, to working as a staffer on the  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and a senior  attorney at the EEOC, she has spent her career working to address  discrimination and ensure no one is treated unfairly because of their  age, sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity, race,  religion, or disability.   I was pleased to see her nomination advanced out of our HELP  Committee with bipartisan support, and I hope to see similar bipartisan  support for her final confirmation.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
