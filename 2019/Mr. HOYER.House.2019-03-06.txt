 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate   Don Young, who the minority  leader and the Speaker have both indicated loves this House. The  minority leader then added apparently you haven't worked a day in your  life, at least that is how I interpreted it, Don. That was a liberal  interpretation, you know, this side of the aisle. What can I tell you?   We just lost the longest-serving Member of the House just a few weeks  ago, and as I sat here, I thought, what a resemblance there is between  the longest-serving Democrat of the House and the longest-serving  Republican of the House: irascible comes to mind; caring about this  institution comes to mind; faithful to principle comes to mind; blunt,  speaks truth, not only to power, but to everybody else as well.   Don  Young has made a difference.     Don Young comes from Alaska, as all of us know, although the  Speaker and the minority leader recognized that he came from  California, but, Don, you have really made a difference, particularly  for your State.   As chairman of Natural Resources, you were focused like a laser on  making sure that your State was treated fairly. I know there are still  some things you didn't accomplish that you would like to have  accomplished, and you have much time left to do that, but the fact is  all of us have benefited, I think, from your honesty, your recognition  of how the House ought to work, and, yes, your regular order, which you  demanded and didn't always get.   Of course, you took that with just very low-key responses, as I  recall, walking by your seat from time to time.                                time  1415    But Don Young is an institution. Don Young is an institutionalist.  Don Young is the kind of Member that makes this House, over the  decades, work as constructively as it can, not as constructively as it  should.   Hopefully, we will follow Don Young and John Dingell's example,  because both of them are lions of partisanship, but both of them were  not only willing but thought it appropriate to work across the aisle to  reach objectives that they could hold in common.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Don for his service. Don and I have  served together for 37 years. Between us, we have a little bit of time  on us. I look forward to serving with him for some years to come. God  bless him and Godspeed.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  thank her for her leadership on this bill, H.R. 1, and I thank Mr.  Sarbanes for being a principal sponsor and proponent of H.R. 1.   Mr. Chairman, I rise as the sponsor of the Help America Vote Act in  2002, which responded to the lack of performance on our voting system  in the 2000 election, hanging chads and all. This bill expands on that.   But let me, at the outset, remind those who would talk about what the  Constitution says to read a portion of the Constitution.   Let me say before I do that, throughout my lifetime, early in my  lifetime, I heard a lot about States' rights. People talk about the  right to vote. I was in Alabama this past weekend, and we commemorated  the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which was led by our  colleague,   John Lewis. There were State troopers meeting him on the  other side of the bridge that beat and almost killed   John Lewis. Why?  Because he was marching from Selma to Montgomery to register to vote.   I remember, as a child--not a child; I was a young man--watching  Lester Maddox on television with an ax handle saying that nobody was  going to integrate his premises.   I have heard a lot about States' rights through the years. Now, what  did our Founders say about States' rights as it relates to Members of  Congress? ``The times, places, and manner of holding elections for  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the  legislature thereof''--and apparently we didn't get to this phrase-- ``but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such  regulations. . . . `'   Why did our Founders do that? Because they wanted one nation.   Now, that was not our pledge at that point in time, but they wanted  the Colonies to come together as a nation. They had been a federation,  and it didn't work so well. So they wanted one nation to come together,  and at least for the Federal Congress, they reserved to the Federal  Congress the right to set the rules in the Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, last September, I delivered a speech outlining House  Democrats' plans to renew faith in government by enacting a series of  reforms to increase transparency, accountability, and ethics reform.  This week, after extensive hearings and lots of witnesses, we bring to  the floor a legislative package of reforms that made good on our  promises to the American people last year.   We didn't make a secret of this. This was well-known to everybody,  and they gave us the majority of this House. We are redeeming, today,  that honor and that responsibility.   I want to thank, again, Representative Sarbanes and the cosponsors of  this bill, every single Democratic Member. I want to thank   John  Lewis, a giant of a man, a giant of principle, a giant who risked his  very life to make sure that the protections available in this bill  would be available to every American and that we would promote--not  prevent--accessibility to the voting booth and that we would not  confront people going over a bridge in Selma, Alabama, who only wanted  to register to vote, to be turned around by State troopers ordered by  Governor Wallace to do so.   This bill was driven in large part by our dynamic freshman class who  were elected on a platform of making government work once again for the  people.   This For the People Act will open government up in several critical  ways. First, it includes real national redistricting reform. I am for  that. Mr. Chairman, it may cost Maryland a seat--I get that--but it is  the right thing to do to have a level playing field.    Now, we have got a number of court cases that have turned around  redistricting in North Carolina, in Pennsylvania, in Texas, and in some  other States as well. But I have always said that, in order to be  successful, redistricting reform cannot be done on a State-by-State  basis; and the Constitution, of course, says that Congress may at any  time by law make or alter such regulations so that we have fair--they  don't have to do this for State elections. If they don't want to do it,  that is fine. But we, under the Constitution, are the arbiters of  Federal elections. It must be a uniform process across all States.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, achieves this by requiring a  nonpartisan redistricting commission to oversee the process in every  State.   What does that mean? It means the politicians will not do it. Iowa,  California, or Arizona will have a fair redistricting process.   Next, this bill includes a much-needed expansion of voting rights to  protect our democracy. It would institute automatic voter registration.   In America, if you are an American citizen, you ought to have the  right to vote, and government ought not make it difficult for you to  exercise that right. No eligible voter should ever be turned away from  his or her polling place.   It will also restore the vote to those who have paid their debt to  society and should have a voice in their representative government.   This legislation builds on the important bipartisan work we did in  2002 when we passed, as I pointed out, the Help America Vote Act. It  reauthorizes the Election Assistance Commission, which, very frankly,  my Republican friends tried to eliminate on a number of occasions and  transfer their authority to the finance commission, which oversees  campaign finance--not election laws, campaign finance. It was a way to,  in effect, undermine and kill, in many ways, the Election Assistance  Commission designed to make sure that our elections are secure and  fair. It reauthorizes the Election Assistance Commission, which is  critically important to ensuring modern, accessible, and secure  elections.   In addition, H.R. 1 will make campaign finance more transparent,  requiring super-PACs to disclose their donors.   Again, I want to congratulate my colleague. We are very proud of    John Sarbanes and his dad in Maryland. He has been indefatigable in his  work in trying to make sure that it is the people's interest and not  the financial interests that control our elections.                                time  1515    This bill will end the era of massive amounts of dark, unaccountable  money funding ads and campaigns.   The For the People Act will also impose higher ethical standards on  America's highest elected officials.   There is only one person in government who can do something on his  own. It is not the Senate. It is not the House. It is not us. We need  collectivity. But the President can make substantial decisions on his  own and, in fact, has. He has done so over the wishes of the Congress  of the United States just recently, so the people ought to know what  his interests are and whether he is acting for his interests or the  people's interests.   Among other new requirements, Presidents and Vice Presidents would  [[Page H2397]]  be required, therefore, to release 10 years' worth of tax returns.   In such ways, H.R. 1 will make strides, Mr. Chair, in restoring the  trust in government that, unfortunately, has been lost in recent years.  Americans need to know that their government works for them and can be  a force for good for their families, their communities, and our  country.   I rise in strong support of this legislation. I don't rise because I  think it is perfect, but I rise because I think it is an excellent  effort to redeem the promise of America and our democracy.   It is for the people. Let us vote for the people.
