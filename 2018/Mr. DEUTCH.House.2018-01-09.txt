 Mr. Speaker, in the past couple of weeks, tens of  thousands of Iranian citizens from a broad cross-section of society  took to the streets to demand accountability and change in their  country. This was the largest mass protest since the Green Revolution  in 2009.   Tragically, both ended in the same predictable darkness: harsh  government crackdowns in which innocent peaceful protesters were  arrested, were jailed, and were killed.   In the latest episode, more than 3,700 Iranian protesters were  arrested and nearly two dozen were killed. The Iranian people deserve  better and they deserve the support of all peoples who value and yearn  for freedom.   Today's resolution sends an important message to the Iranian people,  that we stand with them in their legitimate pursuit of reforms from a  regime that would silence their voices and steal their fundamental  liberties.   I also believe we should do more. I am proud to have introduced with  Chairman McCaul, along with support of Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel, the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability  Act that goes one step further than condemnation to actually impose  sanctions against those Iranian officials perpetrating these egregious  human rights violations, as well as those responsible for kidnapping  Americans, Americans like my own constituent, Bob Levinson, who has now  spent more than 10 years in captivity.   Last week, we welcomed in a new year, and Bob's family again ushered  in that new year without Bob by their side. For his sake and for the  sake of the Iranian people trying to hold their own regime accountable  for caring more about Assad and Hamas than they do about helping their  own citizens, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H. Res. 676 to  help bring the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act  to the floor, and let's make sure that human rights remain exactly  where they should in American foreign policy, right at the center of  our agenda.
