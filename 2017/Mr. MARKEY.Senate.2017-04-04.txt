 Mr. President, Massachusetts has been the  birthplace of revolutions for centuries, from sparking the American  Revolution to leading the world in biotechnology, education, and  medicine. It is a natural home for the next era of the technology  revolution. I am proud that Worcester, MA was identified by TechNet and  the Progressive Policy Institute as a ``Next in Tech'' city, with a  thriving startup environment poised to drive innovation and job  creation for years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court.   Let me begin by making clear my view that the vacancy on the Supreme  Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was President  Obama's to fill. In an act of unprecedented obstructionism that makes a  filibuster pale in comparison, Senate Republicans broke with  longstanding Senate tradition and refused to hold a vote or even a  hearing on President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.   As we now consider President Trump's nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, we  cannot ignore or forget this hyperpartisan action. We also cannot  ignore how President Trump came to nominate Judge Gorsuch. President  Trump went to two of the most partisan, conservative organizations he  could find--the Koch brothers-supported Heritage Foundation and the  rightwing Federalist Society--and said to them: Who do you want on the  Supreme Court? They compiled their dream team of 21 ultraconservative  candidates. President Trump looked at the names on that list and asked  himself which judge could pass the rightwing litmus tests he had  articulated during the campaign. His choice was Judge Neil Gorsuch.   On the campaign trail, Candidate Donald Trump made clear that he was  pro-life and would appoint pro-life judges to the Supreme Court. In one  interview, he was asked about his pro-life position as follows:         So, how important is that issue to you now? When President       Trump picks Supreme Court justices, would there be a litmus       test?    Trump responded:         It is. It is.    During the second Presidential debate, Candidate Trump doubled down  on this issue. He was asked specifically about Roe v. Wade, the  longstanding Supreme Court precedent establishing a woman's right to  choose. The question to Candidate Trump was ``Do you want the court,  including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade?''   Trump responded that he would ``be appointing pro-life judges,''  adding, ``Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on . .  . that will happen,'' meaning Roe v. Wade will be overturned.   We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for  Supreme Court nominees on a woman's right to choose. That litmus test  is that he will appoint only pro-life Justices who are committed to  overturning Roe v. Wade.   What about a litmus test on guns? During the Presidential campaign,  Candidate Trump repeatedly emphasized his pro-gun views, which are in  lockstep with the National Rifle Association. He was asked about a  litmus test for the Second Amendment--specifically, the precedent  established in the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v.  Heller. In Heller, the Justices ruled 5 to 4 that a commonsense  Washington, DC, law banning handguns and requiring other firearms to be  stored unloaded or locked violated the Second Amendment.   Candidate Trump was asked: ``Will you make upholding the Heller  decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees?''   Trump answered: ``Yes, I would.''   The followup question: ``So you won't nominate somebody to the  Supreme  [[Page S2313]]  Court unless they agree with Scalia on the Heller decision?''   Trump responded: ``Correct.''   We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for  Supreme Court nominees on guns--his judges must support the National  Rifle Association's agenda and its unreasonable and dangerously broad  view of the Second Amendment.   From that list of 21 names provided to him by the Heritage Foundation  and the Federalist Society, President Trump chose Judge Neil Gorsuch,  apparently convinced that he was the man who would pass these litmus  tests.   The Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Judge Gorsuch were an  opportunity for him to dispel doubts about his independence that  President Trump's selection process had raised. Unfortunately, Judge  Gorsuch did nothing to address these concerns. In fact, his appearance  before the Judiciary Committee raised more questions than it answered  because Judge Gorsuch was positively sphinx-like before the Senators  questioning him.   For example, when repeatedly asked about something as elementary as  his judicial philosophy, Judge Gorsuch refused to answer. He declined  to say whether he agreed with the Roe v. Wade decision, the District of  Columbia v. Heller decision, or other controversial decisions, such as  Citizens United, which opened the floodgates to unrestricted, secret  money in electoral campaigns, or even the decision in Bush v. Gore,  which decided the 2000 Presidential election.   Judge Gorsuch also refused to respond whether he agreed with other  Supreme Court precedents on the right to privacy, the right to counsel  in criminal proceedings, voting rights, or same-sex marriage. Contrast  that to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who during her confirmation hearing  explained that she fully understood the individual right to bear arms  that the Supreme Court recognized in the Heller decision. Contrast that  with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who during his hearing praised the  Supreme Court's landmark 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, which  established the right to counsel in criminal cases. Even contrast Judge  Gorsuch with Chief Justice John Roberts, who at his hearing affirmed  that privacy is part of the liberty interest protected by the due  process clause. Instead, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch repeatedly  parroted that critical Supreme Court decisions were precedents of the  Court ``that he would follow unless and until they are overturned.'' He  shed no light on what he felt about those precedents or whether he  would be inclined or disinclined to vote to overturn them.   Only after considerable prodding did Judge Gorsuch eventually agree  that the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which did away with  the doctrine of separate but equal and desegregated schools across our  Nation, was correct. Having to pry out of Judge Gorsuch that concession  does not inspire confidence in him.   His performance at the hearings left us with many troubling things  that we don't know about Judge Gorsuch, but equally troubling about  Judge Gorsuch are the things we do know about him.   We do know that Judge Gorsuch authored the Hobby Lobby decision in  which he ruled that corporations are people whose religious beliefs are  more important than the reproductive rights and health of women.   We do know that Judge Gorsuch has questioned the judicial doctrine of  what is known as Chevron deference. That is the rule from the Supreme  Court case of Chevron v. The Natural Resources Defense Council under  which judges must generally defer to expert administrative agency  interpretations of laws they are charged with administering. In a  speech last year, Judge Gorsuch attacked the modern administrative  state that has developed under Chevron, saying that it ``poses a grave  threat to our values of personal liberty.''   What Judge Gorsuch is saying is not some abstract legal theorizing;  he is attacking the fundamental rules that protect the health, safety,  and welfare of all Americans that are put in place by agencies like the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and  the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the decades since Chevron  was decided, it has been instrumental in courts upholding these agency  rules that ensure that our air and drinking water are clean; rules that  ensure that drugs and medicines are safe and effective; rules that  ensure that our automobiles, workplaces, food, medicine, and children's  toys are not dangerous; and rules that ensure our financial markets are  fair and offer investors a level playing field.    Even Justice Scalia supported Chevron deference. But Judge Gorsuch  has signaled that he would overturn it and instead allow pro-corporate  judges to substitute their policy views for those of the agency  experts. If threatening the destruction of the regulations that protect  the health, safety, and welfare of Americans sounds familiar, it  should. It is straight out of the alt-right, Steve Bannon playbook. And  it is a fringe position that is not worthy of representation on our  Nation's highest Court.   We also know that the Supreme Court just rejected Judge Gorsuch's  harsh reasoning in a disabilities rights case. A few years ago, Judge  Gorsuch wrote an opinion for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in a  case under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. That  opinion held that schools across the country must provide educational  benefits to students with disabilities that must be ``merely more than  de minimis.'' But just last week, in an IDEA case, all eight Supreme  Court Justices disagreed with Judge Gorsuch. Chief Justice Roberts  wrote that the IDEA--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act-- is ``markedly more demanding than the `merely more than de minimis'  test applied by the Tenth Circuit,'' and added that Judge Gorsuch's  approach would effectively strip many disabled students of their right  to an education.   We also know that Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled against  employees in cases involving claims of unsafe workplaces and sex  discrimination, and he has repeatedly sided with insurance companies  that sought to deny disability benefits to employees.   Here is something else we know. If the first 75 days of the Trump  administration are a preview of coming attractions, one thing could not  be more clear: The U.S. Supreme Court's rule defending the Constitution  will be tested as never before: conflicts of interest, emoluments,  Muslim bans, rescinding LGBTQ protections. The list of constitutional  rights the Trump administration is violating gets longer every single  day.   Now more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is  independent and not beholden to ideology. Now more than ever, we need a  Justice who will stand up for the rights of all Americans against big  corporate interests. A Justice who would be to the right of Antonin  Scalia on the issue of Chevron deference is not a mainstream Justice. A  Justice who would be to the right of Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas  by a substantial margin--as professors from Michigan State University  and the University of Wisconsin concluded after examining Judge  Gorsuch's opinions on the Tenth Circuit, and the Supreme Court's  decisions reviewing them--is not someone within the mainstream of  American jurisprudence.   Everything we have seen so far--from Donald Trump's judicial litmus  tests, to the visible hand of rightwing interest groups in the  selection process, to Judge Gorsuch's reticence before the Judiciary  Committee, to his pro-corporate bias in cases he has decided--leads me  to the conclusion that he will be neither a Justice for all Americans,  nor one on whom we can count to stand up to President Trump.   We cannot let Judge Neil Gorsuch become the crucial ninth vote on the  Supreme Court. One Justice matters. The list of recent 5-to-4 decisions  coming out of the Supreme Court shows that one judge's vote can forever  alter history. Just remember that Bush v. Gore, Citizens United,  District of Columbia v. Heller, and the Affordable Care Act, were all  decided by 5-to-4 votes.   I will, therefore, oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  Court and support the filibuster, and I urge my colleagues to do so, as  well. If Judge Gorsuch cannot muster 60 votes, the problem is not with  the process, it is with the nominee. If Judge Gorsuch cannot get to the  60 votes historically required for confirmation to the Nation's highest  Court, I urge President Trump to withdraw his nomination and  [[Page S2314]]  consult with a wide range of Senators--legal scholars and others who  past Presidents have sought out before making a Supreme Court  nomination--and put before us someone in the mold of Merrick Garland,  who can enjoy bipartisan support and be within the broad mainstream of  American jurisprudential history.   Otherwise, the consequences of forcing Judge Gorsuch's nomination  through will fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his  Republican allies in the Senate, if they decide to exercise the nuclear  option, forever changing the history of the United States Senate.   I urge a ``no'' vote on Judge Gorsuch.   I yield back to the Chair.    Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of the  passing of my dear friend David Culp in early February. As one of the  leaders of the arms control community for decades, David was an  indefatigable advocate for reducing the threat of catastrophic nuclear  war and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular,  David's work was critical for Senate ratification of the New START  Treaty, which established limits on the number of deployed strategic  nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia.   More recently, David worked closely with my staff on a number of arms  control initiatives, including my efforts to scale back the Pentagon's  trillion-dollar nuclear spending spree, restrain excessive and  destabilizing missile defense systems, and cancel a new nuclear-armed  cruise ``missile that would make Americans less safe.   I will miss David's wisdom, humor, and strategic insight, but I am  comforted to know that his legacy lives on in the robust and committed  arms control community he helped lead. I will continue to be inspired  by David's memory, and I offer my deepest condolences to his friends  and his family.                            ____________________
