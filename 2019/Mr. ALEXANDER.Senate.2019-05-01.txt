 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on  Energy and Water Development be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                Nuclear Regulatory Commission Budget Request          We run a real risk of losing our best source       of carbon-free power just at a time when most Americans are       increasingly worried about climate change. Nuclear power must       be part of our energy future if we want clean, cheap, and       reliable energy that can create good jobs and keep America       competitive in a global economy.        Today 98 nuclear reactors provide about 20 percent of       electricity in the United States, and 60 percent of all       carbon-free electricity in the United States. But nuclear       plants are closing because they cost too much to build and       cannot compete with natural gas. Two reactors have announced       they will retire later this year, and ten more have announced       retirements by 2025.        Let's do a little math here. If we closed those 12       reactors, that would mean a 17 percent decline in carbon-free       nuclear power by 2025, which is 10 percent of carbon-free       electricity. Today, solar power--despite impressive       reductions in cost--provides 4 percent and wind provides 20       percent of carbon-free electricity despite billions of       dollars in subsidies. To replace those 12 reactors that have       announced they will close with other carbon-free electricity,       we would have to almost triple the entirety of U.S. solar       power or increase wind power by another 50 percent. If half       of our existing nuclear reactors were to close, we would have       to double the amount of wind energy produced and or increase       the amount of solar energy produced by as much as 10 times.        Nuclear power is much more reliable than solar or wind       power. It is available when the sun doesn't shine and the       wind doesn't blow. The bottom line is, we can't replace       nuclear power with just wind and solar. We would have to use       natural gas to replace nuclear power, which would increase       emissions in our country.        Unfortunately, we do not need to speculate about what       happens when a major industrialized country eliminates       nuclear power. We have seen what happened in Japan and       Germany for different reasons. Major industrialized economies       similar to ours lost their emission-free, low-cost, reliable       electricity. Prices went up, pollution went up, and       manufacturing became less competitive in the global       marketplace. And that is where we are headed in the next 10       years if we do not do something. Stakes are high.        In Japan, the cost of generating electricity increased 56       percent after the Fukushima accident in 2011 when Japan went       from obtaining 30 percent of its power from nuclear to less       than 2 percent.        Before 2011, Germany obtained one quarter of its       electricity from nuclear. Now that number is down to 12       percent. Now Germany has among the highest household       electricity rates in the European Union after replacing       nuclear power with wind and solar as part of an expensive       cap-and-trade policy. Germany also had to build new coal       plants to meet demand, which increased emissions.        In late March, I proposed that the United States should       launch a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, a five-year       project with Ten Grand Challenges that will use American       research and technology to put our country and the world       firmly on a path toward cleaner, cheaper energy.        These Grand Challenges call for breakthroughs in advanced       nuclear reactors, natural gas, carbon capture, better       batteries, greener buildings, electric vehicles, cheaper       solar, and fusion.        I put advanced reactors first on the list for a reason. To       make sure nuclear power has a future in this country, we need       to develop advanced reactors that have the potential to be       smaller, cost less, produce less waste, and be safer than       today's reactors.        We need to stop talking about advanced reactors and       actually build something. Within the next five years, we need       to build one or more advanced reactors to demonstrate the       capabilities they may bring.        As we review the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fiscal       year 2020 budget request we need to make sure the Commission       has the staff and resources it needs to respond to the       changing industry.        First, I would like to thank our witnesses for being here       today, and also Senator Feinstein, with whom I have the       pleasure to work again this year to draft the Energy and       Water Appropriations bill. Our witnesses today include:       Kristine Svinicki, Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory       Commission; Commissioner Jeff Baran; Commissioner Annie       Caputo; and Commissioner David Wright.        Commissioner Stephen Burns retired yesterday after forty       years of distinguished service at the NRC. He started as an       attorney in 1978, rose to General Counsel, and then retired       from the agency to head Legal Affairs at the Nuclear Energy       Agency in Paris. He returned to the NRC in 2014 as a       Commissioner and Chairman. He was well respected in every       position he held. I would like to thank him for his many       years of service.        We're here today to review the administration's fiscal year       2020 budget request for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory       Commission, the independent federal agency responsible for       regulating the safety of our nation's 98 commercial nuclear       power plants and other civilian uses of nuclear material.        The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's budget request this       fiscal year is $921 million, which is about $10 million less       than Congress provided last year. The request includes $38.5       million for the Yucca Mountain licensing process.        It has become increasingly difficult for the nuclear       industry to compete with other sources of electricity,       especially natural gas. One of the concerns the industry had       was the amount of regulatory fees charged by the Commission--      currently, $760 million of the Commission's budget comes from       fees paid by utilities and other facilities that are       licensed to possess and use nuclear materials.        So over the last five fiscal years, we have worked with the       Commission to reduce its overall budget by about $100       million, which represents about a 10 percent reduction in       budget--which means a roughly 10 percent reduction in fees--      and more closely reflects its actual workload while       maintaining its gold standard of safety.        These savings are important because they lower the fees       utilities must pay the Commission, and these savings can be       passed on to utilities' customers. These reductions have not       been arbitrary and represent the type of oversight the Senate       is supposed to do. Our subcommittee has only reduced the       Commission's budget in areas that the Commission has       identified as unnecessary to its important safety mission.        To ensure nuclear power will continue to play a significant       role in our nation's electricity generation, I'd like to       focus my remarks on four main areas:        (1) Licensing small modular and advanced reactors;        (2) Solving the nuclear waste stalemate;        (3) Safely extending licenses for existing reactors; and        (4) Maintaining adequate staffing at the Nuclear Regulatory       Commission.        Advanced reactors and small modular reactors represent the       future of nuclear power. The Commission needs to be ready to       review applications for new these new reactors. In fiscal       year 2017, we provided enough funding to complete the Small       Modular Reactor Licensing Technical Support program at the       Department of Energy. NuScale, which was one of the       technologies selected in that program, filed an application       for design certification of a small modular reactor with the       Commission in December of 2016. A utility group has been       working with NuScale and Idaho National Laboratory to build       and demonstrate a small modular reactor in Idaho. TVA also       has an application under review for a permit to build and       demonstrate a small modular reactor at the Clinch River site       in Tennessee.        Licenses to build and demonstrate small modular reactors is       an important step, and we need to make sure the Commission       has the resources it needs to review the applications. I also       understand that the Commission expects to receive an       application in fiscal year 2020 for a construction and       operating license for an advanced, non-light water reactor.        The fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill included $10       million for the Commission to prepare to review advanced       reactor designs, and the current budget request includes       $15.5 million for fiscal year 2020. I'd like to know what the       Commission plans to do with the funding Congress provided for       advanced reactors so that we can make sure the development of       advanced reactors stays on track.        To ensure that nuclear power has a strong future in this       country, we must solve the  [[Page S2565]]       decades' long stalemate over what to do with used fuel from       our nuclear reactors. Senator Feinstein and I have been       working on solving the nuclear waste stalemate for years, and       I'd like to take the opportunity to compliment Senator       Feinstein on her leadership and her insistence that we       find a solution to this problem. The only way to break the       stalemate is to get a final decision on whether Yucca       Mountain is safe or not.        And this year's budget request for the Nuclear Regulatory       Commission includes $38.5 million to begin to answer that       questions by restarting the licensing process for the Yucca       Mountain repository. This is the next step the Department of       Energy must follow to determine whether it can begin       construction of Yucca Mountain. After a public hearing where       all parties, including the State of Nevada, can provide       expert testimony and evidence, the Commission will make a       final determination whether it is safe to build Yucca       Mountain.        I strongly believe that Yucca Mountain can and should be       part of the solution to the nuclear waste stalemate. Federal       law designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for       used nuclear fuel, and the Commission's own scientists have       told us that we can safely store nuclear waste there for up       to one million years.        But even if we had Yucca Mountain open today, we would       still need to look for another permanent repository. We       already have more than enough used fuel to fill Yucca       Mountain to its legal capacity.        The quickest, and probably the least expensive, way for the       federal government to start to meet its used nuclear fuel       obligations is for the Department of Energy to contract with       a private storage facility for used nuclear fuel.        I understand that two private companies have submitted       license applications to the NRC for private consolidated       storage facilities, one in Texas and one in New Mexico, and       that the NRC's review is well underway. I'll be asking some       questions about that today. I want to make sure that the       Commission has all the resources it needs in fiscal year 2020       to review the applications for consolidated storage       facilities because we have to start working together to solve       the nuclear waste stalemate if we want a strong nuclear       industry.        Senator Murkowski, along with Senator Feinstein and I,       introduced a bill this week to implement the recommendations       of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future,       which include using temporary private storage facilities. The       legislation complements Yucca Mountain, and would create a       new federal agency to find additional permanent repositories       and temporary facilities for used nuclear fuel.        Instead of building more windmills, which only produce 20       percent of our carbon-free electricity, or solar farms, which       only produce 4 percent of our carbon-free electricity, the       best way to make sure the United States has a reliable source       of inexpensive, efficient, carbon-free electricity is to       extend the licenses of our existing nuclear plants--which       produce 60 percent of our carbon-free electricity--if it is       safe to do so.        Most of our 98 reactors have already extended their       operating licenses from 40 to 60 years (although many have       decided to close prematurely for economic reasons), and some       utilities are beginning the process to extend their licenses       from 60 to 80 years.        The Commission has spent the past several years developing       the framework to review these types of license renewal       applications to make sure the reactors can continue to       operate safely from 60 to 80 years.        This year's budget request includes funding to review what       the Commission calls ``subsequent'' license renewal       applications for six reactors in Florida, Pennsylvania, and       Virginia. Just those 6 reactor extensions would equal about       what solar power currently produces and a fourth of what wind       power currently produces. That is just accounting for the 6       reactors that have applied to extend their licenses rather       than shut down. If even half of the remaining 92 reactors       decide to extend their licenses another 20 years, it would       produce almost double the amount of wind power that is       currently produced and as much as 10 times the amount of       solar power produced.        So if you care about carbon free emissions, the short term       solution for the next 20 years is, where safely, to extend       the licenses for these reactors. I want to make sure that the       Commission has the resources it needs to review those       applications in fiscal year 2020, because I think it is       important to maintain our existing nuclear power when it is       safe to do so.        The Commission's budget reduction has been steep over the       past five fiscal years. As part of its effort to reduce its       budget, the Commission has limited hiring, especially entry-      level hiring. We have heard from the Commission that of its       2,900 current employees, 24 percent are currently eligible       for retirement. Four years from now, 42 percent will be       eligible for retirement. Those numbers are not a concern as       long as the NRC has younger staff ready to take over the       important work of the agency. But I understand that only 2       percent of NRC employees are under 30 years old. To have       nuclear power in the future, we need to have a nuclear       regulator. I would like to understand how the Commission is       ensuring that the next generation is in place.        I look forward to working with the Commission as we begin       putting together our Energy and Water Appropriations bill for       fiscal year 2020, and also with Senator Feinstein, who I will       now recognize for her opening statement.                            ____________________
