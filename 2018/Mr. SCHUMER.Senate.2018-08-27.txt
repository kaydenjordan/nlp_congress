 Madam President, on Saturday, August 25, 2018, 9 years  to the day since the death of his friend Senator Kennedy, our friend  and colleague Senator John S. McCain passed away. Knowing his prognosis  prepared us for the inevitable, but it has not softened the blow. We  all feel a great and inexpressible loss. I know I do. I also feel lucky  that I was able to call this great man a friend.   Today, I wish to share a few reflections, unorganized and incomplete  though they may be. I suspect I will have more to say about Senator  McCain with the benefit of a few days' time.   Senator McCain and I didn't get along very well at first. He was  close to my mentor in the Senate, Ted Kennedy, but not so with me. I  never served with Senator McCain on any committee, where we get to know  other Senators up close.   Before our friendship, my closest brush with him was over a comment  he made during a debate on defense policy when he said that Long Island  was ``regrettably part of the United States.'' I blasted John's  pejorative, which, of course, prompted him to reply from the Senate  floor:         I'm sorry there's at least one of my colleagues that can't       take a joke. I apologize if I offended him and hope that       someday he will have a sense of humor.    Like many, I was a victim of Senator McCain's acerbic wit.   Things began to defrost when we worked together during the Gang of 14  to avoid a change in the Senate rules during the Bush administration,  and a real tight and lasting friendship emerged from our collaboration  on immigration reform.   We worked in close quarters for nearly a year--hour after hour, day  after day, week after week--fine-tuning the only piece of major  immigration reform to pass this Chamber in decades. We visited the  southern border together to assess the gaps in our security up close.  We were doing what the Senate was supposed to do--grappling with the  biggest challenges, working in a bipartisan way to find solutions,  overcoming obstacles that have so long bedeviled immigration reform and  continue to stymie progress today. We couldn't have done it without  John McCain.    In recent days, many have reflected on his Presidential campaigns and  his military service, and rightly so. He was also a natural legislator,  able to seek common ground and having a sense of where to go. He knew  when to give a little, and he knew when not to. He had deep principles,  but he also knew how to craft a product that could actually pass, and  the bill did, in the Senate, with large numbers of supporters from both  parties. Had we passed immigration reform then, had the House done what  the Senate did under John's leadership, we wouldn't be quarreling about  immigration now, and our country would be a better, stronger, and more  unified place.   We became so close over that year that John McCain started treating  my staff like they were his own, and me the same. We spoke so  frequently that I knew John McCain's cell number by heart, and I  mistakenly repeated it during an interview when a reporter asked me how  close we were. They had to edit it out to protect John's privacy.   I can truly say that the times we spent authorizing and passing  immigration reform were some of the proudest days in politics for me  and the rest of the Gang of 8, in no small part because the success was  shared with one great legislative leader, John McCain. He was so many  things to so many people, a fierce friend to those who were lucky  enough to have earned his friendship--you had to earn his friendship-- and a real thorn in the side of those who earned his scorn. Many know  that.   He was an unofficial ambassador for the United States, a comfort to  our allies, and an unabashed champion for Western values. He was  unafraid to take on Presidents. He was unafraid to take on his own  party. He was equally parts funny and furious, foulmouthed and  statesmanlike. He could put the ``temper'' in temperament. He was a  brave and honest man. He was a patriot. He was all those things  throughout his life, usually more than one at once, until his very last  days.   Remarking on the character of America, Senator McCain said we live in  a ``big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring,  brave, good and magnificent country.'' Truer words could not be said  about the man himself--big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate,  restless, striving, daring, brave, good, and magnificent.   As you go through life, you meet a few truly great people. John  McCain was one of them. His dedication to his country and to the men  and women who serve and protect it was unsurpassed. Even in his last  weeks, he was calling me every few days to make sure our Defense  authorization bill was done and done right--not for him, not for his  glory but because he cared about men and women who serve in our Armed  Forces so deeply. His life is a story of American heroism personified,  but maybe, most of all, he was a truth teller.   Perhaps it is a reflection of our politics that a man can be so well  regarded for simply telling the truth as he saw it, or, maybe,  recognizing the demands and failings of our politics, it is more of a  reflection on the man that four decades of public life could not warp  or dim his fidelity to the unvarnished truth.   I will miss him dearly. In the past year of his illness, during  moments of doubt about the direction of our country, I found myself  thinking about what John McCain would do or what he would say if he  were here.   Truth be told, there is nothing I could say that could possibly add  or detract from Senator McCain's illustrious career. There is nothing  any of us have done that compares to the sacrifice he made in a  cellblock half a world away and half a lifetime ago--a sacrifice he  made over and over for the country he loved and the principles he  advanced.   So that generations will study his example, I have proposed we rename  the Russell Senate Office Building, one of only three Senate office  buildings, after John McCain. It would be a fitting tribute to a man  who considered his service in the Senate--headquartered in the Russell  Building, where his beloved Armed Services Committee also resides--the  most significant in his distinguished career. The man whose name he  would replace, Senator Richard Russell, a towering figure in the Senate  of his day, was nonetheless an avowed opponent of civil rights and the  architect of the Southern filibuster that long delayed its passage.   It is time that we recognize that as times change, so do our heroes.  I will be introducing a resolution with Senator Flake to change the  name of the Russell Building to the McCain Building. I hope my  colleagues will cosponsor and support the resolution. It need not be  the only way we honor Senator McCain. We can honor him by trying to  carry out the principles he lived by. We can try, as he did, to put  country before party. We can try, as he always did, to speak truth to  power. We can try, as he summoned us to try, to restore the Senate to  its rightful place in our national political life.   Up until the very end, John McCain still believed the Senate was  capable of solving our country's greatest challenges. He believed that  our arcane rules and procedures, designed to frustrate one-party rule,  were an antidote to the organization of our politics. At the very  least, he believed in the Senate's ability to make progress, to set  [[Page S5944]]  aside, for a moment, our party affiliations, political interests, and  personal ambitions in the service of a larger cause, because that is  what he did. For all his cynicism, he still believed the Senate could  reach that higher calling.   Deep in the middle of his final speech on the Senate floor were these  words: ``I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to  cooperate, on our dependence on each other, learn how to trust each  other again, and by doing so, better serve the people who elected us.''   If we are to truly honor the life and the service of John McCain, let  us do that. Let us do that.   John McCain put out a few final words. Today I think some of his  staffers put them out. I would like to read just two paragraphs of that  and then ask unanimous consent that they be put in the Record:         I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on       earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of       my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had       experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten       satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I       have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good       times or bad times, for the best of anyone else's.    Finally, he concluded with this:         Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe       always in the promise and greatness of America, because       nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never       surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.        Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless       America.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for       sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans,        Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the       rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office       has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country       honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for       America will be weighed favorably against them.        I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on       earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of       my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had       experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten       satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I       have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good       or bad times, for the best day of anyone else's.        I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man       ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of       than I am of mine. And I owe it to America.        To be connected to America's causes--liberty, equal       justice, respect for the dignity of all people--brings       happiness more sublime than life's fleeting pleasures. Our       identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but       enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.        `Fellow Americans'--that association has meant more to me       than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are       citizens of the world's greatest republic, a nation of       ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing       to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home       and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from       tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have       acquired great wealth and power in the process.        We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with       tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and       violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when       we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we       doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be       the great force for change they have always been.        We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated,       vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes       even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we       have always had so much more in common with each other than       in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other       the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country       we will get through these challenging times. We will come       through them stronger than before. We always do.        Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the       election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with       the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully       that evening.        I feel it powerfully still.        Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe       always in the promise and greatness of America, because       nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never       surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.        Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless       America.     I yield the floor.                            ____________________
