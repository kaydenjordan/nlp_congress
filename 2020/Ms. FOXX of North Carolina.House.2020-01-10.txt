 Mr. Speaker, since 2002, January has been  recognized as National Mentoring Month. We all should recognize the  positive impacts that mentoring has on young people.   From our servicemembers stationed at Cherry Point to the volunteers  of the Greensboro United Way, the students and staff of Wake Forest  University to the Journeymen of Asheville, North Carolinians remain  actively engaged in mentoring opportunities across my State.   According to mentoring.org, at-risk youth who were paired with a  mentor are 55 percent more likely to enroll in college, 78 percent more  likely to volunteer regularly in their communities, and 130 percent  more likely to hold leadership positions in their careers.   Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. Mentoring is a  cornerstone of the growth and development of young people across our  country. I commend the individuals involved in being mentors.                            ____________________
