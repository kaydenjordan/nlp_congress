 Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to bring American troops home  from Afghanistan, it is important to recognize those who weren't able  to make it home.   With that in mind, I rise to honor our Nation's Gold Star families,  mothers, fathers, husband, wives, siblings, and children with a loved  one who died in service to our country.   I have deep gratitude for the families who have suffered such a  painful loss, families like that of Captain Joseph Schultz, who was  killed in action in Afghanistan in 2011. Captain Schultz's mother,  Betsy, channeled her grief over losing her only child into action,  forming a nonprofit respite home for other Gold Star families, the  Captain Joseph House in Port Angeles, Washington.   The Captain Joseph House, and organizations like it, provide a  network of support and comfort for the surviving family members. Their  work matters, and we should be grateful for it.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my gratitude to all who have lost a loved one in  service to our country.                            ____________________
