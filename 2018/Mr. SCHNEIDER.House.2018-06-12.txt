 Mr. Speaker, every day, day in and day out, more than  115 Americans die from overdosing on opioids. We are in the midst of a  devastating national epidemic that does not discriminate by geography,  age, income, education, or race.   I have heard from families who have lost loved ones to this epidemic.  I have talked to the first responders who are on the front lines. I  have talked to the doctors who treat the patients and the victims of  this disease. I have talked to community leaders about the impact this  epidemic is having in their communities, in our States, and across our  Nation.   So today, I rise encouraged that this House, this week, is finally  poised to take action to address the addiction and abuse hurting so  many of our communities. This week, we will vote on several bills that,  among other things, seek to provide communities with needed resources  to fight the epidemic, crack down on dangerous synthetics coming into  our Nation, and improve care available to our veterans.   Among these, I am pleased that the House is voting on two specific  measures I have cosponsored.   The Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act would create centers  pairing treatment and recovery services together with community  engagement.   The Preventing Overdoses While in Emergency Rooms, or the POWER Act,  would increase the coordinated care options available for patients who  have survived an overdose. These people, in particular, need more than  just naloxone. They need extended treatment and support to overcome  their addiction.   This epidemic is a crisis. We, as a country, as a body, need to act.  I urge my colleagues to support these measures as we work to turn the  tide, and I hope that we can continue to build on the bipartisan  progress we are making in the days ahead.                            ____________________
