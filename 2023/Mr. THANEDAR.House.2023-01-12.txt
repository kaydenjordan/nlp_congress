 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to stand in this well and  represent the people of Michigan's 13th Congressional District.   Last week, for the first time in 100 years, the House failed to  organize on opening day. As a new Member of Congress, I found it to be  a sad day for this body as an institution, a sad day for democracy, and  a sad day for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are united and prepared to try to find  common ground with the other side of the aisle to solve problems on  behalf of the American people, but I am not sure if I will find a  willing partner across the aisle because of extreme viewpoints.   The start of the 118th Congress has, in its short time of existence,  seen some sad days. These sad days must stop now. Let's get to work.                            ____________________
