 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 734.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 734, the Protection of  Women and Girls in Sports Act.   The Democrats have gone to great lengths to call this bill extreme.  The Democrats have gone to great lengths, being almost hysterical, to  call this bill discriminatory. It is neither of those things.   It is a one-page bill, which is rare in Congress, that strengthens  existing protections for women, ensures a level playing field for  female athletes, and protects women and girls from the Biden  administration's radical regulatory scheme.   It is quite telling when the other party attempts to tear things down  without offering an alternative vision. Democrats refuse to posit a  reason for allowing biological men to compete in women's sports that  comports with principles of athletic competition like fairness and  integrity.   Democrats also refuse to address the implications of their position.  If men can compete in women's sports, should they be able to take  roster spots from women, to rob women of hard-earned achievements?   Instead, they appeal to emotion and call the other side bigots. It is  such a tiring act, Mr. Chair.   How about providing evidence that self-identification is rooted in  biological truth? Explain that a post-adolescent male athlete has zero  physical advantages over women.   Democrats like to pretend they are the party of science. Where is the  data?   The Democrat vote against this bill, including Biden's threat to veto  it, is a vote against continuing to give women and girls equal  opportunity to participate and compete in athletics.   We on the Republican side are grounded. We live in reality. So does  the rest of America. Ask working-class Americans if Muhammad Ali should  have been allowed to box women in his heyday or if Usain Bolt should  have run the women's 100 meters.   It is not about callousness or lack of emotion. This is about  grounding a leftist ideology that has lost its collective mind back in  reality. In fact, Republicans are teeming with admiration and support  for the women and girls who have come so far to get much-deserved  recognition for their athletic achievements.   The left wants to talk about erasure. Let's talk about how American  female athletes are being erased. We are not sensationalizing this  problem. It exists. Females are being hurt by it, and action must be  taken to stop that.   Mr. Chair, I hope this debate and the eventual passage of H.R. 734  help bring sanity to women's sports, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Steube), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens), chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and  Workforce Development.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean), chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood,  Elementary, and Secondary Education.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller), vice chair of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Moran), a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Williams), a member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain), a member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce and secretary of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), chairman of the Health, Employment, Labor, and  Pensions Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), a true hero here in the House of Representatives.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to briefly discuss the proposed regulation the  Department of Education recently issued on this topic.   Frankly, either you believe women's access to athletic opportunity  should be protected or you don't. Either you believe fairness and  safety in women's athletics should be protected or you don't.   The Department of Education clearly doesn't believe in those things.  If it did, it wouldn't have proposed a rule that will upend the laws 20  States have on the books protecting women's sports.   More shockingly, the Department's rule provides no meaningful  guidelines as to what will be an acceptable level of protection for  female athletes. That decision will apparently be made on a case-by- case basis by Secretary of Education Cardona.   Democrats apparently believe one man should get to decide whether or  not women athletes are guaranteed equal access, fairness, and safety.  Once upon a time, Democrats would have recognized the cruel irony of  that. Unfortunately, that day is long gone.   Fortunately, Republicans haven't lost sight of our obligation, and  that is why we will pass this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am ready  to close whenever the gentleman from California is ready to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I have spoken to the absurdity of this debate, but let me  conclude by clarifying what this bill does and does not do by reading  two paragraphs of this bill--it is one page long.   ``Section 901 of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) is  amended by adding at the end the following:   ``(d)(1) It shall be a violation of subsection (a) for a recipient of  Federal funds who operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs  or activities to permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an  athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.   ``(2) For the purposes of this subsection, sex shall be recognized  based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at  birth.''   All of these ridiculous things that we have been accused of are not  in this bill. This bill does not discriminate against anyone. It does  not exhibit any hate toward anyone.   What it does is prohibit Federal funding to institutions that  ``permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic  program or activity that is designated for women or girls.''   The reason for this is simple. Men have certain physiological  advantages over women, such as more size and speed. Because of that,  allowing biological males to compete against women and girls robs  females of equal athletic opportunities and fair playing fields.   H.R. 734 restores the integrity and fairness of women's sports.   Mr. Chairman, Republicans, contrary to what our colleagues have said  and accused us of, Republicans love all God's children, male and  female, born and unborn. Do not question our commitment to fairness to  life or to treating people equally. We hate no one.   As my colleagues have pointed out, it is ridiculous that we have had  to stand here today to defend the rights of women and girls to  participate in sports against other women and girls and they not being  taken advantage of by biological males.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to do what is  best for America's women and girls and support this important bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  DesJarlais) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 734) to  amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide that for purposes of  determining compliance with title IX of such Act in athletics, sex  shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and  genetics at birth, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
