 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is quite simply a giveaway of mining  rights on roughly 5,000 acres of public lands right next to the  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota to a  Chilean mining conglomerate so that it can develop a copper mine that  will, in all likelihood, leach toxic acid waste into the Boundary  Waters for decades, if not centuries, to come. In order to do this,  this bill overrides multiple laws that are in place to allow priceless  natural places to be protected and it vetoes the scientific conclusions  of the U.S. Forest Service.   Last year, the Forest Service recommended that two undeveloped 50- year-old mining leases in Minnesota's Superior National Forest be  allowed to expire, stating that the development of a copper mine on  these leases could lead to potentially extreme contamination of the  Boundary Waters wilderness from acid mine drainage and leached  materials.   The Boundary Waters isn't just a pristine and unique wilderness, it  is also an economic engine for northern Minnesota. Over 1,000 pristine  lakes, 1,200 miles of streams, and 2,000 campsites attract more than  150,000 visitors each year to canoe, kayak, fish, bird watch, ski, and  simply explore and enjoy the natural beauty and peacefulness that is  unlike anywhere else in the United States. These visitors bring in tens  of millions of dollars annually, supporting thousands of local jobs.                                time  1530    The ecological and economic value of the Boundary Waters led the  Forest Service to conclude: `` . . . development of a regionally  untested copper-nickel sulfide-ore mine within the same watershed as  the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness might cause serious and  irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable wilderness  area.''   As a result, the leases were not renewed, and the Forest Service  began a study to look at whether to protect the area adjacent to the  Boundary Waters from mining for the next 20 years. This 2-year study is  open. It is a public process designed to gather scientific information  and local views on the potential impacts of copper mining, which is  immediately adjacent to the Boundary Waters, and it is supported by an  overwhelming majority--79 percent--of the voters in Minnesota.   Even this administration here in Washington has said that it intends  to allow the study to run its course before making any decisions, but  this legislation would make that study meaningless. It would reinstate  the leases and make it almost impossible for them to expire. It would  block the Forest Service from acting on its study no matter what it  found and how the people in the region feel, and it would make it  impossible for the President of the United States to protect this area  using the Antiquities Act, all so a Chilean mining company can move  forward with a dangerous mine next to one of our most pristine and  special natural places.   Mr. Chairman, our public lands belong to all Americans, not simply to  wealthy mining companies with the connections and the cash to try to  overturn decisions they don't like through legislation. The company  that we are talking about is challenging this decision to not renew  their leases in court. That is the appropriate venue for that debate,  not here in the Halls of Congress. We shouldn't rewrite the law to make  sure that they get their way.   Even if the company wins the case, we should not be tying the Federal  Government's hands to make sure that this mine gets developed, no  matter what, instead of listening to the science. That is the wrong  thing to do for any project like this, let alone one that sits right  next to a unique and delicate wilderness like the Boundary Waters.   This bill is a blatant attempt to reward an individual foreign  company at the expense of the American people and the American  landscape, and I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about jobs. Jobs, this is going to  be great job creator, this mine. I just want to highlight, though, some  of the very inaccurate numbers that have been tossed around today.   The sponsor of the bill earlier today said that 10,000 jobs would be  created. The majority's legislative analysis says that the bill will  create 17,000 jobs, but that is not correct. That is not correct. Even  the company behind the project doesn't claim that many jobs.   In their May 2017 fact sheet, and this is the fact sheet for Twin  Metals of Minnesota, they report that once operational, they will  directly employ 650 people and ``will create an estimated 1,300 spinoff  jobs in other industries.'' That is 1,950 jobs. That is good, but that  is a long way and a far cry from 10,000 or 17,000 jobs.   Let's also look at the down side. An economic study of the tourism  industry in the region has shown that putting in a copper mine could  result in the loss of nearly 5,000 direct jobs and up to 22,000  indirect jobs.   That is a terrible tradeoff, and that means that this mine is  potentially a net job destroyer, not a creator.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect jobs and to oppose H.R.  3905.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make sure that my friends on the other  side are aware of a simple fact, and that fact is very important in  this debate: water flows downhill.   They make a big deal about the fact that no mining would take place  in the Boundary Waters, but how happy would you be if someone dumped  millions of gallons of toxic waste just uphill from your home and said  not to worry because they didn't dump anything in your house?   These leases that we are talking about are right on the border of the  Boundary Waters wilderness area. Take a look at this map. These red  parts are the leases we are talking about. There is no gap. There is no  buffer. Any acid mine waste from these leases will flow right into the  Boundary Waters. There is no protection in this bill for the Boundary  Waters. There is only terrible risk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the overwhelming local  opposition to a copper-sulfide mine right next to the Boundary Waters.   A poll done earlier this year found that 59 percent of Minnesotans  oppose copper-sulfide mining near the Boundary Waters. Seventy-nine  percent support the existing 2-year study that the Forest Service is  doing on this type of mining. Included in that 79 percent, 67 percent  of Republicans support the existing 2-year study that the Forest  Service is doing. We are not talking about a bunch of antimining  activists. This is not them.   The same poll found that, overall, Minnesotans support copper-sulfide  mining in the State 43 percent to 33 percent. The people in the State  of Minnesota know that there are right places to have these kinds of  mines and there are wrong places to have these kinds of mines. The  Boundary Waters are the wrong place. The people of Minnesota know it,  the Forest Service knows it, and I hope that the Congress realizes it  and knows it, too.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I would like the chairman to answer a question. That pit  that the gentleman just showed us, is that a taconite pit or is that a  sulfide pit in Minnesota?    I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    We are not talking about taconite. We are talking  about sulfide.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to talk  about that because of what type of mine this is. As has been pointed  out, northern Minnesota has had a long history of mining, but the mine  that we are talking about here is not like any other mine in the State.  This is a copper-sulfide mine. These types of mines are notorious for  generating acid mine drainage.   As the Forest Service puts it: These mines are known worldwide for  producing acid mine drainage that requires continuous management and  perpetual water treatment.   Even in the absence of a major spill, having this acidic waste  chronically leaking into the environment will create a problem that  will last for generations and may never be fixed.   A study of 14 similar copper mines found that all but one had  significant water quality impacts due to failures of the water  collection and treatment systems from keeping the contamination from  seeping out.   As was pointed out by the opposition, the majority, most of these  mines are in dry areas of the American Southwest where there is far  less water that needs to be treated than in a very wet environment like  northern Minnesota.   The Forest Service also describes the specific threat that the  Boundary Waters are under. They point out that there is ``a direct flow  of water from these leases to the Boundary Waters, and that there is a  high likelihood of acid mine drainage from these ores, and that the  drainage from the mine is likely to be highly acidic.''   Mr. Speaker, once the problem starts, it is nearly impossible to make  it stop. This is a perfect storm for destroying the Boundary Waters,  and it is not worth the risk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am here to say that there are many  mines in the State of Minnesota that I do support, that are  ecologically--that are protected, but this is a different mine. We are  only talking about one type of mine.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I think that we have made a very strong  case that economically this does not make sense. It could potentially  destroy the tourist industry. What makes Minnesota unique is the  wilderness areas, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. There is a  tremendous risk because there has never been this type of mining in  Minnesota before.   As was pointed out by the Forest Service, there is a very high risk  of  [[Page H9510]]  acidic discharge, and that the mine will drain into the Boundary  Waters. This is the wrong project at this time, and I urge a ``no''  vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
