The VA states that they are ``taking this  action because it has determined that providing access to abortion- related medical services is needed to protect the lives and health of  veterans.''   The VA expects to provide about 1,000 abortions per year at  taxpayers' expense. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 prohibits the  VA from providing abortion, and no law from Congress has ever changed  that.   So now we have two problems. The VA is providing abortions with  taxpayer dollars, and medical professionals being forced to perform  these procedures against their will.   The VA states ``employees may request an accommodation to a work  requirement based on religious belief.'' However, almost no religious  exemptions were honored for vaccinations, and 60,000 Army reservists  were separated for refusing the vaccine.   How many VA doctors will be released for refusing to perform  abortions?   Why are taxpayers being forced to pay for the VA to perform abortions  in clear violation of the 1992 law?                            ____________________
