 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time, for the recognition.   Let me just say, I want to thank members of the Health Subcommittee,  both sides of the dais, who have worked hard on this legislation, and  it is unfortunate that it was not brought to the floor of the House in  the month of September.  [[Page H8458]]    From a subcommittee perspective, we were ready. We had our  legislative hearings in June. We were delayed one time when the whole  House recessed after the shooting of the Members at the baseball  practice, but we rescheduled for 2 weeks later, and we had a successful  hearing. We had a good hearing; a lot of facts were laid out. We came  up with commonsense legislation that was offset in a responsible way.  The offsets are not draconian.   We have before us a bill today that will, in fact, fund some of the  Nation's most important public health programs. It does fund the State  Children's Health Insurance for 5 years, one of the longest extensions  for this program since its inception in 1996. It will ensure that  children and families who rely on this program will continue to receive  the access they need. It also includes, in a fiscally responsible way,  to delay the harmful ObamaCare-mandated cuts to safety net hospitals,  who also provide care to underserved patients.   Now, think about that for a minute. We are accused of undermining  ObamaCare, but here is a cut that ObamaCare mandates to your safety net  hospitals across the country--not just in Texas, but across the  country--and we are replacing that today in a fiscally responsible way.   It provides funding for community health centers, an important key  part of healthcare in communities across the country. It will help the  Americans who rely on these vital health services.   Not only does the bill provide assistance for underserved  populations, but it does so without adding to the national debt. The  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called this a responsible  health package, noting that the $18 billion cost is fully offset, with  savings beyond the 10-year budget window.   Other groups have also been supportive: Texas Hospital Association,  Texas Health Resources--for me back home--Children's Hospital, and a  number of healthcare organizations.   We have data from MACPAC, whose job it is to advise Congress on  Medicaid and CHIP policy; and MACPAC has advised us that, under current  law, there are no new Federal funds for State Children's Health  Insurance for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Unless Congress acts to  renew funding, all States will experience a shortfall in CHIP funds for  2018, which means, if someone is contemplating a ``no'' vote on this  bill, if you are contemplating a ``no'' vote, you do need to be aware  that if you live in the States of Arizona and Minnesota, you ran out of  money in October of 2017; North Carolina, same situation. Oregon runs  out next month. Vermont runs out next month. You need to think about  your ``no'' vote before you apply it.    Every single U.S. territory, with the exception of Puerto Rico, ran  out of money in the month of October.   So those are a few facts that people do need to bear in mind, if they  vote ``no'' on this bill, what the actual implications of that are.   Yesterday, during debate on the rule, I heard a lot of discussion  about taking money out of the Prevention Fund. It doesn't take money  out of the Prevention Fund, but it does provide discretion for some  prevention and public health dollars. It takes it away from the  executive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health  programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, like  community health centers.   So we are fulfilling our Article I responsibility. We shouldn't just  be giving everything to the administration to decide how to spend  money, whether it be a Democratic or Republican administration. This is  the right thing to do.   I am proud of the work done by our subcommittee. I think our  subcommittee staff has performed admirably on both sides of the dais.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill. It is time to act, as  our chairman has said.                                time  0930
