 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Great Lakes  Task Force, I rise today to urge the swift appointment of a permanent  administrator to lead the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation.   The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation is the  Federal entity responsible for operating and maintaining the U.S.  portions of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence  [[Page H4185]]  Seaway. This 370-mile-long commercial channel runs from the Great  Lakes, America's fourth seacoast, to the Atlantic Ocean, and then  connects our ports with markets around the world.   With 40 million tons of industrial and agricultural cargo traversing  the seaway each year, it is time to appoint an administrator, and  especially in a time of war. We could be backfilling cargoes to Europe  right now.   It is time to fill this vital position, and I look forward to a  nominee who understands the needs of our region and is ready to partner  with the communities, workers, and businesses of America's industrial  and agricultural heartland.                            ____________________
