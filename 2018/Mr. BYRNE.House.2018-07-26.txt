 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1027 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1027         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider the conference report to accompany the       bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year       2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense,       for military construction, and for defense activities of the       Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel       strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. All       points of order against the conference report and against its       consideration are waived. The conference report shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the conference report to its adoption without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2)       one motion to recommit if applicable.        Sec. 2.  The Committee on Appropriations may, at any time       before 3 p.m. on Thursday, August 2, 2018, file privileged       reports to accompany measures making appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 1020 is laid on the table.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1027 provides for consideration of the  conference report to accompany H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.   This NDAA process has once again been a textbook example of how  Congress should work. After extensive hearings in the House and the  Senate, lengthy committee markups, hundreds of amendments, separate  passage in both Chambers, and a conference committee, we have reached  the point of final passage.   This has been a process that has followed regular order and allowed  so many Members to have a role in the process. Here in the House, that  is a testament to Chairman Mac Thornberry, Ranking Member Adam Smith,  and their very capable staffs.   This is the earliest the House has passed the final version of the  NDAA in 41 years, which is a remarkable feat. A considerable amount of  time and effort has been put into this product, and I know I join other  Members of the House in expressing our deep gratitude for their  efforts.   This year's NDAA offers the next steps in our effort to rebuild our  military and reform the Pentagon. I know many of us have been deeply  troubled by the readiness crisis that struck the military over the last  several years. This has resulted in training accidents and failures  that took the lives of our servicemembers.   To reverse that trend, this year's NDAA allows for increased funding  for training, as well as $2.8 billion for the procurement of spare  airplane parts.   In response to recent naval incidents in the Pacific, the NDAA  directs the Navy to review their operational chain of command and  current training plans for surface warfare officers. The strategy of  peace through strength requires us to continue to produce and procure  the best tools and resources possible.   In an effort to build toward President Trump's goal of a 355-ship  Navy fleet, the NDAA authorizes the construction of new ships,  including a Ford-class aircraft carrier, additional Virginia-class  attack submarines, and three littoral combat ships.   Given the range of challenges in the nuclear domain, the NDAA  supports the Nuclear Posture Review's recommendation to pursue a lower- yield ballistic warhead while also making important investments in our  missile defense programs.   Very important, the NDAA authorizes a 2.6 percent pay raise for our  servicemembers, which is the highest increase in 9 years. This is  critical to recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest.   Additionally, this NDAA focuses on policies specific to Russia,  China, North Korea, and Iran, as well as provisions relating to  nonstate actors and terrorist organizations.   I am also pleased that the conference report contains a compromise  final version of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act.  Congress has come together in a strong bipartisan manner to recognize  the growing threat of countries like China in weaponizing financial  investment, threatening our advanced technologies, and undermining our  defense industrial base.   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as  CFIUS, is an interagency body led by the Treasury Department tasked  with reviewing foreign investment for national security concerns.  However, United States law governing CFIUS has not been modernized for  more than a decade, and it is not designed to address today's modern,  evolving threats.   The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act gives CFIUS  much-needed additional authority to address real national security  threats without unduly burdening foreign investment in the American  economy and slowing American economic growth in the process.   I could go on and on about the important reforms and priorities in  this legislation, but these should give you an idea of our focus on  standing up to our adversaries and supporting our servicemen and - women.   Mr. Speaker, just this past weekend, I was able to spend time with  some of these fine servicemen and -women in the Pacific, where they are  taking part in the RIMPAC naval exercise, the largest in the world.   It is amazing to see the work these young men and women, some of them  very young, do on a daily basis. Whether it is landing planes on an  aircraft carrier or steering a massive warship, these individuals are  asked to carry out incredibly complicated and dangerous tasks, and they  do it exceedingly well.   It is the least we can do to show these courageous and patriotic  Americans we have their backs by passing this NDAA on a strong  bipartisan basis.   We deal with a lot of complicated and, frankly, divisive issues in  this body, but, today, on this issue, I hope we can show, for our  national security and the people who devote so much to keep us safe, we  can rise above the divisiveness of today's politics.   Let's pass the NDAA for the 58th straight year and make sure all our  servicemen and -women know we have their backs. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting House Resolution 1027 and the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman.   I would remind the gentleman that this so-called closed Congress has  passed over 600 bills. Record numbers of bills have been passed by this  Congress. This is a remarkably productive Congress, and all of us  should take pride in the fact that over 80 percent of those bills were  passed in a bipartisan fashion. So we have every reason to be proud of  the work that we have done here not just this year, but last year as  well.   I also want to address what the gentleman had to say about an AUMF.  We, indeed, as a Congress have a role to play in the foreign defense  policy of this country. The bill that underlies this resolution that we  have today is the National Defense Authorization Act. It is several  hundred pages of policy that is set by the Congress. So we are  participating in a very active fashion, both in oversight and in  helping set this policy.   I am very proud of the work that the members, Democrats and  Republicans, in the House Armed Services Committee have done. This bill  shows that Congress has a constitutional role that we are fulfilling.  And I believe the very strong, bipartisan vote we are going to see on  the bill demonstrates that all of us, or at least most of us, the vast  majority of us, feel the same way.   I want to say this very clearly. The young men and women who serve us  every day abroad and put their lives at risk deserve from us not  partisan divisiveness on this day, they deserve our unity. They deserve  to hear from us that we are not going to sit and have some partisan  bickering but that we have their back. If we can't do that on this day,  then we need to all go home this August and reexamine our consciences.   There are other days and other times to debate other issues, but on  this day, let's stand up as one House and as one country for the men  and women who wear the uniform of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a vote against the previous question is a vote against  this bill, which is there to defend America and support our servicemen  and -women.   Make no mistake about it: You can't change the subject. The subject  is the defense of the country. The subject is standing behind our  servicemen and -women.   Now, let's make this clear. It was under the previous administration  that Russia meddled in our elections, not under this administration. It  was under the previous administration that Russia illegally seized  Crimea. It was under the previous administration that we refused to arm  the Ukrainians, who were simply trying to defend themselves. We are now  arming them. This administration is doing that.   I remember in the Presidential election of 2012, the Republican  nominee for President said that the biggest threat to the United States  of America is Russia, and he was laughed at. They are not laughing now.   This bill provides what we need to have to pushback against Russia,  to arm the people who want to fight against Russia, and to stand with  our servicemen and -women. To try to distract from that with some  debate over a previous question on something that has nothing to do  with defending this country, I wish we wouldn't do that in this House.   But I understand we have to make some partisan points before we leave  here for August, and I a disappointed we are making those partisan  points. We have an opportunity to stand up as one body and as one  nation for our servicemen and -women.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle  that today Russia faces more sanctions than they have faced since the  end of the Cold War; more sanctions today than under the previous  administration. This Congress and this President is pushing back  against Russia. I am proud of what we are doing to push back on him,  and we may not be done with that yet. We may need to do more. I stand  ready to do more.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentlewoman that in this bill, ZTE is  prohibited from doing any business with the United States Government,  and any company that does business with the ZTE is prohibited from  doing business with the United States Government.   If we did what she suggested we do, we would have to find some way to  save a billion dollars out of mandatory spending under the Defense  Department. There is very little mandatory spending over at the Defense  Department.   Let me tell you what it is. It is the retirement. It is what we  require people to pay for their TRICARE, the people who have already  served in the armed services. We have to make them pay more money for  their healthcare.   I don't want to penalize those people who have already served our  country. I stand with them. For that reason, I think this bill is  plenty strong against ZTE. I think we have reached a good compromise  here.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the gentleman's amendments were  included in the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today we are here to talk about not only defending the  United States of America from all of our adversaries, Russia,  especially, but to stand behind the men and women in uniform. And, yes,  I do associate myself with them.                                time  1000    I am not one of them, but I am one of their supporters. And I hope  that the vast majority of us in this body will stand up with them and  be their supporters today both on the previous question on the rule and  also on the bill when it comes before the body.   If we really want to push back against Russia, we will stop the  games, and we will pass the rule, and we will pass the bill. That is  how we stand up against Russia. Having a bitter, partisan debate before  we do so only helps our enemies.   Let's stand together on this issue. We will come back after the break  in August and debate the other issues, but let's send a clear message  to those brave young men and women, that we have their back. We can do  that by doing our duty today.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  1027 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 1027 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6494) to expose and deter unlawful and subversive foreign       interference in elections for Federal office, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6494.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . .  When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools  [[Page H7699]]       for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and       allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer       an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
