 Mr. Speaker, with access to millions of Americans'  personal information, the IRS is one of the most powerful agencies in  Washington. Unsurprisingly, the agency has failed to secure that  information from abuse. That is why I was pleased to see the Treasury  Department announce it will no longer require certain tax-exempt  organizations to file personally identifiable information about their  donors as part of their annual returns.   While the House has taken steps to limit schedule B disclosures of  the tax-exempt organizations, the latest announcement from the IRS will  exempt some 45,000 nonprofits from the reporting rule, including  conservative organizations, but also unions and social welfare groups.   Today, one's political views can spark passion, hatred, even refusal  of service at a restaurant. In an extreme case, your life may be  threatened at baseball practice.   Regardless of political affiliation, Americans should feel  comfortable donating to a cause or candidate of their choice without  living in fear of reprisal. I applaud the administration's recent  action and encourage this Congress to join their effort and defend the  First Amendment rights of every American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and  Investor Confidence Act of 2018.   Terms like ``capital formation,'' ``liquidity,'' and ``qualified  investor'' may sound like Washington jargon. In reality, they represent  a few of the many important building blocks that drive our markets and  create jobs and opportunity around our country.   On the heels of the largest regulatory relief effort in nearly a  decade, the JOBS Act 3.0 will breathe new light into the  entrepreneurial spirit that makes our country so special.   This package of nonpartisan reforms includes several policy changes  to help small businesses and startups access the most liquid and  vibrant markets in the world, including the text of our Main Street  Growth Act, which the House unanimously adopted last week.   I appreciate the efforts of the chairman and the ranking member to  bring this significant legislation to the floor, and I encourage all of  my colleagues to support the continued growth of our economy and to  vote ``yes'' on the JOBS Act 3.0.
