 Madam Speaker, there was such exhilaration across  the Nation as Democrats came together last week and moved forward on  the bipartisan infrastructure bill with their vote and to catapult  forward the build back America bill as well.   Let me say how happy my constituents are for the $2.3 billion that  will clean the water of old schools, homes, and apartments. This is  something that we all fought together for.   But I am excited about the future of this week passing BBB because I  fought to reinsert the family medical leave and as well to ensure that  all of us have an opportunity to have healthcare across America; Texas  being the poster child for the uninsured. Madam Speaker, 766,000 will  get insurance now because of the Build Back Better Act.   There is breaking news, and the breaking news is inflation is not  caused by the Build Back Better or the bipartisan bill. It is caused by  corporate greed; they put the price on goods.   But, Madam Speaker, with the work of the Biden administration and  Democrats in Congress, we are going to see the economy drive for all of  America, inflation no more.  [[Page H6329]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, this is a very troubling moment in  our history.   After the rule is passed, you will see other Members come to the  floor to continue this debate.   I thought I would start out by holding up a most precious document,  and that is the Constitution of the United States of America. I often  get chills when I read its Preamble, which indicates that the body of  people who started this Nation organized to create a more perfect  Union.   I love to hear those words because what it suggests is that we wanted  to be the standard-bearer for what is best and better in the world. We  wanted to cease conflict. We wanted to be the defenders of peace. And  even with the original sin, we wanted somehow to be better than others.   I get chills when I walk through the Halls of this very august place,  to see the depictions of the debates in the early years, to realize how  fragile democracy is, and how we could not last.    I hold this up because, interestingly, we can be so proud that  Congress was listed as the first body of government, Article I.   As I read the charges in here, it gives us powers as the House of  Representatives. Nowhere is there a privilege to kill. Nowhere is there  the instruction to kill. Nowhere is there an instruction to be free to  murder. Yet, with a great deal of trepidation and sadness, I am here  because of a video.   This headline speaks to it: ``House to vote on censuring  Republican,'' Mr. Gosar, ``who shared violent video targeting'' a  Member of Congress.   That is the crux of why we are here. It is not speech of people  supporting the right to be free in this Nation and supporting the  George Floyd bill, where protesters, peaceful and otherwise, did rise  up, young people, about 66,000 in Houston, completely peaceful, as it  was around the Nation.   Don't try to compare the pain of protesters on an issue of justice  with the actions of this gentleman. Yes, I call him that.   Mr. Gosar is seen delivering a fatal blow to the back of the  monster's head, and blood is seen gushing from the wound. The face is  that of our colleague, and it is violent.   In addition, it is treasonous to be seen to attack the President of  the United States of America.   In one scene, footage of migrants crossing the Rio Grande is overlaid  with what appears to be splattered blood.   Who are we as a Nation?   In another, the words ``drugs,'' ``crime,'' ``poverty,'' ``money,''  ``murder,'' ``gangs,'' ``violence,'' and ``trafficking'' flash across  the screen. Mr. Gosar knew what he was doing.  [[Page H6333]]    The 1 minute and 32 seconds was posted by him. It shows him battling  a towering, naked monstrosity with the face of that Democratic Member.  It is against women of color; it is against women; and it is against  Members of Congress.   Last week, Ted Lieu and I, and 30 other Members, sent a letter to  Republican leadership asking if there was one person that would call  this out and indicate shame, shame, shame.   I include in the Record the letter that was sent to Republican  leadership.                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, November 12, 2021.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Republican Leader McCarthy: We write as members of the       United States House of Representatives to express our extreme       concern, indignation, and fear regarding the recent actions       of Representative Paul Gosar and to ask that you publicly       request a House Ethics Committee investigation into Mr.       Gosar's actions.        On November 7, 2021, Mr. Gosar shared a grotesque video on       Twitter in which his face and those of several other       Republican Members of the House are edited into the opening       credits of the Netflix anime series Attack on Titan, and in       which Mr. Gosar is depicted killing a giant monster with the       face of a Democratic Member of Congress.        The one minute and thirty-two-seconds video depicts Mr.       Gosar battling a towering, naked monstrosity with the face of       a Democratic Member of the House superimposed over the       monster's face. Mr. Gosar is then seen delivering a fatal       strike to the back of the monster's neck, and blood is seen       gushing from the wound. The video also depicts Mr. Gosar       leaping at President Biden while brandishing two swords, and       the video is interspersed throughout with real-life footage       of Border Patrol officers rounding up migrants at the U.S.-      Mexico border. In one scene, footage of migrants crossing the       Rio Grande is overlaid with what appears to be splattered       blood. In another, the words ``drugs,'' ``crime,''       ``poverty,'' ``money,'' ``murder,'' ``gangs,'' ``violence''       and ``trafficking'' flash across the screen.        Sharing the glorification of violence expressed in this       video goes far beyond the protections afforded by the Speech       and Debate Clause in the Constitution and is beneath the       dignity of a person serving in the Congress of the United       States. Mr. Gosar's actions display a breakdown of reasoned       discourse not seen in the House since the summer of 1856,       when South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks attacked       Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner with a cane on the       Senate floor. The beating nearly killed Sumner and       contributed significantly to the country's polarization over       the issue of slavery and to the use of violence that       eventually led to the Civil War.        In a like manner, Mr. Gosar's actions serve solely to       glorify the usage of violence against Members of the House.       As we witnessed with Mr. Gosar's actions leading up to       January 6, threats of violence and the glorification of       violence lead to actual violence. Mr. Gosar has continuously       been a strong proponent of the Big Lie that President Biden       lost the 2020 Presidential election. As reported by several       media outlets, Mr. Gosar was intimately involved with the       planning of the January 6 rally and, following the January 6       attack, Mr. Gosar called the insurrectionists ``peaceful       patriots.'' Rather than condemn calls for violence against       Congress and actual violence against Congress, Mr. Gosar has       instead shared an animated video of himself killing a fellow       Member of Congress.         Less than one year has passed since Congress witnessed the       January 6 domestic terrorists break into the Capitol       building, vandalize and steal property, threaten our safety       and lives, and attack and kill Capitol police officers. Less       than one year has passed since we witnessed crowds chanting       ``Hang Mike Pence,'' and ``Hang Nancy Pelosi'' outside this       bastion of democracy. If ever there was a time for the House       to come together to promote civility, discourse, and       cooperation, it is now.         For these reasons, we are asking that as the Leader of the       Republican Conference you publicly request an investigation       into Mr. Gosar's actions by the House Ethics Committee to       determine whether Mr. Gosar has violated the Rules of the       House to a degree sufficient to warrant disciplinary action,       including ordering the cessation of conduct that threatens       the lives of fellow Members of Congress and the President,       removal from his Committee positions, censure, expulsion, or       further disciplinary action as determined by the Committee or       the House of Representatives.         We must act to protect the dignity and integrity of the       House.            Very truly yours,          Sheila Jackson Lee, Alan Lowenthal, Grace F. Napolitano,             Rashida Tlaib, Ted Lieu, Nanette Barragan, Sylvia R.             Garcia, Grace Meng, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Jimmy Gomez,             Dwight Evans, Mike Doyle, David N. Cicilline, John             Larson, Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr., Adriano             Espaillat, Mike Quigley, Ilhan Omar, J. Luis Correa,             Stacey E. Plaskett, David Price, Linda Sanchez, Andre             Carson, Earl Blumenauer, Troy A. Carter, Madeleine             Dean, Mary Gay Scanlon, Jason Crow, Jim Cooper, Jerry             McNerney, Brenden F. Boyle, Steve Cohen, Members of             Congress.                                time  1300     This brings me to tears. There is no celebration on  this floor. It is imperative that we pass this resolution and Mr. Gosar  is censured and removed from his seat. The reason is you cannot depict  the murder of another Member of Congress or the President of the United  States.   Madam Speaker, I stand here today as a senior member of the  Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget,  to support this Rule governing debate of H. Res. 789 to censure Rep.  Gosar and to remove him from his committee assignment.   I also stand here, Madam Speaker, to express my concern, indignation,  and fear regarding Representative Gosar's actions.   On November 7, 2021, Mr. Gosar shared a grotesque video on Twitter in  which his face and those of several other Republican Members are edited  into an anime segment, and in which Mr. Gosar is depicted killing a  giant monster with the face of a Democratic Member of Congress.   Mr. Gosar is then seen delivering a fatal strike to the back of the  monster's neck, and blood is seen gushing from the wound.   The video also depicts Mr. Gosar leaping at President Biden while  brandishing two swords, and the video is interspersed throughout with  real-life footage of Border Patrol officers rounding up migrants at the  U.S.-Mexico border.   In one scene, footage of migrants crossing the Rio Grande is overlaid  with what appears to be splattered blood.   In another the words ``drugs'' ``crime'' ``poverty'' ``money''  ``murder'' ``gangs,'' ``violence'' and ``trafficking'' flash across the  screen.   The one minute and thirty-two second video depicts Mr. Gosar battling  a towering, naked monstrosity with the face of a Democratic Member of  the House superimposed over the monster's face.   This was a one minute and thirty-two second speech threatening  violence against a member of the House.   Last week, my colleague Ted Lieu and I, along with thirty other  members of the House, sent a letter to Minority Leader McCarthy asking  him to request an Ethics investigation into Mr. Gosar's actions.   Rather than standing for the dignity of the House, Minority Leader  McCarthy has done nothing.   I would like to submit into the record the November 12, 2021 letter  sent to Minority Leader McCarthy by myself, Ted Lieu, and thirty other  members of Congress.   Sharing the glorification of violence expressed in this video goes  far beyond the protections afforded by the Speech and Debate Clause in  the Constitution and is beneath the dignity of a person serving in the  Congress of the United States.   Mr. Gosar's actions display a breakdown of reasoned discourse not  seen in the House since the summer of 1856, when South Carolina  Congressman Preston Brooks attacked Massachusetts Senator Charles  Sumner with a cane on the Senate floor.   The beating nearly killed Sumner and contributed significantly to the  country's polarization over the issue of slavery and to the use of  violence that eventually led to the Civil War.   In a like manner, Mr. Gosar's actions serve solely to glorify the  usage of violence against Members of the House.   As we witnessed with Mr. Gosar's actions leading up to January 6,  threats of violence and the glorification of violence lead to actual  violence.

Rather than condemn calls for violence against Congress and actual  violence against Congress, Mr. Gosar has instead shared an animated  video of himself killing a fellow Member of Congress.   Rather than uphold the dignity and sanctity of the House, Republican  Leader McCarthy has done nothing   Less than one year has passed since Congress witnessed the January 6  domestic terrorists break into the Capitol building, vandalize and  steal property, threaten our safety and lives, and attack and kill  Capitol police officers.   Less than one year has passed since we witnessed crowds chanting  ``Hang Mike Pence'' and ``Hang Nancy Pelosi'' outside this bastion of  democracy. If ever there was a time for the House to come together to  promote civility, discourse, and cooperation, it is now.   For these reasons, I urge all members to vote in favor of this Rule  governing debate.  [[Page H6334]]    We must act to protect the dignity and integrity of the House.
