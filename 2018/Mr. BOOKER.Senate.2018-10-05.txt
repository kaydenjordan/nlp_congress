 Mr. President, on September 16, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford  publicly came forward to share that Brett Kavanaugh had sexually  assaulted her when they were in high school. This was a remarkably  courageous act. It was one that she hesitated to do. It was something  that she struggled with, but she said time and again that she believed  it was her civic duty and her sense of citizenship--that act of grace,  that feeling that you have a commitment to country, to causes larger  than yourself. She put herself forward. She said she was terrified to  do so. She said she feared for what the impact would be on her family.   Indeed, the impact on her family was terrifying. She endured hatred  and vile poured out to her--death threats. She had to leave her family  home and split her family up at times. She had to engage security for  her own protection.   When Dr. Ford came before the Judiciary Committee to testify, she  reiterated that she was afraid. She reiterated how terrified she was,  but she stated again and again this ideal of patriotic duty and civic  responsibility because she believed that there is something about our  institutions that is sacred and that for the highest Court in the land,  there could be millions of qualified people in America, thousands of  folks. Indeed, the President's list itself has dozens of folks. She  said that this person who sexually assaulted her should not go on the  highest Court in the land for a lifetime appointment.   So she sat before us in the face of endless harassment, with glaring  public scrutiny into all aspects of her life and the threats against  her family. Dr. Ford gave testimony that was powerful and that, to  many, was jarring. She talked about her private truth, her experience,  and how it affected her life.   She said again and again that she wanted to be helpful to the  committee.  [[Page S6606]]  She treated every member of the committee on the Republican side and  the Democratic side with respect. She extended them grace. She was  cross-examined by a prosecutor for the Republicans. She engaged with  that prosecutor with a sense of decency and honor. She didn't stretch  the truth or try to dodge questions. She spoke honestly and candidly  and from her heart. She shared details that she said had been seared  into her memory.   She talked about the narrow set of stairs in that house that she  climbed to use the restroom. She talked about being pushed from behind  into a bedroom. She talked about the music being turned up louder as  she struggled. She talked about Brett Kavanaugh on top of her, hand  over her mouth, trying to stop her as she yelled for help. She said she  thought she was going to be raped. She said she thought she might be  accidentally killed.   There was Mark Judge, a person she identified, watching, refusing to  help her. Both Mark and Brett were laughing. Dr. Ford described that  laughter as searing into her memory. She talked about it as being  indelible. She told us she would never forget, and that she would  ``never forget the uproarious laughter between the two and their having  fun at my expense.''   I believe her. I believe Dr. Ford. I still believe her, and many of  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle spoke up, calling Dr. Ford's  testimony credible. Many have said they believe her or, at least, that  they believe someone assaulted her. They gave credence to the power of  that experience--an experience that reflects that of many people who  experience trauma. You don't remember it like a video recording, but  there are moments that are seared into your mind. Her experience was  consistent with people who have experienced trauma. Even though the  Senate hearing would not allow experts to come in, we all know enough  now to know that the way she described her experiences and the things  she remembered all spoke to the ability of a courageous American doing  their civic duty.   I was surprised that even the President of the United States called  her sincere and called her testimony compelling. That was until he  stood at a rally and mocked her. The President of the United States,  the most powerful person in the country--perhaps the most powerful  person in the world--mocked her and got uproarious laughter. The same  thing that was seared in her memory: People were laughing at her. The  President ignited that in a crowd and made her again the focus of  laughter and mocking.   To this body that I revere, this body that I love; to my colleagues,  whom I respect, on both sides of the aisle; to this body that was  designed to be the world's most deliberative body; to this body that  was designed to be thoughtful, to take the time to analyze, the  question is this: We heard words about her testimony, but what followed  those words? Were they like dust in the wind or were they substantive  words that cause us to believe her, admiring and honoring her courage  for coming forward? Did we treat her that way?   Well, if they did believe her, if they did honor her words and her  courage and the risk she took, then this body and the Judiciary  Committee, of which I am a part, would have insisted on a full, fair,  thorough, and complete FBI investigation that included the many  witnesses who stepped forward who could have corroborated her testimony  and could have contradicted Judge Kavanaugh's testimony. This body  would have insisted that we take the time to do a thorough  investigation because it is not just about Dr. Ford. There are millions  of survivors, women and men, watching how this body will deal with the  seriousness of sexual assault.    Will we listen to survivors? Will we honor them enough to fully  investigate their charges? These are not just charges alone. These are  charges against someone who is up for one of the most important  positions in our Nation--a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.   No, they did not honor them. If they had honored them, they would  have insisted on a full FBI investigation. Indeed, when another  survivor, Ms. Ramirez, came forward, talking about her incident with  Judge Kavanaugh during college days--when Judge Kavanaugh diminished  his drinking, evasively talked about his drinking--classmate after  classmate, after his testimony, came forward and said he was lying and  he was misleading. Republican and Democratic classmates were offended  by the way he talked about his behavior. It was in those college days  that Ms. Ramirez said Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her. She  identified 20 witnesses that were either eyewitnesses or could have  corroborated the evidence.   She talked in detail about who could have substantiated her claims  about the kind of drunkenness that we heard in public statements from  his friends, which seemed consistent and seemed to implicate the  truthfulness of someone who was going to the highest Court. Did we  honor that woman? Did we honor that survivor by doing an investigation,  by going to and at least talking to the 20 witnesses that she put  forward--another woman who is being mocked, another woman who is a  victim of hate being spewed at her, belittling her? Did we honor a  survivor and simply listen and interview the 20 people she said could  have proved the factual nature of her allegation?   No, we didn't. We didn't honor a survivor. We didn't listen to a  survivor. We didn't take the time in the world's most deliberative body  to listen to a woman's claims and take the steps to see if they were  true or not.   This is what to me is so deeply offensive. It is that you have two  women who come forward making claims that even the President said, at  first, seemed sincere and compelling, but we didn't take the next step  to fully investigate their claims so that we could know what the facts  are.   The truth is something that the American public deserves. An  investigation that gets to the truth is something that the American  public deserves, that Dr. Ford deserves, that Ms. Ramirez deserves, and  that even Brett Kavanaugh deserves--to let the truth come out. But this  FBI investigation was part of a larger sham.   People on the right, colleagues of mine, accused Dr. Ford, with her  sincere testimony--they accused her of being part of a coordinated,  partisan smear campaign. Think about that. She told her husband in 2012  about the attack. Was she somehow coordinating with Democrats back in  2012 before Judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near being on the Supreme  Court? No.   She talked about it with her therapist. She talked about it with her  husband. She said it was Brett Kavanaugh years before Brett Kavanaugh  was even on a list of consideration by the President.   In 2013, she discussed the assault again in an individual therapy  session. In that same year, she told a close friend that she had been  assaulted as a teenager while she was trapped in the room with two  drunken boys. That was not a coordinated, partisan attack back in 2013.   In 2016, she told another friend she had been sexually assaulted in  high school by someone who went on to become a Federal judge. In 2017,  she told yet another friend about the assault. She told each of these  three friends that a person who had assaulted her had become a Federal  judge. This does not sound like some kind of partisan smear tactics;  this sounds like a woman who has been telling the truth for years about  Brett Kavanaugh.   The least this body could do is pause for a moment and not do a sham  FBI investigation where they talk to just a handful of people but do a  full FBI investigation, because these charges are serious.   Meanwhile, millions of Americans--survivors themselves and others-- are watching to see how we deal with something that the Centers for  Disease Control says happens to one out of every three women in  America. How do we deal with those charges? It happens to one out of  every six men in America. How do we deal with those charges? When a  survivor comes forward, how does the world's most deliberative body  honor that?   What we are seeing here is a coordinated, partisan effort to put  blinders on, to not seek the truth, and to rush this to tomorrow to a  final vote.   Long before Dr. Ford's bravery, I was one of those Democrats, one of  those Senators, one of those Americans who expressed their sincere and  deeply held concerns about Judge Kavanaugh's  [[Page S6607]]  record. I said early that I would not support him. I opposed his  nomination. Then, I opposed his nomination because I was deeply  concerned that we have a President of the United States who is the  subject of a criminal investigation, and that President picked the one  person from his Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society list who had  a view of Presidential power that I believed would give that President  immunity should issues relating to that investigation come before the  Supreme Court.   I am deeply troubled about his views on women's right to make their  own medical decisions. I am troubled about his views on workers' rights  to organize, on voting rights, on civil rights, and on the principle of  equal justice under the law. I am concerned about things that he said  about foreign dark money influencing our campaigns. His record  demonstrated very clearly to me that, if confirmed to the Supreme  Court, Judge Kavanaugh would continue to prioritize the interests of  the powerful few over the rights of everyday Americans and that we  would see an erosion of individual rights in this country. But I still  believed we needed to have a fair and thorough vetting of this nominee  consistent with our constitutional obligations and that it would  eventually get to the floor and we would have our vote.   In the many weeks leading up to Judge Kavanaugh's hearing before the  Judiciary Committee, many Democratic colleagues and I pushed for the  same kind of transparency and a process. Even if we knew where we were  going to go, the process should have been fair. The process should have  been bipartisan.   The Judiciary Committee has a long history of the majority and  minority working together to set ground rules for the committee  process. I watched the Judiciary Committee for many years before I came  to this body. It was the No. 1 committee I wanted to be on 5 years ago  when I came to the Senate. There are legends still on that committee,  statesmen on both sides of the aisle, men I respect. But this process  from the very beginning has been a sham. It has undermined the ability  of Senators to perform our constitutional duty to advise and consent on  the nominee because of the withholding of critical information that I  believe is absolutely necessary to evaluate someone.   This constitutional duty means that we should have a process that  allows transparency into that person's record. The public has a right  to know who the individual is that we are voting on tomorrow, what  their record is. The public has a right to know. Why would we hide  their record from public scrutiny?   Step 1 of the sham was the Republican majority's refusal to request  any records from Judge Kavanaugh's time as Staff Secretary to President  George Bush. Zero records were requested whatsoever. Brett Kavanaugh  himself held that position for 3 years. He called those 3 years of his  year the ``most interesting and most formative years'' of his career,  the most interesting and formative in shaping his approach to serving  as a judge and during which he presumably advised the President on  everything from national security policy to a proposed constitutional  ban on same-sex marriages. So many critical issues that are germane to  his job and his experience and the formation of his ideals were  happening during those times. But they said we could see nothing from  his record, even things that are not classified, not national security,  things that would give us a better window into who he is.   Step 2 of the sham was to create a wholly unaccountable process for  the fraction of the White House records that the Republican majority  did request from Kavanaugh's time in the White House Counsel's Office.  This process was essentially made up. It had no reflection on the  history of his body of work--no reflection at all.    What happened was they put into place a practice where a private  lawyer, Bill Burck--who happens to be a longtime political operative,  who was a former deputy to Brett Kavanaugh himself when he was Staff  Secretary--was put into part of the process as a choke hold on  documents getting to Senators for our evaluation. Most of the documents  of this candidate's work product have not been seen by any Senator  here. In fact, about 90 percent of his relevant work experience, his  relevant work product, has not been reviewed by any Senator here.   Imagine hiring somebody whose resume you have only seen 10 percent of  because 90 percent is obscured. Most of the folks here wouldn't hire an  intern in their office if somebody was hiding 90 percent of their  resume.   Then there is step 3 of the sham. In conjunction with Mr. Burck, the  committee chairman designated 186,000 pages something that was new  called ``committee confidential'' in order to hide them from the public  because they might harm the nomination. Imagine this: With the public  having a right to know, the public needing transparency, now they are  hiding yet again, under the name ``committee confidential,'' critical  documents. They withheld 102,000 pages from the committee altogether,  threatening to invoke some nebulous constitutional privilege. As a  result, today, just hours before the final vote, only 7 percent of  Kavanaugh's record from the Bush White House has been released to  Senators. We are making a decision knowing only 7 percent of his work  product.   When women's rights, workers' rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights,  and affordable healthcare are all in the balance, we know so little  about this candidate. Because of all that is at stake, several  colleagues and I made a decision to release those documents, but it was  still just a fraction.   Meanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh's initial testimony before the Judiciary  Committee raised my concern because he continued to evade questions,  refused to answer our questions.   After Dr. Blasey Ford came forward, he gave his testimony, and I was  stunned. You see, at Judge Kavanaugh's initial hearing in early  September, he testified that he wanted to stay ``three zip codes away  from politics.'' He insisted that the Supreme Court must never--I  emphasize that word--never be viewed as a partisan institution. But  when he came before the Judiciary Committee again last week, Judge  Kavanaugh jettisoned his own advice, his own belief in judicial  temperament, his own belief in how a judge should behave and be  nonpartisan, and he leveled blatantly political accusations. He said  that the allegations against him were nothing more than ``an  orchestrated political hit,'' even speculating that they were motivated  by ``a revenge on behalf of the Clintons.'' He cast blame on outside,  leftwing opposition groups. He told the Democrats who were questioning  him that the hearings had been ``an embarrassment.'' He was  belligerent. He was evasive. At times, he was outright deceptive, and  at times, he was deeply disrespectful to my Senate colleagues. He  displayed the type of fierce partisanship that no American should ever  want to see in a Federal judge. He went on to say almost as a menacing  threat that ``what goes around, comes around.''   Is this someone who can sit on the highest Court in the land, where  political issues might come before him? Has he not already revealed  himself to be deeply partisan? Has he not already revealed himself to  have a deep-seeded anger toward people of certain political stripe? Is  this someone who shows the kind of judicial temperament, not for a  district court, not for a circuit court, but for the highest Court in  the land, the Court of last resort?   He didn't say all of this in response to questions. These weren't  off-the-cuff comments. This was part of his prepared testimony. Those  quotes were in his prepared testimony.   In another instance during his testimony, he warned that ``this is a  circus.'' He said, ``The consequences will extend long past my  nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades.''   That is how I want to end. What are the consequences for a sham  process, for a sham FBI investigation? What are the consequences in  relation to women who came forward before the world's most deliberative  body with credible accusations of sexual misconduct, of sexual assault,  of sexual violence? What are the consequences to a body that runs a  partisan process, that ignores the truth, that shields relevant aspects  of his record--90 percent--from the public? What are the consequences  as they rush to the Senate floor hoping nobody knows the truth and  ignoring investigating some of the most serious charges that could be  leveled against  [[Page S6608]]  someone--charges of violence, charges of assault? What are the  consequences for us in this body behaving in this way? What are the  consequences for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has forever altered her  life for her civic duty, for her patriotism, for her love of country?  She sacrificed to come forward, and how do we treat her?   This has been an emotional week for so many. I have seen and heard  and witnessed the pain and the trauma that has been dredged up. I have  heard from some of my colleagues in private meetings about dozens of  people coming forward to them, having never told people about their  sexual assault, and now they come and tell their Senator, hoping that  their story and that their pain that they haven't even shared with  their spouse will somehow make a difference in the larger story of our  country, will somehow make a difference at this moment when two women  are not being listened to and when their stories are not getting worthy  recognition, worthy investigation. I heard colleague after colleague  tell me the stories, the painful stories.   I heard them myself from friends of mine who I never knew had been  assaulted. I never knew of their pain, never knew of their trauma. But  at this moment in American history, they felt they had to come forward.  They had to tell their truth, like Christine Blasey Ford, like Ms.  Ramirez. They felt now was the time to speak up and stop this Nation  from making a mistake and try to stop the injustice and try to end a  national nightmare where one out of three women is assaulted and most  of them don't feel comfortable coming forward. They don't feel safe  coming forward. They feel that if they come forward, they will be  maligned, hated, disrespected, disregarded; that their charges will be  swept under the rug; that their charges will be ignored. Yet a chorus  of women and men all across this country have been telling their  stories, screaming at this Nation, hoping the national conversation  will shift in this country from abusing those who have been abused to  elevating truth again.   This body has had a test, and we are failing that test. This body has  had a chance. This body has had a responsibility, and we have  surrendered that responsibility. So tomorrow we vote. It seems like the  die is cast.   I heard there were celebrations and cheering in the White House. And  in the last few hours, I also heard the pain and the anguish and the  hurt, and I have heard the tears. It seems so unjust. It seems so  unfair that two courageous women came forward to this body, and we  couldn't even investigate their claims. We couldn't even take time to  talk to witnesses. A lot of folks are now asking me: What now?   I want to conclude by reading some words from another painful period  where people didn't know what this body would do. There was injustice  in this land. People didn't know what this body would do. Hundreds of  thousands came forward to march and to protest and to sit in. They  didn't know what this body would do, but they stood anyway and they  fought anyway. Sometimes they were beaten. In one case, on a bridge in  Alabama, they were beaten and bloodied. One of my colleagues in the  other Chamber,  John Lewis, had his head split open. They eventually  got over that bridge and got to Montgomery, and a man named King gave  this speech to those people who were tempted to surrender to cynicism  in that time. He gave this speech to those people who wanted to give  up. He gave this speech to those people who were hurting. This is what  he said:         I know you're asking today, ``How long will it take?       Somebody's asking, ``How long will prejudice blind the       visions of men, darken their understanding, and drive bright-      eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?'' Somebody's asking,       ``When will wounded justice, lying in prostrate on the       streets . . . be lifted from this dust of shame to reign       supreme among the children of men?'' Somebody's asking,       ``When will the radiant star of hope be plunged against the       nocturnal bosom of this lonely night, plucked from the weary       soul with chains of fear and the manacles of death? How long       will justice be crucified, and truth bear it?''        I come to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the       moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long,       because ``truth crushed to the earth will rise again.''        How long? Not long, because ``no lie can live forever.''        How long? Not long, because ``you shall reap what you       sow.''        How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe       is long, but it bends toward justice.    I say to every American who is hurting tonight, every American who is  angry tonight, tomorrow we face a defeat, but we shall not be defeated.  Tomorrow, it may seem like a loss, but all hope is not lost.   I have faith in us as a country. I know it has been a long journey. I  know we have suffered much, but I have a faith in this country that is  abiding and cannot be destroyed because we are a nation that always  finds a way to move forward, to learn, to grow. What is dependent upon  us doing that is for us to never ever give up. Never give up.   The days ahead will be difficult. It will not be easy, but I have  faith in America. We will learn. We will grow. We will get better. We  will come together if we never give up.   Tomorrow, the vote may be what it is. The die may be cast, but I will  never give up on this country. I will never give up on women. I will  never give up on the ideals and principles we all swear an oath to that  this Nation, one day, truly will be a nation of liberty and justice for  all.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that two  members of my staff, Sophia Brill and Daniel Schuker, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the postcloture time on the nomination.
