 Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the violent  attacks on the pro-life organizations and facilities in the wake of the  Dobbs leak and subsequent overruling of Roe v. Wade.   There has been very little accountability for the leaked draft  opinion and ensuing violent intimidation against pro-life activists.  That is why this resolution is so necessary. It makes it crystal clear  that violence, property damage, threats, and intimidation tactics must  be condemned, and they must have consequences for those who do this  violence.   I am proud of the work of the Palmetto Women's Center in Rock Hill,  South Carolina, in my district, as it does tremendous work.   The Biden administration needs to use all appropriate law enforcement  mechanisms necessary to uphold public safety and protect the rights of  these pro-life groups and facilities. Just because this administration  doesn't agree with protecting the unborn doesn't mean they should turn  a blind eye to violence and intimidation.                            ____________________
