 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Yesterday afternoon, Senate Democrats voted against a  rules change that would have reduced needless delay in the Senate and  ensure that future Presidents of both parties could staff their  administrations in a timely fashion.   Democrats chose partisanship over principle and political advantage  over the well-being of the Senate. How do I know that this was a  partisan decision on Democrats' part and not a principled one? Because  34 currently serving Members of the Democratic caucus supported a very  similar rules change measure when President Obama was in office. Yet  not one Member--not one Member of the Democratic caucus--voted in favor  of the rules change yesterday.   Worse, privately, many Democrats had indicated a willingness to  support the rules change but only if the effective date were pushed to  2021, when Democrats hope they will have a Democrat in the White House.  Apparently, it is reasonable for Democratic administrations to be  staffed up in a timely fashion, but Republican administrations should  have to suffer endless partisan delays. That is a pretty offensive  position.   It is disrespectful to the American people, who deserve a fully  staffed administration, even when their choice of President isn't the  Democrats' choice. It is disrespectful of our system of government.   Democrats apparently think the system should be rigged in favor of  their party, no matter what election results say. Don't like the fact  that a Republican President got to choose Supreme Court Justices? Pack  the courts. Don't like the fact that your candidate didn't win the  election? Change our electoral system.   In a democracy, you win some elections and you lose some elections.  Sometimes you like the individual in the White House, and sometimes you  don't. Sometimes you succeed in passing your legislation, and sometimes  you just don't have the votes. That is the nature of life in a  democracy.   No one likes being in the minority. It is not fun to lose votes or  elections, but that is the price of freedom. That is the price of  democracy.   The other option is for one party to try to rig the system in its  favor so that everything goes its way no matter what election results  say. There is a name for that. It is called tyranny.   Back in 2013, a majority of Republicans, including the Republican  leader and me, supported a rules change to streamline the process of  approving lower level administration nominees, such as district court  judges and assistant secretaries. We voted for this rules change even  though we knew it would benefit only President Obama since it would  expire at the end of the 113th Congress, but we signed on because we  supported the principle behind the change. We believed that Presidents  should be able to staff their administrations in a timely fashion, yes,  even if they weren't Presidents from our party. We believed that  whether the President was a Republican or Democrat, the American people  deserved a fully functioning executive branch. So we worked with  Democrats to streamline consideration of lower level administration  nominees.   I am deeply disappointed that Democrats chose to betray their  principles yesterday for short-term partisan gain, and I hope the  Democrats here in the Senate will think better of their vote and work  with Republicans to speed up consideration of lower level nominees  before Democrats' historic level of obstruction becomes a permanent  standard here in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Mississippi (Mrs. Hyde-Smith).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1001         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
