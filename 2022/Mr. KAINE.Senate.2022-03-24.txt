 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused  extraordinary challenges for our Nation's public health system and put  a spotlight on longstanding gaps in public health preparedness. Our  Nation's public health system needs accurate, timely, and high-quality  data to protect the public from emerging health threats and to respond  to existing public health emergencies.   For far too long, gaps in data infrastructure have prevented  policymakers and public health officials from quickly translating  public health data into their decisionmaking. Outdated and inconsistent  public health data systems have made it hard for Federal, State, local,  Tribal, and territorial public health departments to get a full picture  of the COVID-19 crisis. In turn, these data gaps have made it difficult  for public health departments to tailor their responses. Specifically,  inconsistent definitions of data, ambiguous reporting requirements, and  data accessibility issues have hindered the U.S. response to the COVID- 19 pandemic and prevented the timely communication of public health  data.   We know that effective pandemic prevention and response requires  coordinated efforts between public health  [[Page S1776]]  officials across all levels of government. Today, I am pleased to  introduce with my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Smith, and Murphy, the  Improving Data Accessibility Through Advancements in Public Health Act,  or the Improving DATA in Public Health Act, to use the lessons learned  from the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that our Nation's public health  system has the data capabilities to address and prevent future  pandemics.   The Improving DATA in Public Health Act amends public health data  systems' modernization provisions in current law by establishing a  timeline for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  disseminate data standards to improve the exchange of electronic public  health data. The bill also directs the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services to expand the access, exchange, and use of  public health data by improving data sharing between Federal Agencies  and State and local public health systems when preparing for,  identifying, monitoring, and responding to public health emergencies.   The Improving DATA in Public Health Act also expands upon existing  data modernization efforts by commissioning a study on improving  electronic data standards and reporting between laboratories and public  health data systems. Finally, the legislation calls for the development  of best practices to improve the quality and completeness of  demographic data to support equitable public health responses.   The Improving DATA in Public Health Act will strengthen our public  health data systems and take commonsense steps to improve our ability  to prevent and respond to future pandemics.                                  ______                                         By Mr. HEINRICH (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 3918. A bill to establish programs to improve family economic  security by breaking the cycle of multigenerational poverty, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
