 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan  legislation, which I was proud to introduce with my colleague from New  York, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.   This legislation would provide needed reforms to the living will  submission process, would ensure that impacted financial institutions  get needed feedback from their regulators, and would uphold sensible  standards to protect the financial system.   This may sound like wonky financial policy, but to the hardworking  men and women in my district, fixing these confusing regulations that  have choked off community lending can be the determining factor with  regards to getting a small business loan or a mortgage.   These are the financial products that provide access to the American  Dream, that help communities grow through homeownership, and that allow  small-business owners to hire and expand.   Now, more than ever, we need to be working on a bipartisan basis to  improve the standards and reform the confusing regulations that are  being imposed on our community banks and financial institutions.   This bill changes the procedure for the submission and review of  resolution plans, also known as living wills.                                time  1830    This legislation is in line with recommendations from a 2016 GAO  report in which it was recommended that banking regulators should  publicly disclose the assessment frameworks, consider shifting to a 2- year cycle, and provide feedback to companies within a minimum of 6  months.   The vast discretion granted to Federal regulators under the current  law's living will regime is essentially a license for those regulators  to decide the proper size, scale, and business model of private sector  enterprises.   This legislation reins in that unchecked government authority and  provides greater accountability and much-needed transparency to the  living will process.   This bill requires public disclosure of the rules for living wills  and also requires regulators to follow up with financial institutions  in a timely fashion with the feedback necessary to meet these  standards.   These reforms are critical for providing our Nation's banking systems  and the customers they serve, to protect our Nation's banking systems.   This bill cleared the Financial Services Committee with a strong  bipartisan vote of 60-0. I am especially thankful for the bipartisan  cooperation of my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking member of the Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investment Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Chairmen Hensarling and  Luetkemeyer for their leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters of support from  the Financial Services Roundtable and the American Bankers Association.                                  Financial Services Roundtable,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Financial Services       Roundtable (FSR) supports H.R. 4292 the ``Financial       Institution  [[Page H652]]       Living Wills Improvement Act of 2017,'' sponsored by       Representative Lee Zeldin.        H.R. 4292 changes the procedure for the submission and       review of resolution plans, also known as ``living wills.''       The bill would adjust the frequency of resolution plan       submissions from annually to a two-year cycle, require       regulators to provide feedback within six months of       submission and publicly disclose the framework used to review       the plans. Improving the resolution plan process provides       transparency, accountability and efficiency while enabling       firms to enhance their plans.        The Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation require resolution plan submissions be reviewed       and updated annually. It is increasingly evident, however,       that these annual requirements are neither efficient nor       effective for both regulators and covered firms. Resolution       plans do not change substantially from year to year, absent a       material change in a firm's structure. A Government       Accountability Office (GAO) report on resolution planning       supports a longer submission cycle so firms have sufficient       time to revise their plans and incorporate regulatory       feedback.        Similarly, GAO recommended that regulators make the       assessment frameworks public, noting transparency would       promote accountability by the agencies and result in better       resolution plans. Providing firms clarity as to how       determinations are made will eliminate the uncertainty around       the appropriate changes necessary to strengthen the       resolution plan. Further, requiring regulators to provide       feedback within a defined period will enable firms to address       deficiencies and ensure the institution's strength in the       event of financial distress or failure.        H.R. 4292 helps improve how U.S. financial regulations work       for individuals, financial institutions, and the U.S.       economy. FSR supports H.R. 4292 the ``Financial Institution       Living Wills Improvement Act of 2017,'' and urges enactment       of important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                 Anthony Cimino,                                               Senior Vice President      & Head of Government Affairs.                                   ____                                     American Bankers Association,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the members of the American Bankers Association, I am writing       to express our support for H.R. 4292, the Financial       Institution Living Will Improvement Act of 2017. This       legislation is scheduled for consideration on the January       29th suspension calendar.        This bipartisan legislation introduced by Representatives       Lee Zeldin and Carolyn Maloney, Ranking Member of the Capital       Markets, Securities and Investment Subcommittee, would       improve the process for banks subject to the ``living will       submissions'' process. Requiring filings no more frequently       than every two years and timely regulator feedback on the       submissions would make the resolution planning process more       efficient, while still supporting regulators' ability to deal       with a failed institution.        H.R. 4292 passed the House Financial Services Committee on       November 15, 2017 by a unanimous vote of 60-0.        This is a commonsense piece of legislation that provides       needed reforms. We urge the House of Representatives to       approve H.R. 4292.            Sincerely,      James C. Ballentine,        Executive Vice President, Congressional Relations and       Political Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gaetz for organizing this  important Special Order and all my colleagues for coming to the House  floor tonight encouraging the President of the United States now to  certify the release of this memo to the American public.  [[Page H658]]    The American public is a lot smarter than a whole lot of other people  give them credit for. Present them with the facts and the truth, and  they can form their own independent judgment as to what transpired.  That was the first thought that came to my mind when I went to the  basement a week before last--the basement of the House Capitol--to read  this classified memo of the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence, that this memo should be immediately released to the  American public so that they have all of the facts.   In addition to releasing the memo, I believe it is important to be  releasing relevant material sourced in the memo.   Now, tonight, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  voted to publicly release this memo to the American public, and, at the  same time, the House Democrats came to the committee calling for the  declassification and public release of their memo.                                time  1945    Let me add a little bit more context on this memo that the House  Democrats came to the floor asking to be released.   They did not allow the voting members of the House Intelligence  Committee to read the memo tonight before voting to declassify and  publicly release it.   Let me repeat that. The House Democrats, led by Ranking Member Adam  Schiff, went to the House Intelligence Committee tonight calling for  the public release of their memo, asking for their colleagues to  declassify the memo and to publicly release it immediately, without  giving them the opportunity to read it first.   I can speak for myself. I haven't read the memo that the House  Democrats offered up tonight. I haven't been granted any access to read  it. I am not aware of any other of my colleagues who have been able to  read it. I can't even confirm it exists.   After the committee met, it was fascinating to watch the minority  members of the House Intelligence Committee going straight from the  hearing room to the cameras to give their narrative. At no point did  they mention whatsoever, when they were saying that they were outraged  that the majority members of that committee didn't vote to publicly  release it, at no point did they mention that they never gave them the  opportunity to read it first.   What you don't see, at the same time, are the majority members of the  House Intelligence Committee racing off to all those same cameras to  give their same side of the narrative, the members of that House  Intelligence Committee.   What we are asking for is the American public to get the facts so  that they can form the judgment of this FISA abuse for themselves.   I, too, applaud the leadership of Mr. Nunes and the House  Intelligence Committee for their work to restore faith with the  American people.   As a former Army intelligence officer and JAG officer myself, I  understand the importance of giving our intelligence agencies the  critical tools they need to protect our homeland, assist our troops on  the front lines, and surveil our enemies. However, it is critical that  we strike a balance between national security and civil liberty to  prevent any gross violation of individual liberties under the guise of  national security.   Congress has the responsibility of ensuring an appropriate balance is  struck, and when it is not, to release information we feel is in the  national interest and of public importance. Today, Congress took an  important step in making this possible.   Americans deserve the truth. To pull the wool over the eyes of the  American public insults their intelligence and debases the freedoms and  liberties on which our government was founded. Government transparency  and accountability should be neither partisan nor divisive.   I would urge my colleagues on either side of the aisle, especially  those who have voted against its release, to evaluate and reflect upon  their position and come together united in favor of our belief that the  American public is a lot smarter than many give them credit for. Give  them the facts, and we have faith they will be able to form their own  independent conclusions.   Now it is up to the President. I would encourage him to release the  memo. I would also encourage him to release relevant material sourced  in it. Americans have the right know. If we as their elected  Representatives fail to stand up for them, who will?   The only way forward is to give the American public more information,  not less. Release the memo.   I thank Congressman Matt Gaetz for his leadership throughout this  entire process and his efforts to make sure the American public learns  more, not less.
