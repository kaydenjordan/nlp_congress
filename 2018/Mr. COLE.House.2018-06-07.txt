 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.   Originally, I have to say, I was skeptical when the administration  raised the idea of rescissions, not because I am against saving money-- I think we need to do a lot more of that around here--but because I  thought this might undo the bipartisan agreement that the  administration and our leadership had negotiated.   Frankly, this bill does nothing of the kind. And I want to compliment  the President and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, our former colleague, for  using a tool that has not been used in 20 years. They did the right  thing. They did it in the right way.   This is the largest rescission package ever in the history of  Congress. It will save almost $15 billion. But where are those savings  coming from? They are coming from funds that we, frankly, didn't use or  we overappropriated.   My friends talk a lot about CHIP. The authorization for $5 billion of  that money ran out. You can't even legally spend it. Why would you  leave it in the account?   Another $2 billion is taken from an account for when States go beyond  their spending limits. We have never spent more than $350 million of  that money, and we actually left $500 million in the account. Why not  reclaim the savings and return them to the Treasury?   You can go on and on.   There was $4.3 billion for the Advanced Technology Vehicles  Manufacturing Loan Program that nobody has applied for or has not been  used since 2011.   Again, there is example after example. It is a wise thing to reclaim  unused money and spending authority and return it to the Treasury of  the United States.   I am very proud to cosponsor the legislation. I am very supportive of  it and would urge its passage.
