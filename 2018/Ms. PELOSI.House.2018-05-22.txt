 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  commend her for her extraordinary leadership in protecting the American  consumer, the American taxpayer, our American financial systems. She  has been just a remarkable, wonderful leader.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished Whip for yielding so that I  could stay on schedule and for his great leadership as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I do so on behalf  of the hardworking American people. It is a bad bill under the guise of  helping community banks.   It rolls back key safeguards for American consumers, it opens the  door to lending discrimination, and it potentially threatens the  stability of our financial system and our economy.   The bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness  on Wall Street ignited a historic financial meltdown. Wall Street  gambled with the livelihood of consumers, and then it was the middle  class that lost its shirt.   I just want to share with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  why I have serious concerns about what is happening on the floor today.  It is yet again another weakening of Dodd-Frank.   Here is what I want to call to your mind, because you may not  remember this or you may not have been fully aware of it, but you  should know it.   On the night of September 18, 2008, I called the Secretary of the  Treasury and said: What is happening, that we have had in the past  couple of weeks Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and then in that 24-hour period,  AIG? I said: Can you come to the Capitol to explain tomorrow morning  what is happening so that we can help restore confidence to the markets  and not say anything that would do anything less than that?   He said: Madam Speaker--I was Speaker at the time--tomorrow morning  will be too late.   Tomorrow morning will be too late. Why am I calling you?   So, in any event, the Secretary of the Treasury came to the Capitol  for an emergency meeting. It was a bipartisan meeting, House and  Senate, to inform us that a meltdown was imminent.   What he described to us that night was so stunning, he took us down  to the gates of hell, to a place so deep that even Dante would not have  had a name for that circle in hell, because it was so stunning in terms  of what was happening, the meltdown that was happening to our financial  institutions.   When I asked the Fed Chairman, who was also at the meeting, Ben  Bernanke, what he thought, he said, ``If we do not act immediately, we  will not have an economy by Monday.''   ``An economy by Monday.'' We thought it might be one or the other  financial institutions. ``We will not have an economy by Monday.''   To stop the meltdown, the Bush administration requested and Congress  immediately passed emergency funding, the TARP bill. You may be  familiar with it.   To prevent this from ever happening again, we passed Dodd-Frank, the  most extensive banking and financial reforms in decades and the  strongest set of consumer financial protections in history.                                time  1430    And since the Republicans have taken the majority in the Congress and  now in the White House, there has been a series of weakenings of Dodd- Frank. So you cannot just view this bill as this bill today, bad enough  as it is, worthy of a ``no,'' unworthy of support, but to see it in  light of a series of weakenings of Dodd-Frank.   The bill dismantles key safeguards that are critical in combating  racial discrimination in lending, despite overwhelming evidence that  people of color are routinely discriminated against by financial  institutions. All year, the GOP has opened the door to discrimination  in our financial system. This is just another discriminatory piece of  legislation.   They pushed a CRA to roll back protections against discrimination in  auto lending. They voted to repeal an executive order requiring Federal  contractors to comply with basic nondiscrimination laws. Big banks are  also using the guise of protecting community banks to help out the  largest banks on Wall Street.  [[Page H4344]]    The bill exempts 26 of the largest banks from the Dodd-Frank Act's  heightened oversight. Since 2007, these same banks have been sued or  cited by the regulators nearly 200 times and paid settlements of $40  billion, some of which they can deduct from their taxes.   Republicans are also using relief for community banks as a way of  undermining the Volcker rule, threatening the stability of the  financial system and the entire economy.   Republicans' willingness to abandon vulnerable Americans and  jeopardize our entire financial system to further enrich wealthy Wall  Street banks is astounding. Today, the FDIC reported that banks, helped  by a massive tax cut, earned record profits in the first quarter of  this year, as they have over the past 3 years as well.   Time after time, Republicans put Wall Street and the rich first and  families last. The American people deserve a Congress that looks out  for them, not one that sells out and leaves them high and dry.   This is a raw deal for the American people. Americans deserve a  better deal, better jobs, better wages, and better futures. Democrats  are fighting to put that economic power back.   Who has the leverage? Put the leverage back in the hands of America's  great middle class, America's working families.   So just remember what they were willing to do leading up to 2008.  They have forgotten, or maybe they don't care, but they want to take us  right back down that path one piece of legislation at a time.   If I know Mr. Hensarling, there is probably more to come, because I  understand he doesn't think this bill goes far enough in the wrong  direction, and he probably wants more.   But whatever that is, today is the judgment we have to make about  this bill that our commitment--and by the way, some of the things they  want to roll back are very harmful to our veterans as well, and they  wanted me to be sure to make that point with you, in addition to all of  the other concerns.   It is a threat to our financial system: $250 billion, I think that  number is too large; the exploitation of the custody banks that some of  the banks already told me they were going to try to pass themselves off  as; the discrimination in lending that is in the bill; the lack of  revealing the information, which is so central to knowing what the  facts are.   Mr. Speaker, for these and so many other reasons, I urge a ``no''  vote.
