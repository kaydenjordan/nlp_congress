 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity.   I am not on the Rules Committee or the Ways and Means Committee, but  I am on the Agriculture Committee. I think it is extremely important to  recognize what Feeding America has expressed about this package.   Feeding America has concluded that H.R. 1 will undermine efforts to  assist those who struggle with adequate access to food. I strongly  oppose that in a day and age where there is so much poverty and so much  hunger across this country.   We need to face up to the fact that we should oppose this because it  goes in the wrong direction.   But let's be clear. The people who this bill will affect, too often,  do not have a voice. I am here to be their voice. Enough is enough.  This horrible bill needs to be stopped, and it needs to be stopped now.
