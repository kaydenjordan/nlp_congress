 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 600, I call up  the bill (H.R. 849) to repeal the provisions of the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act providing for the Independent Payment Advisory  Board, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne). Pursuant to House Resolution  600, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the  Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, shall be considered  as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                  H.R. 849         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors Access to       Medicare Act''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL OF THE INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD.         Effective as of the enactment of the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), sections 3403 and       10320 of such Act (including the amendments made by such       sections) are repealed, and any provision of law amended by       such sections is hereby restored as if such sections had not       been enacted into law.   [[Page H8414]]     The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour,  equally divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), and  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 15 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on the bill into the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Minnesota?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on the bill into the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Minnesota?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access  to Medicare Act. This discussion is not new. Republicans and Democrats  came together to pass this same bill back in 2015. This year there is,  once again, strong bipartisan support with 45 Democratic Members and  225 Republican cosponsors. It passed out of the Ways and Means  Committee last month with bipartisan support, too.   This bill will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or  IPAB, created in ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. The IPAB puts 15  unelected bureaucrats in charge of Medicare spending with significant  unilateral powers to slash payments to providers, forcing them to stop  seeing Medicare patients without any accountability, judicial review,  or transparency.   The board's unprecedented authority to alter Medicare policy could  ultimately reduce seniors' access to healthcare and put the government,  rather than the patient, at the center of the healthcare system.   Putting Medicare on a sustainable financial footing is a top priority  for all of us here in Congress, but passing the buck to a handful of  unaccountable bureaucrats is not the right approach.   Last year, the Medicare Trustees Report stated that this was to be  the year that the IPAB's authority to make cuts would be triggered.  Fortunately, this year's Medicare Trustees Report has given us slightly  more time, but next year, they can come back and move that date up once  again. This is a cloud that will hang over providers and beneficiaries,  unless we act and pass this bill today.   Now some have stated that this bill does not solve any immediate  problem, and they have questioned the need to act on the bill today. I  believe that our seniors and our healthcare providers are a priority.  Why should we kick the can down the road when we can stop this today?   There are letters of support from over 700 bipartisan groups  representing patients, employers, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other  healthcare professionals all voicing strong support for IPAB repeal.   They believe that the threat of this board is enough to warrant  repeal and to place the decisionmaking back in the hands of elected  Members of Congress, and I agree.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and let me just start by saying that some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have called on us to work with them over and over  again to find common ground, to make fixes in the flaws in ObamaCare.                                time  1600    Today we have an opportunity to do exactly that. We should all be  joining together. There is bipartisan support on this bill to eliminate  this unnecessary and potentially very destructive body, one that I  would define as a major flaw in the law. This is the exact process that  we have been asking for--you have been asking for.   The bill has been through regular order. We have had countless  hearings on this topic. We have actually voted not once, but twice, in  past Congresses to repeal the IPAB to keep it from harming access to  seniors' care.   So today we are bringing this bill forward--this legislation  forward--as a stand-alone provision, not tied to any other policies, to  once and for all allow Members to say whether they support or oppose  this unaccountable board.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Roe), who has been a tireless champion for seniors in Tennessee and,  since day one, has been working on this legislation to repeal the IPAB.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), who has been a tireless advocate working on  Medicare issues as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), a member of our leadership team.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen), who is an original cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  supported this bill in the Ways and Means Committee in regular order  last month and in a prior vote, I will add, back in 2015.   Rather than take control away from the American people and from our  seniors, we should be expanding choice, expanding access, and expanding  flexibility and competition in Medicare, and we can start that right  now, today, by passing this legislation to terminate the IPAB once and  for all.   Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also called on  us to work with them to find common ground, to work with them to fix  those flaws in the Affordable Care Act. Well, today, with this vote, we  have the opportunity to do just that, to join together to eliminate  this unnecessary  [[Page H8417]]  and potentially destructive provision--certainly, it is a major flaw in  the law--and pass this bipartisan legislation.   Repealing IPAB is crucial to maintaining and expanding access to  high-quality care for our Nation's seniors and ensuring that Medicare  payment policy is not dictated to us and our constituents by a board of  unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Roe and I want to thank Dr. Ruiz on  the other side of the aisle for their leadership on this bill, along  with the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committee members.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of  H.R. 849, and I yield back the balance of my time.
