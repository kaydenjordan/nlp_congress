 Mr. President, this week, the Senate may see an  extreme example of how the minority can abuse its rights in a way that  provokes the majority into an excessive use of its power. I come to the  floor to offer my Democratic colleagues a way to avoid both mistakes.   Here is the abuse of minority rights: More than a year ago, President  Trump nominated John Ryder of Memphis to serve on the board of  directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority based on the recommendation  that Senator Bob Corker and I made. Finally, this week, the Senate is  likely to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination.   You might say: Well, there must really be something wrong with Mr.  Ryder.   Well, if there is, then all the people who are supposed to find out  what is wrong with Mr. Ryder have not found it out. Senator Corker and  I know him very well as one of Tennessee's finest  [[Page S1428]]  attorneys. Senator Blackburn agrees. After a hearing at which Mr. Ryder  answered questions, Republican and Democratic members of the  Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved his  nomination. No, there is no problem with Mr. Ryder.   You might say: This must be a position of overwhelming complexity and  importance that requires a year for all of us to think about it.   TVA is the Nation's largest public utility, and it is important to  the millions of us in the seven-State region for whom it provides  electricity. But this is not a lifetime appointment. It is not a  Cabinet position. It is not even a full-time position. This is one of  nine part-time board positions whose nominees are usually approved in  the Senate by a voice vote.   The problem is not with Mr. Ryder. It is not because of the unusual  importance of the position. The problem is with the determination of  the Democratic minority to make it nearly impossible for President  Trump to fill the 1,200 Federal Government positions that require  confirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional duty to  provide advice and consent.   This is where we are: Democrats have objected to the majority  leader's request to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination. As I mentioned,  these are nominations normally approved by a voice vote. So in order to  have a vote, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has filed a  cloture petition to cut off debate on Mr. Ryder's nomination.   The cloture process takes at least 3 days. Here is how it works: The  first day, you file cloture. That is what Senator McConnell did. The  second day is a so-called intervening day when no action can be taken,  so nothing is happening. On the third day, the Senate votes to invoke  cloture, and then there is up to 30 more hours for postcloture debate  before the Senate can finally vote on whether to confirm Mr. Ryder.   Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder is not the only victim of such  obstructionism. During the last 2 years, Democrats have done what I  just described 128 times. One hundred and twenty-eight times they have  required the majority leader to consume up to 3 days to force a vote on  a Presidential nominee. By comparison, requiring a cloture vote to  advance a nomination happened 12 times during the first 2 years of  President Obama's term, compared to President Trump's 128 times; 4  times during the first 2 years of George W. Bush's term, compared to  President Trump's 128 times; 12 times during Bill Clinton's first 2  years, compared to President Trump's 128 times. Not once during George  H. W. Bush's first 2 years in office was it necessary for the majority  leader to file cloture to cut off debate to advance a Presidential  nomination--not once--but it had to be done 128 times in the first 2  years of President Trump's time.   This unnecessary obstruction has to change. The result of this  extraordinary delay in considering nominees creates a government filled  with acting appointees who, never having gone through the Senate  confirmation process, are less accountable to Congress and therefore  less accountable to the American people. So at a time when many  complain that the Executive has become too powerful, the Senate is  deliberately making itself weaker by diminishing our constitutional  duty to advise and consent to individuals nominated to fill important  positions--perhaps the Senate's best known role.   This abuse of power by the minority is about to produce an excessive  reaction by the majority--something that I think at least nine  Democratic Senators who can see 2 years ahead would want to avoid. At  least nine Democratic Senators hope to be the next President of the  United States. Do they not know that some Republicans will do to the  next Democratic President's nominees what Democrats have done to  President Trump's nominees? Let me ask that again. Do the nine  Democratic Senators who want to be the next President of the United  States--that election is about 20 months away--not know that if they  are elected, some Republicans will do to them what Democrats have done  to President Trump's nominees?   The Senate is a body of precedent. What goes around comes around. All  it takes will be one Republican Senator objecting to a unanimous  consent request to make it difficult for the next Democratic President  to form a government, and this will continue the diminishment of the  U.S. Senate.   Can Republican Senators, by majority vote, change Senate rules to  stop this obstruction? Yes, we can, and we will, if necessary. There  are several ways to change the rules of the Senate. We can amend the  standing rules of the Senate. We can adopt a standing order. We can  pass a law. We can set a new precedent. We can change the rules by  unanimous consent. All of these are rules of the Senate.   The written rules of the Senate say it requires 67 votes to amend a  standing rule and 60 votes to amend a standing order. There is recent  precedent to change the Senate rules by a majority vote.   In 2013, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, used a procedural  maneuver--let's call it the Harry Reid precedent--that allowed the  Democratic Senate majority to overrule the Chair and say, in effect,  that a written Senate rule does not mean what its words say.   Now, this is as if a referee in a football game were to say the  following: The rule book says that a first down is 10 yards, but I am  the referee, and I am ruling that a first down is 9 yards.   Well, that is what happened in 2013. So, in 2017, what goes around  comes around. The Republican majority followed this Harry Reid  precedent in order to make cloture on all nominations a majority vote,  and now Republicans are on the verge again of following the Harry Reid  precedent.   Should Republicans do this, change a rule by majority vote, even  though our written rules say it should be done by 60 or 67 votes? The  answer is, no, we shouldn't, not if we can avoid it.   As Senator Carl Levin said in 2013, when he opposed the Harry Reid  precedent--Senator Levin is a Democrat, and he said: A Senate in which  a majority can change its rule at any time is a Senate without any  rules.   Thomas Jefferson, who wrote our first rules, said: It didn't make  much difference what the rules are. It just matters that there are some  rules.   So it is at least awkward for Members of the country's chief rule- writing body, the U.S. Senate, to expect Americans to follow the rules  we write for them when we don't follow our own written rules.   I have heard many Democrats privately say to me, they express their  regret that they ever established the Harry Reid precedent in 2013.  They didn't look ahead and see that what goes around comes around and  that this is a body of precedent.   So what would be the right thing for us to do--something that avoided  both the minority's abuse of its rights and the majority's excessive  response. We should do what the Senate did in 2011, in 2012, and in  2013, when Republicans and Democrats worked together to make it easier  for President Obama and his successors to gain confirmation of  Presidential nominees.   As a Republican Senator, I spent dozens of hours on this bipartisan  project to make it easier for a Democratic President with a Democratic  Senate majority to form a government. I thought that was the right  thing to do, and we changed the rules in the right way.   The Senate passed standing orders with bipartisan support and a new  law, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act,  which eliminated confirmation for several positions. That bipartisan  working group of Senators accomplished a lot in 2011, 2012, and 2013.   We eliminated secret holds. After over 25 years of bipartisan effort,  led by Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, we eliminated delays caused  by the reading of amendments. We eliminated Senate confirmation of 163  major positions.   Now, remember what we were doing was working in a bipartisan way to  try to make it easier for President Obama and a Democratic majority in  the Senate to confirm the 1,200 Presidential nominees that every  President has to send over here for advice and consent. We did it for  President Obama. We intended to do it for his successors as well.   We eliminated 3,163 minor career positions. We made 272 positions so- called privileged nominations, which means these nominations can move  faster through the Senate. We sped up motions to proceed to  legislation. We made it easier to go to conference. We  [[Page S1429]]  limited postcloture debate on sub-Cabinet positions to 8 hours and on  Federal district judges to 2 hours for the 113th Congress. All of these  changes took effect immediately over these 60 days.   Let me underscore what I am about to say. Republicans did not insist,  in 2011, 2012, and 2013, when Barack Obama was President, that these  new rules should be delayed until after the next Presidential election  when there might be a Republican President. Republicans supported these  changes for the benefit of this institution, even though they would  immediately benefit a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate  majority.   I propose that we do that again. I invite my Democratic colleagues to  join me in demonstrating the same sort of bipartisan respect for the  Senate as an institution that Senators Reid and McConnell--the two  Senate leaders at that time--Senators Schumer, Barrasso, Levin, McCain,  Kyl, Cardin, Collins, Lieberman, and I did in 2011, 2012, and 2013,  when we worked to change the Senate rules the right way.   Now, 2 weeks ago, the Rules Committee gave us an opportunity to do  things again in the right way by reporting to the Senate a resolution  by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Rules  Committee. This resolution, which is similar to the standing order that  78 Senators voted for on January 14, 2013, would reduce postcloture  debate time for nominations. Remember, that is after day one, the  majority leader files cloture; day two, nothing happens; day three, we  have a vote on cloture that is by 51 votes, and we would reduce the  time for debate on day three. District judges would be debated for 2  hours, the same as the 2013 standing order that 78 Senators voted for.  Other sub-Cabinet positions would be subject to 2 hours of postcloture  debate as well.   The proposal offered by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt would not  reduce the postcloture debate time for Supreme Court Justices, for  Cabinet members, for circuit court or certain Board nominations, like  the National Labor Relations Board, but would divide the 30 hours of  postcloture debate equally between Republicans and Democrats.   The Lankford-Blunt proposal would put the Senate back where it has  historically been on nominations. With rare exceptions, Senate  nominations have always been decided by majority vote. Let me say that  again. With rare exceptions, Senate nominations have always been  decided by majority vote.   President Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court was the only example of a Supreme Court nominee who was  blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.   There has never been, in the history of the Senate, a Cabinet nominee  who was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes. There has never been,  in the history of the Senate, a Federal district judge whose nomination  was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.   Since 1949, Senate rules have allowed one Senator to insist on a  cloture vote; that is, 60 votes, which requires more than a majority to  end debate. Even though it was allowed, it just wasn't done. Even the  vote on the acrimonious nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme  Court was decided by a majority vote of 52 to 48. Not one Senator tried  to block the nomination by requiring 60 votes on a cloture motion, even  though one Senator could have done that.   Only when Democrats began, in 2003, to block President George W.  Bush's nominees by insisting on a 60-vote cloture vote did that  tradition change. Then, in 2017, using the Harry Reid precedent,  Republicans restored the tradition of requiring a majority vote to  approve all Presidential nominees, which, as I have said, has been the  tradition throughout the history of the Senate.   Also, until recently, with rare exceptions, nominations have been  considered promptly. After all, there are 1,200 of them, and the Senate  has other things to do besides just being in the personnel business.   For example, last month, I was in Memphis for the investiture of Mark  Norris, whose nomination languished for 10 months on the Senate  calendar. The evening before, I had dinner with 94-year-old Harry W.  Wellford. In November of 1970, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee had  recommended Harry Wellford to serve as a district court judge on the  same court where Mark Norris now serves.   By December 11, 1970, 1 month later, President Nixon had nominated  Harry Wellford, and the Senate had confirmed him. All this happened in  1 month. Not all nominations have moved that fast. In 1991, a  Democratic Senator, using a secret hold, blocked President George H. W.  Bush's nomination of me as U.S. Education Secretary. I waited on the  calendar for 6 weeks. Those 6 weeks seemed like an awfully long time to  me, and that was for a Cabinet position. It was not 10 months for a  part-time position for the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Two weeks ago, I voted to report Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt's  resolution to the full Senate, even though no Democrat voted for it. I  will vote for it again on the floor, even if no Democrat will join us.  I will also join my fellow Republicans, if we are forced to change the  rules by majority vote. I do not like the Harry Reid precedent, but I  like even less the debasement of the Senate's constitutional power to  provide advice and consent to 1,200 Presidential nominees.   My preference is to adopt the Lankford-Blunt resolution, which is  very similar to the 2013 resolution that 78 Senators voted for, and to  do it in a bipartisan way, according to the written Senate rules as we  did in 2013.   I believe most Democrats privately agree that the resolution offered  by Senators Lankford and Blunt is reasonable, and they will be grateful  that it is in place when there is a Democratic majority and one  Republican Senator can block a Democratic President's nominees.   The only objection Democrats seem to have to the Lankford-Blunt  resolution is that it would apply to President Trump. Their other major  objection, which is truly puzzling, is that the proposed change is  permanent, and the change we made in 2013 was temporary. Well, I wonder  if Democrats would like it better if we made this change in the Senate  temporary, only applying to the remainder of President Trump's term.   This is my invitation to my Democratic colleagues. Join me and  Senators Lankford and Blunt in supporting their resolution, or  modifying it if you believe there is a way to improve it, and working  in a bipartisan way, exactly as we did in 2011, 2012, and 2013.   A year or so ago, one of the Supreme Court Justices was asked: How do  you Justices get along so well when you have such different opinions?  This Justice's reply was this: We try to remember that the institution  is more important than any of our opinions.   We Senators would do well to emulate the Supreme Court Justices in  respecting and strengthening this institution in which we are  privileged to serve. One way to do that is to join together to restore  the prompt consideration of any President's 1,200 nominees and do it in  a bipartisan way that shows the American people our written rules mean  what they say.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    There appears to be no one on the floor who wants to  speak. I could go another 4 or 5 hours if the Senate would like to stay  in session.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes  its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday, February 26;  further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired and the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the Miller nomination; further,  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings; finally, that all time during recess,  adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks count postcloture on  the Miller nomination.   Is there objection?    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 7:46 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday,  February 26, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
