 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor an important voice of Tybee Island, Georgia. Michael, or Mike,  Scarbrough passed away on March 4.   He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but eventually moved to Norcross,  Georgia, where he became vice president of Marathon Construction.   Mike later moved to Tybee Island in 1992, where he and his lovely  wife, Iris, became owners of Lazaretto Creek Marina. There, they  created Captain Mike's Dolphin Tours.   Captain Mike's Dolphin Tours was voted the best adventure tour on  Tybee Island for 9 straight years, and it was all thanks to Mike's  tireless contributions and engaging persona.   Mike was an active member of the Tybee Island Republican Club, Tybee  Island American Legion, and the Alee Temple Shriners.   I am thankful for his wonderful contributions to Tybee Island for the  last few decades.   My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
