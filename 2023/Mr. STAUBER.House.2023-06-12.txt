 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the dedication to  service and what it means to be a true public servant by recognizing my  constituent services director and service academy coordinator, Margaret  Cavanaugh.   For nearly three decades, Margaret has served thousands of  Minnesota's citizens, having worked for three different Members of  Congress from the great State of Minnesota.   It is devoted staff like Margaret who work behind the scenes solving  difficult issues for individuals back home, that so many people receive  the help they need from their Federal Government.   Public servants like Margaret are seldom recognized for their  persistent efforts yet are crucial to the deployment of many Federal  programs such as VA and disability benefits, Medicare, Medicaid,  passport issues, and all too often, the IRS and refunds.   Dedicated caseworkers like Margaret are often a godsend to so many  constituents who are often overwhelmed or far too often ignored by our  massive bureaucracies right here in Washington.   Margaret is up there with the best of them, mentoring other  caseworkers in the State and region with advice, contacts, and problem- solving techniques.   I thank Margaret for all she does for the people of the great State  of Minnesota. With people like her, our constituents get the best  assistance, and they deserve it. Once again, I thank Margaret.                            ____________________
