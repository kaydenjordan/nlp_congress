 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  Thornton Fire Department in Thornton, Colorado, for earning the 2021  Congressional Fire Services Institute's Masimo Excellence in Fire  Service-Based EMS Award, which is given annually to the top fire  department in the country.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Thornton Fire Department has  gone above and beyond to serve their community. As part of their  efforts, they created a Pandemic Response Team that has conducted over  20,000 COVID tests for public employees, senior citizens, first  responders, and other community members. When vaccines became  available, the Pandemic Response Team expanded their services to  administer over 80,000 vaccinations at drive-through sites for city  employees and other community members.   The Pandemic Response Team's success led other fire agencies around  the country to look to Thornton as a model for how to effectively  respond to the challenges of COVID-19.   In a very difficult year for fire and emergency services, the  Thornton Fire Department's innovative approach to a rapidly changing  public health crisis is something we should all thank them for and  model.                            ____________________
