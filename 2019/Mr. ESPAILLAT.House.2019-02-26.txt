 Mr. Speaker, less than 2 weeks ago, after a failed  attempt to establish consensus on border security funding, President  Trump, a self-proclaimed master negotiator, failed to get a border wall  that he originally said Mexico will pay for, so then he fraudulently  invoked a national emergency declaration to rob taxpayers of funds from  other programs.   The President's brazen decision not only violates Congress'  constitutional powers of the purse laid out in Article I, Section 9,  Clause 7, it is also a fabricated emergency propped up by fake  statistics, racist undertones, and the blatant hypocrisy of a party  that had complete control of Washington for 2 years and didn't see fit  to fund this useless, medieval wall themselves.   By diverting funds from military projects, the President has  determined that national security takes a backseat to his political  priorities. Today, in the  [[Page H2134]]  Senate, the head of the U.S. Northern Command said that border crossers  do not pose a military threat.   Mr. Speaker, there is no emergency.
