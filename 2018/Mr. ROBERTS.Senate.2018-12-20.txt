 Madam President, I thank Senator Nelson for that  touching story.   That would be a Christmas present for not only you but for anybody  who has heard the circumstances.   I, too, remember having the privilege of being in public service with  President Reagan. He had a human quality that was second to none.   I thank you, Bill, for your service--we used to be on Armed Services  together, fighting the battles--but more especially for being a friend.  You always had a smile on your face. I probably didn't when we got on  the elevators together.   You would say: Pat, what is wrong?   I wouldn't want to go into anything, but I would think, why am I so  glum if Bill Nelson is stuck on ``happy'' all the time?   It was the Florida sunshine, I guess.   I thank you for the privilege of being in public service with you,  sir. Best wishes for your future, which I know will be very good and  very bright, and thank you for that story, which is a great Christmas  story. Repeat it often, sir. Thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to join my colleagues who, over  the past few weeks, have come to the floor to thank Senator Orrin  Hatch--the great Senator Orrin Hatch--for his service to this  institution. Senator Sullivan just informed me that the body here--the  Senate--has, by unanimous consent, passed a bill to name a courthouse  in Utah after Orrin Hatch. He was sitting as the President pro tempore,  and the surprised look on his face was a treasure for everybody who saw  it.   Orrin Hatch has consistently maintained a demeanor that represented  the Senate well--and that is an understatement--over the course of his  illustrious and record-setting 42-year career. As a matter of fact, I  think the definition of ``gentleman'' in the new edition of Webster's  dictionary simply lists two words: ``Orrin Hatch.''   Whether he agreed or disagreed with any policy positions or with any  individual Senator, he always, always treated you with the greatest of  respect. Perhaps that is part of the reason that Senator Hatch will go  down as one of the most effective legislators in the history of the  Senate. All you have to do is go in his office and see all of the  awards, the recordings that illustrate his fantastic music career as a  songwriter, and all of the bills. I think it is safe to say that no  other living Senator has had more bills that he has sponsored and that  have been enacted into law than Orrin Hatch. We come here to make a  difference. We do that through legislation, and that is an indication  of the great legacy that this man has left this body.  [[Page S7965]]    Not many people have the wherewithal, the stature, and bona fides to  have Members from both parties sing their praises. That has happened,  of course, on this floor, and that is what Orrin stands for. Orrin will  be sorely missed--and I mean sorely missed.   Senator Hatch is not most people. Simply put, the institution he  loves will not be the same without him.   Since coming from the House to the Senate, I have had the privilege  of knowing Orrin up close and personal. Our offices are right next to  each other. I bump into his security detail every morning and say good  morning. I feel very safe about that. Then when we have votes, and just  about the time he leaves his office and is accompanied by his security  detail, he always asks me: Why don't you ride with me? So I have joined  his security detail. Every security detail should have a marine. I tell  him that I will be in the back to protect his back if anything would  happen; obviously, nothing did. But the Senator from Utah should know  that I still have his back, and I will always have his back.   I think the measure of a man, with regard to his long hours in the  Senate, is hard to measure until you work with him--and I am talking  about Orrin, of course--but work with him with regard to legislation.  We are talking about the Finance Committee, and we are talking about  the tough legislation that we always have. We would always go to the  conference room--those who are privileged to serve on the Finance  Committee--and we would walk in, and there would be fruit juice and  there would be vitamins and there would be goodies to eat--goodies, of  course, that are good for you, as determined by the Senator.   He had that very soft voice, and he would bring people to order. It  was a very respectful situation in which we were trying to put together  a bill to see if we could move it and work with our colleagues across  the aisle. He had such a soft voice that, on occasion, I found that it  was best to sit in the back of that conference room and look right at  him, so I could tell precisely what he was saying because he never used  his voice in a way that was high pitched; it was very calm and  reasoned. That was his demeanor. He acted like a Hollywood version of a  Senator.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act probably would not have come to pass  without the leadership of Orrin Hatch. Boy, was that an effort. We went  through the trials and tribulations of tough arguments on both sides.  But we always kept in the committee, with him at the helm, a posture of  at least trying to work together. We faced some tough issues. At the  end of it, there were quite a few amendments. We worked late into the  night. The amendments were not going to pass on a partisan vote. That  is very unusual for Orrin. He kept his cool. He kept his demeanor.   Finally, at the end, it became an impossible situation in which we  were just going to get into a shouting contest, and he maintained  order. When he maintained order, he really maintained order. Usually he  didn't have to do that.   My first boss in public service, acting as the chief of staff, was  Senator Frank Carlson. He was a great man. He helped found the National  Prayer Breakfast here, and in many other Agencies, all throughout the  government, that spread. He worked with Billy Graham, somebody named  Dwight David Eisenhower, and Conrad Hilton--those four, including Frank  Carlson, started the Prayer Breakfast.   The Senator always told me there are no self-made men or women in  public service. It is your friends who make you what you are, and if  there were ever a person you could put in that category in the Senate,  it is Orrin Hatch. He is a person who would stand behind you when you  were taking praise and beside you if you were taking some boos, but  Orrin Hatch never had to do that because in working with him, the  chances were that you had a good chance of passing a bipartisan bill.   All of us stand with him with respect and out of friendship. We have  a cloth of comity here that is not seen, but it has been observed at  least in my 22 years here in the Senate, perhaps a little more than in  the rowdy House, of which I was a Member for 16 years, and then 12  before that as a chief of staff. I am sort of like a piece of furniture  here, as some would say, with a marble top. But I have seen a lot.   I am very worried about the comity of the Senate. If you pull at  those threads, as we have been doing with issues where we should come  together, even though there are very tough questions, I worry that we  could get into sort of a situation like in Dodge City at the Long  Branch Saloon and somebody having a rowdy time there. That should not  be the Senate, and it should not be a situation where we pull at those  threads of comity to the extent that we won't have any left, and then  it is just a shouting contest.   The exception to the rule was the Farm Bill, which the President is  going to sign this afternoon. I had the privilege of leading that  effort, along with Senator Deborah Stabenow from Michigan.   I had some reporters in the other day, and they said: How did you get  along with Debbie Stabenow?   I said: Well, No. 1, we trust each other; No. 2, we are friends; and  No. 3, it isn't our first rodeo. We just worked with each other to get  it done. We got 87 votes.   That is precisely the example we followed from Orrin Hatch, who did  so much--produced legislation with Democrats that you would never think  would work with a Republican or vice versa. That is his legacy. That is  the man I have been privileged to know as a friend.   There is a video out about Orrin Hatch. He has boxing gloves on,  bright blue. There he is--just a couple of days ago when they took the  video--willing to throw a few punches, trying to eat bacon with his  boxing gloves on. It is a hilarious tribute to him, big smiles on  everybody's faces. A tough guy, but not tough to deal with, he always  had a way of working things out.   It is a privilege to know Orrin Hatch. Not many people at my age call  me ``Boy,'' but he always would come out that back door and offer a  ride, and he would say: Boy, do you want to come along?   I said: Yes, sir.   It has been quite a privilege.   I yield the floor.
