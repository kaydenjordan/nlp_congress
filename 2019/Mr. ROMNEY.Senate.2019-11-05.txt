 Mr. President, I wish to congratulate MG Jeff Burton, a  man of remarkable achievement and character, on a career dedicated to  public service. After 7 years of serving as the adjutant general of the  Utah National Guard, Major General Burton leaves behind a distinguished  legacy.   The Utah National Guard provides military forces that are ready to  assist both State and Federal authorities in times of emergency and in  times of war. It is comprised of 7,300 soldiers and airmen from the  Utah Army National Guard and the Utah Air National Guard.   As adjutant general, Major General Burton oversaw the training and  military preparation of soldiers and airmen throughout the State. He is  a principled and dedicated leader who has set a high standard of  conduct for the men and women under his command.   Major General Burton and his wife, Charn, have always cared for and  supported Guard members and their families, particularly in the tragic  times of loss. Their devotion to the servicemen and servicewomen of  Utah cannot be overstated.   Major General Burton's life of service extends beyond his time as  adjutant general. He was an assistant professor at both Brigham Young  University and Utah Valley University, where he taught military  science.   He was awarded the Bronze Star for his exceptionally meritorious  service as the commander of the 1457th Engineer Combat Battalion during  Operation Iraqi Freedom, during which his unit played a significant  role in the initial ground war. Under his leadership, his unit also  helped to rebuild the country after its having been devastated by  conflict.   Our great State of Utah owes Major General Burton a debt of gratitude  for his decades of service. We wish the honorable general all the best  in his next chapter.   Thank you, Major General Burton, for your service to our State and to  our Nation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
