 Mr. President, first I want to thank my good friend and  colleague from Pennsylvania who serves with great distinction with me  on the Agriculture Committee. I love that he is speaking about our  farmers. In a few minutes, I am going to talk about Sonya, who is a  blueberry farmer and small business owner from Michigan. We know there  are so many small business owners and farmers who finally have been  able to find affordable health care because of what was passed in the  health care reform act.   I want to thank Senator Casey for being such a strong advocate for  those dairy farmers. We have a few dairy farmers in Michigan, as well,  and we appreciate very much his advocacy.   I want to take a step back and look broadly for a moment at what is  really happening here and why we are so concerned and why we have spent  all of this evening and are going on into the night to talk on behalf  of the people we represent on the impact of what repealing the  Affordable Care Act without having a replacement that is as good or  better in place at the time would really mean for people.   Republicans get sick. Democrats get sick. Independents get sick.  People who don't vote get sick. This is not a partisan issue. This is  about one of the most basic human needs, most basic things that we care  about for our families. People go to bed at night and say: Please God,  don't let the kids get sick. Make sure Mom is OK, Dad is OK.   Because of the Affordable Care Act, because of the increases in  access to affordable health care that we were able to pass a number of  years ago, fewer people are having to worry. There are still people  worrying, and there are still issues. There are still costs, and there  are still things to do. I am anxious to get about the business--all  Democrats are anxious to get about the business of making sure that  health care is more affordable and doing more to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs. I am also concerned about small businesses. There  are things that we can do together, that we should be doing on a  bipartisan basis, but we shouldn't be repealing health care and  unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire system  instead of focusing on how we make health care better for families.   The bottom line of what is being proposed--and what this budget  resolution is really all about--is going to make America sick again.  That is the bottom line. We are going to create a situation where more  Americans will be sick and not be able to see a doctor, not be able to  find affordable insurance, or not be able to have the protections that  they currently have under what we like to call the Patient's Bill of  Rights--the patient protections for everybody. Seventy-five percent of  Americans get their health insurance through their employer, and every  one of them--all of us--have benefited from changes in health care that  have taken total control out of the hands of insurance companies and  given us more assurances that if we get sick, we are not going to get  dropped. If we have an illness or our child has juvenile diabetes or  cancer or Alzheimer's or leukemia or high blood pressure or if you are  a woman of child-bearing age, which is viewed as a preexisting  condition so you have higher rates--all of those things were changed in  the interest of the American people.   Basically, when we look at it, there are four different areas where  health care reform has made a difference in people's lives and what we  are fighting for tonight. We are fighting for these things. We are  fighting to have them not taken away and to have the system not ripped  up and not create a situation where we cause incredible harm by what  Republican colleagues are talking about doing.   The first general category is putting insurance companies back in  charge by repealing the patient protections. That is what is being  talked about: keeping young people, your son or your daughter, on your  insurance until age 26. They graduate from college; they probably  already have mounds of debt. Letting them get started in the workplace  and stay on your insurance has made an incredible difference for  hundreds of thousands of young people across the country. That is gone.   Guaranteed access to essential health benefits. I did fight very hard  so that we had a benefit package that includes simple things, important  things for women, like maternity care. Prior to health care reform,  about 70 percent of the insurance policies that were available in the  private market--if a woman were to go out and try to find insurance,  about 70 percent didn't provide basic maternity care. Now all the  policies have to provide maternity care. Policies have to include  mental health and addiction services like physical health, so we are  saying that if you have an illness above the neck, it ought to be  treated the same as an illness below the neck. These are patient  protections for all of us.   In health care today, you can't have your services capped. I have  seen and spoken with so many doctors who treat cancer in children and  adults. Families talk about the fact that in the past there would be a  financial cap or a number of visits or a number of treatments as a  limit, and if you were done with your treatment and your doctor didn't  feel that you received enough treatments, too bad. Your yearly cap is  up or the lifetime cap is up. Right now, that is gone. But with the  repeal, those caps come back.    Preventive services with no copay. We want folks getting a wellness  visit, getting a mammogram, being able to get contraceptive coverage,  being able to get preventive cancer screenings. Doing that without a  copay has made a tremendous difference in people being able to get the  preventive care they need.   There are so many other things that have been put in place for  everyone who has insurance. All of that gets ripped away with repeal,  and there is no excuse for that. There is no way we are going to allow  that to happen without continuing to fight as hard as we can. It is  outrageous.   The second thing is cutting Medicare and Medicaid. All of the health  care system is tied together. When we made changes in Medicare, we  lengthened the solvency of the trust fund--12 more years of solvency in  the trust fund, 12 more years of making sure it is solid, financially  viable. That goes away.   My colleagues have talked about prescription drugs and the fact that  we have closed this gap in coverage. If you have high bills related to  the cost of medicine, right now you are covered. When you get to a  certain point and there is a complete gap in coverage and you are not  covered anymore, and then you are covered again--folks call that the  doughnut hole. We are closing that so there is no gap in coverage.   With repeal, the doughnut hole comes back. Coverage is lost. Costs  for medicine go up. Preventive services under Medicare are ripped away  if we see a repeal. And there is not a replacement that is put in place  that is equal  [[Page S168]]  to or better than what we currently have.   Medicaid. We have so many people who are working for minimum wage,  working really hard at minimum wage jobs, who never had the opportunity  to have health insurance before, and now they do. That is gone if the  whole system is ripped up. Most of Medicaid goes for seniors in nursing  homes, long-term care. If you look at the nominee for Secretary of  Health and Human Services, who has proposed completely rewriting,  ripping up Medicare as we know it, as well as health reform and the  Affordable Care Act--if you put all that together with this repeal and  somebody who wants dramatic changes--I believe it is $1 trillion in  cuts proposed by the current chairman of the Budget Committee or the  gentleman who now is being proposed for Secretary of Health and Human  Services--Medicare and Medicaid are seriously threatened by all that is  talked about right now.   We are talking about, in total, kicking 30 million Americans off  their insurance. In Michigan, all together, counting Medicaid and those  who are purchasing through the new insurance pools, it is over 2  million people. One out of five people in Michigan and their families  will lose their access to a doctor and medical care.   What does all of this mean? It means costs are going to go up both  for coverage and prescription drugs. And for Republican colleagues who  say: Well, we are going to repeal it now, but not really because we are  going to say it is repealed and then we are going to wait 2 or 3  years--first of all, Republicans have had 6 years of talking about  repeal. It has been over 50 times in the House of Representatives. You  would think within that time they would have been able to come up with  a plan, not a bunch of ideas but a plan to show that, in fact, these  things aren't going to happen; that they are not going to unravel the  health care system; that they have something bigger, better, greater,  but that is not what we are hearing. We are hearing: Well, we don't  have it yet; we don't know if we are going to have it. We will try to  figure it out somehow, and we will wait 2 or 3 years.   What happens in the insurance market when insurance companies don't  have predictability? Rates go up. What happens when hospitals--and I  have already been told this in Michigan--don't know what is coming? You  pull back. You pull back on investments. You pull back on what you are  doing in terms of coverage because you don't know what is coming.   This makes no sense whatsoever. I understand politics. I understand  slogans. I understand all the rhetoric that has been said for years  about repealing health care reform, but this is the most irresponsible  thing I have ever seen in my life if there is a repeal with no  replacement immediately that at least equals what people have today-- the protections, the coverage, the strengthening of Medicare, the  lowering of prescription drug prices under Medicare, the help for  people who work hard every day on minimum wage and are finding access  to a regular doctor instead of using the emergency room, which, by the  way, raises health care costs.   The truth is, we all are here because we care deeply about this. If  our colleagues want to stop this craziness of running the cow off the  cliff and decide that maybe we are going to work on just fixing it  together, we are ready, willing, and able to do that. We know, as with  any major change in form, that after they work a while, you have to  figure things out and you have to fix problems. We are more than  willing; we want to do that. We have been offering to do that and  suggesting that for the last several years. But this approach is  outrageous and completely irresponsible, and, in fact, it will make  America sick again.    Let me conclude by just sharing a couple of stories from constituents  in Michigan. I have heard from a lot of people, particularly small  business owners, people who have the freedom now to be able to leave  their job where they were working only because of the insurance. That  has happened to my own family and friends, where folks are in a job  that does not work for them but at least they have insurance.   The Affordable Care Act has given the flexibility for someone to step  away, to be able to start their own business or their own farm, like  Sonia who is a blueberry farmer in Michigan. She has written me,  indicating they are extremely fearful that they are going to lose their  insurance under the new administration because of what Republicans are  talking about.   She says:         A number of years back in 2000 I quit my traditional job       and my husband, who had been laid off, and I bought my step-      dad's blueberry farm. He had passed away in 1995, and we took       care of my mom who had inherited the farm, and lived with us       for a year and a half until her death. We are full-time       farmers, small farmers, about 15 acres of blueberries. We       also have a small garden center, Sweet Summer Gardens, which       is open from May to September, and a small bead store, the       Enchanted Bead. It is open year round.    She says:         We are hard-working people who love the life that we have       carved out for ourselves, but there some drawbacks to being       self-employed and small business owners. In 2012, I tore the       meniscus in my right knee. I did nothing to take care of it       because I did not have insurance. But then in April of 2015,       3 years after the injury, I finally got to the point where I       could no longer take the pain. Luckily, we had signed up for       insurance through the Affordable Care Act. I was able to have       the severe tear repaired.    Then she goes on to talk about how a little later there was a cancer  scare, and she had to go in for ultrasounds and lab work and an  outpatient D&C.   Because she was able to do that, she was fortunately able to find out  it was not cancer, thank goodness. Again, because of the Affordable  Care Act and her insurance, she was able to get the services she  needed. She goes on to talk about a number of different health  challenges for them, including the following:         Finally we have coverage for preventive care. My husband       had a physical, the first time since high school, and we       found out that there was an issue that needed to be       addressed. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon,       discovered he had severe arthritis. It was causing constant       pain. Again, we were able to have insurance coverage. Because       of the Affordable Care Act, he was able to have this       repaired.    She says:         We are hard-working people. We have never asked for help.       But we are extremely concerned because we could not afford       our insurance right now without the tax credits--the subsidy.    She says:         This morning, watching the news, we were met with a story       that the Republicans are all ready to repeal ObamaCare. They       said that while they couldn't take away the insurance, they       could take away the subsidies. This would put insurance out       of our range and we would no longer be able to afford it. My       husband Larry said to me, ``they couldn't just throw us out       to the dogs, could they?''    She says:         My reply was, ``anything is possible.''        I know the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. I know that       not everyone has taken advantage of it, but there has to be a       way to fix it without hurting the millions of people who have       been helped by it.    In fact, Sonia, there is a way to fix it without hurting you and your  husband, full-time farmers and small business owners. I have a number  of other stories. I am going to pause because I have other colleagues  who I know want to speak who care deeply about this as well. I will  share those at a later point.   Let me just say, what we are talking about is not a game. It is not.  This is about real people with real lives who are encountering  situations that could happen to any of us. Too many people are not in a  situation, without Medicare or Medicaid coverage or access to health  care through the exchanges, to be able to see the doctor and get the  care they need. That has changed in the last number of years.   There is more to do. We can work together to make it even better, but  the idea that people are not being helped today, that small business  owners and farmers and families are not getting medical care today  because of what was done is just not true. It is just not true. The  reality is, we are in a better spot with more to do. Pulling the thread  and unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire  system makes no sense.   So we as Democrats are going to do whatever we can. We know that  ultimately the votes are there. If the Republicans in the House and the  Senate and the new President want to completely dismantle the health  care system, unravel the health care system, weaken Medicare, and  weaken Medicaid, you can do it. You have the votes to do it.  [[Page S169]]    People right now who get care, the millions of people, the over 2  million people in Michigan alone who have been directly helped by the  Affordable Care Act, they know that. They will know when that is no  longer available to them. It will hurt many, many people. We hope  colleagues will take a second look and decide to work with us in a way  to move forward on health care that will allow people to get the care  they need at an affordable price for themselves and their families.   I know that is what we all want for our families. We should be doing  everything humanly possible to make sure people have the affordable  care they need and the protections they need to get care when they need  it.   I yield the floor.
