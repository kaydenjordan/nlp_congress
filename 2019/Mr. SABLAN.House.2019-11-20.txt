 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 737, the  Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act.   The act bans the buying and selling of shark fins in the United  States, and this widely supported bipartisan bill has gathered 287  cosponsors. A companion bill, S. 877, has been introduced in the Senate  as well.   Now, Mr. Speaker, this is the largest number of cosponsors for any  ocean conservation bill so far in this Congress, and I want to thank my  good friend and the distinguished Member from Texas, the Honorable    Michael McCaul who has worked tirelessly with me on the bill and brings  with him the support of 68 Members from his side of the aisle.   This bill has such strong support because it represents an effective  way to remove the United States from the devastating global trade in  shark fins at zero cost, and because it does so without stopping those  who want to fish for sharks and use them for their meat.   Mr. Speaker, sharks are absolutely critical to life in the ocean. As  apex predators, they help maintain balance by keeping prey populations  in check. They are also critical to the tourism economy off our coastal  communities.   In Florida alone, tourists who go diving to see sharks generate more  than 200 times the value of the trade in shark fins for our entire  country, 200 times the value.   Despite their importance ecologically and economically, sharks are in  serious trouble. Each year fins from up to 73 million sharks are sliced  off and sold in a global marketplace. And largely due to this demand  for fins, some shark species in the population have now declined by  more than 90 percent.   Our Nation has wisely banned the inhumane practice of finning sharks  and throwing them back into the ocean to drown and die, yet we still  allow fins to be bought and sold here. And many of the fins we are  buying and selling come from countries that simply do not have the same  level of protection the United States gives sharks.   Now is the time for us to take the next step. Only by banning the  shark fin trade once and for all within our borders can we ensure we  are no longer supporting an unsustainable use of ocean resources.  Recognizing this unsustainability, The Northern Mariana Islands, my  home, was the first U.S. insular area to ban the trade of shark fins in  2011.   As an island culture 3,000-plus years old, the people of the Marianas  understand and respect the important role that sharks play in  maintaining the life of our oceans. And we are not alone. Twelve U.S.  states and two territories have also passed their own shark fin bans.   But this patchwork of State laws can be challenging to enforce, and  so this is why we need a Federal ban on the shark fin trade in the  United States, and that is why I am asking for your support today.   A ban on the shark fin trade is supported by 45 domestic and  international airlines, by 21 shipping companies, seven major  corporations and more than 645 U.S. businesses and organizations.   A 2016 national poll found four of five Americans supported a  national ban on the buying and selling of shark fins. Hundreds of  scientists, chefs, fishers, dive, and surf businesses have written to  Congress requesting passage of a national shark fin ban.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House to act. Please join me by  voting ``yes'' on this critical bill. Vote ``yes'' to conserve our  oceans and the all-important sharks that live in those waters.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 925) to extend the authorization of appropriations for  allocation to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects under  the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through fiscal year 2024.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 295         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``North American Wetlands       Conservation Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 7(c) of the North American Wetlands Conservation       Act (16 U.S.C. 4406(c)) is amended by striking ``not to       exceed--'' and all that follows through paragraph (5) and       inserting ``not to exceed $60,000,000 for each of fiscal       years 2020 through 2024.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would reauthorize the North American Wetlands  Conservation Act, a partnership-based program that leverages non- Federal funds to protect and restore wetland and associated habitat.   NAWCA has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, and this bill is no  exception.   The bill authorizes NAWCA for 5 years at $60 million per year.   NAWCA is considered one of the most cost-effective conservation  programs. Each Federal dollar invested in NAWCA is typically matched by  more than $3 from non-Federal partners at the local and State level,  including corporations, private landowners, and nonprofits.   Thanks to NAWCA, almost 29.8 million acres of habitat have been  protected.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Representative  Thompson and Representative Wittman for their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and would inquire  whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on his side. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
