 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in the strongest support possible for this bill  to begin the process of establishing a memorial to honor the  servicemembers of our longest war.   5,799 days ago, on a crystal blue September morning, we came face to  face with an evil as old as time. Within days, our military was  engaged, and within weeks, we sustained our first  [[Page H6546]]  casualties. Our latest loss happened this very month.   They came from every walk of American life, from the North, the  South, the East, the West, every race, color, and creed, men and women.   The memorial authorized in this bill will allow the Nation to  remember not only those who did not come home, but also those with  life-changing injuries, visible and invisible, the incomprehensible and  too often unnoticed stress on the spouses and children of those  deployed, and the sacrifices of those who put their stateside lives on  hold to serve.   Mr. Speaker, amidst the divisions in our country today, we need this  memorial now more than ever, yes, to remember our fallen, but also to  bind us together as we reflect upon their sacrifice for the  transcendent ideals upon which this country was founded.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, the gentleman from  Arizona, and the gentleman from Massachusetts for their work on this  legislation and for their service to our country.    Mr. Speaker, the Senate's inability to pass healthcare  reform legislation does not change the fact that the Affordable Care  Act is failing. Many Americans may not have one insurance provider on  the exchange this fall.   Forty percent of counties in the country now only have one option on  the exchange. The ACA Medicaid expansion treats nonelderly, nondisabled  individuals living above the poverty line more favorably than the  elderly and disabled that this crucial program exists to protect.   Seven years ago, President Obama and congressional Democrats ran  through an ill-conceived and unsustainable healthcare law that was  grounded in make-believe and statements that were just not true. The  Supreme Court twisted an unconstitutional individual mandate penalty  into a dubiously constitutional tax, not only mocking our Constitution,  but facilitating an evasion of responsibility for representatives who  imposed an unpopular tax on the American people.   The legacy ObamaCare has been and will continue to be--lost plans,  lost doctors, and, as Chelsea Clinton reminded us last year, crushing  costs. Single payer is not to the option. Not one Senator voted for  single payer yesterday.   The solution to our healthcare problem is more freedom, more choice,  less Washington control. We must continue our efforts to save the  American people from this failing law, and continue our healthcare  reform efforts.                            ____________________
