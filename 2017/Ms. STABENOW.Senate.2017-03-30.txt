 Mr. President, just yesterday, the White House held a  forum on empowering women. Sean Spicer said the President made women's  empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, but earlier today, Vice  President Pence traveled to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote to  move ahead on a resolution to undermine women's access to preventive  healthcare. That doesn't sound like women's empowerment to me.   Title X was enacted in 1970. It passed the Senate unanimously at that  time and was signed into law by a Republican President. Title X is the  only Federal healthcare program dedicated solely to providing  comprehensive family planning and other related preventive healthcare  services so important to women, as well as preventive services for men.   Last year alone, 4 million women and men at 4,000 health centers all  across our country got basic care because of title X funding--critical  Pap tests to head off cases of cervical cancer, counseling to help  women plan for a healthy pregnancy, contraception, breast exams, HIV  testing, vaccinations. These services prevented 87,000 preterm or low  birth weight babies and 2,000 cases of cervical cancer. These health  services also save money. The taxpayer saves $7 for every $1 invested  in preventive healthcare.   For more than 2 million people, the title X funded clinic is their  only source of healthcare. This matters to small towns and rural  communities all across Michigan, as well as all across the country.  Title X funds clinics in three-fourths of all the counties in the  United States. In Michigan, you can benefit from the services in the  beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where I will be this weekend,  where funds support the health department in Iron County, or the  Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette--at the opposite end of the  State, down in the southeastern corner--where funds support the health  department in Monroe County.   So what are we voting on today? Plain and simple, this is an effort  to take away women's family planning and other healthcare services.  Right now, title X funds are awarded solely based on the provider's  ability to serve the patient, as it should be. Republicans want to  discriminate against certain family planning services, certain  providers, and reduce access to this care, frankly, based on politics  or their own personal beliefs.   The vote this afternoon is very simple: It is about basic healthcare  for women. A ``yes'' vote is a vote against women in Michigan and all  across our country. A ``yes'' vote will take away healthcare. A ``yes''  vote will take away healthcare for millions of Americans.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
