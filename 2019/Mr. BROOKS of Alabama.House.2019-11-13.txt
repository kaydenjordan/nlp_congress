 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  50th anniversary of Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University.   The school was originally established not long after the Civil War,  in 1873, by the legislature of the State of Alabama. Through the  tireless efforts of the first principal and president, William Hooper  Council, the Huntsville Normal School opened on May 1, 1875, with an  appropriation of $1,000 per year. It had 61 students and two  instructors.   In 1885, because of its success with industrial education, the  Alabama Legislature changed its name to the State Normal and Industrial  School in Huntsville.   In 1891, the name was again changed to the State Agricultural and  Industrial Institute for Negroes, and a new location was provided at  Normal, Alabama.   In 1969, the school became a fully accredited member of the Southern  Association of Colleges and Schools, and its name was changed to  Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, the name that it has  today.   In the 50 years since its university designation and establishment of  the foundation, Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University has  grown to encompass widely respected programs in engineering, computer  science, business, food sciences, agricultural and animal sciences, and  education, as well as Ph.D. programs in plant and soil science, food  science, physics, and reading.    Today, Alabama A&M University is comprised of over 70 buildings and  more than 1,000 acres, is home to more than 6,000 students, is a  designated Gold Military Friendly institution, and serves as a regional  State, national, and international resource, while maintaining its  mission of educating the underserved and uplifting the people of  Alabama, the Nation, and the world through its excellence in education.   On a more personal note, my mother, Betty Brooks, is a proud graduate  of Alabama A&M University, having received her master's degree there. I  thank Alabama A&M for helping her to successfully serve for a quarter  of a century as a Lee High School government and economics teacher.   In sum, I am, and all of the State of Alabama is, proud of Alabama  A&M University's accomplishments and wish Alabama A&M a happy 50th  anniversary as a fully accredited university.   Go Bulldogs.   May their future success in helping prepare, train, and educate our  youth be as great and productive as their past.                            ____________________
