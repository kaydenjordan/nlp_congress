 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Nadler for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, my call today is for full transparency, with a clear  focus on the sinister motives of Russia's corrupt leaders. Their  interference in our 2016 elections has created confusion, anger,  bewilderment, and division--exactly what Russia wanted.   Today's resolution calls for the Department of Justice to make  Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, along with any findings,  available to the public to the maximum extent permitted by the law and  to provide the report and its findings, in entirety, to the Congress of  the United States of America.   So whether you have used Special Counsel Mueller as a patriot  conducting a nonpartisan investigation into a foreign power's possible  influence in our elections or as a witch hunt, a full accounting and  public release of the findings is needed to heal our political  differences.   This is not about embarrassing President Trump. This is about closure  and full disclosure.   If there was no collusion, as the President has emphasized, then he  should want complete transparency. Mr. Speaker, the American people  deserve no less.
