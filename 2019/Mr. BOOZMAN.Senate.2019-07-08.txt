 Madam President, recently I met with members of the  American Legion of Arkansas during their annual convention. This year  they celebrated 100 years of helping veterans. I was honored to join  them on this occasion and share how proud we are of their efforts to  serve their fellow veterans.   Since its founding, Legionnaires have been leading advocates for  veterans and their families. They are committed to strengthening the  policies, programs, and institutions to support those who have worn our  Nation's uniform.   One of the ways they have been instrumental in achieving this is  bringing Legionnaires from across the country to Washington to share  the Legion's priorities with me and my colleagues. Members from  Arkansas expressed that one of the top issues for the Legion this  Congress, as has been the case for the past several years, is suicide  prevention.   The American Legion and other VSOs like the VFW, AMVETS, IAVA,  Wounded Warrior Project--and the list simply goes on and on--are  pressing for action to improve access and treatment for veterans who  are at risk of suicide. We all know there is room for improvement on  this front.   Congress has provided significant funding increases to the Department  of Veterans Affairs to decrease veteran suicide rates. In fiscal year  2010, the VA requested $62 million for suicide prevention outreach.  That number nearly quadrupled to $222 million within 10 years. Despite  the sharp increase in resources, sadly, 20 veterans commit suicide each  day. That number has, unfortunately, remained roughly unchanged  throughout the years. Tellingly and sadly, only 6 of those 20 veterans  are receiving healthcare services at the VA.   Veterans are particularly vulnerable to mental health struggles  which, when untreated, can lead to increased risk of suicide. They  suffer a disproportionately higher rate of suicide compared to the  general population.   In Arkansas, veterans represent about 8 percent of the population,  but, sadly, they account for one-fifth of the suicides in my State. So  you have 8 percent of the population yet 20 percent of the suicides.   I have heard the anguish of family members and friends who miss the  signs of mental health struggles in their loved ones. We have read and  heard in the news about veterans who have taken their own lives on VA  properties. They were so close to help yet felt that their situations  were beyond repair. We need to close the loop to ensure that  individuals at risk make contact with professionals trained to respond  to address the needs of these vulnerable veterans.   Congress is actively engaged in fighting this public health crisis.  In 2015, we passed and the President signed into law the Clay Hunt  Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. This was an important  step to providing the VA with the tools and flexibility to get help for  veterans living with mental illness. We knew this was just the start.   My colleagues and I on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee are  continuing to build on that foundation. I am hopeful that we can  advance the three particular pieces of legislation I am about to  highlight so that we can give help to veterans at risk of suicide.   Senator Warner and I recently introduced the IMPROVE Wellbeing for  Veterans Act. This bill will enable the VA to harness the potential of  what is already occurring in communities by allowing it to provide  grant funding to nonprofits and local organizations for expanded  outreach to veterans.   Our bill enhances coordination and planning of veteran mental health  and suicide prevention services and will better measure the  effectiveness of these programs in order to reduce the alarming number  of veteran suicides.   We can work with veteran-serving nonprofits to create and use a  standard measurement tool that helps us in this area.   Some nonprofit groups have implemented their own tools to track  progress and monitor the results of their programs.   The VA should examine how it can work with partners to develop or  adopt a measurement tool that will be used uniformly across all groups.  This will allow the VA and its partners to identify which suicide  prevention efforts are having the most impact so that resources can be  concentrated appropriately.   VA Secretary Robert Wilkie called the IMPROVE Wellbeing for Veterans  Act ``key'' to unlocking the veterans suicide crisis.   I am pleased with the support we have received from the Secretary,  members of the committee, and other colleagues, and I encourage other  Senators to cosponsor this important legislation that will make a  positive impact on our effort to reduce veteran suicides.   It is also important to make it easier for veterans in crisis to get  the help they need. That is why I teamed up with Senator Manchin to  introduce the SPEED Act. This legislation would establish a three-digit  number that is easy for veterans to remember in order to reach the  Veterans Crisis Line. In a crisis, time is of the essence. Providing a  more direct line of communication will save lives.   Created in 2007, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered over 3.5  million calls. This has been an essential tool to prevent veteran  suicides. By taking an additional step to simplify the number, we can  make further strides and expedite assistance to veterans in crisis.   The VA has indicated that suicide prevention is its highest clinical  priority. To help improve its operation, oversight, and evaluations of  its suicide prevention media outreach campaigns, we have partnered with  Senator Richard Blumenthal to introduce the Reach Every Veteran in  Crisis Act. This bill supports recommendations by the Government  Accountability Office study that found gaps in the VA's suicide  prevention media outreach activities.   By delivering an action plan for the VA to follow, we can isolate  meaningful suicide prevention programs and ensure resources are focused  on efforts that save lives.   An important provision of the legislation requires establishing  targets to evaluate the effectiveness of the outreach campaign. It is  vital that we have metrics to measure the success of the VA's mental  health and suicide prevention programs.   As the chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been pushing the VA to incorporate  measurement tools so that we can better evaluate the effectiveness of  VA programs. That is why, in the subcommittee's fiscal year 2019 bill,  we incorporated language requiring the VA to report to Congress the  metrics it uses to evaluate the efficacy of all of its mental health  and suicide prevention programs.   My colleagues and I are committed to upend the trend of veteran  suicide. We are blessed to have many organizations devoted to this  common goal.   Together, we can make a positive difference in the lives of veterans  and their families and give them hope for a brighter tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S4689]]     Mr. President, today I wish to honor William J.  ``Bill''  [[Page S4696]]  Strauss, a WWII veteran who served his country with bravery, honor, and  distinction and who continues to inspire Arkansans as an active member  of his community.   Bill was born on October 27, 1919. This year, his friends, family,  and community have planned a number of events to celebrate his 100th  birthday and recognize his endless commitment to serving others.   Bill has led a life of service. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in  January 1942 and assigned to the 73rd Field Artillery of the 9th  Armored Division--the ``Phantom Division''--which valiantly helped  defeat the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge.   For his selfless service, Bill earned numerous awards, including the  European African Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon with three Bronze Battle  Stars. In recent years, he was also awarded the French Legion of Honor.   When he was honorably discharged in 1945, Bill returned home and  married the late Betty Dean Saulsman. The couple raised four children.   Bill moved to Salem, AR, in 1995 and has been a leader in the  community. He is a lifetime member of the VFW and continues to be an  active member of VFW Post 9777. He shares the memories of his WWII  service and his stories of the Battle of the Bulge at schools and at  various community events.   Like his fellow servicemembers, Bill defined the Greatest Generation.  Their sacrifice and dedication changed the course of history. After  serving in unimaginable circumstances in Europe, Bill came home and set  about creating a stronger nation, something he continues today. I want  to thank him for his service and wish him a very happy 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
