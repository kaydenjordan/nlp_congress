 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the  conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019.   This bipartisan piece of legislation is crucial for our Nation's  armed services, and it is an honor and privilege to be selected again  to serve as a conferee.                                time  1115    We have over 15 major military installations in Texas, and NDAA funds  key defense and scientific research industries throughout the State,  and especially for the constituents that I serve in the Dallas-Fort  Worth metroplex. This bill ensures our military is supported with the  research they need to complete their missions and face the national  security challenges at home and abroad.   This is a crucial time for Democrats and Republicans to find ways to  work together for solutions that will ensure the safety of the United  States and our allies--now, really, more so today than ever before.   This bill will make great strides in achieving that mission. This  bill provides the highest pay increase for our troops in a decade,  funds innovation in emerging technologies that will increase aviation  readiness, and requires the DOD establish a pilot program to maximize  opioid safety in the military health system by monitoring controlled  substances for servicemembers.   It is also a great point of pride in Texas that we supply some of the  best military and defense readiness equipment for our armed services.  Many of the Nation's F-35 Joint Strike Fighters are built in Fort  Worth, and Lockheed Martin is one of the metroplex's largest employers.  I will continue to fight tirelessly for additional funding for F-35s to  ensure that our Armed Forces have the most advanced jet fighters in the  world.   Democrats have also succeeded in taking out funding for the wall,  which I think was very important in this bill. I was disappointed about  taxpayer dollars being spent to fund a very extravagant military parade  that I don't think that we need. I think it shows authoritarianism.  However, this bill funding makes great progress in improving our  military readiness and continues to demonstrate America's resilience  and strength.
