 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment  that would appropriate additional resources to CDBG funds, or the  Community Development Block Grant program. Back home in California's  25th District, CDBG funds are awarded to numerous nonprofit  organizations that do significant and far-reaching work for our  constituents.   These resources reach citizens of the city of Santa Clarita through  programs like Bridge to Home, domestic violence victim support centers,  home rehabilitation services, and summer youth development programs.   In the Antelope Valley, CDBG funds address community needs through  grants for street maintenance in low-income neighborhoods, emergency  shelter for low-income people, and financing for the construction of  Palmdale's senior center.   Mr. Chairman, it goes without saying that my constituents  dramatically benefit from CDBG funds, and I am sure many of my  colleagues here can attest to the same. That is why I was alarmed to  see that the President's budget request completely defunded this  program. I am thankful to Chairman Diaz-Balart and his staff for  understanding the importance of this program and supporting it in the  underlying bill.   My amendment returns the total program funding to a level that is  consistent with the FY 2017 enacted level, which will provide the  funding stability our communities need to ensure these programs can  continue to operate. I urge my colleagues to support this.
