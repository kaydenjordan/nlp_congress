 That was--those were the driving factors. Did       he also mention to  [[Page S454]]       me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server?       Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it. That's why       we held up the money. Now, there was a report--         The look-back to what happened in 2016       certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in       corruption with that nation and absolutely appropriate.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. But Mulvaney didn't just admit that the President  withheld the crucial aid appropriated by Congress to apply pressure on  Ukraine to do the President's political dirty work. He also said that  we should just ``get over it.'' Let's watch.    (Text of Videotape presentation.)          We do that all the time with foreign policy.       If you read the news reports and you believe them--what did       McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he       was really upset with the political influence in foreign       policy. That was one of the reasons he was so upset about       this. And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's       going to be political influence in foreign policy.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Should the Congress just get over it? Should the  American people just come to expect that our Presidents will corruptly  abuse their office to seek the help of a foreign power to cheat in our  election? Should we just get over it? Is that what we have come to? I  hope and pray that the answer is no.   We cannot allow a President to withhold military aid from an ally or  to elicit help in a reelection campaign. I hope that we don't have to  just get over that. I hope that we just don't have to get accustomed to  that.   Is that what we want to tell our constituents, that, yes, the  President withheld aid from an ally? Yes, it damaged our national  security. And, yes, he wouldn't meet with the foreign leaders important  to us unless he got help in the next election. And, yes, it is wrong to  try to get a foreign power to help.   It is kind of cheating, really, if we are going to be honest about it  and blatant about it. It is cheating. Americans are supposed to decide  American elections, but, you know, I guess we just need to get over it.  I guess that is just what we should now expect of a President of the  United States.   I guess there is really no remedy for that anymore. The impeachment,  maybe that was a good idea 200 years ago, but I guess we just need to  get over it. I guess maybe the President really is above the law  because they say you can't indict the President.   The President says you can't even investigate the President. The  President is in court saying, you can not only not indict the  President, you can't even investigate the President. The Attorney  General's position is that you can't even investigate the President.   Are we really prepared to say that? The only answer to the  President's misconduct is that we need to get over it? What are we to  say to the next President? What are we to say to the President who is  from a different party, who refuses the same kind of subpoenas, and the  President says to you or his Chief of Staff says to you or her Chief of  Staff says to you: Just get over it. I am not doing anything different  than Donald Trump did. Just get over it. He asked for help in the next  election, I am asking for help in the next election. Just get over it.  We do this kind of thing all the time.   People are cynical enough as it is about politics, about people's  commitment to their good, cynical enough without having us confirm it  for them.   I think it is more than crazy. Those were Ambassador Taylor's words.  I think it is more than crazy. I think it is a gross abuse of power.   And I don't think that impeachment power is a relic. If it is a  relic, I wonder how much longer our Republic can succeed.   For months, President Trump and his agents had pressured Ukraine to  announce investigations, and President Zelensky finally yielded. As  previously noted, he scheduled a CNN interview and planned to publicly  announce the politically motivated investigations.   He informed Sondland of this plan during a September 7 phone call. In  the same call, Sondland related to President Zelensky that Trump  required that the Ukrainian leader make the public announcement in  order to get the critical military aid.   President Trump's corruption had finally worn down President  Zelensky, overcoming his effort to remain true to his anti-corruption  platform--until events intervened.   Before Zelensky could do the interview, President Trump learned that  his scheme had been exposed. Facing public and congressional pressure  on September 11, the President finally released the hold on aid to  Ukraine. Just like the implementation of the hold, he provided no  reason for the release, but the reason is quite simple. The President  got caught.   In late August, President Trump learned about a whistleblower  complaint that was winding its way through the intelligence agencies on  its way to Congress.   On September 9, three House committees announced an investigation  into President Trump's Ukraine misconduct and that of his proxy, Rudy  Giuliani. Later that day, again, September 9, the intelligence  community inspector general notified the Senate and House Intelligence  Committees of the existence of the complaint and the fact that it was  being withheld from Congress, contrary to law and in an unprecedented  fashion.   Facing significant public pressure on September 11, the President  gave up and released the money to Ukraine. One week later, President  Zelensky canceled the CNN interview.   And rather than demonstrate attrition or acknowledged wrongdoing, the  President instead has continued his effort, even after the impeachment  investigation began. He not only continued to call on Ukraine to  investigate his political opponent, he called on China to do the same.   This should concern all of us. It is a confirmation not only of the  scheme to pressure Ukraine to help his political campaign but a clear  sign that the President believes that these corrupt acts are  acceptable.   A President this unapologetic, this unbound to the Constitution and  the oath of office, must be removed from that office lest he continue  to use the vast prejudicial powers at his disposal to seek advantage in  the next election.   President Trump's abuse of powers of his office undermined the  integrity of our free and fair elections and compromised America's  national security.   If we don't stand up to this peril today, we will write the history  of our decline with our own hand. If President Trump is not held to  account, we send a message to future Presidents, future Congresses, and  generations of Americans that the personal interests of the President  can fairly take precedent over those of the Nation. The domestic  effects of this descent from democracy will be a weakened trust in the  integrity of our elections and the rule of law and a steady decline of  the spread of democratic values throughout the world.    For how can any country trust the United States as a model of  governance if it is one that sanctions precisely the political  corruption and invitation to foreign meddling that we have long sought  to help eradicate in burgeoning democracies around the world? To  protect against foreign interference in our elections, we have  guardrails built into our democratic system. We have campaign finance  laws to ensure that political assistance can come only from domestic  actors, and we take seriously the need to shore up the integrity of our  voting systems so that a foreign government or actor cannot change vote  tallies. The promise of one person, one vote is only effective if each  vote is cast free of foreign interference. Americans decide American  elections--at least they should.   Now, what if electoral corruption is even more insidious? What  happens when the invitation comes from within? Our Framers understood  that threat too. George Mason noted at the Constitutional Convention  that impeachment was a necessary tool because ``the man who has  practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the  first instance'' could seek to repeat his guilt.   In June of last year, President Trump was clear that, if a foreign  government offered dirt on his political opponent, he would take it, a  statement deeply at odds with the guidance provided at the time by his  own FBI Director, the former Federal Election  [[Page S455]]  Commission Chair, and our Constitution, written some 233 years ago. In  no uncertain terms, it admonishes against any person holding office of  profit or trust accepting any present from any foreign state.   But President Trump did more than take the foreign help in 2019, as  he had done in 2016. This time, he had not only asked for it in the  July 25 call, but when he didn't get the help from the Ukrainian  President in the form of announced investigations, he withheld hundreds  of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded military aid and a coveted  White House meeting to increase the pressure on Ukraine to comply.  Later, he demonstrated no remorse and continued to encourage Ukraine to  conduct the political investigations he wanted, even asking other  countries to do so.   The consequences of these actions alone have shaken our democratic  system. What message will we send if we choose not to hold this  President accountable for his abuse of power to solicit reelection  interference in our upcoming election? The misconduct undertaken by  this President may lead future Presidents to believe that they, too,  can use the substantial power conferred on them by the Constitution in  order to undermine it. Nothing could weaken the integrity of our  elections more, and no campaign finance law or statement by a future  FBI Director could stand up to the precedent of electoral misconduct  set by the President of the United States if we do not say clearly that  this behavior is unacceptable and, more than unacceptable, impeachable.   We also undermine our global standing. As a country long viewed as a  model for democratic ideals worth emulating, we have, for generations,  been the ``shining city upon a hill'' that President Reagan described.  America is not just a country but also an idea. But of what worth is  that idea if, when tried, we do not affirm the values that underpin it?   What will those nascent democracies around the world conclude; that  democracy is not only difficult but maybe that it is too difficult?  Maybe that it is impossible? And who will come to fill the void we  leave when the light from that shining city upon a hill is  extinguished? The autocrats with whom we compete, who value not freedom  and fair elections but the unending rule of a repressive executive;  autocrats who value not freedom of the press and open debate but  disinformation, propaganda, and state-sanctioned lies.   Vladimir Putin would like nothing better. The Russians have little  democracy left, thanks to Vladimir Putin. It is an autocracy; it is a  thugocracy. The Russian story line, the Russian narrative, the Russian  propaganda, the Russian view they would like people around the world to  believe is that every country is just the same, just the same corrupt  system: There is no difference. It is not a competition between  autocracy and democracy. No, it is just between autocrats and  hypocrites.   They make no bones about their loss of democracy. They just want the  rest of the world to believe you can't fight it anywhere. Why take to  the streets of Moscow to demand something better if there is nothing  better anywhere else. That is the Russian story. That is the Russian  story. That is who prospers by the defeat of democracy. That is who  wins by the defeat of our democratic ideals. It is not other  democracies; it is the autocrats who are on the rise all over the  world.   I think all of us in this room have grown up in a generation where  each successive generation lived with more freedom than the one that  came before. We each had more freedom of speech and associations, the  freedom to practice our faith. This was true at home. It was true all  over the world. I think we came to believe this was some immutable law  of nature, only to find it isn't, only to come to the terrible  realization that this year fewer people have freedom than last, and  there is no guarantee that next year people will live in more freedom  than today. And the prospect for our children is even more in doubt.   It turns out, there is nothing immutable about this. Every generation  has to fight for it. We are fighting for it right now. There is no  guarantee that this democracy that has served us so well will continue  to prosper. We will struggle to protect this idea, and even as we do,  we will struggle to protect our security in more tangible ways. Support  for an independent and democratic Ukraine, which is the literal bulwark  against Russian expansionism in Europe, is essential to our security.  Russia showed that when it invaded Ukraine in 2014 and sought to redraw  the map of Europe.   Was our commitment to Ukraine's independence and sovereignty just an  empty promise or are we prepared to support its efforts to keep Russia  contained so they and we may all eventually enjoy a long peace?   Russia is not a threat--I don't need to tell you--to Eastern Europe  alone. Ukraine has become the de facto proving ground for just the  types of hybrid warfare that the 21st century will become defined by:  cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, efforts to undermine the  legitimacy of state institutions, whether that is voting systems or  financial markets. The Kremlin showed boldly in 2016 that, with the  malign skills it honed in Ukraine, they would not stay in Ukraine.  Instead, Russia employed them here to attack our institutions, and they  will do so again. Indeed, they have never stopped. Will we allow the  primary country now fighting Russia to be weakened, placing our troops  in Europe at greater risk and opening the door to greater interference  in our affairs at home?   If we allow the President of the United States to pursue his  political and personal interests rather than the national interests, we  send a message to our European allies that our commitment to a Europe  free and whole is for sale to the highest bidder. The strength of our  global alliances relies on a shared understanding of what that alliance  stands for: one built on the rule of law, on free and fair elections,  and on a shared struggle against aggression from autocratic regimes.   We are countries built on a commitment to our people, not unyielding  loyalty to a President who would be King.   A President has a right to hold a call with a foreign leader, yes.  And he has a right to decide the time and location of a meeting with  that leader, yes. And he has a right to withhold funding to that leader  should the law be followed and the purpose be just.   But he does not, under our laws and under our Constitution, have a  right to use the powers of his office to corruptly solicit foreign  aid--prohibited foreign aid--in his reelection. He does not. He does  not have the right to withhold official Presidential acts to secure  that assistance, and he certainly does not have the right to undermine  our elections and place our security at risk for his own personal  benefit. No President, Republican or Democratic, can be permitted to do  that.   Now let me turn to the second Article of Impeachment, which charges  the President with misusing the powers of his office to obstruct and  interfere with the impeachment inquiry.   The evidence you will hear during the House presentation is equally  undeniable and damning. President Trump issued a blanket order  directing the entire executive branch not to cooperate with the  impeachment inquiry and to withhold all documents and testimony. His  order was categorical. It was indiscriminate and historically  unprecedented. No President before President Trump has ever ordered the  complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and  impede so comprehensively the ability of the House of Representatives  to investigate high crimes and misdemeanors.   The President was able to block agencies across the executive branch  from producing any records or documents to the House investigative  committees, despite duly authorized subpoenas. The White House  continues to refuse to produce a single document or record in response  to a House subpoena that remains in full force and effect. The  Department of State and Office of Management and Budget, Department of  Energy, and the Department of Defense continue to refuse to provide a  single document or record in response to House subpoenas that remain in  full force and effect.   It is worth underscoring this point. The House has yet to receive a  single document from the executive branch agencies pursuant to its  subpoenas. Not a single piece of paper, email, or other record has been  turned over--not one.  [[Page S456]]    While I pause to get a drink of water, let me let you know for your  timing that I have about 10 minutes left in my presentation. So the end  is in sight.   President Trump has also successfully blocked witnesses--nine of  them--under subpoena from testifying, witnesses with firsthand  knowledge of the President's actions, including his closest aides, some  of whom were directly involved in executing the President's improper  orders. These witnesses include Mick Mulvaney and Robert Blair; Russell  Vought, the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget; Michael  Duffey, a senior official; and the President's chief legal advisor on  the National Security Council, John Eisenberg, among others.   The managers will present in detail what these officials knew about  their role in executing different parts of the President's scheme.  There is no dispute, nor could there be, that President Trump's order  substantially obstructed the House impeachment inquiry. That  obstruction continues unabated today, even as we stand here at the  start of the President's trial.   The President has been able to do so only because of the uniquely  powerful position he holds as our Commander in Chief. No other American  could seek to obstruct an investigation into his own wrongdoing this  way. No other American could use the vast powers and levers of his  government to conduct a corrupt scheme to benefit themselves and then  use those same powers to suppress evidence and bar any cooperation with  the authorities investigating them--not a police chief, not a mayor,  not a Governor, not any elected official in the country, and certainly  not any unelected official in the country.   For those folks watching us from around the country, you know what  would happen to them if they defied a lawful subpoena.   They got a subpoena commanding them to appear. You know what would  happen to them because they are not above the law: They would be  arrested; they would be detained; they would be incarcerated; they  would be forced to comply. They are not above the law, and neither are  we, and neither is the President.   And, yet, despite the fact that he is not above the law, despite the  President's extensive and persistent efforts, the House heard from  courageous witnesses who obeyed lawful subpoenas, and we gathered  overwhelming evidence. The House built a formidable case that forms the  basis of these articles.   The second article for obstruction of Congress is not simply about  President Trump's decision to obstruct a congressional investigation or  even an impeachment inquiry. It should not be misunderstood as some  routine dispute between two branches of government, nor should it be  reduced to the notion that the President was simply protecting himself  or fighting back against a partisan or overzealous Congress. The  charges in the second article are much more serious and urgent than  that.   First, the President's attempt to obstruct the inquiry so  categorically and comprehensively is part and parcel of the President's  furious effort to conceal, suppress, and cover up his own misconduct.  From the very first moment his actions were at the risk of coming to  light, President Trump has sought to hide and cover up key evidence,  even as his scheme to pressure Ukraine was still underway.   As the House's presentation will make clear, the President's coverup  started even before the House began to investigate the President's  Ukraine-related activity. The President learned early on of the  existence of a lawful whistleblower complaint from within the  intelligence community that would ring the first alarm. He deployed the  White House and Justice Department to intervene in an unprecedented  fashion to conceal and then withhold from Congress--for the first time  ever--a credible and urgent whistleblower complaint, even though the  law requires that it be provided to the congressional intelligence  committees.   Once the impeachment inquiry was underway in late September, the  President used the immense and unique power at his disposal to direct  and maintain at every turn the categorical defiance of congressional  scrutiny, even as he attacked the inquiry itself and its witnesses. The  President offered multiple and shifting justifications for obstructing  the House's inquiry, each of them deficient, while his actions and  statements powerfully reflect his own consciousness of guilt.   Second, the ramifications of the President's obstruction go beyond  the sinister motives of simply covering up his actions. His obstruction  strikes at the heart of our Constitution. It threatens the last line of  defense our Founders purposefully enshrined in our system to protect  our democracy.   If Presidents can obstruct an impeachment inquiry undertaken by the  House and evade accountability in the Senate for doing so, they usurp  an essential power granted exclusively to the Congress--and for a  reason. Presidents could seize for themselves the power to neutralize  and nullify the impeachment clause in order to shield themselves from  any accountability. And if Congress is unable to investigate and  impeach a President for abuse of their office, our democracy's  essential check on a rogue President would fail. It would no longer  protect the American people from a corrupt President who presents an  ongoing threat. This is the outcome every American should be concerned  about and one that the Founders warned us about.   Through the impeachment clause, the Framers of the Constitution  empowered Congress to thoroughly investigate Presidential malfeasance-- and to respond, if necessary, by removing the President from office.  This entire framework depends on Congress's ability to discover, and  then to thoroughly and effectively investigate, Presidential  misconduct. Without the ability of Congress to do that, the impeachment  power is a nullity. If you can't investigate it, you can't enforce it  and can't apply it.   What we confront here, in the second Article of Impeachment, is  therefore an impeachable offense aimed at destroying the impeachment  power itself. When a President abuses the power of his office to so  completely defy House investigators, and does so without lawful cause  or excuse, he attacks the Constitution itself. He confirms that he sees  himself as above the law. His actions destabilize the separation of  powers, which defines our democracy and preserves our freedom, and  establish an exceedingly dangerous precedent. And he proves that he is  willing to destroy a vital safeguard against tyranny--a safeguard meant  to protect the American people--just to advance his own personal  interests in covering up evidence.   The House's presentation of the second article will therefore focus  on three core areas that confirm the President's obstruction and  require his removal from office: first, the singular importance and  role of the impeachment clause for our democracy and why an effort by a  President to obstruct an impeachment inquiry is, in and of itself, an  impeachable offense; second, why the President's extensive effort to  cover up evidence of his misconduct is unprecedented in American  history and without lawful cause or justification; and, finally, why  the President's obstruction poses a direct threat to our system of  self-governance, with consequences for all Americans--today and in the  future--and for both Chambers of Congress.   Over the coming days, you will hear from the House managers details  of this scheme and the effort to hide it from Congress. The Articles of  Impeachment that the House presented go to the heart of those efforts,  and let me share a few takeaways.   The House of Representatives has found that, using the powers of his  high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign  government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. He did so  through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the  government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would  benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political  opponent, and influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election improperly  and to his advantage.    President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to  take these steps by conditioning official U.S. Government acts of  significant value to Ukraine on Ukraine's public announcement of these  investigations. He engaged in this scheme or course of conduct for  corrupt purposes  [[Page S457]]  in pursuit of his personal political benefit.   In doing so, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a  manner that compromised the national security of the United States and  undermined the integrity of the U.S. democratic process. He thus  ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.   As part of the House's impeachment inquiry, the committees  undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and  testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various executive branch  agencies and offices and current and former officials.   In response, and without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump  directed executive branch agencies, offices, and officials not to  comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers  of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of  Representatives and assumed to himself functions and judgments  necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by  the Constitution in the House of Representatives.   As George Washington and his troops retreated across the Delaware  River in early December 1776, they were read the words of Thomas Paine,  published that month in his pamphlet, ``The American Crisis'':         These are the times that try men's souls. The summer       soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in the crisis, shrink       from the service of their country; but he that stands by it       now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.    Seventeen days later, George Washington crossed the Delaware, leading  to a decisive victory for those who would come to shape our promising  young country.   As much as our Founders feared an unchecked Chief Executive able to  pursue his own will over the will of the people, they also feared the  poison of excessive factionalism that could divert us from a difficult  service to our country. As George Washington warned in his farewell  address, ``the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party  are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to  discourage and restrain it.''   Our political parties and affiliations are central to our democracy,  ensuring that good and bad political philosophies alike are considered  in the marketplace of ideas. Here, the American people can choose  between the policies of one party or another and make decisions about  their political leaders up to and including the President of the United  States based on the degree to which that person represents their  interests and values. That is not factionalism; that is the foundation  of our democracy.   But when a leader takes the reins of the highest office in our land  and uses that awesome power to solicit the help of a foreign country to  gain an unfair advantage in our free and fair elections, we all-- Democrats and Republicans alike--must ask ourselves whether our loyalty  is to our party or whether it is to our Constitution. If we say that we  will align ourselves with that leader, allowing our sense of duty to be  usurped by an absolute Executive, that is not democracy; it is not even  factionalism. It is a step on the road to tyranny.   The damage that this President has done to our relationship with a  key strategic partner will be remedied over time, and Ukraine continues  to enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress. But if we fail to act,  the damage to our democratic elections, to our national security, to  our system of checks and balances will be long-lasting and potentially  irreversible.   As you will hear in the coming days, President Trump has acted in a  manner grossly incompatible with self-governance. His conduct has  violated his oath of office and his constitutional duty to faithfully  execute the law. He has shown no willingness to be constrained by the  rule of law and has demonstrated that he will continue to abuse his  power and obstruct investigations into himself, causing further damage  to the pillars of our democracy if he is not held accountable.   He cannot be charged with a crime, so says the Department of Justice.  There is no remedy for such a threat but removal from office of the  President of the United States.   If impeachment and removal cannot hold him accountable, then he truly  is above the law.   We are nearly 2\1/2\ centuries into this beautiful experiment of  American democracy, but our future is not assured.   As Benjamin Franklin departed the Constitutional Convention, he was  asked: ``What have we got? A Republic or a Monarchy?'' He responded  simply: ``A Republic, if you can keep it.''   A fair trial, impartial consideration of all of the evidence against  the President is how we keep our Republic.   That concludes our introduction.                            ____________________     Those were the driving factors. But he also       mentioned to me that the corruption related to the DNC       server. Absolutely, no question about it. But that is it.       That is why we held up the money.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. When pressed that he had just convinced them of  the very quid pro quo that President Trump had been denying, Mulvaney  doubled down. Let's listen to that.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Question. But to be clear, what you just described is a       quid pro quo. It is: Funding will not flow unless the       investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.         We do that all the time with foreign policy.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This evidence demonstrates that President Trump  withheld the security assistance and the White House meeting with  President Zelensky until Ukraine made a public statement announcing the  two investigations targeted to help his political reelection efforts.  But as you will learn next, he got caught, and a coverup ensued.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  your patience. This is a lot of information, but you have a very  important obligation, and that is, ultimately, to decide whether the  President committed impeachable offenses. In order to make that  judgment, you have to have all of the facts.   We are going through this chronology. We are close to being done, but  it is important to know that while all of this material was going on  and these deals were being made, there were other forces at work. Even  before the President's freeze on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine  became public on August 28, Members of both Houses of Congress began to  express concern.   On August 9, the Democratic leadership of the House and Senate  Appropriations Committee wrote to the OMB and the White House, warning  that a hold on assistance might constitute an illegal impoundment of  funds. They urged the Trump administration to follow the law and  obligate the funds.   When the news of the frozen aid broke on August 28, congressional  scrutiny of President Trump's decision increased. On September 3, a  group of Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, including Senator  Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Rob Portman, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Ron  Johnson, and Senator Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Acting White  House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, expressing ``deep concerns . . .  that the Administration is considering not obligating the Ukraine  Security Initiative funds for 2019.''   Two days later, as has been mentioned, on September 5, a Washington  Post editorial expressed concern that President Trump was withholding  military assistance to Ukraine in order to pressure President Zelensky  to announce these investigations. That was the first public report  linking the frozen security aid to the investigations that Mr. Giuliani  had been publicly pressing for and that President Trump, as we have  heard, had privately urged President Zelensky to conduct on the July 25  call.   That same day, Senators Murphy and Johnson met with President  Zelensky in Kyiv. Ambassador Taylor went with them, and he testified-- Mr. Taylor testified that President Zelensky's ``first question to the  senators was about the withheld security assistance.'' Ambassador  Taylor testified that both Senators ``stressed that bipartisan support  for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine's most important strategic asset  and that President Zelensky should not jeopardize that bipartisan  support by getting drawn into U.S. domestic politics.''   Senator Johnson and Senator Murphy later submitted letters in which  they explained that they sought to reassure President Zelensky that  there was bipartisan support in Congress for providing Ukraine with  military assistance and that they would continue to urge President  Trump to lift the hold. Here is what they said in that letter.   Senator Murphy said: ``Senator Johnson and I assured Zelensky that  Congress wanted to continue this funding, and would press Trump to  release it immediately.''   And Senator Johnson in the letter said: ``I explained that I had  tried to persuade the President to authorize me to announce the hold  was released but that I was unsuccessful.''   As news of the President's hold on military assistance to Ukraine  became public at the end of August, Congress, the press, and the public  started to pay more attention to President Trump's activities with  Ukraine. This risked exposing the scheme that you have heard so much  about today.   By now, the White House had learned that the inspector general of the  intelligence community had found that a whistleblower complaint related  to the same Ukraine matter was ``credible'' and ``an urgent concern''  and that they were therefore required to send that complaint to  Congress.   On September 9, three House investigating committees sent a letter to  White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, stating that President Trump and  Giuliani ``appeared to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement  and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into  pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of  anti-corruption activity.''   The letter also said this: ``If the President is trying to pressure  Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression  without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the  ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of  power, a boon to Moscow, and a betrayal of the public trust.''   The Chairs requested that the White House preserve all relevant  records and produce them by September 16. This included the  transcript--or actually the call record of the July 25 call between  President Trump and President Zelensky.   Based on witness testimony, it looks like the White House Counsel's  Office circulated the committee's document request around the White  House. Tim Morrison, a senior director at the National Security  Council, remembered seeing a copy of this letter. He also recalled that  the three committees' Ukraine investigation was discussed at a meeting  of senior level NSC staff soon after it was publicly announced.  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman recalled discussions among the NSC staff  members that the investigation--and here is a quote--``might have the  effect of releasing the hold on Ukraine military assistance because it  would be potentially politically challenging for the Administration to  justify that hold to Congress.''    Later that same day, on September 9, the inspector general informed  the House and Senate Intelligence Committees he had determined that the  whistleblower complaint that had been submitted on August 12 appeared  to be credible, met the definition of urgent concern under the statute,  and yet he reported that for first time ever, the Acting Director of  National Intelligence was withholding this whistleblower complaint from  Congress. That violated the law, which required it to be in the Senate  in 7 days. The Acting Director later testified that his office  initially withheld the complaint based  [[Page S481]]  on advice from the White House in an unprecedented intervention by the  Department of Justice.   According to public reporting and testimony from the Acting DNI at a  hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on September 26, the  White House had been aware of the whistleblower complaint for weeks  prior to the IG September 9 letter to the Intelligence Committee.   Acting DNI Maguire testified that when he received the whistleblower  complaint from the inspector general, his office contacted the White  House Counsel's Office for guidance. Consistent with Acting DNI  Maguire's testimony, the New York Times has reported that, in late  August, the President's current defense counsel, Mr. Cipollone, and NSC  lawyer, John Eisenberg, personally briefed President Trump about the  complaint's existence and told the President they believed the  complaint could be withheld from Congress on executive privilege  grounds.   On September 10, the next day, Ambassador Bolton resigned from his  position as National Security Advisor. On that same day, September 10,  Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee wrote a letter to  the Acting Director, demanding that he provide the complaint as the law  required. The next day, on September 11, President Trump lifted the  hold on the security assistance to Ukraine.   Numerous witnesses have testified that they weren't aware of any  reason why the hold was lifted, just that there was no explanation for  the hold being implemented. There was no additional review, no  additional European contribution, nothing to justify the President's  change in his position, except he got caught. Just as there was no  official explanation for why the hold on Ukrainian assistance was  implemented, numerous witnesses testified that they were not provided  with any reason for why the hold was lifted on September 11.   For example, Jennifer Williams, who was a special adviser to Vice  President Pence, testified that she was never given a reason for that  decision; neither was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. Here is what he told  us during the hearing.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
