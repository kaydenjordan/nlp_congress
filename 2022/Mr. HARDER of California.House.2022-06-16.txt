 Mr. Speaker, I rise today frustrated, and  to be honest, just plain tired.   For months now, my community has been paying over $6 a gallon for gas  and $5 for a jug of milk. Prices are out of control, and it is crushing  us. I talked to a neighbor the other day and she told me she is going  to have to choose between picking her kids up from school and driving  herself to work, if gas prices stay this high.   Families in my neighborhood don't have the luxury of sitting around  while politicians do nothing. Today, we have a chance to actually help  by passing our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act.   This package includes my bill, which provides funding for farmers to  implement nutrient management programs. These programs will help lower  the cost of growing food for our farmers, so prices go back to normal  at the grocery store.   Helping farmers lower costs while cutting gas prices for our families  is common sense. It is beyond time that Congress put politics aside and  actually listen to what our communities need. This isn't rocket  science. They are asking for the government to do its job and bring  these prices back down to Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I hope common sense prevails today, and let's pass this  bill.
