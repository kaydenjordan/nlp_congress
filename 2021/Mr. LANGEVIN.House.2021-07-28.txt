 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the en bloc  which includes my amendment, #10, to increase funding for the Capitol  Grounds account to prioritize the removal of accessibility barriers.   Madam Chair, the Capitol Complex was not built with accessibility in  mind, and as the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, I'm reminded  of this every day.   For the past two decades, I've worked closely with the Architect of  the Capitol to address these barriers, and I'm grateful for the  progress we've made so far. Yet many physical barriers still remain,  and we need to remove them proactively so that all Members of  [[Page H4167]]  Congress, our staff, and visitors from across the nation can navigate  the Capitol with ease.   I thank Chairman Ryan and the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for  including report language under the Capitol Grounds account directing  the Architect of the Capitol to prioritize the removal of accessibility  barriers.   Yet the reality is, proactively achieving this requires dedicated  funding, which is what my amendment provides. l thank the Chair and  Ranking Member for supporting it, and I urge my colleagues to support  the en bloc and the underlying bill.
