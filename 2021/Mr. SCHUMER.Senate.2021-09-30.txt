 Madam President, I begin this morning with some good  news: Today, the Senate will pass a continuing resolution that will  eliminate the possibility of a government shutdown tonight. The CR we  are voting on will keep the government funded until December 3, provide  funding to help process and resettle Afghan refugees, and finally  deliver on critical disaster aid for Americans battered by the storms  and wildfires this summer.   As part of today's agreement, we will hold a vote series starting at  10:30 this morning on three amendments offered by Senators Cotton,  Marshall, and Braun. We will hold a vote on final passage soon  thereafter, and I am confident the House will approve this measure  later this afternoon and send it to the President's desk before funding  runs out.   This is a good outcome, one I am happy we are getting done. With so  many things to take care of here in Washington, the last thing the  American people need is for the government to grind to a halt. But, of  course, we have more work to do. Just as our Republican colleagues  realize that a government shutdown would be catastrophic, they should  realize that a default on the national debt would be even worse. I will  have more to say on this later.                                 Nominations    Madam President, now on nominations, despite a week marked by  Republican obstruction, the Senate is making great progress on our  responsibility to confirm President Biden's nominees to his  administration.   Last week, a handful of Members made a scene here on the Senate floor  in a doomed effort to stymie a number of nominees critical to our  national defense. I am glad to say that, over the course of the week,  we have successfully confirmed these individuals despite these  theatrics from that handful of Republicans Senators.   This Chamber will not allow anyone to hijack the confirmation process  to score political points and to prevent these nominations from being  approved. It will not happen. We will move forward. It will take a  little more time, but we will get it done.   Today, the Senate will keep going. After passing the CR, we will turn  to the nomination of Rohit Chopra to serve as the Director of the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Chopra is the right man to  lead this Agency tasked with protecting Americans from predatory  financial institutions. He is a veteran of the CFPB from the Obama  years, where he specialized in protecting students from unscrupulous  practices of student loan providers.   Under President Trump, who didn't give a hoot about the average  person, the CFPB spent more time protecting the likes of payday lenders  and for-profit colleges than American consumers. With Mr. Chopra's  confirmation, the CFPB will return to fighting on the side of the  American worker instead of big financial institutions. I look forward  to his confirmation today.   After that, we will turn to the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to  lead the Bureau of Land Management. Few Agencies are as important for  protecting and promoting America's public lands. In the years to come,  the BLM will play an even greater strategic role in our government's  effort to fight climate change.   Ms. Stone-Manning is a familiar face here in the Senate. She served  as a staffer for Senator Tester before moving to Montana to work for  then-Governor Bullock. As head of Montana's environmental agency, she  earned the reputation not only as a skilled policymaker but also as an  honest broker, one who commanded the respect of conservationists and  ranchers alike.   Of course, you would never guess that by listening to some of the  histrionics coming from the other side. Unable to disqualify Ms. Stone- Manning on the merits, which is so obvious to just about anyone who  studies it, some of our Republican colleagues have used her nomination  to launch cheap, out-of-context attacks. Thankfully, no one is taking  these attacks seriously.   Because of her exceptional qualifications, Tracy Stone-Manning has  broad support of the Democratic caucus to lead the BLM, and I expect  her nomination to be approved later today.   Finally, I am also pleased that today President Biden is announcing  the nomination of another outstanding judge from my home State: Dale Ho  to serve as district judge for the Southern District of New York.   Like so many of President Biden's judicial nominees, Mr. Ho is a  prominent civil rights lawyer and voting rights expert. A graduate of  Yale and Princeton, a veteran of the NAACP and the ACLU, Mr. Ho would  bring an impressive resume to the judiciary. I am thrilled that  President Biden has taken my advice to nominate Mr. Ho, and I look  forward to working on his confirmation.   In a more general note on this issue, I am proud that the Senate is  not only increasing the demographic diversity on the bench--more women,  more people of color, and more individuals from immigrant families--but  also its occupational diversity as well--voting rights experts, civil  rights lawyers, public defenders, and more. This is how we work to  strengthen not only diversity in our judiciary but the trust that it  represent all Americans.                                  Debt Limit    Madam President, finally, on the debt limit, just as our Republican  colleagues realized a government shutdown would be catastrophic, they  should realize that a default on the national debt would be even worse.   Throughout American history, the Federal Government has consistently  paid its debt on time. The unbroken promise is what made the United  States the leading economy in the world for so long, benefiting  countless millions of families. So when we talk about extending the  debt limit, that is what is at stake.   All week long, Senate Democrats presented our Republican colleagues  with reasonable proposals to prevent a default from happening. We  offered to hold a simple majority vote so Democrats could fix the debt  ceiling ourselves. They rejected that offer.   We are not even asking Republicans to vote yes, even though we know  they should, but, instead, just to get out of the way; just get out of  the way, and let us keep the faith and credit in America's finances  intact. Unfortunately, Republicans spent the week solidifying  themselves as the party of default; the party that says America doesn't  pay its bills; the party that would send our economy into unknown and  dangerous territory.   On Monday, Republicans unanimously blocked a measure that would have  funded the government and raised the debt ceiling.   On Tuesday, the Republican leader blocked the proposal to raise the  debt ceiling with only Democratic votes--exactly what Republicans  insisted they wanted from the start.   By Wednesday, it was clear that Republicans were committed not only  to voting in favor of default but even preventing Democrats from  solving this risk crisis on our own.   Every day that Republicans continue their cynical obstruction, they  risk causing irreparable harm to the economy. The last time Republicans  played games with the full faith and credit of the United States, our  sovereign debt was downgraded. This time around, the consequences for  American families could be far worse.   Despite Republicans' intransigence, the facts have not changed. We  must raise the debt ceiling. We cannot allow America to default.   Yesterday, the House approved legislation providing for a clean debt  limit extension until the end of 2022. At the appropriate time, I will  move to proceed to its consideration, which could come as early as next  week.   By now, we are not asking Republicans to vote with us to solve the  debt limit crisis they have created. If they want to oppose this  measure and bring  [[Page S6804]]  us closer to financial disaster, they can write their names in the  history books as the Senators who let the country default for the first  time ever. But Republicans need to get out of the way so Senate  Democrats can address the issue quickly and without needlessly  endangering the stability of our economy.   We cannot afford the risk of a drawn-out, unpredictable process  sought by the minority, which could very well actually cause a default,  no. The way to resolve this crisis is much more simple. Either  Republicans snap out of their insane position and work with Democrats  or they get out of the way while we solve the problem ourselves.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously  scheduled votes begin at 11:05 a.m. and that all provisions of the  previous order remain in effect.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Leahy on the  Appropriations Committee, as well as Senator Shelby and all those who  worked diligently and hard to put this continuing resolution together.   This vote says we are keeping the government open. At this time--at  any time, it is a very, very bad thing to let the government shut down  but at this time in particular when there is so much going on in the  country. And it is a glimmer of hope as we go through many, many other  activities.   I would say this: Just as the CR is so important and requires  bipartisan cooperation, I wish my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle saw the debt ceiling as equally important and equally requiring  bipartisan cooperation. They don't, and we are willing to move forward  on debt ceiling ourselves. But for this moment, this is one of the  larger problems, the biggest problem that has faced us in the last  while, making sure the government stays open, and now we can be sure it  will.   So I thank all of my colleagues who worked so hard on this issue.   I yield back time on both sides.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on  confirmation of the Meyer nomination occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday,  October 4, and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senate has  received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany S.  1301.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany S. 1301, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague.   Mr. President, so a few moments ago, the Senate voted to proceed to  go into the House message on the debt ceiling suspension until December  of 2022. For the information of all, this vote will only require a  majority threshold and is a necessary procedural step before cloture  can be filed on the House-passed legislation.   Now, despite Republicans' twisted logic for wanting the debt limit to  be addressed while actively blocking that from happening, the basic  facts have not changed. The debt must be addressed; it will be  addressed; and America cannot default.   We Democrats are not asking Republicans to vote with us. If they want  to vote to stop checks from going to veterans and payments to Social  Security recipients, they can do so. But what we are saying is simply  the Republicans ought to get out of the way so Democrats can suspend  the debt limit.   That is what Republicans have asked for. Leader McConnell talked  about that idea repeatedly on the floor over the last several weeks,  and it is the best way to avoid financial catastrophe without  endangering the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move that the Senate concur in the  House amendment.
