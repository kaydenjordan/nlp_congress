 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Georgia Representative Mickey Stephens for his remarkable career  in the Georgia General Assembly.   Mr. Stephens is a native of Savannah and a proud graduate of Savannah  State College. He served one term in 2002 and was reelected in 2014 to  the Georgia House, representing the 165th District.   As an educator, he was a great asset to Savannah High School, Shuman  Middle School, and John W. Hubert Middle School. Additionally, he  served on the Savannah-Chatham County Board of Public Education and the  Savannah Zoning Board of Appeals.   Mr. Stephens is known throughout Georgia for his civic service,  including his commitment to the community and his efforts in supporting  the education of youth and adults.   Thank you, Mr. Stephens, for all of your hard work to make Savannah a  better place to live. You are an inspiration to us all about giving  back to your community.                        Remembering Michael Mamalakis     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Michael Mamalakis of Savannah, Georgia, who  passed away on May 16 at the age of 37.   Michael was a lifelong resident of Savannah and a graduate of Jenkins  High School.   He had many passions in his life, but one of his greatest passions  was the Savannah Country Day School sports teams.   Michael spent 20 years inspiring athletes with his incredible spirit  and unsurpassed devotion. He taught players and coaches alike that  passion, effort, and dedication are far more important in sports than  wins and losses.   In 2014, Michael was honored as Savannah Country Day School's Best of  Preps Unsung Hero.   He touched many lives in the Savannah community, and his  irreplaceable presence will be missed by all.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him, during this most difficult time.                        Congratulating Davion Mitchell     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Davion Mitchell for winning the 2021 NCAA men's basketball national  championship with Baylor University.   Davion has never been a stranger to achieving success and making an  impact on his team.   During his time at Liberty County High School in Hinesville, in the  First Congressional District of Georgia, Davion led his team to their  first State title in school history.   As a junior at Baylor University, Davion led Baylor in an impressive  season that resulted in a win over Gonzaga in the national championship  game.   Some of Davion's impressive accolades include the AP All-American  Team, the All-Big 12 First Team, the 2021 All-Tournament Team, and the  National Defensive Player of the Year.   Davion's long list of accomplishments stems from his countless hours  of work and his determination to win.   I, along with the rest of the First Congressional District,  congratulate you, Davion, on your achievements and know that you will  continue to make us proud.                       Honoring Carl Hamilton Alexander     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor retired Chief of Police Carl Hamilton Alexander of Brunswick,  Georgia, who peacefully passed away at the age of 72.   Chief Alexander was a man of strong character and deep devotion to  his lifelong profession of public service.   He began his career in public service with the Glynn County Fire- Rescue in 1970, and he would eventually rise through the ranks of the  police department to become chief of police.   Under his leadership, the Glynn County Police Department became the  14th nationally accredited agency in the State in 1994.   Chief Alexander modernized the county emergency radio system and  brought computer technology into police vehicles.   Through every position he had, he worked to better his community and  every life he touched. His commitment to Glynn County has changed  countless lives, and we are forever grateful.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Mary Lott Walker of Blackshear, Georgia, who  passed away on May 12 at the age of 85.   Mary loved her city of Blackshear, her State of Georgia, and her  country, the United States of America, devoutly.   After graduating from Georgia State College for Women, Mary began her  influential career in public education.   Mary was also involved in politics, becoming the first woman in  Blackshear to serve as mayor pro tempore.   Through her work in Georgian education, politics, and historical  preservation, Mary inspired young people to achieve greatness.   Above all, she devoted more than 67 years of membership and  leadership to the Blackshear Presbyterian Church.   Mary's profound community impacts will be felt for generations to  come.   My thoughts and prayer are with her family, friends, and all who knew  her during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the many foreign failures  President Biden and the Democrats have made putting our national  security and country at risk.   When President Biden came into office, he and Vice President Harris  invited people to come through our border. President Biden even stopped  construction of the highly successful and necessary border wall.   The Biden border crisis was preventable, and can be fixed if  President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit the border like I  have.   President Biden has also been apologetic to our Nation's greatest  foes. He refused for months to acknowledge the possibility that the  coronavirus was man-made in the Wuhan lab. He let big tech silence  those who spoke out about the evidence, despite leaked emails from Dr.  Fauci that showed even he knew the lab leak theory was highly possible  and likely probable.   And now President Biden wants to hand our vaccine technology over to  China free of charge. Members on both sides of the aisle recognize the  dangers of this. Yet President Biden would rather side with the Chinese  Communist Party than American innovators and American workers.   And most recently, the Biden administration and my colleagues across  the aisle won't condemn anti-Semitic comments made by Members of this  Chamber.   To conflate the U.S. and Israel with Hamas and Iran is disgusting. It  is wrong. And it is an insult to the men and women who fought for our  country and who still defend our country against terrorism.   It is time for President Biden to put America first. President Trump  did, and our country was stronger than ever before. Now it is time for  President Biden to do his job and stand up for the U.S. and  hardworking, patriotic Americans.   You work for Americans, not for foreign countries.
