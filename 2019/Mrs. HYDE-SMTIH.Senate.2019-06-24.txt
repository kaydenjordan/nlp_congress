 Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute  to Brig. Gen. Ernest Randolph ``Randy'' Webster, U.S. Air Force,  retired, who passed away on June 2, 2019. A native of Midnight, MS, he  served our country with distinction both stateside and abroad.   General Webster, who was an Army ROTC student at Arkansas State  University, joined the U.S. Marine Corps and became a helicopter pilot  and intelligence officer while serving in the Vietnam War. Following  his service in Vietnam, General Webster transferred to the Air Force  Reserve, where he served in a variety of assignments, eventually rising  to the rank of brigadier general.   General Webster's final assignment was as commander of the 403rd Wing  at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, MS. Also known as the Hurricane  Hunters, the airmen 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, a component  of the 403rd Wing, have the critical mission of flying into dangerous  conditions to identify and assess storms developing in the Gulf of  Mexico. The information they provide is crucial to allowing States and  communities in the Gulf Coast region to prepare for severe storms.   Under General Webster's leadership, the Hurricane Hunter aviators,  along with support personnel, successfully fulfilled this vital mission  of protecting Gulf Coast communities from weather-related disasters and  further solidified their role as a key national asset.   General Webster stayed true to form following his retirement in 2000  with 33 years of military service, dedicating himself to his family and  volunteering his time to youth groups and his church.   Our gratitude and condolences go out to his wife Martha Webster and  the entire Webster family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
