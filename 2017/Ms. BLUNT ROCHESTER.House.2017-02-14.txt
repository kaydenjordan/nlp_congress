 Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to the  chorus of new Members of the 115th Congress.   It is fitting that we make this commitment on Valentine's Day. It is  a holiday to show appreciation and also love, and I think that is what  this is really about. It is about our love for our country and our love  for our friends and families and neighbors.   It is also about civility, and to me, civility is not about the what.  We can all disagree on the what. Civility is about the how. It is about  our tone. It is about our tenor. It is about the words that we choose  to use, and it is about respect.   As freshmen, our class is special. I feel we are special. Just like  Claudia said, we are actually awesome. And it was really telling that,  at one of our retreats, orientations, we came together and we asked if  we could just be alone, no staff, no one else in the room--just us. We  actually said: Let's try to find common ground. Who here has a port?  Who here has served in public life? Again, our goal wasn't to find ways  to divide, but to find ways to come together.   If we expect civility from others, including our children, then we  need to model it. Our signatures on this document show our commitment  to civility, to caring, and, most of all, to getting things done. That  is what America wants, and that is what America deserves.
