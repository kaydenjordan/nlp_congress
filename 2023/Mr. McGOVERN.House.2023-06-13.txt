 Mr. Speaker, I have always thought it was odd that  doctors could prescribe medications for heart disease and diabetes but  couldn't prescribe fresh fruits and vegetables.   For a long time now, community-based organizations have been  incredibly successful in using produce prescriptions to reduce hunger  and diet-related disease. Recently, the Indian Health Service announced  a new $2.5 million grant to make produce prescriptions available to  more American Indian and Alaska Native peoples.   In Indian Country, hunger is prominent. About one in four Native  people experience food insecurity, compared to one in nine Americans  overall.   Last September, the Biden-Harris administration hosted the second- ever White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.   Within the ambitious national strategy that came out of the  conference is a special focus on the challenges and opportunities in  Indian Country.   That is why I am so excited about programs like the one just  announced by the Indian Health Service agency to end hunger among  historically underserved communities.   We can and we should end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is great to see you again. How are you? It has been a  while. You look terrific.   We haven't had votes in what, 5 legislative days, all because some  Republican Members decided to throw a temper tantrum last week on the  House floor, wanting to rehash legislation that was passed the week  before.   What we saw was essentially a fight between the rightwing and the  extreme  [[Page H2824]]  rightwing. I mean, what the hell is going on here?   With each passing week, it becomes more and more obvious that the  Republican Party is completely out of touch with what everyday people  care about in this country.    We are bringing a new rule to the floor that incorporates the bills  that we were supposed to do last week and adds an additional bill to  make it easier to kill people.   I am told that the Republicans now have the votes to pass this rule.  The question is: What was the deal? Better yet, what was the secret  deal to convince the Republicans who were problematic last week to go  along to get along this week?   Reading the press, we see that members of the Freedom Caucus are  saying they have this deal on power sharing.   I am not quite sure what that means. Power sharing with the Speaker  and the extreme rightwing; is that the deal?   We hear from the Speaker that there is no deal on anything. I don't  know what the truth is. Maybe my friend can enlighten us at some point  about what the truth is.   My Republican friends like to say that this place should be run like  a business. Well, if they really believe that, then this place should  be out of business because this is not the way Congress should be run.  This is not the way you run a democracy. This is ridiculous.   Democrats have worked tirelessly to try to lower costs for people,  bring jobs back from China, rebuild our country, fight pollution, and  keep our communities safe.   Republicans? What do they stand for? Well, forgive me if I say I am  not entirely sure because right now, the only thing I have seen so far  since they took over is dysfunction and disarray.   Republicans began this Congress by wasting a week fighting with each  other about who would be Speaker. Now we are 5 months in, and they have  enacted five laws.   One a month. Boy, what an achievement. Even Democrats and President  Trump were able to enact 21 laws at this point.   The far right fringe of the Republican Party, the same fringe that  demanded Speaker McCarthy give them all of his power, has succeeded in  even dictating to him what bills he can and can't bring to the House  floor.   This is important. I want the American people to understand who is in  charge here right now. It is not the Speaker of the House. It is not  Kevin McCarthy. It is the far right of the far right.   We have sitting members of the Republican Conference right now openly  advocating for civil war. These are the people calling the shots. Are  you kidding me?   In what world should the 11 most extreme people in the Republican  Party get to dictate the entire agenda of a legislative body that  represents 332 million people? What are we doing here, Mr. Speaker?                                time  1245    We have smoke from wildfires clogging up our air. Scientists are  telling us we need to do more on climate change, yet we are passing  messaging bills about gas stoves.   By the way, that is not even me calling them messaging bills. It is  the Republicans saying that. This is a Republican: We do not need to  leave D.C. early because messaging bills are not coming to the House  floor. That was Congresswoman Boebert last week.   How about this one: When we pass things around here that are  messaging bills that don't do anything, is it really a loss that we  aren't passing anything?   I mean, their own Members are saying that the bills they are passing  do nothing. Essentially, they are just playing a messaging game. Is  this really the best we can do with all of the challenges that we face  in this country and around the world?   Meanwhile, our constituents are begging us and they are pleading with  us to do something about gun violence in this country. What do  Republicans do? How do they respond? By bringing to the floor a bill  that makes it easier for the next mass shooter to kill more people. It  is sick.   Mr. Speaker, killed were: 9 people outside a bar in Dayton in 2019;  10 people, including a police officer, at a grocery store in Boulder in  2021; 5 people in an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs in 2022; and 6  people, including children, at a school in Nashville just a few months  ago. What do they all have in common? They were all killed by mass  shooters who used stabilizing braces.   By the way, the ATF rule that the Republicans are trying to overturn,  contrary to what they say, doesn't even make stabilizing braces  illegal. It doesn't ban them. All it does is it says that you need to  register braces because they are used in a lot of mass shootings.   But for Republicans, any amount of commonsense gun safety regulation  is too much. Why? Because the NRA says so.   Our kids are being slaughtered, for God's sake. Does anyone care? Do  my Republican colleagues care at all that America's parents stay up  wondering whether their kids will be the next one shot at school or at  a mall or at a movie theater or at their own graduation?   People come up to me all the time and they ask me: Why can't  Democrats and Republicans just work together? I tell them I wish we  could. There was a time when we did.   I say to them: Go online and Google the bills that Republicans are  bringing to the floor. Ask yourself why Republicans oppose background  checks on a gun accessory that mass shooters use to kill people. Ask  yourself if it is right that this bill was introduced by a Republican  Member of Congress--and you are going to love this--who owns a gun  store and makes millions of dollars by selling guns and these types of  gun accessories that mass shooters use to kill people. Ask yourself if  it makes sense that the only reason this bill is even on the floor is  because Speaker McCarthy isn't even in charge of the House schedule  anymore; the far, far, far right is.   The craziest thing is this rule was inspired by guidance published  under the Trump administration. Let me repeat that. Even the Trump  administration thought it was necessary to further regulate stabilizing  braces. I can't believe I am about to say this, but I agree.   If you want to know why we can't have real action when it comes to  gun safety, follow the money. In the last decade, the NRA has spent  more than $100 million to help elect Republicans who will support their  extreme agenda. Follow the money. It is no surprise that the far right  is demanding this bill, but it is a shame.   How many more mass shootings need to happen? How many more kids need  to die before my Republican colleagues pull their heads out of the sand  and say the NRA's blood money is not worth the damage that is being  done to our country?   I wish I was wrong, Mr. Speaker, but sadly the cowardice and moral  bankruptcy on the other side of the aisle seems to know no bounds.   Between the new concept of power sharing in the House, which really  just means that the Speaker is going to have to keep a tiny minority of  extremist Members happy for the House to be able to function, and the  fact that their party's frontrunner for the 2024 Presidential election  is being indicted with very serious charges for the second time this  afternoon, I am sorry to say the Republican Party is a train wreck, and  it doesn't bode well for what is to come.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say a couple of things. First of all, nobody is  talking about banning anything here. What we are saying is that an  accessory that has been used in a number of mass shootings be  registered. That is it.   By the way, the gentleman said the administration should not be  making laws. The administration is not making laws. They are  administrating and enforcing the laws that we have passed, and they do  that through regulation and rulemaking. I am not sure what the  gentleman is talking about.   Let me also say that he keeps on saying that this bill will turn gun  owners into automatic felons, that by owning or buying one of these  stabilizing braces, American gun owners will become felons. That is  just not true.   By the way, I should tell the gentleman, someone has to be convicted  of a crime in a court to become a felon. Let me give him an example,  one that he might be able to relate to. Despite being charged with 37  counts for mishandling classified documents, former President Trump is  not a felon. He only becomes a felon if he is found guilty of the  crimes that he was charged with and is sentenced to a year or more in  prison, which may very likely happen.  [[Page H2826]]                                     time  1300    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from the Washington Post titled: ``Here are the 37 charges  against Trump and what they mean.''    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my next speaker, I have  to say, we heard a lot of words from the gentleman and from other  Republicans who speak on these issues. Do you know what we don't hear?  We don't hear any empathy for the families who have lost loved ones to  gun violence.   I began my opening remarks by citing examples of how this accessory  was used in mass shootings. Children, mothers, fathers, grandmothers,  and grandfathers lost their lives. They were murdered. Police were  murdered. There is not even any empathy. There is no acknowledgment  that this is a terrible tragedy.   All we hear about is: Don't take away my toys. Don't interfere with  my hobby. You can't register any of these things.   I think people are so sick and tired of where our priorities are.  People are sick and tired of having the National Rifle Association and  all of their money dictate what our policies should be on guns. They  don't care about all the people who have died and have been murdered in  this country.   By the way, other countries have similar challenges and problems that  we do, but they don't have the level of gun violence. They don't have  massacres on a regular basis. This is what we get. Enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we didn't call them messaging bills. Members of the  Republican Conference called them messaging bills, I would remind the  gentleman.   The gentleman says that we need serious solutions to gun violence in  this country. I think I heard the gentleman correctly, that he is  suggesting it is okay for people to carry guns into bars when they are  drunk. I don't think that is very serious.   The idea that we can shoot our way into gun safety is insane. We  already have more guns than people in this country. We are the only  country in the world that has massacres that occur on a regular basis.   The gentleman is saying that people should be able to carry guns into  bars when they are drunk, that we ought to give teachers more guns, and  that everybody ought to have more guns and everybody will be safe. This  is insane. It doesn't make any sense.   At some point, people are going to have to have the courage to stand  up to the gun lobby and say no to the NRA's money and actually do what  is in the best interest of the American people, do what will protect  the people of this country. To hear this nonsense--this place is  crazier than usual.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This is strange what we hear on the House floor today. My friends keep  on talking about veterans and people with disabilities, but I don't see  any major veterans organization or disability organization that has  endorsed this bill. The gentleman talks about the fact that we have  security here. Yes, the Capitol Police who protect us all have had  background checks and have all had training.   It is interesting that we have a rule when my friends are in charge  where you can't bring weapons on the House floor. I feel good about  that after I have listened to some of my colleagues here today.   I also remind the gentleman that there were police officers at  Uvalde. We hear from police officers and organizations all across the  country all the time how they don't want to have to get into situations  where they are battling with somebody who has an AR-15.   People are dying in this country on a regular basis. Massacres are  happening on a regular basis, and we are on the floor to basically make  it easier for people to have access to an accessory that can make a gun  more deadly and more accurate that can kill more people. I mean, it  doesn't make any sense. All I can think of is the fact that some of my  friends are afraid to take on the gun lobby. They are afraid to lose  their money. $100 million in NRA money went into campaigns in the  last 10 years--$100 million. We have to get our priorities straight  here in this Congress. We have to put people ahead of guns. Mr.  Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question, and  if we do, then I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for  consideration of a resolution which states that it is the House's duty  to protect and preserve Social Security  [[Page H2829]]  and Medicare for our future generations and reject any cuts to these  essential programs.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Casar), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I won't hold my breath waiting for the  other names.   It is astounding to me that my friends on the other side of the aisle  don't want any gun laws. Basically, they lack empathy for the murders  and deaths in this country that happen on a regular basis. I mean, at  some point, we have to say enough is enough. They have to put people  ahead of the gun lobby, and my friends are incapable of doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who is a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many  additional speakers he has?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, we have real problems in this country. I mean, the  Northern Hemisphere was on fire. You couldn't walk outside last week  without a mask in Washington, D.C., New York City, or a number of major  cities and communities all across the Northeast. Our  [[Page H2832]]  planet has a fever. I mean, we have a real issue here with climate  change, but we don't talk about those things.   There are a zillion issues that we need to deal with, but instead we  come to the floor with--this is what the Republicans have said-- messaging bills. Those are their words, not mine. These messaging bills  promote their culture war against gas stoves, and these messaging  bills, I guess, make the NRA even happier.   The gentleman talks about veterans who want this. There are 16  million veterans in this country. If this were a priority of our  veterans, these major organizations would be supporting this bill, but  they are not.   The bottom line is, we are here talking about stuff that will not  help anybody. In fact, this gun bill just makes it easier for people to  kill people.   Why are we doing this? This makes absolutely no sense.   Last week, my Republican friends fought with each other, and nothing  got done. This week, we are bringing bills to the floor that Republican  Members are calling nothing more than messaging bills.    Congress was created to help solve problems, to help people. My  Republican friends think that that is a foreign idea. This is helping  nobody. It is a joke that we are here today bringing this horrific bill  to the floor basically so that the NRA can be happy and justify another  $100 million into their campaigns.   People are dying every single day in this country, and we hardly hear  a word about it from the other side of the aisle. In fact, during this  debate, very little was even acknowledged in terms of the people who  are dying in this country. We can do so much better.   I used to have a history teacher who used to say the world will not  get better on its own. I didn't really know what he was talking about  when I took the course, but I do now. Nothing good happens unless good  people come together and make change.   There have to be some reasonable people on the Republican side who  understand that gun violence is out of control. We have more guns in  this country than people. We can't shoot our way out of this problem,  and yet that is what my Republican friends are suggesting.   Enough is enough. We need to get back to doing the people's business.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, vote ``no'' on the rule, and vote ``no'' on all this garbage  messaging legislation that will follow. We are here to solve problems,  to make people's lives better. Let's do something that actually makes  the American people proud of this Congress. This is embarrassing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  1640, which would add an important provision to ensure that nothing in  this bill would harm U.S. energy security.   Before I share with my colleagues why this amendment is necessary, I  want to take a minute to say what an exercise in absurdity this week in  the House has been.   With everything going on in the world, we are considering nonsense  bills about imaginary threats. That is the best that this Republican  majority could muster, bills that are written so poorly they wouldn't  even fake solve the fake problems they are making up to scare people.   In the case of H.R. 1640, this bill could do real damage. The Biden  administration is not trying to ban gas stoves, period, but instead of  just acknowledging that and moving on, my Republican friends are  pretending that the administration is trying to ban them through an  energy efficiency proposal that would save consumers money and improve  America's energy security.   Consumers and experts recognize that energy efficiency is a key  component of energy security. It is simple. If you can cook the same  exact way with less gas, that means we are more energy secure.   I have heard for years from Republicans that they care about energy  security. This vote is an opportunity for them to prove it.   This amendment contains a ``do no harm'' provision, which says that  the bill should not take effect until the Secretary of Energy certifies  that it would not have a negative impact on U.S. energy security.   This is simple. This amendment is a chance to affirm, in a bipartisan  way, that Congress should be strengthening our energy security, not  weakening it.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If energy security is as important to Republicans as they say it is,  this should be a no-brainer, because why would they bring a bill to the  floor that could possibly weaken our energy security?   I suspect there might be something else at play here.   It is possible that the majority knows exactly what this bill would  actually do, and they are eager to steamroll U.S. energy security and  make consumers pay through the nose.   Why do I think that? Because that is exactly what Big Oil and the  fossil fuel lobby wants. Follow the money. Google their donations.   If Republicans really care about energy security, they wouldn't all  have voted against the Inflation Reduction Act last year, the single  most ambitious bill on energy security that Congress has ever  considered.   If Republicans really care about energy security, they wouldn't have  voted against millions of new clean energy jobs that will make us truly  energy independent.   With this vote, let's see what my Republican colleagues care more  about, America's energy security or helping Big Oil and gas  billionaires rake in more profits on the backs of our constituents.   I am sure my Republican friends will be generously compensated for  their efforts here today. How sad. How pathetic.   I urge everybody to follow the money. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
