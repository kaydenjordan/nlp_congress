 Mr. President, yesterday, the Provide  Accurate Information Directly, PAID Act took a pivotal step closer to  becoming law. Once enacted, this vital legislation, which I had the  privilege of coauthoring with Senator Cardin, will save tens of  millions of taxpayer dollars through targeted and commonsense updates  to the Medicare secondary payer, MSP, statute, which Congress first  codified four decades ago. The PAID Act aims to ensure that the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, in coordinating claims related  to Medicare Advantage MA, or Medicare Part D plans, can provide the  information needed for settling parties to resolve claims-fairly and  efficiently.   In short, this bill is a boon for seniors, Main Street job creators,  and the American taxpayer.   As this bill approaches the legislative finish line, I would like to  thank Chairman Grassley for his invaluable support in working with my  office, as well as with our Democratic counterparts and with CMS, to  bolster, refine, and identify legislative avenues for our proposal. I  would also like to thank Senator Cardin for his partnership in co- leading this legislation, along with Representatives Kind and  Bilirakis, who introduced a companion bill in the House, which passed  by voice vote yesterday. Together, I feel confident that we can see the  PAID Act signed into law by the end of the year.   Congress amended the MSP statute in 2007 to require parties to a  dispute--known as primary plans--to report settlements, judgments, and  awards to Medicare through so-called section 111 reports. This  amendment allowed Medicare to-seek recovery from settling parties when  Medicare paid for healthcare because other payment was not available or  reasonably expected to be available. While this system has functioned  well for the Medicare Fee-for-Service program, where CMS has the claims  data needed for recovery, it has not worked successfully for the MA  Part C and Part D programs, where CMS does not have the requisite Part  C and Part D claims data and cannot recover for payments that have been  made. To compound the problem, settling parties are often unable to  identify the correct Part C or Part D plan to be able to coordinate  benefits, should they choose to do so. This legislation closes that  critical information by having CMS communicate the Part C and Part D  plan identification to settling parties in response to a section 111  report. CMS has that data and can provide it.   Congress recognizes that for the last 8 years, CMS has provided  section 111 reports to the Part C and Part D Plans, and Congress  expects that CMS will continue to do so after this legislation is  enacted. Further, the existing MSP statute and regulations impose  specific requirements on CMS, and on Part C and Part D plans, to pay  for claims in some situations, to not pay for claims in other  situations, and to pursue recovery of claims when appropriate. Nothing  in this legislation is intended to change any of those obligations or  requirements, and Congress expects Part C and Part D plans to continue  to seek recovery of claims by timely notifying settling parties when a  payment has been made that should be reimbursed, consistent with the  CMS notice procedures. This legislation is only intended to provide  more information to the settling parties so that they have the ability  to coordinate with Part C and Part D plans earlier, if they so choose.   Congress has afforded CMS 12 months to implement this law, and we  urge the agency to move with all deliberate speed to both implement its  own system changes and coordinate with primary plans throughout the  implementation process. Regular communication and coordination will  prove critical in ensuring that Primary Plans are aware of the data  exchange requirements that CMS plans to implement and are prepared as  quickly as possible to utilize the data CMS will be providing under  this law. By involving all stakeholders throughout the implementation  process, CMS can implement our intent that the needed plan identity  information be available for parties to coordinate benefits as  efficiently as possible.                            ____________________
