 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, in this hallowed Chamber of the  House, in the U.S. Capitol, we pay tribute to a good friend, a patriot,  a loyal Member of this House of Representatives, and the Senate, and  that is John McCain, who we lost last week, after a long and productive  life.   It seems fitting that we are here in the House Chamber with the  portraits of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, two  generals in the army of the liberation in our American Revolution, two  comrades at arms, two people who set the standard for high, ethical  standards of leadership, and leading us in what we treasure today, our  United States of America. And really John McCain epitomized that.   Mr. Speaker, it may be unusual that a Member from Arkansas would lead  a tribute in honor of our distinguished former colleague, but there is  a connection, because when I started, one of my earliest jobs was  serving Senator John Tower of Texas, on his personal staff and on the  staff of the Senate banking committee.   You couldn't work for John Tower and not be a friend to John McCain,  because John McCain was, as a young captain, the liaison to the Senate  between 1977 and 1981, and then he ran for office in 1982 in his home  State of Arizona.   He said it was hard to decide to run. He didn't really have a home.  The longest place he had lived before he ran for Congress from Arizona  was in the Hanoi Hilton, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1830    And John Tower broke his promise to not campaign and mess around in a  Republican primary by traveling Arizona and Texas helping John McCain  win his election in 1982.   They were, like Lafayette and Washington, comrades in arms, both Navy  men: Tower, the seniormost enlisted man elected to the Senate, and John  McCain, a captain, son and grandson of admirals.   Tower's favorite story about John was when they went to Oman, and  Captain McCain was his escort officer on a codel, and they were with  the Sultan of Oman out in the desert in a tent, arrayed on beautiful  carpets.   As you know, it is bad protocol to show one's soles of the feet in  the Arab culture, and John McCain, Mr. Speaker, could not bend his legs  from his beatings in the Hanoi Hilton. And so there he was, cross- legged--or tried to be cross-legged--in that tent in Oman with the  soles of his feet pointing directly at the sultan.   It was Tower who said: Your Majesty, please understand that Captain  McCain can't properly cross his legs, as he was a POW in Vietnam and is  crippled from that horrible ordeal.   And the Sultan of Oman said: My dear Senator, I am a graduate of  Sandhurst and a former captain in the British Army of the Rhine. I  understand. And it is a pleasure to have Captain McCain at our table.   Years later, it was John McCain who worked his tail off to try to  have John Tower confirmed as Secretary of Defense in 1989 for my old  boss, President Bush, to no avail. But in the minutes before that  failed vote in the Senate, McCain turned to Tower and said: God bless  you, John Tower. You are a damn fine sailor.   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute to John McCain, his  comradeship, his friendship with John Tower, his  [[Page H7915]]  service to this country, his undenied patriotic leadership and strength  in the country that we have today.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to call on my friend from Texas, and it is  a special call, it is an emotional call for all of us in this Chamber  tonight, to ask Sam Johnson to come to the podium, Sam Johnson, who  spent 7 years in the Hanoi Hilton, 42 months in solitary confinement, a  29-year career in the Air Force.   So, Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sam Johnson), and thank him for sharing his thoughts on his  comrade in arms, former Senator John McCain.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our good friend for his service.   Sam Johnson has served this Chamber so nobly during his years on Ways  and Means and ends his career in the people's House this term. All of  us treasure our time with him, our work together, and his leadership,  and we treasure his remarks tonight in honor of his great comrade.   And, sir, we salute you and we thank you, and God bless you for all  you have done for this great country.   With that, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Denham), who  serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Natural  Resources. Also, he served this great country in the Air Force for 16  years, fought in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, Operation Restore Hope  in Somalia. We welcome him, and we thank him for his comments tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California. I  appreciate his personal testimony about John's service and his  friendship. I thank him again for his service to our country, not only  in the people's House, but in the U.S. Air Force.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my friend from Memphis, my neighbor from  across the Mississippi River, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen),  a Representative from Memphis who serves on the Committee on Ethics,  where he is a ranking member. I am proud to have his contributions  tonight in tribute and memory to our former colleague, Senator McCain.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Tennessee for his  remarks about our friend John McCain.   Now, I would like to ask a colleague of his from Arizona, my friend,  who we served on the House Financial Services Committee together, Dave  Schweikert, who represents Phoenix and Scottsdale and currently serves  on the House Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative Schweikert and thank him for  being with us tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona. I thank him  for his personal stories tonight and his tribute to our former friend  from Arizona.   It is a pleasure for me to ask my friend from Fresno, California,  Representative  Jim Costa, to share some thoughts on the life of John  McCain.   Mr. Costa serves on the Agriculture Committee and Natural Resources  Committee, and we are grateful for him being with us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for his  personal memories and tribute to Senator McCain.   It is a pleasure now for me to yield to my friend from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart).   Senator McCain, throughout his life, was such a great voice for our  Bill of Rights, for liberty across the world, for the fight against  communism during the Cold War, and for the fight for trade and  leadership by the American people and our great country around the  world.   I think the same of my friend, Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida, who  with his friend  Jim Costa helps lead our parliamentary dialogue  between the Transatlantic Economic Council in the EU and the United  States.   I thank my friend, also a member of the Ways and Means Committee, for  coming tonight and sharing his thoughts on Senator McCain.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time to thank my  colleagues for coming to the House floor to this hallowed Chamber of  the people's House and paying tribute to a distinguished Member of this  House, a distinguished United States Senator, and someone who  epitomizes the best of American character.   We were all inspired by the stories shared tonight, particularly I  think by the touching tribute of a colleague in the Hanoi Hilton, Sam  Johnson of Texas. I will remember that time for the rest of my days.   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me just say that as John McCain  communicated with Sam Johnson in the Hanoi Hilton, I say we salute this  fine sailor and say God bless you.
