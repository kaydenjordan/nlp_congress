 Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden and House Democrats should listen  to what former Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to say about debt ceiling  negotiations back in 2019, according to The Washington Post: ``Pelosi,  the California Democrat, said the idea of raising the debt ceiling on  its own and not in conjunction with a budget agreement was not  `acceptable to our Caucus' and, therefore, did not stand a chance of  passage in the House of Representatives.''   Debt ceiling negotiations are nothing new. President Biden has a long  history of engaging in and supporting negotiations over the debt limit,  as do other House Democrats.   House Republicans are committed to a reasonable, responsible, and  sensible solution to our Nation's debt crisis that would limit  Washington's irresponsible spending, save taxpayer dollars, and grow  the American economy.   President Biden and the extreme Democrats' inflationary spending  spree has worked to increase our national debt to unsustainable levels,  over $31.6 trillion, with annual deficits of $1.5 trillion.   While Joe Biden has no plan to avoid debt default, House Republicans  are committed to sensible debt ceiling negotiations.                    Congratulating Stuarts Draft FFA Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Stuarts Draft High  School team for winning the Virginia State Future Farmers of America  forestry championship at the Mountain Gateway Community College in  Clifton Forge. These outstanding students exemplify leadership and are  model representatives of the organization.   The forestry competition included being able to identify tree types  and disorders, pinpoint wood products, as well as pass a knowledge exam  and identify and navigate maps.   Led by Coach William Monroel, as well as advised by agriculture  teacher Lindsey Baber, these champions include freshman Kelli Weaver  and seniors Anna Grace Henderson, Will Monroe, and Steven Ramsey.   As Virginia's Sixth District is the number one agriculture district  in the Commonwealth, I am always proud to see the next generation of  agriculture leaders participating, excelling, and winning in  competitions like this one.   Congratulations to the Stuarts Draft students, Coach Monroel,  parents, and staff on this well-deserved victory.         Recognizing Clarke County High School Girls' Basketball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Clarke County  High School girls' basketball team for their Virginia Class 2 State  championship victory. These impressive young ladies stepped up big and  beat the defending State champs, Central High School of Wise County,  45-41, for their second State title in the program's history.   Junior guard Selene Good cemented the Eagles' lead by nailing a  dramatic 3-pointer to put the team up by 5. In the final minutes, the  Eagles knocked down 10 of 12 free throws that helped seal the victory.   These champions include: Selene Good, Kayia Williams, Emma Nelson,  Devin Simmons-McDonald, Keira Rohrbach, Willow Oliver, Alainah  McKavish, Bailey Beard, Hailey Evans, and Emily Emmart, led by head  Coach Regina Downing and assistant Shadd McCaw.   Congratulations to all of these talented athletes, coaches, staff,  and parents on this well-deserved State championship.                            ____________________
