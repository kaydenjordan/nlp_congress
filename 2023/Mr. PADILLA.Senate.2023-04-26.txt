 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to a  resolution that has been presented to overturn the EPA's lifesaving  heavy-duty NOX rule.   Across the country, heavy-duty vehicles, including trucks and buses,  make up one-third of all transportation NOX emissions. Now,  this is the same source of smog and soot that darkens skies in many  communities and certainly poisons the lungs of too many Americans.   In an effort to address those real challenges, the EPA's heavy-duty  vehicle pollution rule is projected to cut NOX emissions  from the heavy-duty sector by nearly half over the next dozen years.  This represents a monumental investment and significant step forward in  our Nation's health and air quality that will benefit all Americans.  But instead of supporting this rule, some Members have suggested that  we reverse course and instead leave in place an outdated pollution  standard--a rule that even the heavy-duty vehicle industry acknowledges  is too weak--and, in so doing, endanger the lives of thousands of  Americans. This makes no sense.   Consider the Inland Empire in Southern California. Truly this region,  this geographical area, is the heart of our Nation's supply chain. No  one in the Inland Empire wants the economy to shutter, but residents in  the region know all too well the dangers that surround them. Children's  playgrounds, veterans health centers, schools, and entire neighborhoods  are surrounded by warehouses and distribution centers. Now, the  warehouses in and of themselves aren't threatening our air quality or  public health, but think about the emissions from the trucks that carry  goods to and from those warehouses. As a result, communities throughout  the Inland Empire, which happen to also be mostly Latino and low-income  communities, experience higher rates of asthma, decreased lung function  in children, and higher rates of cancer. It is not hyperbole. The data  is there. Statistics are clear.   It is not just the Inland Empire. I raise that as the most  significant example. In fact, it is communities all across the country  near freight corridors that are impacted--almost 72 million people who  live near freight routes.   So yes, Mr. President, I am standing up for the fundamental human  right to clean air for all Americans.   Now, truth be told, I actually wanted the EPA to be more ambitious in  its final NOX rule and to align more closely with  California's stringent heavy-duty vehicle rules. California proudly  leads the Nation in decarbonization and emissions reduction, and we  have done so by working thoughtfully and collectively with industry and  communities to cut deadly NOX and other pollution from  vehicles while we transition to zero-emission vehicles.   So to my colleagues who claim negative business or economic impacts,  California is doing this while having just grown from being the fifth  largest economy in the world to the fourth largest economy in the  world. Economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually  exclusive. Economic growth and protecting public health are not  mutually exclusive. We can and must do it all together.   Last I checked from business leaders whom I talked to--I mentioned  industries at the table and also at the State level--they actually  appreciate that regulatory certainty that I know you and I have talked  about, Mr. President, where we lay out a rule, an agenda, a policy  objective, and work together to create a plan to achieve it and keep  that plan, not ripsaw back and forth about what regulations are going  to be in place from one year to the next, from one congressional  majority to the next, et cetera.   I am also continuing to push the EPA to finalize a strong phase 3  heavy-duty vehicle rule with my clean air and clean transportation  partners in the Senate, including Chairman Carper of the Environment  and Public Works Committee and Senator Markey and others.   But, at the very least, we can't undercut two decades of progress we  have already made, and this CRA undermines the scientific and technical  expertise behind these important standards and public health  protections. And we know that the CRA is part of a bigger effort to  stop the bold action we are taking to tackle the climate crisis.   So, colleagues, for the sake of clean air, for the sake of our  environment, and for the sake of the health of all communities across  the country, I urge you to oppose this repeal.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Sandra Nash Baldonado, the former mayor of Claremont, CA, and a  beloved community leader.   During an intrepid lifetime of service and generosity, any number of  friends across the country will remember her knocking doors in Southern  California with her kids by her side, serving our Nation at the C.I.A.  in Washington, organizing Lady Bird Johnson's campaign tour through the  South in the 1960s, or forging ahead to find a permanent home for the  Claremont Lewis Museum of Art to bring life to the town she loved most.   Born in Shanghai in 1935, Sandy had a very international childhood,  with her family living everywhere from Canada and Mexico to New York  City. She attended Smith College, where she earned her undergraduate  degree in economics, her first stop in a lifelong quest for knowledge  that would lead her to earn her master's degree in education from  Claremont Graduate School and her law degree from Whittier School of  Law.   In 1959, after marrying her first husband Arthur Baldonado, the  couple moved to Southern California where they would eventually make  their home, raise four children, and start their new lives. As a point  of personal privilege, it is not lost on me that only in the time since  Sandy followed her then Brooklyn Dodgers out west have the Dodgers  become one of the most successful franchises in professional sports,  with six of their seven World Series titles coming since 1959.   In 1992, Sandy married her late husband George Hart, with whom she  traveled the world.   Across her long and accomplished career, Sandy served as a sixth- grade teacher, president of the League of Women Voters, member of the  Three Valley Municipal Water District's Board of Directors, vice chair  of the California Democratic Party, family lawyer, city council member  and later mayor of the city of Claremont, and president of the  Claremont Museum of Art.   In every role she held, whether teaching sixth graders or  representing women and children in family law, the people and  communities around her were made better because of her boundless  capacity to care.   My thoughts are with all those she now leaves behind, including her  children and their spouses Charles and Michele Baldonado, James  Baldonado, Andrew and Susan Baldonado, and Liana and Ezra Bayles; as  well as her grandchildren Caroline, Pauline, Alex, Grace, Charlie, and  Selina.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Richard Joseph Riordan, a veteran, businessman, father, proud  Californian, and the 39th mayor of the city of Los Angeles.   Born in Flushing, Queens, in New York City, and the youngest of eight  siblings, Mayor Riordan's intellect and work ethic earned him a degree  in philosophy from Princeton University, before he went on to serve our  Nation in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. His keen mind for  business and legal matters brought him to the University of Michigan  Law School and later to a career in legal practice and private equity  in Los Angeles, where he made his home. But to many Angelenos, we know  him best for his time as mayor of Los Angeles from 1993 to 2001.   I had the privilege of serving alongside Mayor Riordan during my  first 2 years on the Los Angeles City Council,  [[Page S1380]]  and I am proud of the work we did together on behalf of Los Angeles  families. Mayor Riordan cared deeply about the city's children and  prioritized the modernization of parks, libraries, and recreational,  and cultural opportunities for children. He was instrumental in  bringing the Children's Museum of Los Angeles, now known as the  Discovery Cube Los Angeles, to the San Fernando Valley.   His response to crisis earned Los Angeles national recognition, both  in rebuilding after the devastating Northridge earthquake in 1994 and  working with the U.S. Department of Justice to reform the Los Angeles  Police Department and advance community-based policing efforts. And he  was instrumental in bringing the Democratic Convention to Los Angeles  in 2000, showcasing the City of Angels to a national audience.   Angela and I offer our deepest condolences and appreciation to Mayor  Riordan's family and loved ones. His legacy has left a lasting mark on  our city, and his loss will be deeply felt by all Angelenos.                            ____________________
