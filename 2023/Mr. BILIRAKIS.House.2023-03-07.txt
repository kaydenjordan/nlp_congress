 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  effort of my Hernando County constituents from Brooksville, Florida,  who mobilized rapidly under the skillful leadership of Hernando County  Sheriff Al Nienhuis to search for 2-year-old JJ Rowland, who went  missing 24 hours earlier.   Against all hope, Sheriff Nienhuis and his team of dedicated  professionals coordinated a colossal effort with hundreds of volunteers  in their search for little JJ.   Through the powers of prayer and the remarkable instincts of  volunteer Roy Link, a retired marine, the sweet, precious child was  found safe and sound deep in the woods, a mile and a half from the home  he wandered from. What a miracle, Mr. Speaker.   I am so proud and honored to represent this loving and faithful  community.   God bless them all.   I thank all who prayed for this wonderful little boy.                            ____________________
