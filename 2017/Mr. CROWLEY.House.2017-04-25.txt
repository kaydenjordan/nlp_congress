 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  I want to recognize the bipartisan support for this resolution. It  heartens me. I know of the great work of the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass) for quite some time, as well as others on the  other side of the aisle, on this issue.   She, along with the Sudan Caucus, the Africa Subcommittee, and the  CBC Africa Task Force have been working every day in a very tenacious  way to draw attention to this issue and demand a strong international  response.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that this is a crisis. I agree with my  colleague and friend from New Jersey (Mr. Smith): it is a manmade  crisis.   The United Nations is reporting that the current situation in a  number of countries in Africa and the Middle East constitutes the most  serious humanitarian crisis since its founding over 70 years ago. In  South Sudan alone, 100,000 people are in a state of famine as we speak,  and up to 5 million more are in serious danger of being in famine.  These are men, women, and children who are in danger of not having  enough food and water.   The simple fact is, without international aid and assistance, people  will die--many people will die. But it doesn't have to be this way. The  world is smart enough and resourceful enough to ensure that the worst  of this tragedy can be prevented before the situation gets further out  of hand, but it is going to take a full-court press by this  administration, by the State Department, and by the international  community.   I grew up in Queens, New York, in an Irish-American family. At an  early age, I learned of the Great Hunger in Ireland that killed more  than 1 million people and forced more than 2 million more to flee.  Those Irish didn't have to die just because a potato crop went bad.   In Ireland at the time, food was actually being exported out of  Ireland while people starved. So it was starvation not only because of  food loss, but also because of politics and repression--very much the  same situation that exists in parts of Africa and in Yemen--and only  politics could ultimately change the underlying conditions in Ireland.   Now, we need both aid and political pressure to help stop this famine  and all of the ongoing famines now. So I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this legislation. I urge that the State  Department: Seize the bull by the horns and take action. Don't let  history look back on America and say: Why did you not do enough while  millions starved? Let history reflect the goodness of the heart of the  American people, which I know exists.   To this day, the people of Ireland remember the sultans from the  then-Ottoman Empire that helped. They remember the Choctaw Nation, who  gave $700 during the 1840s to help the starving Irish.   Let America be that shining country in the future when Africa looks  back and says: Who was there to help? Let it be America. That is the  American way. Working with our allies, America will succeed in  preventing this famine if we move expeditiously.
