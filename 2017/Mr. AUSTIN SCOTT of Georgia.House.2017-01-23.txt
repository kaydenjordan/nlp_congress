 Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege  of representing a beautiful part of this country. Many of you have seen  it on the news lately. Cook County is ground zero for the storms that  hit this past weekend. We have seven deaths in Cook County, two in  Berrien, two in Brooks, four in Dougherty--outside of my district--and  we have four lives lost in Mississippi as well.   As I speak to you, the Georgia Forestry Commission is searching for  five who are unaccounted for with cadaver dogs. I would ask that you  pray for the families who have lost so much, and I would ask that we  also pray that they find those who are unaccounted for.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say one thank you as well to the first  responders, the volunteers, those from other counties who have provided  mutual aid, and the churches who have opened their doors to take care  of those who have lost their homes. Thank you.   And I also want to thank Governor Deal and President Trump, both of  whom were available yesterday to offer their support and pledge to help  our communities rebuild.                            ____________________
