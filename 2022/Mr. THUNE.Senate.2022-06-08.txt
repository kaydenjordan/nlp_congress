 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, a Federal judge blocked the  Biden Administration from lifting title 42 COVID restrictions. It was a  welcome decision that will hopefully stave off an additional flood of  illegal immigration on our southern border. But it has been pretty much  the only bit of good news on this front, because the situation at our  southern border is out of control.   In April, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 234,088  individuals attempting to cross our border illegally--234,088. That is  the highest number ever recorded.   The Border Patrol is stretched thin. A recent article reported that  ``around 60 percent of CBP agents have been assigned to process  migrants, taking them away from field work.'' Sixty percent. Detention  facilities are overflowing and massive numbers of illegal immigrants  are being released into the country, many of whom will never report to  an immigration office as ordered.   In short, our southern border is in chaos, and if title 42 is lifted,  the situation is almost guaranteed to become much worse.   The Department of Homeland Security has estimated that as many as  18,000 migrants per day could attempt to cross our southern border if  the policy is lifted. Eighteen thousand per day--that is more than  double the number we are currently experiencing, and the administration  has yet to implement any plan for dealing with such a situation.    Illegal immigration, especially the kind of out-of-control illegal  immigration we are now experiencing, has serious consequences.  Criminals, including human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang  members, regularly attempt to cross our southern border. The worse the  situation at our border gets, the easier it is for those individuals to  make their way into the United States, and that has consequences for  our entire country.   South Dakota law enforcement officials tell me that they are seizing  drugs that they can trace directly back to the cartels who smuggle  these drugs across our border. Our country is currently in the midst of  a fentanyl crisis. In fact, right now, fentanyl overdose is the leading  cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. And where  is all this fentanyl coming from? Most of it is being trafficked across  our southern border; and when more and more of our Customs and Border  Protection agents have been pulled off the border to process migrants,  it is pretty much a guarantee that drug smugglers are having a much  easier time in getting their product into the country.   I mentioned that Customs and Border Protection encountered more than  234,000 individuals who were attempting to cross our southern border  illegally in the month of April, but that number only reflects  individuals the CBP has actually apprehended. In April, Homeland  Security Secretary Mayorkas testified that, in addition to the 1.7  million apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal year 2021, there  were more than 389,000 ``got-aways''--individuals the Border Patrol saw  but was unable to apprehend.   The Economist recently reported:         One border expert estimates that less than 20 percent of       people trying to cross the border undetected are stopped.    The administration has attempted to suggest that the surge in illegal  immigration that we have been experiencing since President Biden took  office is, in large part, a function of conditions in other countries;  but while these factors exist--and there are legitimate asylum claims  at the border--that doesn't mean there is nothing the President can do  about our out-of-control border situation. Better border security is  well within the President's control. He is just not interested in  putting it in place, and his Vice President has all but formally  abandoned her role as border czar.   In fact, since taking office, the President has invited increased  illegal immigration with the policy decisions that he has made. On his  very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the declaration of  a national emergency at our southern border; he halted construction of  the border wall; he revoked a Trump administration order that called  for the government to faithfully execute our immigration laws; and his  Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines pausing deportations  except under certain conditions. That was all--all--on his first day in  office.   Needless to say, the effect of all of this was to declare to the  world that the U.S. borders were effectively open. And, of course, the  President's anti-border security efforts didn't end there.   The President has significantly limited the ability of Immigration  and Customs Enforcement to enforce immigration laws. Deportations  dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in the  interior of the country. In March, the administration rescinded a 2019  rule expanding the expedited removal for individuals here illegally;  and as I have mentioned, of course, the administration is attempting to  remove title 42 COVID-19 restrictions with no visible plan to control  the resulting surge in illegal immigration.  [[Page S2846]]    President Biden has made it known that he wants to create a ``fair,  orderly, and humane'' immigration system. Well, he is failing on all  fronts. I don't need to tell anyone that the situation at the southern  border, right now, is far from orderly, but it is also not humane. The  President and other members of his party tend to convey an attitude  that strong border security and the enforcement of our Nation's  immigration laws are somehow not compassionate or humane. Well, they  are wrong. We are seeing the effects of the President's anti-border  security policies at our southern border right now, and the results are  neither compassionate nor humane.   Encouraging individuals to make the oftentimes dangerous journey to  our southern border in the hopes they will be able to slip across  illegally is not humane. Encouraging families and, at times,  unaccompanied children to expose themselves to the dangers of heat and  the elements and human trafficking is not compassionate. At least 557  migrants died while attempting to cross the southern border during  fiscal year 2021. That, too, was a record number. How many of them were  encouraged to make the journey by the President's lax border policies?   And I haven't even mentioned the lack of compassion and humanity the  President displays for Americans affected by the illegal immigration  crisis. Straining the resources of U.S. border communities by smoothing  the way for illegal immigration and cross-border criminal activity is  not compassionate. Making it easier for cartels to flood our Nation  with fentanyl is not humane.   The President of the United States--any President--has a special  responsibility for our Nation's security, and that includes securing  our Nation's border. So far, President Biden has spectacularly failed  to meet that responsibility. This week, a caravan of thousands has  reportedly started working its way north, through Mexico, aligning with  the Summits of the Americas.   It is long past time for the President to get serious about the  border crisis that he has created, and this summit could be an  opportunity for him to finally take action. I hope that he will reverse  his current course before his administration's signature accomplishment  ends up being a legacy of chaos at our southern border.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Utah (Mr. Romney).
