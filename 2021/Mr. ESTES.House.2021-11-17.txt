 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this  Special Order.   Madam Speaker, following the Biden administration's overreaching  mandates, hundreds of Kansans have shared their concerns with me about  how this would affect their jobs, livelihoods, and families.   One vaccinated individual wrote saying, ``I would love for people to  be vaccinated, but mandating a vaccination, and even worse, making the  employers the enforcers, is yet another example of government pushing  more onto the plates of business managers.''   Others tell me how they have been at the same company for decades,  some near retirement and some who continue to work faithfully in person  each day through the pandemic, especially our first responders and  healthcare workers, yet they are being demoted or forced to retire or  resign because they made some personal healthcare choices. One teacher  wrote, ``My doctor and I discussed the vaccine and deemed it would not  be good for me to get it.   Madam Speaker, these Kansans aren't anti-vaccine, they just don't  believe that the Federal Government should be forcing them and their  neighbors to make a healthcare decision or lose a job.   My colleagues and I are utilizing the Congressional Review Act to  attempt to strike down one of these mandates, hopefully putting an end  to this overreach by the administration and the Federal Government.
