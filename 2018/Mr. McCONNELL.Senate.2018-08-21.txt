 Madam President, the Obama administration's so-called  Clean Power Plan offered a typical story from that era, an innocent- seeming name, a pleasant-sounding objective, but underneath, an  intrusive regulatory regime built not on effective policy but on far- left ideology. That is why I am so grateful today that the Trump  administration is unveiling its plan to pare back this unfair,  unworkable, and likely illegal policy.   Remember, the far left tried to push through radical legislation like  an energy tax through the last Congress. Well, enough of us knew it  would have hurt American competitiveness, victimized the poor, and done  little to actually give the American people a cleaner environment, but  instead of learning from those failures, the Obama administration tried  to go it alone and impose their radical agenda unilaterally.   The so-called Clean Power Plan they dreamed up would have had no  meaningful effect on global emissions. It would, however, have packed  up middle-class American jobs and sent them right overseas. It would  have piled a heavier burden onto the most vulnerable families. Lower  income Americans are hit the hardest when energy costs take off, and  this plan was projected to yield double-digit percentage increases in  electricity costs of 40 States, of course, including Kentucky.   Unfair, ineffective, unaffordable, more than likely illegal. That is  quite the pedigree.   That is why I fought the Obama administration's entire War on Coal,  which was centered around this regulation, tooth and nail. I submitted  an amicus brief to the courts when this was challenged for exceeding  the scope and intent of the Clean Air Act. I championed legislation to  cancel it entirely. On two occasions, I wrote to every Governor in the  Nation asking them to not be complicit in implementing this outrageous  overreach until the courts had ruled on its legality.   My colleagues and I have been at this for quite some time.   That is why the President's actions today are so encouraging. Today's  proposed rule is the first step in the process. I look forward to  engaging in this process as it moves forward toward a better outcome  for Kentucky and for the entire country.                                Appropriations    Madam President, on another matter, the Senate is considering the  eighth and ninth of 12 appropriations measure for fiscal year 2019.  They will deliver on most of the important promises we make to the  American people.   First and foremost is our promise to defend the Nation and to meet  our obligation to the brave men and women who do so, to ensure that if  we send them into battle, they will be prepared and equipped to  prevail.  [[Page S5734]]    Secretary Mattis and our Nation's top military commanders have made  their assessments perfectly clear. Our security and our interests are  challenged every day across the globe by a wide array of threats,  whether nation states or terrorist groups. They include the  destabilizing influences of Iran in the Middle East and Russia in  Eastern Europe, the challenges we face on the Korean Peninsula, the  security of our allies, and the stability of international commerce in  the Pacific. Our leaders have outlined the threats we face and the  strategies it will take to check them, but they have also explained how  the past decade's pattern of inconsistent and insufficient funding  undermined readiness and borrowed from the future. This Congress and  this President are determined to right the ship.   Earlier this year, we did away with the arbitrary spending caps that  had cut our military readiness and modernization. We passed a defense  bill that authorized the largest year-on-year increases in defense  spending in 15 years. This week, we have the opportunity to follow  through by appropriating the necessary resources.   The Defense appropriations measure before us will support American  military installations at home and abroad. My fellow Kentuckians and I  are more than proud to host installations like Fort Campbell, Fort  Knox, and the Blue Grass Army Depot. This legislation supports the most  important work that goes on at those facilities and the communities  that revolve around them.   Each of my colleagues, I am sure, can offer similar reports of the  resources directed to military operations in their States.   Whether they are serving at sea or training with the 101st Airborne  Division in Kentucky, our Nation's men and women in uniform will  receive some well-deserved benefits from the legislation we are  considering today. That includes expanded access to onbase services for  veterans, billions in new funding for housing, support infrastructure,  child and health services, and the largest pay raise for our military  personnel in nearly a decade.   It is impossible to put a price on the sacrifices warfighters--and  their families--make in service to our Nation, but it is within our  power to give them the support they deserve on behalf of a grateful  nation, and that is precisely what this legislation will do.   I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Durbin, who led this bill through  the subcommittee process. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan measure when the time comes to pass it.                               Economic Growth    Madam President, on one final matter, our servicemembers will not be  the only Americans who will be receiving well-deserved pay increases.  As Republicans' pro-opportunity agenda continues to take hold, our  economy continues to steam ahead, and working families across the  country are reaping the benefits.   By now, we are all familiar with the fact that millions of American  workers have received special bonuses, wage increases, or other new  benefits from their employers as a direct result of our Nation's new  Tax Code. We are talking about nationwide employers from AT&T to  Walmart, and local businesses from Glier's Meats in my home State of  Kentucky to Stricks Ag in Montana, and New Hudson Facades in  Pennsylvania. These are, in some cases, the multithousand-dollar  bonuses that my friends, the Democratic leaders in the House and in the  Senate, tried to shrug off as ``crumbs''--maybe in New York or San  Francisco but not much anywhere else.   Remember, they persuaded every one of our Democratic colleagues to  vote against tax cuts.   Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found the Employment  Cost Index--that is everything American employers spend on employee  wages and benefits--has increased 2.8 percent in the last 12 months  alone. As CNBC reported, that is the strongest year-over-year growth  since the autumn of 2008.   So let me say that again. By this measure, on Republicans' watch,  worker pay and benefits has already logged a faster 12-month growth  rate than we ever achieved in all of President Obama's time in office.   It is yet another data point: American workers, job creators, and  middle-class families are enjoying one of their best economic moments  in a long time, and it is thanks, in part, to Republicans' economic  agenda, which is getting Washington's foot off the brake.   I am proud this week's appropriations bill will give American  servicemembers a raise. I am also proud our healthy economy is giving a  raise to millions more Americans, and Republican policies are helping  to make that happen.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are making good progress on the  rather large package of appropriations bills, including Defense and  Labor and HHS, but just to make sure we are in a position to wrap it up  before we depart for the week, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  Senate amendment No. 3695.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  H.R. 6157.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, August 22; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 6157; further,  that the Senate recess from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:40 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, August 22, 2018, at 10 a.m. --- ---                            ____________________
