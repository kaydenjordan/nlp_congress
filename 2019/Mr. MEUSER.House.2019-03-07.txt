 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1.   The people have a right to know what this bill truly is: a Big  Government, central command takeover of our elections by the new House  majority. This bill should be called the Democratic Politician  Protection Act.   This legislation is virtually a complete takeover by the Federal  Government of State and local voting jurisdictions. It imposes new  mandates, including more than 2 weeks of mandatory early voting and  same-day registration, and diminishes the process of election day  voting by expanding absentee voting and allowing both current and newly  registered voters to cast their ballot by mail, with no additional  safeguards to that process.   The bill also allows felons to vote, violating our Constitution by  usurping the 14th Amendment ability of States to determine whether  felons may vote or not.   An example of its impracticality can be seen in Lenhartsville  Borough, Berks County, in my district, a small borough with a polling  place that averages 60 voters each election. This bill would mandate  that Lenhartsville open and operate a polling place for 15 days of  early voting. That is absurd.   Astonishingly, this bill also includes a 6-to-1 match of public funds  to the campaign of a candidate that individual taxpayers may not even  support on contributions up to $200. That is a possible $1,200 match of  public funds going to fund political campaigns for each contribution.                                time  1830    This legislation is not for the people. It is for partisan power.  H.R. 1 isn't just terrible policy, it is an attempt to rewrite the  rules of the political process itself and change the rules to favor one  side.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I hope they will  stand with me in defending the Constitution and the sanctity of our  elections. I urge a ``no'' vote.
