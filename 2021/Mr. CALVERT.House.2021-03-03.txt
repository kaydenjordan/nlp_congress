 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment en  bloc No. 4 and the underlying bill.   I have a long list of concerns with this bill, and at the top of this  list is nationwide ballot harvesting.   Democrats in California have already legalized ballot harvesting in  our State. Despite our concerns with the practice, Republicans were  determined to play by the rules and utilized legal ballot collection  methods in the last election.   One amendment in this package, offered by my California colleague,  puts this hypocrisy on full display. Under current law, with my  colleague's amendment, a foreign operative--maybe a Russian operative,  maybe a Chinese spy--could still handle ballots for untold numbers of  people. My colleague's amendment is a blatant attempt to criticize  ballot harvesting only when the other guys do it.   In other words, California Democrats think it is fine when their paid  operatives collect ballots from strangers and throw them in a bag. But  they object when churches try to collect them for members of their  congregation and put them in a box.   Don't be fooled. Democrats don't want to facilitate ballot collection  for all Americans. They just want to make it easier for their  operatives to harvest ballots and will cry foul whenever Republicans  try to play by the same rules.
