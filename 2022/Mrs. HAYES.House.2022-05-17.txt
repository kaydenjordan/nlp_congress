 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the passage of this  bill, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, a historic, $78  billion investment, which will provide training for 1 million workers  per year by 2028. This package includes my bill, the YouthBuild for the  Future Act, which would invest $1 billion into YouthBuild over 6 years.   YouthBuild is a crucial program that is specifically built to help  young people who have not completed their high school degree train for  a high-wage, stable career. But most importantly, it helps those young  people regain their confidence and their ability to be self-sufficient  and contribute to our communities.    My bill makes critical investments to the program, such as reserving  grant funds for rural areas, extending the period of follow-up services  to 2 years, and allowing YouthBuild to fund meals for participants.  These improvements will expand opportunity for young adults and  employers who are clamoring to fill skilled positions that too often  remain vacant.   These are meaningful, life-changing investments for Americans  searching for long-term, high-wage employment. I know that these  programs work because the one in my district and my hometown has young  kids building homes.   Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this reauthorization, I am  proud to support passage, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
