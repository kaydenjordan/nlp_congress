 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 36, a  joint resolution which I am leading in the House.   The evidence is clear: the Saudi Government continues to disregard  the vital distinction between combatants and innocent civilians in  Yemen.   In February, Congress voted to end U.S. support to the Saudi-led  campaign against the Houthis that have left thousands of civilians dead  and created one of the largest humanitarian crises in modern times.   However, the President not only vetoed a resolution, but the  administration is now ramping up support for Saudi Arabia's offensive  actions in Yemen, while simultaneously escalating tensions with Iran.   As I made clear during Foreign Affairs Committee hearings in May, not  only is the administration trying to sell the Saudis more powerful  weapons, but we are giving them the opportunity to build their own.  With this latest proposal, the administration would be transferring  sensitive technology that would allow Saudi Arabia to manufacture these  high-tech weapons directly.   Congress needs to reassert its authority now as a coequal branch of  government. This resolution, which I have led in the House, would make  sure that blatantly offensive weapons aren't sold to the Saudi military  under the guise of defensive uses without congressional review.   I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Senate to block the sale  of precision-guided munitions, which are responsible for some of the  most horrific examples of targeted attacks against civilians.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand  up against this misguided decision, protect innocent lives, and  reassert the authority of Congress.                                time  1330
