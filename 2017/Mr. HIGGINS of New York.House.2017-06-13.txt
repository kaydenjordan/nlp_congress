 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, thousands of  Russians took to the streets of Moscow's Red Square to protest  President Putin's party of crooks and thieves. The protesters chanted  that they want to make Russia free and that they want to live in a  modern democratic state. They want democracy.   Today, in America, here in the Nation's Capitol, another Trump  official is testifying before Congress on Russia's interference with  U.S. elections for the fourth time in as many weeks. There is no doubt  that Russia interfered. This we know. Did Russia interfere in  coordination with Trump officials? With whom and to what extent? This  is what the American people deserve to know.   Today, in America, the talk is how Putin tried to dishonor American  democracy to do one thing, to keep his people from wanting it, the very  democracy that is uniquely America's.   And yesterday, in Moscow, was about what Putin couldn't do. He  couldn't keep young Russia from taking to the streets of his capital  city denouncing him as a crook and a coward and demanding American  democracy.                            ____________________
