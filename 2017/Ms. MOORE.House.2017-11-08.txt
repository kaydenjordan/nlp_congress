 Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from the Badger State  for yielding to me. I am so pleased to join him, along with  Representative Mark Pocan, in support of this amendment.   It is critical, Mr. Chairman. Wisconsinites value our natural  resources like no other. The Great Lakes are an immense source of  regional pride as well as a great economic engine for our region, and  we know that these resources are constantly under attack from a variety  of threats. One particularly nefarious threat is invasive species.   My colleagues and I are all aware of the costs these species impose.  These costs are something that, unfortunately, the Great Lakes region  knows too well. From the sea lamprey to the zebra mussel, to the  carnivorous Asian carp now advancing toward the region, we have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars dealing with the damage created when  these invasive and nuisance species get into the Great Lakes ecosystem;  and keeping them out of the Great Lakes in the first place is the most  effective strategy.   A stitch in time saves nine, so I am pleased that this is a  bipartisan amendment. I want to emphasize that the amendment does not  predetermine any particular outcome or decision.   There is no magic bullet, Mr. Chairman, to the problem of invasive  species given that there are so many pathways for them to get into a  body of water, including through ballast water, but this commonsense  amendment gives us a more effective tool in that fight.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  vote for it.
