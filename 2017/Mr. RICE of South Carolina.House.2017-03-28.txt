 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  friend and an outstanding man from my home in Horry County, South  Carolina, who has dedicated his entire life to education and public  service. Mr. Neyle Wilson retired last month after 14 years of serving  as the president of Horry Georgetown Technical College and leaves  behind a great legacy of selflessness and devotion to education in the  community.   Under Mr. Wilson's direction, Horry County Technical College added  nine new buildings, 40 new programs of study, and saw enrollment  double. He never failed to go above and beyond to complete the task at  hand. Often he was called on at the last minute to provide education or  skilled workplace training to fill spots at existing local businesses  or businesses looking to move to Horry County to employ South  Carolinians, and he always came through.   Mr. Wilson was a credit to Horry County Technical College and the  entire Grand Strand community. He led thousands of South Carolinians to  meaningful jobs. Through these and his many other meaningful  contributions, he will always be remembered.                            ____________________
