 Mr. President, I rise to pay my respects to Phil  Hanceford, a tireless and broadly respected advocate for public land  conservation. Phil unexpectedly passed away on August 14, 2022.   Phil served more than 15 years as an attorney, policy expert, and  conservation director at The Wilderness Society--TWS--in Denver, CO. He  began his career with an internship at TWS while a student at the  University of Colorado School of Law. Across a distinguished, 15-year  career, Phil played a significant role in protecting some of the most  important public lands in the West, from Bears Ears and Grand  Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, to conservation areas in the  Pacific Northwest, the Mojave Desert, Nevada, and Colorado.   Phil was an expert in land management planning, specializing in the  management of national monuments and other Bureau of Land Management-- BLM--conservation lands. He inspired and mentored countless individuals  at TWS and across the conservation community, contributing his deep  expertise and humble spirit to all who sought his advice or support.  Over the years, his guidance helped shape a new cohort of effective  advocates for America's public lands.   Phil's greatest accomplishments include helping to create the  National Landscape Conservation System; the adoption of the Desert  Renewable Energy Conservation Plan that conserved wildlands and  promoted renewable energy development across nearly 11 million acres in  southern California; the restoration of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monuments that protects over 3 million acres of  stunning desert wilderness in southern Utah; and the establishment of  Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado.   Phil was a champion of the BLM and earned the lasting respect of  Bureau staff across the country for his warmth and expertise. He often  went out of his way to connect with employees across the organization  and fiercely advocated for getting staff into the field to see  firsthand the places they worked to protect.   Phil grounded his work in humor, kindness, determination, and grace.  He genuinely believed in the promise of public lands as a legacy for  everyone--an issue that could bring Americans together regardless of  where you lived or which political beliefs you held. Phil's  [[Page S4852]]  distinguished career was cut too short, but he leaves behind a legacy  that will endure for generations to come. I extend my deepest  condolences to Phil's wife Keenan and their young daughter Hazel, along  with the rest of Phil's family, friends, and colleagues.                            ____________________
