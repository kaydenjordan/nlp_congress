 Mr. President, most Americans agree that the cost of  prescription drugs is too high. Most Americans agree that President  Biden has done the right thing by reducing the monthly cost of insulin  to $35 so that millions of people facing diabetes can afford their  medication. Most Americans agree that it is almost impossible to  explain why American drug companies sell the same drugs in Canada for a  fraction of the cost they charge American consumers. Most Americans  agree that the pharmaceutical companies should be able to take  advantage of basic research by Agencies like the National Institutes of  Health but, when it comes to their profit-making, they ought to be  reasonable with the American taxpayers, who started them down the road  to a successful product.    Most Americans also agree that the No. 1 driver in the cost of health  insurance premiums is the cost of prescription drugs. BlueCross  BlueShield of Chicago has told me as much. It stands to reason.   That is why it is very difficult to understand the statement just  made by the Republican leader in the Senate, who is suggesting that the  idea of negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies so that Medicare,  for example, doesn't pay the highest price for drugs isn't a reasonable  thing.   What I heard from the Republican leader was this was prescription  drug socialism--socialism--that we would go to the private sector and  say: Lifesaving drugs should be affordable. You are entitled to a  profit, but you are not entitled to rip off taxpayers or consumers  across America.   That seems like a reasonable approach. In fact, it seems so  reasonable that someone suggested we do that for our veterans years  ago. The Veterans' Administration has been negotiating prescription  drug pricing for years.   What the Senator from Kentucky refers to as ``unelected bureaucrats''  are the officials of the Veterans' Administration who, on behalf of the  veterans and their families, sit down at a table and negotiate a  reasonable cost so that veterans will always have those drugs available  to them and the government will pay not the highest price but a  reasonable price for the product.   That has been going on for decades, and I don't recall any  Republican--or Democrat, for that matter--who stood before the Senate  or the House and said: That is a bad idea. The Veterans' Administration  ought to pay a much higher price for drugs, and taxpayers ought to foot  the difference.   The reason you don't hear that is it doesn't make sense. We should be  able to negotiate reasonable pricing for pharmaceutical drugs in  Medicare, just as we do in the Veterans' Administration. That is what  President Biden has suggested.   If you took a look at the top 10 drugs that the Medicare system is  buying across America, not surprisingly, these drugs, which have  tongue-twister names, are familiar to most Americans. Why?   The pharmaceutical companies have put so many ads on television for  the drug Xarelto that we can not only pronounce it but we can spell it.  And Xarelto, of course, is a drug that appeals to many people but  certainly to senior citizens.   Now, for the record, there are only two nations in the world that  allow television advertising of pharmaceutical drugs: the United States  and New Zealand, of all places. So why do the pharmaceutical companies  spend more money on television advertising and marketing than they do  on research to find new drugs and cures? Well, they do that because  they make money at it.   They are trying to reach American consumers--in this case, senior  citizens--and convince them, the next time they go for a doctor's  appointment, to ask for one of these drugs.   Now, the doctor may decide to counsel the person that that drug is  not appropriate for the challenges of the medical situation they face.  He may say there is a generic that is much cheaper, and he may try to  talk them out of the idea. But, after some time, the doctors usually  give in to the patients. They have a limited amount of time to debate  with them, and they have got to move on to another patient. And so the  high-priced prescription drug advertised on television is then sold to  the senior citizen. And as a result, the taxpayers, through Medicare,  pay for a large portion of that high-priced drug. That is an  unfortunate system, but it is very profitable for the pharmaceutical  companies.   So to call this socialism is to ignore the obvious. We want Americans  to have access to affordable, effective drugs, whether they are buying  them as private citizens or through programs like Medicare and  Medicaid. What the President has said is: I should take my authority as  President, given to me by Congress with a measure that received only  Democratic votes, and negotiate drug prices down to an affordable  level--for the government and for individuals.   Some may call that ``prescription drug socialism.'' I call it common  sense. We should protect American consumers from high-priced  prescription drugs. Why the Republican leader takes the opposite  position is his business, but I think most Americans believe it is a  reasonable approach.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, on a separate issue, I rise today to discuss the  critical role that U.S. attorneys play in keeping America and our  communities safe. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have come  to the floor to request unanimous consent to take up and confirm U.S.  attorney nominations.    Across the United States, men and women are chosen to head U.S.  Attorney Offices through the Department of  [[Page S4612]]  Justice. It is a major responsibility. I have seen many U.S. attorneys  in my lifetime and my time in the Senate, and I know them to be  carefully screened before they reach this level. They go through  background checks--extensive background checks--to make certain there  are no questions about their background before they are appointed to  this position. They then go through the Judiciary Committee of the  Senate, which I chair, carefully screened by both Democrats and  Republicans. Then they are voted on in the committee and sent to the  floor here for approval.   Unfortunately, we have run into an obstacle. Last year, we went  through an exercise twice when a Republican Senate colleague refused to  allow the Senate to confirm nearly 12 Justice Department nominees by  voice vote, which is the typical approach used under Presidents of both  political parties. Thankfully, the Senator involved in that particular  issue lifted his objections in time for these 12 to be appointed to  U.S. attorney posts across the United States.   We were able to get the U.S. attorneys and marshals confirmed and in  place so they could go to work. And, thank goodness, we did.   Unfortunately, here we stand again today, finding ourselves in a  position where a single Senator objects to the timely confirmation of  U.S. attorney nominees.   In short, one Senator--one Senator--is making it more difficult for  us to put women and men in the position of U.S. attorney for the  prosecution of violent criminals, tracking down fugitives, and  protecting Americans from gang violence, cyber crime, terrorism,  narcotics, and fraud.   It is an awesome job to be U.S. attorney because of the possibilities  of all of the vulnerabilities of American citizens.   Remember when extreme voices were crying out ``defund the police''?  We knew better as Americans. Sure, reform is appropriate, but we need  the police, just as we need prosecutors--criminal prosecutors. Now, we  have one Senator who has decided to stop this effort at criminal  prosecution by these new U.S. attorneys.   It is worth taking a moment to think about what U.S. attorneys do.  The position of U.S. attorney is nearly as old as the Nation. It was  created as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was passed by the  first Congress and signed into law by President George Washington.   U.S. attorneys are empowered to prosecute all Federal criminal  offenses; and we have recognized, since the founding of America, that  they are an integral part of our justice system.   U.S. attorneys play a critical role in enforcing the law, promoting  public safety, protecting our communities. Blocking the confirmations  of U.S. attorneys threatens public safety and puts many Americans and  their families, including the most vulnerable among us, at greater  risk.   Why would we knowingly want to put our families that we represent in  States across America at greater risk by holding up the employment of  U.S. attorneys?   Now, we have heard a lot of tough talk about law and order from a lot  of Senators. But when it comes to law and order, we shouldn't allow one  Senator to prevent us from confirming well-qualified law enforcement  nominations today.   This Senator has vowed to ``grind the Department of Justice to a  halt.''   Let me repeat that.   This Senator has vowed to ``grind the Department of Justice to a  halt.''   And all of this because of why? He is upset that special counsel Jack  Smith has indicted the former President of the United States on  multiple felonies. This is a protest, a political protest, for an  action taken by a special counsel. But he is doing it at the expense of  families all across America.   Let me repeat that.   A Member of this body is undermining our government's efforts to  prosecute violent crimes, terrorism, and crimes against children  because he does not like it that one of his political allies is being  held accountable for his actions. He is doing so despite the fact that  these are exceptional--exceptional--nominees for U.S. attorneys, and  there is no principled basis to delay their confirmation.   Let me describe some of these U.S. attorneys who are being held up by  this one Republican Senator.   Todd Gee, nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  Mississippi, is dedicated to the rule of law and longtime career in  public service. A native of Vicksburg, MS, Mr. Gee attended George  Washington University and Tulane Law School. He spent several years as  an assistant U.S. attorney right here in the District of Columbia. He  prosecuted homicides, carjackings, and gun crimes. In one case, he was  the lead prosecutor in securing the convictions for seven members of a  deadly street gang that had been indicted for multiple murders. Since  2018, Mr. Gee has served as Deputy Chief of the Public Integrity  Section at the Department of Justice. He is a dedicated public servant  with significant experience as a Federal prosecutor. He is the person  for the job of U.S. attorney in Mississippi.   Don't take it from me, take it from both Mississippi Senators, both  Republicans, who approved his nomination. And yet he is being held up.   Tara McGrath, nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District  of California, devoted her legal career to keeping America safe. Ms.  McGrath attended Boston College and the University of Michigan Law  School before beginning her career as Deputy Staff Judge Advocate with  the U.S. Marine Corps. She was honorably discharged after 6 years of  service in the Marine Corps and then began serving as Federal  prosecutor in the Southern District of California.   During her time with the U.S. Attorney's Office, she received awards  for her work on crime prevention and prisoner re-entry and handled drug  importation, human trafficking cases, and gang prosecutions.   Notably, Ms. McGrath led the investigation of a large-scale  racketeering and drug-trafficking operation run by the Mexican cartels  in San Diego County that resulted in 51 indictments against 40  defendants.   How many times have we heard Members from the other side of the aisle  talk about the scourge of fentanyl in the United States, the narcotics  that are killing too many Americans every single day? What is going to  stop that? A lot of different things. But one thing that has to be part  of the equation is a criminal prosecutor who knows how to bring them to  court and hold them responsible for the deadly narcotics and deaths  across America.   Why in the world would we stop Ms. McGrath from becoming a U.S.  attorney in California, where she has a proven record of doing just  that? By holding up her nomination for no specific reason, we are  jeopardizing the safety of so many people who innocently expect us to  do our duty.   These are individuals--the ones she has prosecuted--responsible for  drive-by shootings, child abduction attempts, meth distribution. Thanks  to Ms. McGrath, they are off the streets.   She recently returned to her military roots, served as a lawyer for  the Marine Corps in Okinawa in Japan since 2019. She has represented  America admirably. She will be an outstanding U.S. attorney.   A third U.S. attorney nominee who is being held up by this Senator is  Rebecca Lutzko. This one is interesting. She was nominated to be U.S.  attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, the home State of the  Senator who is holding up her nomination.   She is a longtime Federal prosecutor. She attended Boston University  and Georgetown University Law before clerking on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.    After 7 years in private practice, Ms. Lutzko joined the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, handled cases  involving prescription drug trafficking, gun crimes, and corruption.  She eventually became Appellate Chief of the office's Criminal  Division.   For nearly a decade, Ms. Lutzko was the lead counsel in prosecuting  an online pill-mill organization that illegally distributed well over 4  million pain pills to customers in all 50 States. She secured  convictions on all 12 defendants in the case, and the organization was  forced to surrender $4 million to the U.S. Government in criminal  proceeds.   She has served her office with distinction. She would be an  outstanding U.S. attorney.  [[Page S4613]]    April Perry, nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Northern District  of Illinois, has significant experience in the private sector and as a  Federal prosecutor.   She attended Northwestern University and the Northwestern Law School  and then clerked on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Then she  served as Federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois for  over a decade, where she handled narcotics, gang violence, public  corruption, and fraud cases. Notably, Ms. Perry specialized in child  exploitation prosecutions and spent 6 years in the office as Project  Safe Childhood Coordinator.   As an assistant U.S. attorney, she investigated a former police  officer who was convicted of raping a person he had arrested, and she  secured the conviction of a former priest who was accused of sexually  abusing more than 20 children.   Ms. Perry has since served as Chief Ethics Officer for the Cook  County State's Attorney's Office and is currently working as the GE  Healthcare a senior counsel for Global Investigations and Fraud and  Abuse Prevention.   She has the qualification and leadership abilities to serve as U.S.  attorney with distinction.   The interesting thing about all of these nominees that are being held  up by one Senator from the other side of the aisle is the extraordinary  records they have already written in their lives as criminal  prosecutors. That is why Senators from both political parties in the  U.S. Senate have said they are entitled to a promotion and entitled to  an opportunity to lead these U.S. attorney's offices.   By keeping these posts vacant, by refusing to give us a vote in the  Senate on their nominations, we are jeopardizing the efforts of U.S.  attorney's offices to control narcotics and crime.   These men and women are on the frontline of keeping us safe in  America. To hold up their nominations without any specific complaint  about any one of these nominees is just unacceptable.   We have a responsibility here to keep America safe. We can't keep  them safe by using a political reason to hold up the nominations of  these well-qualified people. If you are truly for law and order, if you  are truly for law enforcement, if you want the prosecutors across  America to keep us safe, then, for goodness' sake, lift the hold on  these nominations.   Mr. President, I am prepared to make a unanimous consent request at  this point.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar No. 129, No. 266, No. 314, and No. 315; that the nominations  be confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate  then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, my colleague says he is holding up these  critical law enforcement positions because former President Trump is  being treated unfairly. He promises to grind the Department of Justice  to a halt in loyalty to his political ally.   President Biden has continually demonstrated his respect for the  Justice Department's independence. He has never interfered in any  investigation into himself or his family. In contrast, President Trump  treated the Justice Department as his personal law firm for 4 years,  and he continues to undermine the rule of law by repeatedly threatening  and making baseless accusations against judges, prosecutors, grand  jurors, and witnesses.   Former President Trump has been indicted four separate times--once,  of course, a State indictment in Georgia. As the criminal charges  mount, President Trump is becoming even more reckless in threatening  judges, prosecutors, jurors, and witnesses. That is what inappropriate  interference in our judicial system looks like.   Instead of directing his concerns there, the Senator from Ohio is  attacking law enforcement officers who want to keep our families and  communities safe. In fact, one of the nominations that he is holding  up, in argument that the Department of Justice has become a political  tool, is a nomination which he notified the Judiciary Committee he  supports--from his home State of Ohio. If this person is a political  tool, why did he support this person for this nomination? He is holding  him up today for political reasons.   Despite the tough talk from the Senator of Ohio about crime in  America and all the references I have to put up regularly with the  other party making references to crime in the city of Chicago, I can't  think of a better way to fight crime and protect communities than by  confirming all these qualified nominees, especially one for the  Northern District of Illinois.   While the Senator from Ohio stands in the Senate talking about crime  in my home State and other places, Ms. Perry could be leading Chicago's  Firearms Trafficking Strike Force in cracking down on the illicit flow  of illegal guns from other States into Chicago.   The Chicago Police Department recovered more than 10,000 guns every  year from criminal investigations for the last 2 years--10,000 guns  taken off the streets. Ms. Perry could be helping to coordinate these  efforts with ATF and other law enforcement agencies.   Instead, thanks to my colleague's political position, our law  enforcement agencies and U.S. attorneys are missing key officials who  would otherwise be leading these efforts.   If you are for law and order, if you are for safety in the streets,  if you want to reduce gun violence, how in the world can you  rationalize stopping the nominations of U.S. attorneys, the  [[Page S4614]]  lead criminal prosecutors of the U.S. Department of Justice?   I would like to give them the help and leadership they need, but the  Senator from Ohio blocks it. These offices and the safety of the public  they serve should not be subject to politics. These are highly  qualified nominees who deserve to be swiftly confirmed. Until we do so,  our law enforcement agencies in Ohio, Illinois, Mississippi, and  California are going to be limited on how they can fight crime.   I really am saddened that this has become the new standard for Senate  Republicans. One Senate Republican has stopped 300 military promotions  for 6 months or longer. Deserving men and women, many of whom risked  their life for our country and have served us so well, are being  punished because of a political item on the agenda. As important as it  may be, you have chosen the wrong targets to take your political  revenge.   The same thing is true when it comes to these nominees. For goodness'  sake, give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to stop the  spread of fentanyl and narcotics in the United States, to stop and slow  down violent crime in the United States, to do something to protect  children from being trafficked. To stop these nominations is to turn a  blind eye to the reality that faces crime in our country. I can't  explain it. I won't even try to.   I just beg the Senator from Ohio to think twice. Grinding the U.S.  Department of Justice to a halt, as you have promised, is nothing to be  proud of. We will not be safer as a nation; we will not be better off  in terms of the safety of our children; and this political strategy is,  unfortunately, ill-intended and is going to have a result which is  going to hurt a lot of innocent people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) and the Senator from  Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.  [[Page S4625]]
