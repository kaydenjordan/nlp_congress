 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman Engel,  and Ranking Member McCaul for their leadership on this matter and all  the members on the Foreign Affairs Committee who worked so diligently  to support the people of Hong Kong, their autonomy, and their freedoms.   In my travel to Hong Kong, I witnessed firsthand the innovative  spirit and work ethic of the citizens of that special place. Hong  Kongers, like people all around the globe, look to the United States as  a symbol for freedom and democracy, that beacon of hope in a sea of  global despair that we have been for some 2\1/2\ centuries.   Today, as the CCP tightens its grip on Hong Kong, we must provide  unwavering support for the democratic desires of the people of Hong  Kong and be steadfast in our solidarity with these democracy-loving,  hardworking people.   That is why I am pleased to support and urge all my colleagues to  support this important bill, H.R. 8428, the Hong Kong People's Freedom  and Choice Act, to give those seeking refuge on our shores the  protection they need.   As the people of Hong Kong cry out to the free world for support  against tyranny, the United States stands at their side to join those  calling on the CCP to honor their 1984 treaty commitments and those  aiding those Hong Kongers seeking refuge.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), my friend, for yielding.   I rise today in strong support of S. 461, the HBCU PARTNERS Act,  introduced by my friend from South Carolina in the Senate, Senator Tim  Scott; and my good friend here in the House, Congresswoman Alma Adams  of North Carolina; and a strong bipartisan group, including my good  friend from Virginia, our chairman of the Education & Labor Committee.   Mr. Speaker, HBCUs play a critical role in the education of our young  people in this country. Throughout their history, they have helped  students achieve the dream of a college education and their unique  start to that pursuit of happiness.   In our central Arkansas region, we are blessed with four outstanding  HBCUs, including Arkansas Baptist College, Philander Smith College,  Shorter College, and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.   As the vice chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, I  am encouraged by the legislation that we consider today because it  draws on partnerships--public, private, community--to strengthen our  HBCUs. This has been a key for success of our HBCUs in Arkansas.   Inspired by the strong Federal consensus both in the executive branch  and the legislative branch, last year I sponsored and hosted the first  regional HBCU Summit in Little Rock to foster public- and private- sector partnerships to enhance our HBCUs for philanthropy, student  recruitment and advancement, and workforce partnerships and  apprenticeships.   I am committed to supporting our HBCUs to help them continue to  graduate Americans who are prepared for a competitive global  environment.   Every student in America deserves the opportunity to succeed. For  thousands of students in Arkansas and across the country, HBCUs offer  those young people the key tools to help them succeed in that  opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends on the HBCU Caucus, Chair Adams; our  friend from Pennsylvania; and, of course, the chairman.                                time  1345
