 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Mr. Dennis Salts, who was a dear friend and leader in the Buena Park  community in my 39th Congressional District.   Dennis had a passion for service as a member of Rotary International,  and president of the Buena Park Rotary Club. He was instrumental in  founding both Interact and Rotaract Clubs for high school and college  students.   He had a special passion for mentoring our youth to get involved in  community service and was dedicated to making sure our students  received the best education possible as a trustee on the Centralia  School District.   Dennis was recognized for his distinguished service as a Buena Park  Citizen of the Year, Buena Park Rotarian of the Year, and Rotary  District 5320 Business Rotarian of the Year.   Dennis' kindness and passion will be missed, and I pray for God's  peace for his wife, Christiane, his daughter, Carrie, and anyone who  knew him.                            ____________________
