 Mr. Speaker, I thank the good Congressman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud) for leading this important discussion.   When I visited the border, I saw the dangers of open borders, not  only for Americans, but for thousands of illegal immigrants smuggled  across the border.   Open borders empower drug cartels. Cartels are ruthless and inhumane  in their treatment of their human cargo.   President Trump secured agreements with El Salvador, Honduras, and  Guatemala that curbed the flow of illegal immigrant caravans. Those  agreements, along with the Remain in Mexico agreement, deprived the  cartels of billions and billions of dollars and saved hundreds of  thousands of immigrants from sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands  of the ruthless drug cartels.   Sadly, on January 20, President Biden gave the ruthless cartels a  green light to resume their exploitation of women, children, and young  men when he signed executive orders effectively repealing those  agreements, which had curbed illegal immigration and were defunding the  cartels.   Now, the record-low crossings of immigrants and drugs have been  replaced by record highs. Customs and Border Protection agents are  overwhelmed and have resorted to catch and release, which rewards the  cartels, further enriching those guys.                                time  2100    Rather than abandoning border security, the Biden-Harris  administration must abandon the failed policies that created the  crisis.   Restoring our border is essential to putting the safety and security  of Americans first, to protect immigrants from exploitation and harm,  and to deprive the drug cartels of victims and revenue.   The worst is still to come if this administration continues down this  reckless road.
