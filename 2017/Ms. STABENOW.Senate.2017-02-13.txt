 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Secretary of the Treasury is one of  the most powerful positions in our government, as we know. The Treasury  Secretary has broad responsibilities--for the economy, for our tax  system, trade, our pensions, housing, and so much more. It is critical  that anyone who holds that position use their power to help working  people. It is clear to me that Mr. Mnuchin's policies will, in fact,  hurt middle-class families and working people.   There are also serious ethical concerns that neither he nor my  Republican colleagues have been able to address. As a result, I will be  voting no on his nomination.   I would like to talk about something that has not received the focus  that I think it deserves and certainly that the people of Michigan feel  it deserves, and that is the question of pensions and what is happening  to pensions in our country.   Mr. Mnuchin has a history of fighting against working people and  profiting off their misfortune. As we know, pension funding can have a  significant impact on a company's bottom line. But losing a pension can  destroy a family's bottom line, and it seems that Mr. Mnuchin doesn't  know this. When serving on the board for Sears, Mr. Mnuchin played a  critical and direct role in how to fund the company's pensions. So what  happened? Sears routinely underfunded the company's plan throughout his  tenure. Analysts predicted that Sears ``massively underfunded'' their  pension plan. They said their ``massively underfunded'' pension plan  was ``a ticking time bomb'' that could even hasten or bring down the  financial collapse of the company.    The company used investment return projections that were too  optimistic, along with accounting gimmicks so they could avoid paying  into the pension fund. They inflated their earnings on paper while  contributing less to the pension.   Sears did such a bad job managing their pension fund while Mr.  Mnuchin was on their board, that the fund only made a return of 1.5  percent, putting their fund in the bottom 5 percent of all the pension  funds over $1 billion. Is this the kind of result the American  taxpayers want when he manages their money?   Already, Sears has been cutting its employees' pensions. In 2014, the  company eliminated the monthly health care subsidy that helped its  retirees afford their health care premiums. That saved Sears and Kmart  about $6.2 million a year.   I have received a lot of letters from Michigan families a lot from  families who are very concerned about their pensions. One of my  constituents who worked in the trucking industry said:         We took small raises on our paycheck each contract so the       company could put more in the pension fund--    That is what people do. They take less every month in their paycheck  so they can have more in the pension fund. I know in the Presiding  Officer's State and my State, that is what they do. He continued--       and [we] were told we would receive a certain amount for the       rest of our lives. That is what we based our retirement on.       Through no fault of ours, over the years, government       deregulation of the trucking industry, passing trade       agreements and other laws that have devastated the economy,       have made our pensions become doubtful.    Can you imagine paying all your lifetime? My brother drives a truck  and counts on the fact that he is working hard every day and putting  money into a pension fund for his family when he retires, and it is  supposed to be there, right? The pension is a promise that is supposed  to be there.   Another woman from West Michigan wrote in worried about her Central  States Pension Plan. That is the pension plan my brother is in as well.  She said:         My husband retired from Grocers Baking Co. of Grand Rapids       and has a pension in Central States Pension Fund. As you       know, that pension fund is in critical status and the       Treasury Department turned down a plan to save all the       pensions. My husband is 74 and I am 78 and we rely on that       pension and Social Security to live on. We try to save, but       it is difficult. We are hoping that the pension will last       more than 10 years, but who knows.    I also hear from people in Michigan all the time about how little  accountability there is when it comes to the management of people's  pensions.   One man wrote in from Macomb County about his own pension plan:         Why are none of the trustees being held accountable for the       bad investments or failure of the plan? I'm sure they all       have their golden parachutes in place for when they retire.       Why do we, the hard workers, have to suffer because of their       incompetence? I am just an average guy hoping that you can       help protect the benefits that are due to me, so I can enjoy       retirement when my time comes.    The Treasury Secretary nominee sat on the Sears board when they were  making changes that created the investments that were not as good as  they should have been, when they underfunded their pension system, cut  back on help for health care, and he is asking for a promotion. I  wonder what my constituents in Macomb County will be saying about that.   The Treasury Secretary plays a very important role in the security of  our pension system--one of the basic tenets in our country, the way we  support each other, the way people have trust in the system, you know  that when you pay into the pension and then when you retire you get the  pension.   The Treasury Secretary oversees implementation of the Multiemployer  Pension Reform Act and serves on the board of directors of the pension  overseers. I asked Mr. Mnuchin in committee: What is your position on  the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which Treasury is responsible for  administering?   How do you propose to shore up our multiemployer pension system and  protect people who are counting on their pensions? His answer was:  ``You have my commitment to work with you to find solutions to the  multiemployer pension crisis.''   That is it. I resubmitted the question, hoping for a more detailed  response.   His response was: ``If confirmed, I will consult with you and other  interested parties on the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014.''   That is not much of an answer for the people whom I represent, who  want to know how he feels and what he is going to do to protect their  pensions. The American people deserve a better answer than that.   People are struggling, retirees are struggling after trusting the  system and paying into their pensions their whole life--the whole time  they have been working, paying in, counting on having that dignity in  retirement. We need a Treasury Secretary who understands that a pension  is a promise. Mr. Mnuchin's actions have not demonstrated that he  understands that.   Even when it comes to something as basic as Social Security, during  our Finance Committee hearing, Mr.  [[Page S1106]]  Mnuchin couldn't tell me the average monthly benefit when I asked him,  which, by the way, one-third of our seniors virtually rely on that  alone, and the rest are putting together a small pension, and most  seniors are counting on Social Security and their pension to have  dignity and a quality of life in their retirement. The Treasury  Secretary is a key overseer of the laws and management process and  accountability for both of those systems. So for me this is a very big  deal who is in this spot, in terms of how this affects working people,  middle-class families, and retirees.   I didn't mention earlier that when I asked him what the average  Social Security payment was--which he could not answer--he also  couldn't tell me what he meant about a ``cut'' in Social Security; if  he wasn't going to cut, what that meant. Did that mean putting in place  a lower cost of living? What did that mean? He did not answer that.   Let me talk about another pretty basic area. Pensions are critically  important so is the ability to have a home. Up until the financial  crash, the disaster in 2008 and 2009, most families' savings for  retirement, savings to put their kids in college, were through the  equity in their home. In 2008 and 2009, for millions of Americans, that  disappeared.   Mr. Mnuchin has made his career profiting from the misfortunes of  working people, and let me talk about the financial crisis and how he  benefitted from that as well. During the financial crisis, he put  together a group of investors to purchase IndyMac Bank, which was  renamed OneWest. During that time, OneWest was notorious for taking an  especially aggressive role in foreclosing on struggling homeowners.  OneWest Bank pushed people into foreclosure and made their last-ditch  efforts to save their homes through a mortgage modification or other  means all but impossible.   When their voices were not allowed at the hearing on this  confirmation, I was pleased to join with colleagues in putting together  a forum where homeowners who had been impacted could share their  experience. We held this forum for homeowners who were repeatedly given  hope by OneWest that they might be able to avoid foreclosure, only to  have it snatched away every time. One small business owner at the forum  told us her story of how OneWest defrauded her and ultimately  foreclosed on her. She told us that ``despite how difficult OneWest  made the process, I did everything I was told, because I wanted to keep  my home.''   Twice she applied for a loan modification. She submitted two checks  with her new modification offer. OneWest cashed the checks--they cashed  the checks--but told her that both offers were never received.   Wait a minute. What is that? They cashed the checks, then told her  the offers were not received, and therefore the offer was void.   Eventually, she said: ``I received a knock on my door and a man  introduced himself as the owner of my house.'' Unbelievable. Shortly  thereafter she had to leave her home. OneWest was Mr. Mnuchin's  company. This is one of the many stories about OneWest's abusive  conduct. When OneWest Bank sold, Mr. Mnuchin and other investors made  about $3 billion off the backs of folks who lost their home and many  were like the women we heard from who tried desperately to work it out  to keep their home. I wonder if the checks they cashed from her after  they said they didn't get them were a part of that $3 billion.   Finally, I want to express my concern over statements that Mr.  Mnuchin made at the Finance Committee hearing that just don't line up  with the facts; particularly, Mr. Mnuchin was asked whether his bank,  OneWest, robo-signed foreclosure documents. To be clear on what this  is, the banks, during the foreclosure crisis, had sworn documents robo- signed, automatically signed so they could foreclose on homeowners  quickly without anyone even reading the documents. They just signed the  papers--signed the papers--nobody reviewed whether they added up or  whether they were right, whether they could help them. They just had  the machine signing, signing, signing, foreclose, foreclose, foreclose.   Mr. Mnuchin said in the hearing his bank didn't do that. He said his  bank didn't do that. The Columbus Dispatch did an investigation that  found that OneWest did do that in Ohio. A source in Texas reported that  OneWest did do it in Texas. New Jersey temporarily banned OneWest from  foreclosing on homeowners at all in New Jersey because of its history  of robo-signing documents. Sign, sign, sign--don't look at it, just  sign away. We heard the story of one woman who lost her house because  of a 27-cent difference. I wonder if she was in one of those piles they  just signed away. Mr. Mnuchin said they didn't do that. There is  evidence to the contrary.   Mr. Mnuchin also forgot to disclose to the committee that he owned a  company organized in the Cayman Islands. When I asked him about that,  his best defense was that ``I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in  any way to avoid paying taxes myself.'' At the time, I said: Oh, so you  just helped other people avoid paying their taxes.    We find out now he did use it to help foreign investors avoid paying  U.S. taxes. I have a funny feeling that he made money by helping those  investors avoid paying their U.S. taxes.   He also forgot to disclose that he owned $95 million in real estate  in various locations. I forget that all of the time. I have so many  houses all over the place, it is easy to forget. So $95 million in  property that he ``forgot'' to disclose. He said he didn't know his  real estate was an asset. He didn't know his real estate was an asset.  That is alarming.   I don't mean to be flip, but this is so shocking when I listen to  some of this. The idea that we would believe someone who says this,  that it somehow is making sense--that is why we as Democrats on the  Finance Committee, before this final confirmation vote, asked that he  be required to come back in and answer questions, because these are  serious questions.   This nominee has not been properly vetted. He supports policies that  do not have the interests of the working men and women in Michigan at  heart or people across the country. He adheres to policies that don't  protect the pensions of hard-working men and women in Michigan and  across the country or people's retirement systems. I don't know where  he really is on Social Security, which is the other big piece of the  promise we made as Americans, where people pay into Social Security and  are counting on that being there. He has personally profited off the  misfortune of those who need help the most.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a champion  for Detroit and for Michigan, Mike Ilitch. Everyone from Michigan knows  his life story: the son of Macedonian immigrants, he founded Little  Caesars Pizza, one of the largest pizza chains in the world, and  rebuilt both the Detroit Tigers and the Detroit Red Wings into world  class, winning franchises. He led the Red Wings to four Stanley Cups  and brought the Tigers to the World Series twice.   The story of Mike Ilitch is the story of never doing anything  halfway. He embodies the American dream: he served as a marine, built a  business empire, and had an eye for perfection that led him to  incredible success.   For him though, it wasn't enough to be satisfied with success in  business or  [[Page S1129]]  sports; it was all about giving back. He said it himself: ``I was  raised in Detroit. I came from zero. This community helped make me.  It's nice to give something back.''   He loved Detroit and worked to revitalize the city while maintaining  its cultural history. His company, Olympia Entertainment, purchased the  Fox Theater and restored it in 1988. He built Comerica Park, home to  the Tigers. His recent $40 million donation to the Wayne State  University School of Business will help build their state-of-the-art  facility on Woodward Avenue, next to the new home of the Red Wings and  the Pistons, Little Caesars Arena.   Detroit is better off because of the work that he did. And the people  of Detroit are better off because of his work. From his philanthropic  organization that has given to those in need and the program he started  through Little Caesars that helps honorably discharged veterans get  employed, Mike Ilitch gave people a chance to succeed and to thrive.   Mike will be sorely missed by all of us. His legacy is shared by his  loving wife of over 61 years, Marian, and his seven children, but it is  also shared by everyone in Michigan and all of those who love Detroit.  Thank you.                            ____________________
