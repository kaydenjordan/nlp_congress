 Correct.         Correct.         It's not what we recommended the President       discuss.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The July 25 call was at least the second time  that National Security Council officials had reported concerns about  President Trump's pressure campaign to White House lawyers--the second  time--who now clearly understood the gravity of the ongoing misconduct.   But because the President blocked Mr. Eisenberg from testifying  without any justification, the record is silent as to what, if any,  actions he or the White House Counsel took to address President Trump's  brazen misconduct and abuse of power. We do know, however, that instead  of trying to halt the scheme, White House lawyers facilitated it by  taking affirmative steps to conceal evidence of President Trump's  misconduct. For example, after Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Mr.  Morrison reported their concerns related to the July 25 call to the  National Security Council lawyers, they tried to bury the call summary.  They tried to bury it. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that the  National Security Council lawyers believed it was ``appropriate to  restrict access'' to the call summary ``for the purpose of the leaks''  and ``to preserv[e] the integrity'' of the transcript.   According to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Mr. Eisenberg ``gave the go- ahead'' to restrict access to the call summary. Mr. Morrison testified  that he learned in late August, after he raised concerns that the call  record might leak and be politically damaging to the President, that  the call summary had been placed on a highly classified National  Security Council server. The call record was placed on a server that is  reserved for America's most sensitive national security secrets and  covert operations, not routine calls with foreign leaders.   Apparently, Mr. Eisenberg claimed at the time that burying the call  transcript on a highly classified server was a ``mistake.''   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          I recommended we restrict access to the       package.         No.         No.         I did.         It was a mistake.         It was an administrative error.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In Mr. Morrison's view, the July 25 call record  did not meet the requirements to be placed on a highly classified  server.   At his deposition, Mr. Morrison testified that the call record was  placed on the server by ``mistake.'' However, even after this alleged  ``mistake'' was discovered, the July 25 call summary was not removed  from the classified system because someone was trying to hide it. It  was not until a launch of the House impeachment inquiry in late  September, and after intense public pressure, that the rough transcript  of the July 25 call was released.   Again, because Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Ellis refused to testify in the  House, we do not know exactly how the July 25 call record ended up on  this highly classified National Security Council server. What we do  know is that Mr. Eisenberg ordered access restricted after multiple  officials, like Dr. Fiona Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, advised  him of the scheme to condition a White House meeting on phony political  investigations. They strongly suggested there was an active attempt to  conceal the clear evidence of the President's wrongdoing. Instead of  addressing the President's misconduct, Mr. Eisenberg seemingly tried to  cover it up.   Why did Mr. Eisenberg place the July 25 call summary on a server for  highly classified material? Did anyone senior to Mr. Eisenberg direct  him to hide the call record? Why did the call record remain on the  classified server even after the so-called error was discovered? Who  ordered the coverup of the call record? The American people deserve to  know.   Following the July 25 call, the President's scheme to pressure  Ukraine for political purposes intensified, apparently unchecked by any  effort to stop it from the White House Counsel's Office. After the July  25 call, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked with the President's  personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to procure a public statement from  President Zelensky to announce phony investigations into Joe Biden and  the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory being peddled by President Trump. At  the same time, President Trump continued to withhold the White House  meeting and security assistance from Ukraine in a manner that broke the  law.   As these efforts were ongoing, White House attorneys reportedly  received yet another warning sign that the President was abusing his  power. According to a published report in the New York Times, the week  after the July 25 call, an anonymous whistleblower reported concerns  that the President was abusing his office for personal gain. The  whistleblower's complaint landed with the CIA's General Counsel's  office. Although the concerns related directly to the President's own  misconduct, the CIA's General Counsel, Courtney Elwood, alerted Mr.  Eisenberg. Over the next week, Ms. Elwood, Mr. Eisenberg, and their  deputies reportedly discussed the whistleblower's concerns, and they  determined, as required by law, that the allegations had a ``reasonable  basis.''  [[Page S535]]    So, by early August, White House lawyers began working, along with  the attorneys at the Department of Justice, to cover up the President's  wrongdoing. They were determined to prevent Congress and the American  people from learning anything about the President's corrupt behavior.  Although senior Justice Department officials, including Attorney  General Bill Barr, were reportedly made aware of the concerns about  corrupt activity, no investigation into President Trump's wrongdoing  was even opened by the DOJ.   As White House and Justice Department lawyers were discussing how to  deal with the whistleblower's concerns, on August 12--another important  date--the whistleblower filed a formal complaint with the inspector  general for the intelligence community.   In accordance with Federal law, on August 26, the inspector general  transmitted the whistleblower's complaint to the Acting Director of  National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, along with the inspector  general's preliminary conclusion that the complaint was both credible  and related to a matter of urgent concern. Instead of transmitting the  whistleblower's complaint to the House's and Senate's distinguished  Intelligence Committees, as required by law, the Acting Director of  National Intelligence notified the White House.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          That the Ukrainians would have to have the       prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the       investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.         Well, I was concerned about what I saw as       essentially an additional hurdle to accomplishing what I had       been directed to help accomplish, which was giving the       President the information that he needed to determine that       the security sector assistance could go forward.         There was the appearance of one, based on       what Ambassador Sondland represented.         I promptly reached out to Ambassador Taylor       to schedule a secure phone call.         About that conversation, yes.         Correct.         I have reached out to him as well and       requested his availability for a secure phone call.         Tell the lawyers.         When I returned to the States, yes.         He did not.    Mr. Manager CROW. Now, this wasn't the first time--and it wouldn't be  the last--that Ambassador Bolton instructed other government officials  to report details of the President's scheme to White House lawyers.   Now, let's be clear. When government employees have concerns about  whether something is legal, they often go to their agency's lawyers.  And it was happening an awful lot around this time. Recall that Bolton  also instructed Dr. Hill to report to the lawyers Sondland's statements  about requiring an announcement of the investigations as a condition  for a White House meeting--what Bolton called Sondland's ``drug deal''  with the President's top aide, Mick Mulvaney. Ambassador Bolton's  testimony would obviously shine further light on these concerns and  what or who, if anyone, in the White House or the Cabinet did to try to  stop the President at this time.   After the President's hold on military aid became public in late  August, there was increasing pressure on the President to lift the  hold. On September 3, a bipartisan group of Senators sent a letter to  Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. An excerpt from that  letter is in front of you. The Senators expressed ``deep concerns''  that the ``Administration is considering not obligating the Ukraine  Security Initiative funds for 2019.'' The Senators' letter also urged  that the ``vital'' funds be obligated ``immediately.''   On September 5, the chairman and the ranking member of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee sent a joint letter to Mulvaney and OMB  Director Russell Vought. That letter also expressed ``deep concern''  about the continuing hold on the military aid.   The same day, Senators Murphy and Johnson visited Kyiv and met with  President Zelensky, along with Ambassador Taylor.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. On September 5th, I accompanied Senators       Johnson and Murphy during their visit to Kyiv. When we met       with President Zelensky, his first question to the Senators       was about the withheld security assistance. My recollection       of the meeting is that both Senators stressed that bipartisan       support for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine's most       important strategic asset and that President Zelensky should       not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn in to       U.S. domestic politics.        I had been making and continue to make this point to all of       my official Ukrainian contacts. But the odd push to make       President Zelensky publicly commit to investigations of       Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed       how the official foreign policy of the United States was       undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.    Mr. Manager CROW. The Senators sought to reassure President Zelensky  that there was bipartisan support in Congress for providing the  military aid.   Also on September 5, the Washington Post editorial board reported  concerns that President Trump was withholding the aid and a meeting to  force President Zelensky to announce investigations to benefit his  personal political campaign.   The editors wrote:         ``[W]e are reliably told that the President has a second       and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky       to intervene in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by       launching an investigation of the leading Democratic       candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting       Ukraine's help with his Presidential campaign; he is using       U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt       to extort it.    Despite these efforts to get the President to lift the hold and the  now-public discussion about the President's abuse of power, the scheme  continued. Two days later, on September 7, Morrison went back to the  White House lawyers to report additional details he had learned from  Ambassador Sondland about the President's scheme--again, at the  direction of Ambassador Bolton.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          That sounds correct, yes.         If I recall this conversation correctly, this       was where Ambassador Sondland related that there was no quid       pro quo, but President Zelensky had to make the statement and       that he had to want to do it.         I think I did, yes.         I understood that that's what Ambassador       Sondland believed.         That's what he represented.         Well, I believe if we're on September 7th,       the end of the fiscal year is September 30th, these are 1       year dollars, the DOD and the Department of State funds, so       we only had so much time. And, in fact, because Congress       imposed a 15 day notification requirement on the State       Department funds, September 7th, September 30th, that really       means September 15th in order to secure a decision from the       President to allow the funds to go forward.         I did. I did, yes.         He said to tell the lawyers.         He did not explain his direction.    Mr. Manager CROW. Again, ``tell the lawyers.''   Ambassador Sondland's call with President Trump on September 7 also  prompted deep concern by Ambassador Taylor, which you have already  heard about.  [[Page S537]]    On September 8 and 9, Ambassador Taylor exchanged WhatsApp messages  with Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, describing his ``nightmare''  scenario that ``they give the interview and don't get the security  assistance.'' He then goes on to say: ``The Russians love it. (And I  quit.)''   After the hold on the military aid became public, the White House  took two actions in early September.   First, the White House and the Justice Department ensured that the  Acting DNI continued to withhold the whistleblower complaint from  Congress, in clear violation of the law.   And second, the White House attempted to create a cover story for the  President's withholding of the assistance.   Approximately 2 months after President Trump had ordered the freeze,  Mark Sandy received an email from his boss, Michael Duffey that, for  the first time, gave a reason for the hold. Sandy testified that in  early September he received an email from Duffey ``that attributed the  hold to the President's concern about other countries not contributing  more to Ukraine.''   Again, after months of scrambling, this was the first time any reason  had been provided for the hold.   And according to Sandy, it was also only in early September--again,  after the White House learned of the whistleblower complaint and the  hold became public--that the White House requested data from OMB on  other countries' assistance to Ukraine.   So let's recap why we know the concern about burden-sharing was  bogus. First, for months, no reason was given to the very people  executing the military aid who had been actively searching for answers  about why the aid was being held.   Second, remember the supposed interagency process performed by OMB?  Well, it was fake.   And third, after the hold went public and the White House became  aware of the whistleblower, they started scrambling to develop another  excuse. Public reports confirm this.   A November 24 news report, for instance, revealed that in September,  Mr. Cipollone's lawyers conducted an internal records review. The  review reportedly ``turned up hundreds of documents that reveal  extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the  decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal.''   The President's top aides were trying to convince the President to  lift the hold in late August and early September, and White House  officials were actively working to develop an excuse for the  President's scheme and devise a cover story in the event it was  exposed, and soon it would be.   On September 9, the chairs of the House Intelligence Committee, the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform  publicly announced a joint investigation of President Trump and Mr.  Giuliani's scheme. And this is when the music stops and everyone starts  running to find a chair.   Word of the committees' investigation spread quickly through the  White House to the NSC. Morrison recalled seeing and discussing the  letter with NSC staff. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman also recalled  discussions among NSC staff members, including Morrison's deputy, John  Erath, about the investigation.   The same day, there were efforts at OMB to create a paper trail to  try to shift the blame for the President's hold on security assistance  away from the White House. Duffey sent an email to Elaine McCusker that  contradicted months of email exchanges and stated falsely that OMB had  in fact ``authoriz[ed] DOD to proceed with all processes necessary to  obligate funds.'' Duffey was attempting to shift all the responsibility  for the delay onto the Pentagon. McCusker replied: ``You can't be  serious. I am speechless.''   Now, all of this--including OMB's efforts to shift blame to the  Pentagon, the White House's effort to create a cover story for the hold  on security assistance--was a continuation of the coverup.   It started with the White House lawyers' failure to stop the scheme  after the July 10 meeting was reported to them, continued with attempts  to hide the July 25 call summary, and escalated with the White House's  illegal concealment of the whistleblower complaint from Congress.   On September 10, the House Intelligence Committee requested that the  DNI provide a copy of the whistleblower complaint as the law requires.  But DNI continued to withhold the complaint for weeks.   The same day, it was announced that Ambassador Bolton was resigning  or had been fired. It is unclear whether Ambassador Bolton's departure  from the White House had anything to do with his opposition to the hold  on military aid, but, of course, Ambassador Bolton could shed light on  that himself if he were to testify.   The next day, on September 11, President Trump met with Vice  President Pence, Mulvaney, and Senator Portman to discuss the hold.  Later that day, the President relented and lifted the hold after his  scheme had been exposed.   The President's decision to release the aid, like his decision to  impose the hold, was never explained. Cooper testified that President  Trump's lifting of the hold ``really came out of the blue. . . . It was  quite abrupt.''   The only logical conclusion, based upon all of this evidence, is that  the President lifted the hold on September 11 because he got caught.   The President's decision to lift the hold without any explanation is  also very telling. If the hold was put in place for legitimate policy  reasons, why lift it arbitrarily with no explanation?   By lifting the hold only after Congress had launched an  investigation--when, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified, none of  the ``facts on the ground'' had changed since the hold had been put in  place--the President was conceding that there was never a legitimate  purpose.   Since the hold was lifted, the President has paid lip service to  purported concerns about corruption and burden-sharing. But the  administration has taken no concrete steps before or since those  statements were made to show that it really cares.   The record is clear. Before he got caught, the President had no  interest in anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. And, as you have  already learned, those people who really were concerned about these  issues--like Congress, this Senate, the DOD, and the State Department-- had already gone through the process to address them.   As Ambassador Sondland testified, at no point did the President ask  him to discuss additional contributions to Ukraine from the EU  countries, nor did President Trump push Ukraine to undertake any  specific anti-corruption reforms.   Now, the President's counsel will likely say that his lifting of the  hold shows his good faith. They will say that because Ukraine  ultimately received the aid without President Zelensky having to  announce the sham investigations, then there was no abuse of power. As  a legal matter, the fact that the President's corrupt scheme was not  fully successful makes no difference. Trump's abuse occurred at the  moment he used the power of the Presidency to assist his reelection  campaign, undermining our free and fair elections and our national  security.    But, importantly, President Trump almost did get away with it. As  discussed earlier, President Zelensky agreed during his September phone  call with Ambassador Sondland to do a CNN interview during which he  would announce the investigations. On September 12, Ambassador Taylor  personally informed President Zelensky and the Ukrainian Foreign  Minister that President Trump's hold on military assistance had been  lifted. On September 13, Ambassador Taylor and David Holmes met with  President Zelensky and his advisers and urged them not to go forward  with the CNN interview.   It was not until September 18 and 19--around the time that President  Zelensky spoke with Vice President Pence--that the Ukrainians finally  canceled the CNN interview.   The President has also repeatedly pointed to President Zelensky's  public statements that he did not feel pressured by Trump. Not only  unsurprising, it is also irrelevant. The question is whether President  Trump used the power of the Presidency to coerce President Zelensky  into helping him win a political campaign.   But we know that President Zelensky was pressured. He kept delaying  and delaying because he did not  [[Page S538]]  want to be a pawn in U.S. domestic politics.   In fact, President Zelensky remains under pressure to this day. As  Holmes testified, there are still things the Ukrainians want and need  from the United States, including a meeting with the President in the  Oval Office, which has still not been scheduled. And yes, Ukraine  remains at war and needs U.S. military aid, including aid that is still  delayed from last year. For these reasons, Mr. Holmes explained:         I think [the Ukrainians are] being very careful. They still       need us now going forward. In fact, right now President       Zelensky is trying to arrange a summit meeting with President       Putin in the coming weeks, his first face-to-face meeting       with him to try to advance the peace process.        He needs our support. He needs--he needs President Putin to       understand that America supports Zelensky at the highest       levels. So this doesn't end with the lifting of security       assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still       fighting this war this very day.    When President Trump, for his own personal political gain, asked for  a favor from President Zelensky, he did exactly what the Framers feared  most: He invited the influence of a foreign power into our elections.  He used the power of his office to secure that advantage and  jeopardized our national security.   Yet President Trump maintains that he was always in the right and  that his July 25 call with President Zelensky was ``perfect.''  President Trump has made it clear that he believes he is free to use  his powers the same way, to the same ends, whenever and wherever he  pleases. Even more troubling, he is even doubling down on his abuse,  inviting other countries to interfere in our elections.   What does all of this tell you? It tells you that Ambassador Sondland  was correct when he told Holmes after hanging up with President Trump  on July 26 that the President doesn't care about Ukraine. He only cares  about the ``big stuff,'' meaning stuff that helps him personally.   The bottom line is that the President used the powers of his office  for personal political gain. He did so knowingly, deliberately, and  repeatedly, and his misconduct continues to this day.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, just for your orientation, this will be  the last presentation on article I, and, Mr. Leader, I think at the  conclusion of this presentation would be a logical point to take a  break.   This last section on article I deals with the injury to our national  interests and our national security.   When President Trump used Ukraine's leader for a political favor and  withheld critical military aid to an ally in exchange for that favor,  he did exactly what our Framers feared most: He invited foreign  interference in our elections and sold out our country's security for  his personal benefit and betrayed the Nation's trust to a foreign  power.   The President's scheme to pressure Ukraine to do his political dirty  work harmed our national security, undermined our free and fair  elections, and even today--even today--threatens the very foundation of  our democracy.   When the President argues that his call was ``perfect,'' that he did  nothing wrong, what he is really saying is that there is nothing wrong  with a President asking a foreign government to do a personal favor,  that there is nothing wrong with the President pressuring that foreign  country to interfere in our elections for his personal benefit, that  there is nothing wrong with withholding congressionally appropriated  taxpayer-funded military assistance to that foreign country to extort  that country to help the President cheat to win an election.   But there are a great many things wrong with that. Most significant  for the purposes that bring us here today, the Constitution does not  permit it. The Constitution does not permit it because that conduct is  the quintessential abuse of power--the use of official power for  personal gain, putting personal interests over the national interests,  and placing personal benefits over our Nation's security.   The President's conduct that we outlined yesterday harmed our  national security. That is without a doubt. It endangered our elections  and it has sent our country on a dangerous path that if left unchecked  will cause irrevocable damage to the balance of power contemplated in  our Constitution. If someone sacrifices the national interest in favor  of his own and is not removed from office, our democracy is in  jeopardy. It is just that simple.   The grave consequences of President Trump's misconduct demand our  attention. Let me take these issues in turn, beginning with this harm  to national security.   First, the President's abuse of power had immediate consequences to  our security. Ukraine is a burgeoning democracy entangled in a hot war  with Russia. By withholding military aid, President Trump not only  denied Ukraine much-needed military equipment but also weakened  Ukraine's position in negotiations over the end of the war with Russia.  Because of President Trump's corrupt actions, Vladimir Putin was  emboldened at a pivotal moment ahead of those sensitive negotiations to  attempt to end the war. An emboldened Russia is a threat to the United  States and global security around the world.   The President's willingness to put himself over country undercut our  European allies' confidence in America's commitment to deterring  Russian aggression, and it signaled to adversaries and friends alike  that the President of the United States, the most powerful man in the  world, our Commander in Chief, could be influenced by manipulating his  perception of what was best for his personal interests.   Now, I have no doubt that the Russians, and probably every other  nation that has the capacity, does a psychological profile of the  President of the United States, as we profile other leaders. If a  President can be so easily manipulated to disbelieve his own  intelligence agencies, to accept the propaganda of the Kremlin, that is  a threat to our national security. That is just what has happened here,  but that is not all.   President Trump's willingness to entangle our foreign allies in a  corrupt political errand also undermined the credibility of Americans  to promote the rule of law and fight corruption abroad.   This is ``Trump first,'' not ``America first,'' not American ideals  first. And the result has and will continue to be great harm to our  Nation if this Chamber does not stand up and say it is wrong, if you do  not stand up and say this is not only wrong, not only unacceptable but  conduct incompatible with the Office of the Presidency. If it really is  incompatible with the Office of the Presidency, if you cannot  faithfully execute that responsibility, if you cannot bring yourself to  put your Nation's interests ahead of your own, it must be impeachable,  for the Nation remains at risk.   Let's consider the big picture, and probably a question many people  around the country are asking: Why does Ukraine matter to the United  States? Why does Ukraine matter to the United States? Because we are  talking about a small country that many people know very little about.   Well, this small country, this ally of ours, is a country hungry for  reform and eager for a stronger relation with its most powerful,  important ally, the United States. We are talking about ourselves and  what it means to the strength of our own democracy and democracies  around the world when countries like Ukraine are fighting our fight  against authoritarianism. It used to be our fight, and God help us if  it is not our fight still.   Russian President Putin declared the collapse of the Soviet Union to  be the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Ukraine's  vote for independence in December 1991 was the final nail in the Soviet  Union's coffin. That made Ukraine's greatest moment Putin's greatest  tragedy.   When it declared independence from Soviet domination, Ukraine  inherited roughly 1,900 Soviet nuclear warheads, enough firepower to  level every major American city several times over--1,900 Soviet  nuclear warheads. In exchange for Ukraine's surrendering this arsenal,  the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom reached an  understanding called the Budapest Memorandum of 1994. They committed in  this memorandum to respecting the borders of an independent Ukraine and  also to refrain from using the threat or use of force against Ukraine.  This was an early success of the post-Cold War period.  [[Page S539]]    Despite its commitment to respect Ukraine's independence, of course,  Russia continued to meddle in Ukraine's affairs. Ambassador Taylor  recounted how events took an even more sinister turn in 2013:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. In 2013, Vladimir Putin was so       threatened by the prospect of Ukraine joining the European       Union that he tried to bribe the Ukrainian President. This       triggered mass protests in the winter of 2013 that drove that       President to flee to Russia in February of 2014, but not       before his forces killed 100 Ukrainian protesters in central       Kyiv.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Angered by the fall of the Kremlin-backed leader  in Kyiv, President Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine--specifically,  a region known as Crimea. Russia's aggression was met with global  condemnation.   (Videotape presentation.)   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We don't have the sound there, but you can see  the images of that conflict on the screens before you.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified as to  the stakes for U.S. national security:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
