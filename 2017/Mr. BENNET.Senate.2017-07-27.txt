 Mr. President, I am aware that the time is at an end. I  ask unanimous consent for 7 additional minutes.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from New Mexico, my  neighbors, for being here.   I thank the Presiding Officer for his statement. As usual, he is  pointing the Senate in a direction that we should be headed.   Whether people in my State support the Affordable Care Act or whether  they don't, they are dissatisfied with the way our healthcare system  works. The Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare or whatever you want to  call it--is just part of our healthcare system. We have Medicare. We  have Medicaid. We have hospitals. We have doctors. We have nurses. It  all adds up, in America in the 21st century, to a system that is really  hard on people and makes it very hard for them to predict their future.  It creates situations where they have to make choices that no other  people in the industrialized world have to make, about raising their  family, about staying in a job--as the Presiding Officer was talking  about--that they might not want to stay in for fear they would lose  their health insurance.   I thought the Presiding Officer made an excellent point when he said  that you don't lose your car insurance when you leave your place of  business for another job. Why should you lose your health insurance?  Why should you? Why should you have to put up with things in this  country that nobody else in the industrialized world has to put up  with?   It may be that the debate we are going to have is as binary as the  Presiding Officer was saying. Maybe it is a debate about single payer  versus what he described as more consumer based. Maybe there is  something in between. America has a way of trying to figure those kinds  of things out--or at least we have historically.   My colleague from Oregon earlier quoted the famous line, which  somebody yelled out to Ben Franklin: What kind of government are you  creating, a monarchy or republic? That was the question.   His answer was, as the Senator of Oregon said: ``A republic, if you  can keep it''--if you can keep it.   The Founders had extraordinary vision, and they were creating  something that had never existed before in the history of humankind-- never existed. You could make an argument about a couple of small  principalities or places in Switzerland, and there would be some  argument about ancient Rome, but, really, this exercise in self- government had sprung from their imagination and their desire as human  beings to govern themselves, to slough off the monarchy that ruled them  and ruled others in Europe.   What Ben Franklin said was so important and so wise because he didn't  say: ``A republic.'' He said: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''   When they wrote the Constitution, they were creating a mechanism for  the American people to resolve their disputes. They were not creating a  republic where they believed that everyone would agree with each other.  They had vast disagreements. They had disagreements far greater than  the ones we have. They had geographic disagreements. They had  disagreements about big States and little States. They had  disagreements about slavery.   They were able to come together and create a mechanism to resolve our  differences. They didn't believe, as some people seem to on talk radio  every day, that if you don't agree with the other person that you must  be a Communist or you must be some rightwinger. That is not what they  believed.   They believed there was a public purpose, that there was public  virtue that underlay the work they were trying to do and that we would  be able to persist in this Republic only if we kept it--if we kept it.   That is how self-government works. It is not a king telling you what  to do. It is not the generation of the Founders telling you what to do.  It is doing what you need to do, as the Presiding Officer said, for the  sake of people who did their jobs before us but, more importantly, as  he said, for the people who are coming after us. Seeing from this  perspective, this process is a disgrace. This is why we have a 9- percent approval rating in the U.S. Senate--what has been referred to  in past generations as the greatest deliberative body in the world.  Those words are spoken mockingly today.   The people I represent, and the people the Presiding Officer  represents, are paying a price for this. It has been a long time since  I have been in the majority--I am sad to say, but it is true--but there  was a time when I would preside, as the Presiding Officer is doing  today. A reporter asked me once: What do you think about when you are  up there? As John McCain said the other day: We aren't doing anything  here. He is right. We are not.    So the reporter said: What are you thinking about?   Do you know what I told him? I said: What I think about is, What is  China doing right now, while Democrats and Republicans here had their  fight that has nothing to do with the people whom we represent?   We know what China is doing right now. While we don't even have the  decency to maintain the assets and infrastructure, the roads and  bridges that our parents and grandparents had the decency to build for  us--starting on this floor--they are building trains, not just in China  but all over Asia, to bind them together in an economic union to come  after the United States. What is China doing?   What I deeply regret about this debate is that the end product,  whether we pass this bill or if we don't, is not going to improve  healthcare for the people I represent. Again, my starting point is that  there are people who like the Affordable Care Act and there are people  who don't like the Affordable Care Act, but everybody is deeply  dissatisfied, as they should be, with the way our healthcare system  works. What we should do is abandon this process and, instead, go to  committee. Chairman Alexander--he is a Republican--is perfectly capable  of running a bipartisan process that could lead us to a place where we  actually are making things better for people who live on the Eastern  Plains of Colorado, on the Front Range of Colorado, or on the Western  Slope of Colorado, who may be Republicans and Democrats, but for whom  healthcare is not political. It is about their family and about their  future. That is what we should be keeping in mind, instead of just the  next election around here. Everybody has lamented that.   I am running out of time, but I remember when the majority leader was  not the majority leader. He is a smart person. He came here and said:  ``Major legislation is now routinely drafted, not in committee, but in  the Majority Leader's conference room and then dropped on the floor  with little or no opportunity for members to participate in the  amendment process, virtually guaranteeing a fight.''  [[Page S4367]]    That is what he said. I am telling those of you with whom I was in  townhall meetings 7 years ago, when people were saying: Read the bill,  read the bill. The tea party was at the height, bringing pocket  Constitutions to my meetings, telling me to be faithful to that  process. I say that we should be saying that right now: Be faithful to  that constitutional process.   He knew the process wasn't working as it should. What he said was  this:         When Democrats couldn't convince any of us--    That is, Republicans--         that [the Affordable Care Act] was worth supporting as       written, they decided to do it on their own and pass it on a       party line vote.    He continued:         It may very well have been the case that on ObamaCare, the       will of the country was not to pass the bill at all. That's       what I would have concluded if Republicans couldn't get a       single Democrat vote for legislation of this magnitude, I'd       have thought, maybe this isn't a great idea.    So I say to the Republicans and Democrats who are here today, maybe  it isn't a great idea because they can't even get the Republican votes.  They haven't gotten one Democratic vote. They haven't gotten the  Republican votes to repeal and replace, even though they have run on  this for 8 years. They had to bring the Vice President here to cast the  deciding vote because we were tied. What a shame for the Senate not to  do its work and to rely on the executive branch to come here and supply  that vote.   Every single person in this body knows the President of the United  States has no idea or interest in what is in this legislation. Every  single person here knows that. So why are we doing it? We are doing it,  I guess, to fulfill a campaign promise to repeal ObamaCare. I can  understand why there is pressure for people to do that, because they  said that over and over, even though I disagree with their  characterization of the bill.   I disagree with the facts they presented. I understand that impulse,  but I don't understand the impulse of writing a bill in secret--listen  to this folks--not having a single committee hearing--not one committee  hearing in the Senate. Talk about ``read the bill.'' How about having a  bill that is written down on paper so we can read it? Where are my  brethren in the tea party who wanted to read the other bill? There was  a bill then. There had been a bill for a year and a half.   There is no bill. There is no bill because what they are trying to do  is to figure out what they can eke out across the line here. They are  calling it a skinny repeal. I don't even know how that satisfies the  laugh test, when it comes to the campaign promises that were made  around here, but that is not my issue. But we should just stop. We are  at 9 percent. This bill, I think, the last time I checked, had a 15- percent approval rating or a 20-percent approval rating. Don't pass  that. We have wasted 6 months--not of our time but of the American  people's time. I have people all over the State of Colorado who would  love to come here and testify at a committee hearing about how  healthcare is intersecting with their lives and making their lives  difficult or how they are benefiting from certain things. I would love  for them to have a chance to come here and testify, but we haven't set  up that process. We should. We should stop this.   The American people would be relieved if we would stop this  partisanship to get together and work on the committee as we should do  and pass something on the floor. What we have forgotten about the  Affordable Care Act--even though it didn't have Republican votes, and  it should have--is that it had almost 200 Republican amendments adopted  as part of the process. I agree with what the majority leader said  then. If the process is lousy, the outcome of the bill is likely to be  lousy. An important point he made is that it is unlikely to reflect the  will of the American people, and when it doesn't, what it is going to  mean is that we are just going to continue to seesaw from one election  to the next election and we are not going to get a result.   I am willing to settle for 80 percent of what I want, or 70 percent  of what I want--I am. I don't think that is an unvirtuous position to  have. All these people here are talking all the time about the  principle they are standing on. When you scratch at that and look for  the content of the idea underneath that principle, there is very seldom  anything there. They are often repeating something they heard last  night on FOX or MSNBC, but it wouldn't be recognizable to the Founders  as a principle. For them, a fundamental principle was that you had to  unleash the imagination of people with different sets of experiences  and different sets of opinions and from different geographic places in  order to do the right thing for this country. That is what we should do  today.   I realize the indulgence of the Presiding Officer. I thank him for  his kindness.   With that, I yield the floor.    Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate so much my  colleagues being out here on the floor.   We are debating a bill that relates to 16 percent of our gross  domestic product, almost 20 percent of our economy.   I wish there were folks on the other side of the aisle who were out  here tonight having this debate. I thank my colleague from Minnesota  for the point she made.   I want to state that I am really discouraged about where we are in  our political system right now, and part of that is because politicians  seem to think they can say one thing when they are running for office  and do another thing when they get here and that somehow there is not a  consequence.   I guess one of the reasons people think there is no consequence is  that we have begun to treat edited content--journalism--as though  somehow it is inferior to somebody just shooting their mouth off on the  internet. We hear the President verbally assaulting journalists who  have covered terrorism and who have tried to bring the story in Syria  to the United States. Some have lost their lives. The President says  they are not covering terrorism; then he attacks them as fake news. He  goes to places like Youngstown and gets people to attack CNN or the New  York Times or the Wall Street Journal--anything that is actually edited  content.   I think it is because he thinks, A, he will not withstand the  scrutiny of real journalists, but I think, B, he thinks it will help  with this anything-goes style of politics, which says you can say one  thing in the election and do something else.    I ask for an additional 3 minutes.    I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I just don't think this Republic will work  very well if we don't have a free press that is respected and if we  don't hold people accountable for their campaign promises.   Here is one of the things Donald Trump said during the campaign about  what he was going to produce for the American people with respect to  healthcare. He said that it was going to be beautiful, terrific--a  beautiful and terrific plan to provide such great healthcare at a tiny  fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy.   That is what he said, in rally after rally across the United States  of America, and a lot of people believed it. He talked about how much  he hated the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, whatever you want to  call it, and all the reasons why; many of the reasons he talked about  were manufactured.   But that doesn't really matter anymore. He is the President. The  Republicans are in the majority of the Senate, and the Republicans have  a majority of the House. Their characterization--or  mischaracterization--of the Affordable Care Act is not the issue  anymore; the issue is what are they going to do for people living in  the State of Colorado who are dealing with a healthcare system that is  not supporting them terribly well. My colleagues heard that right.  People who support the Affordable Care Act or oppose it, in my State,  are deeply discouraged about the way our healthcare system works. And I  think that if the President were keeping his promise, we would see 100  people support the bill because it is actually consistent with what  people at home want. They want more transparency when it comes to  healthcare. They want more affordability. They want more  predictability. That is what they want.   If I set out to write a bill less responsive to that aspiration of  the people I represent, who are critics of the Affordable Care Act-- Republicans in my State--I couldn't write a bill less responsive than  the one the House of Representatives has passed and the one that was  introduced by the majority leader after he wrote it in secret.   It is 8:20 on the night we are going to have this vote, and we  haven't seen the bill. After a year and a half of almost countless  committee hearings, after adopting almost 200 Republican amendments on  the Affordable Care Act, and then going to townhall after townhall,  being accused of being a Bolshevik who hadn't read the bill, my  question is, Why aren't people being held to that standard tonight?  Maybe they are not asking us to read the bill because there is no bill  at 8:20 on the night that we are supposed to take away 16 million  Americans' healthcare, or 20 million Americans' healthcare--on the  night we are supposed to vote for a bill that the Congressional Budget  Office says will jack up insurance rates by 20 percent.   They wrote the bill in secret. They didn't have a single hearing in  the Senate--not one hearing in the Senate. Now it is 8:20 at night, and  there are people in my State who think they are going to lose their  health insurance because they might be one of those 16 million people  or they might have a kid or a parent who has a preexisting condition,  like the thousands of people who have contacted my office. They are  terrified, and they are not even on the floor, and they can't read the  bill. Read the bill.   Now we are told there is going to be a procedural trick that is going  to allow the House of Representatives to just pass this through over  the weekend.   That is a shameful way to run the Senate. It is exactly the opposite  of what the majority leader promised he would do when he was the  minority leader in the Senate. He is the one who said: If you can't get  a vote from the other side--if you can't get one vote from the other  side--you maybe should acknowledge that the American people aren't  behind your bill.   They can't even get all of the Republicans to vote for this. They had  to have Mike Pence, who is the Vice President, come here to break a  tie. What a disgrace to ask the executive branch to come here and save  your bacon because you can't get the votes. And there is not a  Democratic vote for this bill tonight because it doesn't meet the test  that the minority leader himself had.   I see my colleague from Michigan is here. I will yield the floor by  just saying that we should stop this catastrophe. The only thing we  know about this catastrophe is if it passes, there will be 16 million  people who lose their health insurance and a bunch of rates go up. If  we don't do it, that will not happen.   I yield the floor.
