 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate overwhelmingly  approved the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and  Deterrence Act, known as the TRACED Act, authored by our colleagues  Senators Thune and Markey.   I am pleased to have been a cosponsor of this bill to help protect  consumers from fraudulent, aggravating, and incessant robocalls.   The TRACED Act makes a number of important changes to our laws that  will make it easier to fight illegal robocalls.   Most important, the TRACED Act requires telecommunications carriers  to implement what is known as SHAKEN/STIR technology to verify whether  caller IDs that appear on incoming calls are authentic.   When fully implemented, this technology will be a major advance  against the illegal spoofing of calls that have resulted in successful  scams.   Combating illegal robocalls has long been a focus of the Senate's  Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, and on which the Presiding  Officer serves.   Over the past 6 years, the Special Committee on Aging has held 22  hearings to examine scams that specifically target older Americans.  Scams that we have highlighted include the IRS imposter scam, the  Jamaican lottery scam, computer tech support schemes, grandparent  scams, elder financial exploitation, identity theft, and the notorious  drug mule scam.   The number and the kind of these scams are endless in their variety.  The criminals are ruthless and relentless, and they will continue to  come up with new ways to defraud Americans, particularly our seniors.   These scams are often initiated by robocallers who use caller ID  spoofing to perpetrate their schemes. Many of us remember back in 2003  when the Do Not Call Registry was created. At that point, what we were  able to do was register our phone numbers and block those unwanted,  illegal robocalls. Fortunately, back then, telecommunications equipment  could not easily be  [[Page S3083]]  used to disguise a caller ID to make it look like the call was coming  from someplace other than its origin.   Unfortunately, technology today and particularly the emergence of the  voice over internet protocol technology has changed all that to the  point where the Do Not Call Registry has become virtually useless for  most Americans. Now criminals can use VoIP to hide their identities  while generating millions of robocalls from anywhere in the world at  practically no cost.   We heard in the Aging Committee some heart-wrenching stories of  consumers who have been ripped off because of the combination of the  robocall and the disguising of the identity of the caller.   For example, in 2015, we heard from the Auburn, ME, Police Department  about a woman who lost $7,400 because she got one of these calls, and  it was followed by another call that appeared to be the Auburn Police  Department. That is what appeared on her caller ID. Yet, of course, it  was nothing of the sort. But that was sufficient to make her think she  really did have to pay what turned out to be $7,400 of her retirement  savings, which she could ill afford to lose.   In 2017, we heard from an 81-year-old veteran from Portland, ME,  Phillip Hatch, who was a victim of the IRS imposter scam. In these  scams, what happens is the robocaller pretends to be an IRS agent. He  or she will tell the person who answers the phone that the consumer  owes thousands of dollars in back taxes and penalties and that if they  are not paid immediately, they will either be arrested or a lien will  be put on their home. They manage to panic people of all ages-- particularly our seniors--into paying money they do not owe to the IRS.   Everyone should be aware that if you really do owe back taxes to the  IRS, you will get a letter from the IRS. You won't be called up and  threatened. But that, unfortunately, is what these con artists, these  ruthless criminals, do.   Well, Mr. Hatch was induced to pay some $8,000 when he got a second  call that appeared to be from the Portland Police Department telling  him that if he did not pay up immediately, there was a warrant for his  arrest--again, completely bogus. Mr. Hatch did not owe back taxes, much  less penalties, but it was the spoofing of the call that made it look  like it was from the Portland Police Department in this case--the  Auburn Police Department in the previous case I described--that caused  him to lose a substantial amount of money. His situation would have  been even worse if his son had not intervened. He would have lost even  more.   This is a problem that is getting worse every day. Oddly enough,  lately on my cell phones, I have been receiving robocalls that are in  Chinese, which is really bizarre. I don't know whether they are  targeting a Chinese-American population in some part of the Washington,  DC, area, but that is what I have been getting lately. But all of us  know how frequent, how annoying, and in many cases how dangerous these  robocalls can be when they are conducted by these ruthless criminals.   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission logged an incredible 3.8  billion complaints about illegal robocalls. This year, industry sources  estimate that nearly half of all mobile phone calls are fraudulent-- nearly half. So this is a problem that deserves our attention. The  American people are tired of having scammers ring their phones off the  hook--or their cell phones--and they want these calls stopped. We have  to do all we can to give the regulators the important tools to help  fight these illegal robocalls.   I am very pleased that we have taken an important step today and that  the Federal Communications Commission is also acting to increase the  protections for consumers. We should be able to rely on the veracity of  our caller ID identifications. That is why we have caller ID. But the  spoofers have managed to defeat the purpose of caller ID, including  being able to pretend to be the Department of Treasury, the Auburn  Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies. No wonder people  pick up the phone when they see the Department of Treasury, the Auburn  Police Department, or the IRS is calling, but, in fact, that is not who  is calling; it is a relentless criminal who is trying to steal money  from the consumer.   It is my hope that this important consumer protection bill, which  builds on all of the 22 hearings our Aging Committee has held, will  become law shortly and provide relief to American consumers.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, access to quality healthcare is the  foundation of any community. Throughout his long and distinguished  career at Stephens Memorial Hospital in Norway, ME, Dr. William Medd  has helped to build that foundation in Oxford County. It is a pleasure  to join his friends and neighbors in thanking him for 45 years of  expert, dedicated, and compassionate service.   Healthcare is essential to the vitality, even the survival, of rural  communities. In a recent interview, Dr. Medd said that, after he  graduated from the University of Rochester Medical School, he had a  wide choice of places to practice. He decided to practice in a place  where he could make a real difference, and he certainly has. His role  in starting the Maine Track program through Maine Medical Center and  the Tufts University School of Medicine to recruit young physicians to  rural practice will make a difference for generations to come.   When a new medical center opened in Norway 3 years ago, it was named  in Dr. Medd's honor as a tribute to his many contributions to his  community. Just as important is the gratitude the people throughout the  Oxford Hills region have for his outstanding attentiveness to their  health and well-being. I offer Dr. William Medd my congratulations upon  his retirement and best wishes for the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from  Minnesota, Senator Tina Smith, to introduce the TICK Act. This stands  for Ticks: Identify, Control, and Knockout Act. I would also like to  recognize my colleague from Maine, Senator King, who is joining us as  an original cosponsor.   Our bipartisan legislation would provide local communities and States  with the resources needed to help prevent, detect early, and treat Lyme  and other tick-borne diseases.   Tick-borne diseases like Lyme have become a major public health  concern, with the incidence exploding over the past 15 years. The  number of Americans with tick-borne diseases has been rising at an  alarming rate. In 2003, Lyme disease infected approximately 30,000  Americans. Last year there were an estimated 450,000 cases--a  staggering 1,400-percent increase.   In Maine, last year alone, there were 2,000 new cases of Lyme  disease. That is a sharp increase from the 752 cases in 2010.   Other tick-borne diseases are also on the rise. Anaplasmosis, for  example, has more than tripled.   Far too many Americans with Lyme disease experience a complex  diagnostic odyssey that takes months or even years. One of my  constituents, Paula Jackson Jones, from Damariscotta, ME, shared with  me her harrowing tale that took 2 years, scores of tests, and 23  different physicians before she finally received the correct diagnosis  that she had Lyme disease. Her journey started one afternoon 10 years  ago after raking leaves in her backyard. A week later, unusual symptoms  began to appear: anxiety attacks, pain, muscle spasms, and fatigue.  These symptoms became debilitating.   Before receiving the correct diagnosis, Paula was diagnosed  incorrectly with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and other diseases.  Once she finally received the proper diagnosis and treatment, Paula  founded Midcoast Lyme Disease Support & Education, a nonprofit that  raises public awareness about Lyme disease.   She told me:         This has been a 10-year crusade for me with the first 5       years fighting for my life and the latter, fighting on behalf       of others.    In addition to the physical and emotional toll that Lyme disease  takes, it is also expensive. Paula is still paying off more than  $250,000 worth of medical bills that she has incurred. Medical costs of  Lyme disease are estimated at $1.3 billion per year. When accounting  for indirect medical costs, including the loss of work, the annual cost  balloons to $75 billion per year.   A correct and early diagnosis can reduce costs, as well as improve  the prognosis, but we have a long way to go. When HIV became a public  health crisis, fortunately, a gold standard for identification and  treatment was developed within 10 years. Lyme disease, by contrast, was  identified more than 40 years ago; yet there still is no gold standard  treatment, and existing prevention, education, and diagnostic efforts  have proven to be inadequate.   The TICK Act would apply a three-pronged approach to addressing Lyme  and other tick and vector-borne diseases. First, it would establish an  office of oversight and coordination of vector-borne diseases at the  Department of Health and Human Services. This office would develop a  national strategy to prevent and treat Lyme and other tick-borne  diseases. It would expand research and improve testing, treatment  affordability, and public awareness. The office would also coordinate  with key Federal agencies, including the CDC, the Department of  Defense, USDA, and EPA to protect Americans from these diseases.   Second, our bill would reauthorize the Regional Centers for  Excellence in Vector-Borne Disease, which Congress established in 2017  in response to the Zika outbreak. Since then, tick-borne diseases have  accounted for three out of four vector-borne diseases in our country,  and these centers have been effective in leading the scientific  response. The Collins-Smith bill would reauthorize these centers for  another 5 years at $10 million per year.   Finally, our bill would establish CDC grants, which would be awarded  to State health departments to improve data collection and analysis,  support early detection and diagnosis, improve treatment and heighten  public awareness. The TICK Act takes a comprehensive approach to  address tick-borne diseases.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  at the conclusion of my remarks letters of support signed by more than  2 dozen organizations supporting our bill, including the Midcoast Lyme  Disease and Support Education organization, the LivLyme Foundation, the  Northeast Regional Center for Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases, the  National Association of County and City Health Officials, and the  Entomological Society of America.   I urge all of our colleagues to support this important legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       May 22, 2019.      Re: Stakeholder Support for Bill on Vector-Borne Disease           Management.       Hon. Susan Collins,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Vector-Borne Disease       Network and allied organizations, we the undersigned write to       articulate our support for the objectives of ``Ticks:       Identify, Control, and Knockout Act'' or the ``TICK Act,''       which aims to combat the escalating burden of VBD. The       Vector-Borne Disease Network is a new stakeholder group of       non-profit organizations led by the Entomological Society of       America (ESA) that aims to reduce human and animal suffering       caused by arthropod disease vectors.        Illnesses such as Lyme disease, Zika virus, Malaria, and       West Nile virus are transmitted by vector organisms,       primarily blood-feeding insects or arthropods. Vectors ingest       disease-causing germs when biting an infected human or animal       and later inject them into a new host during a subsequent       bite.        Between 2004 and 2016, reported human disease cases in the       U.S. resulting from bites from arthropods--primarily ticks       and mosquitoes--tripled, according to the U.S. Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Meanwhile, nine new       germs spread by ticks and mosquitoes were discovered or       introduced in that same timeframe. Disease vectors also pose       significant threats to both livestock and companion animals.       The underlying causes for these trends are varying and       complex, and so are the potential solutions.        Due to all the challenges mentioned above, and the growing       threat to American health and security posed by vector-borne       disease (VBD), the Vector-Borne Disease Network is pleased to       see new legislation that aims to establish an Office of       Oversight and Coordination for VBD within the Department of       Health and Human Services to promote interagency       coordination; develop and maintain a national plan for       responding to VBD; reauthorize the CDC Regional Centers of       Excellence in VBD for five years; and authorize a cooperative       agreement through CDC to support state health department       efforts to improve management, surveillance, diagnosis, and       education.        On behalf of this coalition of stakeholders invested in the       mission to reduce the public-health and economic risks posed       by ticks and mosquitoes, we thank you for your commitment to       this critical issue.            Sincerely,        Anastasia Mosquito Control District of St. Johns County       (FL); Associated Executives of Mosquito Control Work in New       Jersey; Drexel University, College of Medicine; Entomological       Society of America; Colorado Tick-Borne Disease Awareness       Association; College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,       University of Wisconsin-Madison; Hudson Valley Lyme Disease       Association; Lyme Association of Greater Kansas City, Inc.;       Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector Borne Disease;       National Association of Vector-Borne Disease Control       Officials; New Jersey Mosquito Control Association; North       Fork Deer Management Alliance;  [[Page S3112]]         Northeast Regional Center for Excellence in Vector Borne       Diseases; Pacific Southwest Center of Excellence in Vector-      Borne Diseases; School of Veterinary Medicine at UW-Madison;       Southeastern Regional Center of Excellence in Vector Borne       Diseases; University of Miami Miller School of Medicine;       University of Rhode Island Center for Vector-Borne Disease;       University of Rhode Island TickEncounter Resource Center; US       Biologic; Western Gulf Center of Excellence for Vector-borne       Disease.                                   ____               Letter of Support for the TICK Act--May 21, 2019         Please pass along my sincere gratitude to Senator Collins       for taking on this fight on our behalf. This has been a 10-      year crusade for me with the first 5 years fighting for my       life and the latter, fighting on behalf of others.        Bit by a tick in Oct 2009 while outside doing fall clean up       with my husband, I was misdiagnosed for the next 2.5 years by       23 doctors and specialist from panic attacks to chronic       fatigue to fibromyalgia. When a scan revealed lesions on my       brain appeared and my neurological symptoms intensified, I       was tested and diagnosed with MS. When my symptoms became       even more severe and I was not responding to treatment, I was       reevaluated and my diagnosis changed to Parkinson's. When I       began to have trouble swallowing and using my arms and legs       was a daily challenged, my medical providers wanted me tested       for ALS. I knew that was a death sentence for me and it was       at this point I knew that I needed to fight. This was when I       spoke out for the first time and advocated for myself.        Thanks to my sister in law who kept pressing me to be       checked for Lyme disease, even though I had 4 negative tests,       I demanded to see a provider who knew about Lyme. My primary       refused to give me a referral because that was not what they       thought I had. The intern gave me a scrap of paper with the       name of someone he knew saw Lyme patients and that doctor,       number 24, saved my life.        Shortly thereafter, with bloodwork and additional tests, I       was diagnosed with late stage neurological Lyme, Babesia,       Bartonella, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Erlichiosis.        These medical providers who knew more about Lyme and tick-      borne disease not only saved my life but gave my life back to       me.        Today, I am in full remission going on 5 years.        In April of 2014, I co-founded and became President of       Midcoast Lyme Disease Support & Education (MLDSE), a       charitable nonprofit 501c3 organization that travels       statewide, hosting year-round free educational and prevention       talks and event. We advocate for changes at state and federal       levels and provide support to those in Maine afflicted by       tick-borne disease by connecting them to medical providers       and financial assistance programs. We are the Maine partner       of the national Lyme Disease Association, members of Maine's       CDC Vector-borne Work Group and active in Maine's Lyme       legislation. In 2018, I wore a federal hat as the co-chair to       the HHS Tick-borne Disease Working Group's Access to Care       Services and Patient Support subcommittee. I honored to have       been selected for that role as it defines who I am these       days, sitting in the trenches alongside patients and their       families and connecting them with whatever services they need       as they journey back towards health and wellness. I am not a       victim but a survivor and one who advocates for those who       cannot advocate for themselves.        This is a fulltime job for and one that I do on a voluntary       basis without pay.        Sen Collins, your support is so greatly needed as funding       is crucial to our work here on the ground as well as on the       hill. You see, when people are personally touched by       something, they fight and they fight hard to make changes. We       will not stop fighting until the status quo changes. Until       the new science is embraced and patients are treated with       fairness and equality, irregardless of the disease that they       may have. We will fight to protect the doctors who put their       careers on the line each and every day to save their       patients.        When a cancer doctor thinks outside the box and heals their       patient, they are deemed a hero. When a Lyme provider does       it, they are brought up under medical scrutiny and       disciplined beyond belief.        The governing body that exists and controls all things to       do with disease (IDSA) wrote in their guidelines a foot note       that reads as follows:        These guidelines were developed and issued on behalf of the       Infectious Diseases Society of America.        It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always       account for individual variation among patients. They are not       intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to       particular patients or special clinical situations. The       Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to       these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate       determination regarding their application to be made by the       physician in the light of each patient's individual       circumstances.        In 2013, ILADS introduced another set of diagnostic and       treatment options and after passing a rigorous qualifying       process, it was introduced into the National Guidelines       Clearinghouse but ignored by IDSA and dismissed by mainstream       medicine.        In 2015 advocates, patients and medical providers were       forced to pushed through a bill of protection [Maine Public       law LD422] to protect those knowledgeable about tick-borne       disease who choose to do just that--focus on the individual       circumstances of each patient and treat accordingly        Sen Collins, Lyme and tick-borne disease is not a cookie       cutter disease and a cookie cutter approach has failed time       and time again. With your bill, a strong push and more       funding will help with provider and patient education and       access to better diagnostic and treatment services.        Thank You so much,        Paula Jackson Jones, President and Co-Founder, Midcoast       Lyme Disease Support & Education, Co-Chair of Access to Care       Services and Patient Support, subcommittee of the HHS Federal       Tick-borne Disease Working, Group; Maine partner of the       National Lyme Disease Association; Member of Maine CDC       Vector-Borne Workgroup; Active in Maine's Lyme Legislation       movement.

This has been a 10-      year crusade for me with the first 5 years fighting for my       life and the latter, fighting on behalf of others.        Bit by a tick in Oct 2009 while outside doing fall clean up       with my husband, I was misdiagnosed for the next 2.5 years by       23 doctors and specialist from panic attacks to chronic       fatigue to fibromyalgia. When a scan revealed lesions on my       brain appeared and my neurological symptoms intensified, I       was tested and diagnosed with MS. When my symptoms became       even more severe and I was not responding to treatment, I was       reevaluated and my diagnosis changed to Parkinson's. When I       began to have trouble swallowing and using my arms and legs       was a daily challenged, my medical providers wanted me tested       for ALS. I knew that was a death sentence for me and it was       at this point I knew that I needed to fight. This was when I       spoke out for the first time and advocated for myself.        Thanks to my sister in law who kept pressing me to be       checked for Lyme disease, even though I had 4 negative tests,       I demanded to see a provider who knew about Lyme. My primary       refused to give me a referral because that was not what they       thought I had. The intern gave me a scrap of paper with the       name of someone he knew saw Lyme patients and that doctor,       number 24, saved my life.        Shortly thereafter, with bloodwork and additional tests, I       was diagnosed with late stage neurological Lyme, Babesia,       Bartonella, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Erlichiosis.        These medical providers who knew more about Lyme and tick-      borne disease not only saved my life but gave my life back to       me.        Today, I am in full remission going on 5 years.        In April of 2014, I co-founded and became President of       Midcoast Lyme Disease Support & Education (MLDSE), a       charitable nonprofit 501c3 organization that travels       statewide, hosting year-round free educational and prevention       talks and event. We advocate for changes at state and federal       levels and provide support to those in Maine afflicted by       tick-borne disease by connecting them to medical providers       and financial assistance programs. We are the Maine partner       of the national Lyme Disease Association, members of Maine's       CDC Vector-borne Work Group and active in Maine's Lyme       legislation. In 2018, I wore a federal hat as the co-chair to       the HHS Tick-borne Disease Working Group's Access to Care       Services and Patient Support subcommittee. I honored to have       been selected for that role as it defines who I am these       days, sitting in the trenches alongside patients and their       families and connecting them with whatever services they need       as they journey back towards health and wellness. I am not a       victim but a survivor and one who advocates for those who       cannot advocate for themselves.        This is a fulltime job for and one that I do on a voluntary       basis without pay.        Sen Collins, your support is so greatly needed as funding       is crucial to our work here on the ground as well as on the       hill. You see, when people are personally touched by       something, they fight and they fight hard to make changes. We       will not stop fighting until the status quo changes. Until       the new science is embraced and patients are treated with       fairness and equality, irregardless of the disease that they       may have. We will fight to protect the doctors who put their       careers on the line each and every day to save their       patients.        When a cancer doctor thinks outside the box and heals their       patient, they are deemed a hero. When a Lyme provider does       it, they are brought up under medical scrutiny and       disciplined beyond belief.        The governing body that exists and controls all things to       do with disease (IDSA) wrote in their guidelines a foot note       that reads as follows:        These guidelines were developed and issued on behalf of the       Infectious Diseases Society of America.        It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always       account for individual variation among patients. They are not       intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to       particular patients or special clinical situations. The       Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to       these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate       determination regarding their application to be made by the       physician in the light of each patient's individual       circumstances.        In 2013, ILADS introduced another set of diagnostic and       treatment options and after passing a rigorous qualifying       process, it was introduced into the National Guidelines       Clearinghouse but ignored by IDSA and dismissed by mainstream       medicine.        In 2015 advocates, patients and medical providers were       forced to pushed through a bill of protection [Maine Public       law LD422] to protect those knowledgeable about tick-borne       disease who choose to do just that--focus on the individual       circumstances of each patient and treat accordingly        Sen Collins, Lyme and tick-borne disease is not a cookie       cutter disease and a cookie cutter approach has failed time       and time again. With your bill, a strong push and more       funding will help with provider and patient education and       access to better diagnostic and treatment services.        Thank You so much,        Paula Jackson Jones, President and Co-Founder, Midcoast       Lyme Disease Support & Education, Co-Chair of Access to Care       Services and Patient Support, subcommittee of the HHS Federal       Tick-borne Disease Working, Group; Maine partner of the       National Lyme Disease Association; Member of Maine CDC       Vector-Borne Workgroup; Active in Maine's Lyme Legislation       movement.
