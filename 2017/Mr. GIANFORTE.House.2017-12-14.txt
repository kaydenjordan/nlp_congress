 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill (H.R. 2815) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New  Jersey, as the ``Sergeant John Basilone Post Office'', as proposed to  be passed under suspension of the rules, be modified by the amendment I  have placed at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.   The Clerk read as follows:         Amendment by Mr. Gianforte        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. GUNNERY SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New       Jersey, shall be known and designated as the ``Gunnery       Sergeant John Basilone Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone Post       Office''.    Mr. GIANFORTE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Montana?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request  of the gentleman from Montana?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the  unfinished business is the question on suspending the rules and passing  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana  (Mr. Gianforte) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, as  amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to  designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at  30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New Jersey, as the `Gunnery  Sergeant John Basilone Post Office'.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, America lost a hero this week, and I lost  a friend.   Tim Frable trained at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and flew  missions in a P-51 over Japan during World War II. During one mission,  he had to ditch into the Pacific. He and a wing mate floated for days  before being rescued.   Tim was my science teacher in junior high school. He told his ocean  rescue story in 5-minute installments at the end of class each day.  Because of his storytelling, no one missed class.   Tim loved Montana. In 1976, he brought me and 17 other classmates  from Pennsylvania to Red Lodge to  [[Page H9926]]  hike into the back country. We hiked to Black Canyon Lake, Grasshopper  Glacier, Froze-to-Death Plateau, and onto the Absaroka Lake Plateau.   Tim had a tremendous impact on many lives in his 93 years, including  my own. I will always be grateful for his service to our country and  for his dedication as a teacher. I will miss my friend Tim Frable.                            ____________________
