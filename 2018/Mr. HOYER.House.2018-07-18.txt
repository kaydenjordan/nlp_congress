 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the ICE agents for being present.   It is unfortunate that our Republican colleagues are not present  doing the business that cries out to be done.   I am voting ``present'' on this resolution because it is a sham and a  distraction. It is an outrageous attempt to hide the continued  suffering of children behind a partisan attack on Democrats.   This is exactly the kind of gotcha vote that alienates Americans from  our government. It is as shameless as it is inappropriate. It is  inappropriate because Republicans are not doing a single thing to  address the crisis of children still separated from their parents, even  after a court ruled that they need to be reunited.   Democrats refuse to play the Republicans' game when it comes to  children's well-being and the safety of those who come here seeking  asylum. We are not falling for this trap, and you can say we are doing  it as much as you want. Democrats support secure borders and honor the  service of all whose lives are at risk in protecting our country and  our people.   I take a back seat to no one in the House over the years in  supporting our law enforcement personnel, but we will neither be silent  nor will we cease fighting to bring an end to the dangerous and  inhumane policies of the Trump administration that are traumatizing  families and children at our borders, which Senator McCain correctly  called ``an affront to the decency of the American people.''   Shame on the Republican House majority for putting such blatant  partisanship ahead of the children. Shame on you for using our law  enforcement agents as pawns in your political games.
