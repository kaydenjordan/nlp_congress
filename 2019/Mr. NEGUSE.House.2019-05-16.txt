 Mr. Chairman, across the State of Colorado and across my  district, the cost of healthcare is an urgent concern to so many of my  constituents. That is why I am proud to support the legislation  championed by our chairman today.   Today's legislation will provide much-needed reforms to lower the  cost of healthcare, protect people with preexisting conditions, and  lower the cost of prescription drugs--and these reforms are urgently  needed.   We know for a fact that American consumers pay far more for  prescription drugs than it costs to manufacture them. In Colorado, over  half a million people each year don't fill a prescription because of  the cost--half a million people. The burden has led to heartbreaking  stories across my State and  [[Page H3863]]  across the Nation of individuals forced to choose between feeding their  loved ones and taking life-sustaining medications.   Today's legislation will provide much-needed reforms, will lower  prescription drug costs by ending the tactics used by so many drug  manufacturers to keep less expensive drugs off the market, and will  bring generics to market faster.   I urge passage of the provisions on the floor today to ensure that no  American has to skip doses of lifesaving medication because of the cost  and no American goes bankrupt paying for their healthcare.   I thank the chairman again for his leadership in championing this  legislation.
