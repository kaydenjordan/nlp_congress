 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on Good Friday, the U.S. Capitol  Police were subjected to another violent attack. Once again, our  uniformed heroes wound up in harm's way, and Officer Billy Evans, a  friend and favorite of many here on the Senate side and a faithful  protector of the Capitol, was killed.   Investigators are still assessing what drove the perpetrator to  attempt this attack on the Capitol and whether domestic, violent  extremism played a role. He appears to have been captivated by the  Nation of Islam--a racist, anti-Semitic, extreme group under the openly  hateful leader, Louis Farrakhan.   His attack injured Officer Ken Shaver, and it stole away the life of  Officer Evans from his children Logan and Abigail, his mother Janice,  his entire family, and all of his friends and colleagues decades too  soon.   Officer Evans was famous within the Senate for his friendly spirit  and easy manner. He was the first face that many would see on the way  to work here in the Capitol every day. His particular post often meant  he was literally the first line of defense of the Congress--the  interface between these grounds and the outside world. We could not  have had a kinder and more likeable ambassador at this juncture or a  more faithful protector to keep us safe.   It will be with tremendous grief, but tremendous gratitude, that we  will welcome Officer Evans to the Capitol for a final time tomorrow  where he will lie in honor in the Rotunda.   I think I speak for the entire Senate when I salute all of our U.S.  Capitol Police officers for the heroism, courage, and resilience they  displayed the Friday before last and which they display every single  day. The Senate and the Nation are profoundly grateful for your  selfless service.
