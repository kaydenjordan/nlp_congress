 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a dear friend of  mine, Brother Fred Wolfe.   Fred Hartwell Wolfe was born December 5, 1936, in Rock Hill, South  Carolina, and he passed away on January 3, 2021. I was standing on this  very floor being sworn in the moment they let me know he had passed  away.  [[Page H515]]    To so many people in this country, Fred Wolfe was a friend. He was a  spiritual leader. He was a life coach. He was a father figure. He was a  big brother. That is why we all simply called him Brother Fred.                                time  1015    Brother Fred had a God-given ability to make everyone feel special,  and he truly believed that everyone was special. Every waking moment in  Brother Fred's life, he understood that God was not only watching him,  but God knew exactly what His next step would be in Fred's life.   Brother Fred, on numerous occasions, would tell me that everything in  our life is controlled by God, and everything was put here to serve  God.   Later in life, Brother Fred's health started breaking down, but he  never took his eyes off of God. I remember when he had open-heart  surgery and the men from the church would stay with him to take care of  his needs. One night when I was there with Brother Fred, I asked him  how his open-heart surgery had played a role in God's master plan.   He told me, I don't know. He said, It is part of the plan, but I  don't know. I am here to serve. I thought that was a pretty strange  response seeing he just had his chest cracked open and everything moved  around. But he knew he would wait. He told me, We may never know; then  again, we may.   Just a few minutes later, a nurse came walking in to take his vital  signs--of course, as they do in the hospitals and keep you awake all  night--while doing so, he smiled at Brother Fred and said, You don't  remember me, but a few years ago, I got saved under your ministry.   Unfortunately, I have slipped away from God, and I am paying the  price in my family today.   With all the tubes, with all the monitors, with everything going off  in that room, Brother Fred stopped what he was thinking and doing and  prayed with that man. He left with much higher spirits than he actually  entered with.   As we sat there quietly, I was thinking, Did God use Fred Wolfe in  this position because of this man? I looked up and made eye contact  with Fred, who was laying in the bed, he simply winked and rolled over  and went to sleep like he knew that was the answer.   For thousands of people who were saved under his ministry, raised  their family with his wisdom, and learned that God is the most  important thing in their life, I say this is not good-bye, for we will  see you again. We will see Miss Anne, and we will see Brother Fred at  the right hand of God.                            ____________________
