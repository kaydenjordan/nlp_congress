 Mr. Speaker, 81 days. That is how long it took for  Republicans to change their position from abortion as a State issue to  supporting a nationwide abortion ban; 81 days to put their hypocrisy on  full display for every American--every woman--to see.   Mr. Speaker, this is what it looks like when lawmakers show their  true intention. Their intention is to go beyond the Supreme Court's  disastrous decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Their intention is to go  beyond the horrific State laws that have already stripped millions of  women and young girls of their reproductive rights. Republicans backing  this new proposal want to ban every woman in America from seeking  abortion care--no exceptions.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker. If Republicans get their way, women's  lives will be at risk, and many will die from delayed or denied care.   For our daughters, we cannot--we will not--let them win.                            ____________________
