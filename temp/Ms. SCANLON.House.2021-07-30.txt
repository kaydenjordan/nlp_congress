 Madam Speaker, my community in southeastern Pennsylvania  was deeply impacted by the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.   Members of our community were among the flight crews and passengers  [[Page H4301]]  on the hijacked planes, others worked at the World Trade Center or  Pentagon that day and were killed or had to flee for their lives.  Airplanes headed to Philadelphia were diverted to Canada, and the high- rise offices were evacuated with bomb threats. Located between New  York, D.C., and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, our area keenly felt like  the geographic center of the three airplane attacks.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2278, which authorizes the National Park  Service to designate the September 11 National Memorial Trail route  linking the Memorial and Museum in New York to the Pentagon Memorial in  Arlington, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in Somerset  County. The 9/11 Memorial Trail will allow us all not to just engage  with the tragedy of that terrorist attack, but also to heal from it.   In Pennsylvania's Fifth District, the Memorial Trail will link parts  of the Schuylkill River Trail, Kingsessing, the John Heinz National  Wildlife Refuge, and move on through Delaware County.   This bill passed the House with great bipartisan support, and I urge  the Senate to take it up before the 20th anniversary of September 11.                            ____________________
