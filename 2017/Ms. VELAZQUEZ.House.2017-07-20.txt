 Mr. Speaker, since last year, when our intelligence  community concluded that Russia sought to influence our elections, we  have seen a series of terrifying headlines. This has not stopped.   Last week, we found out the President's son took a meeting in which  he anticipated receiving from the Russian Government damaging  information on the Democratic nominee. This was after it was spelled  out in black and white in an email that the information came from the  Kremlin. Donald, Jr.'s, response: I love it. But now we must go  further. We need an independent commission, which Congress can  authorize.   Speaker Ryan, these issues go beyond party. They go to the heart of  our democracy. The American people deserve the truth. Allow a vote on  an independent commission before the August recess.                            ____________________
