 Mr. Speaker, I thank our chair, our leadership,  and, particularly, Nancy Pelosi for making sure that this bill was a  priority bill.   For me, I have dedicated a great part of my life in public service to  helping immigrants who come to the United States in search of a  prosperous and dignified life.   Today, I am honored to participate in this historic day in the House  of Representatives.   Since 2001, when the DREAM Act was first conceived, Dreamers have  waited.   In 2012, DACA enabled eligible young adults to work lawfully, attend  school, and contribute to society without the constant fear of  deportation.   DACA, however, does not provide a path to citizenship, and it leaves  out a huge number of deserving Dreamers.   Now, in 2019, they are still waiting. They are Americans in waiting.  Right now, Dreamers live in fear of being deported to countries they  may never have known, don't remember, or don't know at all, countries  with which they have little or no personal connection.   And, because of their status, most Dreamers have never left the  United States, never having had the opportunity to know their places of  origin and never knowing any other place to call home other than the  American communities in which they grew up. Some don't even know  another language other than English.    Opponents of this bill fail to realize that it is not just about the  Dreamers. It is also their families that would be harmed by mass  deportations. It is their employers who would lose key members of their  workforce. It is their communities who would lose vital members of  their community.   It bears repeating: Dreamers are American in every way except on  paper. In their hearts, in their minds, and in their souls, they are  Americans. They are Americans in waiting.   Many have been in this country for decades, becoming business owners,  employers, and homeowners.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to vigorously condemn  the administration's threats to impose damaging tariffs on imports from  Mexico. The proposal underlines a serious misunderstanding of how our  economy benefits from trade with Mexico.   Here are the facts. Mexico is the United States' largest trading  partner in the world. In Texas alone, Laredo and El Paso saw $55.8  billion and $18.6 billion in trade passing through their borders last  year.   Every product from Mexico will be taxed higher by the White House,  forcing us to pay more for household goods we buy every day. It is not  just the avocados we use for guacamole or the tequilas we use for  margaritas, not that I drink any of them. It will be everything, autos,  computers, and machine goods.   Some estimate that even a 5 percent general tariff could eliminate  more than 400,000 U.S. jobs. This would be catastrophic to my State and  other States on the border.   The White House clearly does not understand the special economic  relationship between Texas and Mexico and has shown that it is willing  to throw away our economy for bravado and bullying.                            ____________________
