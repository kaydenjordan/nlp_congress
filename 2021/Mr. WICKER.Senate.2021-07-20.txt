 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hyde- Smith and I be allowed to use a prop or two during our next  presentation.    Mr. President, thank you very much.   My first prop is a front-page story from the Northeast Mississippi  Daily Journal on Thursday, July 1, 2021. It says:         Hail State! Bulldogs are national champions. Mississippi       State celebrates after winning the College World Series 9-0       against Vanderbilt after the deciding Game 3 on Wednesday in       Omaha. See full coverage: Sports, 1B.    That is my other prop, and that headline says:         Best in Show. Decisive win delivers first national title       for the Mississippi State Bulldogs.    Senator Hyde-Smith and I could not be more delighted to rise this  afternoon and recognize Mississippi State University and their baseball  team on their first national championship in school history in any  sport.   The Bulldogs had been to the College World Series 11 times in the  past, and that in itself is a remarkable achievement. They even got to  the championship series once in 2013. But this year was the year it all  finally came together under Head Coach Chris Lemonis.   They say good pitching wins baseball games, and in this case, it  certainly helped Mississippi State win the College World Series.   The hype had been building around MSU by the time they arrived in  Omaha in mid-June. After beating Texas and then Virginia and then again  beating Texas on a walk-off hit in the bottom of the ninth, the Dawgs  advanced to the championship round to face Vanderbilt.   The Bulldogs dropped the season opener, but the next day, on the  strength of pitching from Houston Harding and Preston Johnson, who  combined to throw a four-hitter, State bounced back with a 13-to-2  victory. They carried that momentum into game 3, where Will Bednar and  Landon Sims took the mound and held Vandy to one single hit. The  Bulldogs won in a 9-to-0 shutout to bring the national title home for  the first time ever to Starkville, MS.   I want to offer my congratulations to Mississippi State Head Coach  Chris Lemonis, who was named Coach of the Year by Collegiate Baseball  Newspaper.   Congratulations are also in order for Will Bednar, who won Most  Outstanding Player at the College World Series and outfielder Tanner  Allen, the SEC Player of the Year. He was also named the American  Baseball Coaches Association National Player of the Year.   In addition, six Bulldogs were named to this year's College World  Series All-Tournament Team: Logan Tanner, Luke Hancock, Lane Forsythe,  Tanner Allen, Rowdey Jordan, and Will Bednar.   I want to commend the Mississippi State Bulldogs team for their  tireless work throughout this season and for their outstanding  achievement. They have made Mississippi State and the entire Magnolia  State of Mississippi proud.   In the words of the late Jack Cristil, the voice of the Bulldogs for  many, many years, you can wrap this one up in the maroon and white.   I yield to my colleague from Mississippi.
