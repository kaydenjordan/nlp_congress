 Madam Chair, let me thank the gentlewoman for offering  this amendment, along with our other colleagues, to H.R. 1112 that  would simply require the Department of Justice to release a report  analyzing the effect of this bill's provisions on the safety of the  victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence,  sexual assault, and stalking.   Madam Chairwoman, I am here on the floor today with the hopes that my  colleagues will listen to the 10 million men, women, and children who  experience domestic violence each year. Domestic violence is a horrible  scourge, and the presence or possession of a gun only worsens these  tragedies.   You heard my colleague, Representative Porter, say that women are  five times more likely to die or be killed in a domestic violence  situation if a gun is owned, which is one of the reasons, Madam Chair,  I have introduced legislation to help incentivize States to adopt laws  that ensure that we do everything to take guns from those with a court  restraining order or other protective order.   I hope, Madam Chair, that my colleagues will listen to the one in  three women and one in four men who have been victims of intimate  partner violence. I sure hope that my colleagues will listen to me as  one of the 4.5 million women who have experienced gun violence  firsthand.   There is much discussion in these Chambers about a national  emergency. Gun violence and domestic violence are a national emergency,  and that is why we have offered this amendment so that our laws  actually reflect the realities.   The data collected will be critical to inform Congress about ways to  prevent needless tragedies in our country, and to help us evolve in a  way that will more accurately protect our constituents.
