 Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden's disastrous tax- and-spend policies, the American people are now facing the highest  levels of inflation in more than 40 years. Americans have seen the  effects of inflation in their paychecks, at the gas pumps, and in the  grocery stores ever since Joe Biden took office.   The latest Bloomberg report concludes that the average U.S. household  will have to earn an extra $5,000 this year just to keep up with  inflation.   Instead of scaling back wasteful government spending, the President's  budget calls for the highest sustained spending and taxes in American  history. Fanning the flames of inflation with more reckless spending  only makes it harder for American families to afford essentials.   Instead, Congress must work to eliminate waste and enable Americans  to reclaim control of their money and their lives.  [[Page H4400]]                                ____________________
