 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Peter  Nezamis of Belleville.   It was recently announced that Colonel Nezamis will be promoted to  brigadier general and will lead the Illinois Air National Guard, where  he will lead over 3,000 personnel.   He commanded the Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing at  Scott Air Force Base, which received the Outstanding Unit Award, under  his guidance.   Colonel Nezamis has commanded numerous expeditionary operations and  flew over 275 combat and combat support hours. He first joined the Air  National Guard in 1986 and has served our State and Nation over 30  years.   Colonel Nezamis, we know you will serve the State and Nation to the  best of your ability, and congratulations in your new role.          Enhancing Agricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans     Mr. Speaker, I also rise to bring awareness about a coming  crisis in our Nation's agricultural workforce.   According to USDA, the average age for a farmer is now 58 and has  been on the rise for over 30 years. Our Nation faces a shortfall of  700,000 agricultural workers over the next 20 years.   How can we reverse this trend? According to the Department of Labor,  45 percent of armed servicemembers are from rural America. Many of our  returning heroes struggle to find employment after serving our Nation.   Agriculture is a sensible solution to fill the economic gap our  veterans face. That is why I joined with my friend and colleague on the  House Agriculture Committee, Al Lawson of Florida, to introduce the  Vets to Ag Act. Our bill streamlines the process for veterans getting  apprenticeships in the agricultural industry.   Despite dysfunction in Washington, we are still fighting for  bipartisan, commonsense solutions to help our farmers and our veterans.  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.                      Human Trafficking Prevention Month     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in recognition of Human  Trafficking and Prevention Month.   Human trafficking cases are on the rise nationwide. As the  grandfather of 11 grandchildren, I am angry about that. My appreciation  goes out to members of law enforcement who are on the front lines  combating these crimes and making our communities safer.   Programs like the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign help  combat human trafficking. The program works to make sure, if  trafficking victims are taken over the border, they are rescued or have  a resource that they can turn to for help.   These are important steps, but there is still so much more work  remaining. Both parties must work together to do our part in wiping out  this evil before it does any more harm.                            ____________________
