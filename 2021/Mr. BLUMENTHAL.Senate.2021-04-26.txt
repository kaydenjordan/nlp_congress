 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  April 27, and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Miller nomination, postcloture; that at 11:30  a.m., all postcloture time be considered expired; that following the  cloture vote on the McCabe nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15  p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is  invoked on the McCabe nomination, all postcloture debate time be  considered expired at 2:30 p.m.; finally, that if any of the  nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's actions.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:21 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 27, 2021, at 10 a.m.
