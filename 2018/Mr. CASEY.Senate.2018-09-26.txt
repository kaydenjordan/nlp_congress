 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I rise today to urge the Senate to pass  the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. This is a bill that  not many Americans have heard about yet, but it is a critically  important bill for the Senate to pass and very important for the  country. This bill will preserve the Justice Department's independent  investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential  election.   Since this weekend, there have been reports that the President may  fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein from his position at the  Department of Justice. This would be a gross abuse of power--a line  that we cannot allow to be crossed without consequence. Mr. Rosenstein  has a long career in public service and law enforcement. He initially  joined the Department of Justice nearly 30 years ago through the  Attorney General's Honors Program and rose through the ranks, serving  as a Trial Attorney, as a Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General  for the Tax Division, and as a U.S. Attorney in Maryland for over a  decade--a critically important job in our justice system.   As Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the Russia  investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which has secured  indictments or guilty pleas from 32 people and 3 companies, including  Russian individuals and companies, as well as former Trump campaign  manager Paul Manafort, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, and other  campaign advisers, including George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.  Earlier this month, Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to ``conspiracy against  the United States.''   Mr. Rosenstein has played an integral role in ensuring that the  Mueller investigation can continue without interference. Unfortunately,  this work and Mr. Rosenstein's long and distinguished service at the  Department of Justice could come to an end if he is fired by the  President.   From day one, President Trump has systematically worked to obstruct  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into Russia's attack on our  Nation. He has attempted to fire, to demand loyalty of, and to  interfere with any official with oversight of this matter. By way of  example, this is a President who fired the Director of the FBI and  later admitted in a television interview that he had done so with the  Russia investigation in mind. This is a President who has repeatedly  attacked the very Attorney General he nominated, suggesting that the  Department of Justice should do his political bidding. This is a  President who has impugned the impartiality and the motives of judges  who have ruled against his policies. This is a President who has  continued to call the Mueller investigation a ``witch-hunt'' despite  the fact that it has already produced dozens of indictments and guilty  pleas.   In short, this is a President who believes the Department of Justice  owes a duty of loyalty to him and him alone. Our Justice Department  officials have a duty to serve the American people and only the  American people. They swear to uphold the Constitution, not to  genuflect to this President or any President.   Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has upheld his duty to the country  and our Constitution. If the President fires him, it will be yet  another blatant attempt to derail the Mueller investigation, and it  could very well be successful.   Rod Rosenstein supervises the Russia investigation, overseeing the  work of Special Counsel Mueller and his team. He receives status  reports, establishes the investigation's budget, and, according to  special counsel regulations, has the power to ``determine whether the  investigation should continue.'' He therefore plays an integral role in  ensuring that the independent investigation can continue to seek  answers on Russia's interference in the 2016 election.   If Mr. Rosenstein were fired, it could compromise the Mueller  investigation in ways the public can see and in ways we may never know  through warrants that are never approved or resources that are diverted  to other projects. This would be a decision by the President that would  put us into unchartered waters. It is therefore more important than  ever that Congress step up and exercise the oversight that the American  people expect from us and I would say especially here in the Senate.   Since President Trump entered office, the Republican majority has not  discharged its duty to act as an independent check on the executive  branch and on the President himself. The majority would not be able to  abdicate its responsibility any longer if Rosenstein were to be fired.   Congress has a solemn obligation to act immediately--immediately--to  protect Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and prevent any more  interference from this administration. Senators in both parties have a  duty to the American people to step up as a coequal branch of  government and ensure that the special counsel's independent  investigation remains just that--independent.   For public officials and institutions with nothing to hide, an  investigation which is independent is not a ``witch-hunt''; it is an  opportunity for vindication, a chance to prove that our institutions  and the individuals who serve them are truly worthy of the public's  trust.   At a time when the American people's confidence in our institution is  low--very low--and when suspicion of wrongdoing is high, it is all the  more important that the 2016 election activities of Russia, as well as  the Trump campaign, be open for review. As the voice of the American  people, we in the Senate must ensure that the investigation both  continues and remains, in fact, independent.   The legislation to protect the Mueller investigation, the Special  Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, is ready for a vote by the full  Senate at any time if the majority leader would permit us to do that.  It is a bipartisan bill that has been approved by a bipartisan majority  of the Judiciary Committee. There is no excuse not to pass this  legislation immediately. Day by day, each time the President attacks  Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein or the rule of law, we are presented  with more evidence of why this legislation is needed. That is why I  have again come to the floor to urge Leader McConnell to bring up this  bill for a vote. It is far past time to put country over party.   We must not forget that the special counsel is investigating an  attack on our democracy by a foreign adversary. As a matter of national  security, the American people deserve answers about what happened  during the 2016 election. We cannot allow anyone, including the  President, to interfere with the investigation and prevent the American  people from getting those answers to very important questions.    Mr. President, September 24 to 28, 2018, marks  Malnutrition Awareness Week. Malnutrition Awareness Week is a multi- organizational, multipronged campaign created by the American Society  for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition to educate healthcare  professionals to identify and treat for malnutrition earlier, educate  consumers and patients to discuss their nutrition status with  healthcare professionals, and increase awareness of nutrition's role in  patient recovery.   Last summer, the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging held a  hearing to discuss the importance of proper nutrition and the impact of  malnutrition on America's seniors. We learned that, in 2014, more than  13 percent of seniors in Pennsylvania reported food insecurity. Experts  shared that poverty, food insecurity, and changes with age  significantly increase the risk of malnutrition.   Unfortunately, we do not know the full extent to which malnutrition  plagues seniors across the country. It is for this reason that last  fall I called on the U.S. Government Accountability Office to examine  what is known about the caloric and nutrient needs of older adults as  well as the extent to which federally funded nutrition programs that  serve older adults are meeting their nutrition needs.   No seniors should have to choose between putting food on the table  and taking their medications. That is why, as ranking member of the  Aging Committee, I authored a bill, the Nourishing Our Golden Years  Act, to improve seniors' access to the senior food box program, my bill  assures that seniors are not kicked off the program simply because of  red tape and difficult deadlines.   We cannot solve malnutrition without better understanding the issue.  Older adults, caregivers and healthcare professionals require guidance  on the identification of and interventions for seniors facing this  crisis. I am pleased to raise awareness about malnutrition among  seniors as part of Malnutrition Awareness Week.                            ____________________
