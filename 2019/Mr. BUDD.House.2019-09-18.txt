 Mr. Speaker, on September 23, Congress will lose one of its  most dedicated Members as Sean Duffy retires from the House.   I will miss his unwavering commitment to conservative principles and  the way that he never backed down from a fight. In fact, he welcomed  them. But he also engaged in a battle of ideas, and he never made it  personal.   It is because of this attitude that freedom and liberty will be  sustained a little longer, and I wish we had more like him. I also  respected his legislative accomplishments, particularly his commitment  to protecting our State-based system of insurance regulation, just one  of his many passions during his time as chairman and ranking member of  the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, Sean will be remembered by me as a friend, a loving  father, a dedicated husband, and a humble public servant. I, for one,  hope this is not the last we hear or see of Congressman Sean Duffy.                            ____________________
