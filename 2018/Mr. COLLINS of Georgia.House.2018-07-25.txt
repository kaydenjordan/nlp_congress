 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ryan  and Abby Burle of Gainesville for creating a book drive for families  with newborns who are receiving lifesaving medical treatment.   The couple was inspired to establish the Mighty Three neonatal  intensive care unit book drive after their triplets, Maggie, Max, and  Miller, underwent medical treatment in Northeast Georgia Medical Center  following their births. For months, Ryan and Abby could not hold their  babies while they received crucial medical attention.   As teachers, the young couple decided that they could leverage  reading to communicate with the triplets using the sound of their voice  to develop a bond with the three tiny patients. The Burles designed the  Mighty Three NICU book drive to give families two books for each baby  receiving treatment at Northeast Georgia Medical Center's Gainesville  hospital.   Initially, the couple set out to collect 850 books but quickly  surpassed that goal. Through their tireless work, the Mighty Three NICU  book drive has provided more than 2,000 books to the hospital on Spring  Street.    Mr. Speaker, I commend Ryan and Abby for their dedication to  encouraging families during times of need, and I wish the two of them  much joy as they raise their three healthy children.            Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Ty Cobb Museum     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join northeast  Georgia in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Ty Cobb Museum.   The museum opened its doors on July 17, 1998, to highlight the legacy  of Ty Cobb, a Banks County native and Baseball Hall of Fame member.   Cobb was a Major League Baseball outfielder who set 90 MLB records  during his career, some of which stand today. He played for the Detroit  Tigers for 22 years, and, later, for the Philadelphia Athletics for two  seasons.   Cobb's remarkable achievements include 4,065 runs scored and batted  in, 897 total stolen bases, and a batting average of 366 at the close  of his career. Additionally, Cobb was the first player ever inducted  into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.   In the community of Royston, The Georgia Peach is remembered for his  philanthropic kindness. He was responsible for the Cobb Memorial  Hospital and the Cobb Educational Fund, which have left a lasting  legacy of love for his hometown.   Mr. Speaker, the Ty Cobb Museum captures significant moments  throughout Cobb's life, from his roots in Royston to this success as  part of American's pastime. I congratulate the staff of the museum for  two decades of service to their Georgia community and wish them well in  their endeavors.                       Congratulating Caroline Lewallen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Caroline Lewallen of Jaemor Farms in Alto.   As a member of the Hall County Farm Bureau and Georgia Farm Bureau's  Young Farmers and Ranchers program, Caroline's commitment to our  State's agricultural industry earned her the program's Excellence in  Agriculture award.   Caroline holds degrees in agricultural education and leadership from  the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, respectively. She  began her career as a student teacher and later became an agricultural  fellow in the office of one of my former colleagues, Congressman Jack  Kingston.   Today, Caroline serves as the agritourism and marketing coordinator  for Jaemor Farms. At Jaemor Farms, Caroline manages all events, like  the festival honoring my favorite peach, the annual Georgia Belle Peach  Festival. She also runs Jaemor Farms' marketing and social media  presence, regularly attracting attention from across the State and the  country.   Mr. Speaker, Caroline has played an important role in promoting the  work of the northeast Georgia farmers by communicating the importance  of locally grown produce for communities, and I want to congratulate  her on this award and wish her well throughout her career.                             Honoring Kit Dunlap     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Kit Dunlap, president and CEO of the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce,  who recently received the Georgia Association of Chamber of Commerce  Executives' Legacy Award.   The Georgia Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives' Legacy  Award is the association's highest honor, recognizing executives who  have dedicated many years to successfully improving their local  chambers of commerce.   Kit has served as the Greater Hall Chamber's top official for more  than 20 years. Her ambition and compassion for others has allowed her  to excel as a leader. Throughout her involvement in the local chamber  of commerce, she has transformed the Greater Hall Chamber by bringing  together a well-connected economic development team. This team has  helped increase capital investment, job availability, and job retention  in the Hall County area.   Additionally, Kit has managed multimillion dollar initiatives,  including the HALLmark campaign and Vision 2030, which helped fund  community-based education and economic development programs.   I congratulate my friend Kit Dunlap on this award and thank her for  her service to the Hall County business community.   Mr. Speaker, as Kit's representative, I must end this speech by  answering the question she asks at the end of each chamber meeting:  What is the water level of Lake Lanier? Well, today, it is 1,071.89.                            ____________________
