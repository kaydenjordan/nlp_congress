 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Al J.  Schneider Company for 75 years of service and contribution to the  Commonwealth of Kentucky.   On September 30th, 1947, the Al J. Schneider Company began its  service by building barracks and other military facilities on Fort  Knox. The company has since built and owned four of the largest hotels  in Louisville, including the Galt House Hotel, the Executive Inn and  Executive West--now known as the Crowne Plaza Louisville Airport--the  Waterfront Office Tower, and One Riverfront Plaza, as well as many  other commercial properties throughout Louisville.   The Al J. Schneider Company was founded with the belief that great  things in great cities are done by the people in the city, including  the $80 million reinvestment of the Galt House Hotel and the employees  who serve our community.   The Al J. Schneider Company has also taken great pride in supporting  the local community with devout support of the Catholic Church,  investment in the University of Louisville, Simmons College of  Kentucky, Louisville Metro Police Foundation, King Solomon Missionary  Baptist Church, and many other nonprofits throughout the Commonwealth.   I am proud to salute the Al J. Schneider Company for their 75 years  of service and accomplishments and have no doubt they will continue to  play an integral role in bettering the Commonwealth.                            ____________________
