 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 496) to repeal the rule issued by the Federal Highway  Administration and the Federal Transit Administration entitled  ``Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area  Reform''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 496         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPEAL.         The rule issued by the Federal Highway Administration and       the Federal Transit Administration entitled ``Metropolitan       Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform''       (81 Fed. Reg. 93448 (December 20, 2016)) shall have no force       or effect, and any regulation revised by that rule shall be       applied as if that rule had not been issued.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Lewis) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 496.

There was no objection.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 496.  [[Page H2824]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Minnesota?   There was no objection.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my colleague across the aisle,  Representative Lipinski, for his work on the original House version of  this legislation and to Senator Duckworth for introducing the  corresponding language in the Senate. We all understood the unintended  ramifications that this last-minute rule created, and we worked  together to address this issue.   This bill rescinds the Federal Highway Administration and Federal  Transit Administration's Metropolitan Planning Organization  Coordination and Planning Reform rule that was promulgated in December,  2016.   After being sworn in to the House of Representatives, one of the  first pieces of legislation I offered was to repeal this rule. Through  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we were able to work  in a bipartisan manner to achieve that goal, and I was proud to serve  as the lead Republican in advancing a commonsense policy unanimously  through our committee.   This flawed rule mandates the expansion of boundaries for federally  required Metropolitan Planning Organizations, or MPOs. There are 409  MPOs in the United States, and the Department of Transportation  identified that more than one-third of these MPOs would immediately be  subject to the new requirements of this rule.   By requiring that MPO boundaries encompass the entire urbanized area  and any surrounding areas that may be urbanized within 20 years, the  Department of Transportation has taken away the ability for States and  localities to determine how to plan their transportation networks. In  many cases, this rule pushes an MPO into the boundary of another MPO,  forcing consolidation of areas that are represented by different  governing bodies. These areas are not capped and could become extremely  expansive. There are even instances where MPOs would be mandated to  include cities and counties in neighboring States.   The question is: Why did the DOT feel the need to institute this  rule? States already have the ability to reassess their MPO boundaries.  MPOs have the ability to expand beyond their boundaries by using  memorandums of understanding. Minnesota uses several for transportation  planning. Additionally, every 4 years, MPOs are required to participate  in a review process that identifies areas of concern like the planning  of projects with neighboring areas.   Meanwhile, in the instances of unelected MPOs, like Minnesota's  Metropolitan Council, this rule encourages them to expand without any  participation or control from local citizens. The MPO council  representing the Twin Cities area is entirely appointed by the  Governor. Through State statute, they have the ability to levy taxes,  and, like all MPOs, they determine what transportation projects to  pursue. An expansion of MPO boundaries could mean a new tax for  surrounding counties to fund transportation projects that do not  address their local needs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and  return current law to what Congress intended when it passed the FAST  Act. This bill ensures that States, cities, and counties retain  decisionmaking ability when it comes to planning their development and  transportation growth.   Our language restores certainty to local officials already in  planning phases for local projects and could save MPOs more than $340  million over the next several years conforming to the regulation. The  essence of this bill is local control. The more government is removed  from the people, the less responsive it becomes. Self-governance works  best when closest to home.   I want to thank Chairman Shuster for his leadership on this matter,  as well as my colleagues, Representative Lipinski and Senator  Duckworth, for their work on this bill, and I encourage all my  colleagues to support our bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Association of Regional Councils and the Association of Metropolitan  Planning Organizations, and a letter from the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials.           National Association of Regional Councils and Association             of Metropolitan Planning Organizations,                                                    April 25, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the members of the       Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (AMPO) and       National Association of Regional Councils (NARC), we wish to       express our strong support for a bill expected on the floor       later today: S. 496--``To repeal the rule issued by the       Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit       Administration entitled ``Metropolitan Planning Organization       Coordination and Planning Area Reform''. This legislation       passed the Senate unanimously on March 8. Identical       legislation from Representatives Daniel Lipinski and Jason       Lewis, H.R. 1346, has the support of 26 bipartisan co-      sponsors and passed the Transportation and Infrastructure       Committee by voice vote on March 29.        AMPO and NARC support increased planning coordination at       all levels, but this Final Rule has significant drawbacks       that make its implementation impractical, and would hinder       the regional planning process and delay project       implementation. Our extensive joint comments to the federal       docket explain in significant detail the problems with this       rule and the negative consequences we believe would result.       Ours was one of more than 600 comments to the docket that       asked this rule be withdrawn or substantially modified.       Neither occurred, so legislative action is required.        Repeal of this Final Rule is a key priority for our       organizations and for many of our members. The legislation       you will consider today would immediately restore certainty       to the planning process for hundreds of planning       organizations. Its bipartisan support is an indication that       members from both parties recognize the damage this Final       Rule could inflict on the transportation planning process and       project implementation.        We thank you for your consideration of this matter, and       reaffirm our request that you support passage of S. 496.            Sincerely,      Leslie Wollack,        Executive Director, National Association of Regional       Councils.      DeLania Hardy,        Executive Director, Association of Metropolitan Planning       Organizations.                                   ____           American Association of State Highway and Transportation             Officials,                                    Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Re H.R. 1346 to repeal the rule issued by the FHWA and the           FTA entitled ``Metropolitan Planning Organization and           Coordination and Planning Area Reform''         Dear Members of Congress: The American Association of State       Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) expresses our       full support of H.R. 1346 which will repeal the recently       issued rule by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and       the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) entitled       ``Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and       Planning Area Reform'' (81 Fed. Reg. 93448) finalized on       December 20, 2016. Representing all 50 states, the District       of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, AASHTO serves as a liaison       between state departments of transportation (state DOTs) and       the federal government.        AASHTO and its members are supportive of voluntary       opportunities to strengthen regional transportation planning       by states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). As       expressed in our comments on the NPRM regarding this rule, we       do not see a basis for making substantial changes to the       planning process as required in the rule.        AASHTO has significant concerns with the specific mandates       that the rule imposes upon states and MPOs. The regulation       will add significant additional legal and administrative       requirements that would serve as barriers to constructive and       flexible approaches to planning and programming being       implemented by states and MPOs today. Imposing these new       requirements goes against the Congressional intent of the       Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act to       streamline project delivery. The rule also epitomizes the       one-size-fits-all approach that does not allow flexibility to       tailor processes and solutions to the diverse needs,       opportunities, and constraints faced by states and MPOs       across the nation.        We appreciate your tremendous leadership in repealing this       specific rule. If you would like to discuss these issues       further, please contact AASHTO's Program Director for       Planning and Performance Management.            Sincerely,      David Bernhardt, P.E.,        President, American Association of State Highway and       Transportation Officials; Commissioner, Maine Department of       Transportation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this important legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
