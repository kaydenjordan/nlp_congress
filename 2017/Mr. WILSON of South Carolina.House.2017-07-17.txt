 Mr. Speaker, last week the House of  Representatives overwhelmingly passed the National Defense  Authorization Act with a bipartisan vote of 344-81. This bill  represents a strong commitment to enacting accounting reforms and  rebuilding our military.   As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I  am grateful that this bill modernizes our forces and begins to close  the readiness gap facing our servicemembers, fulfilling President  Donald Trump's pledge to rebuild the American military.   This legislation also supports military families by providing the  largest pay raise in 8 years and by giving military families greater  flexibility when relocating during the school year.   The primary function of the national government is to provide for our  national defense, to ensure that our servicemembers have the training,  equipment, and resources they need to achieve the goal as established  by Senator Barry Goldwater, ``Why Not Victory.''    I appreciate the determined leadership of Chairman Mac Thornberry,  and I look forward to continuing to work with him to advance the  legislation through the conference process.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.  [[Page H5890]]                                ____________________
