 Mr. President, at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994,  Mother Teresa famously said:         I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is       abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct       killing of the innocent child.    She went on to say:         Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the       people to love but to use any violence to get what they want.       That is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is       abortion.    That was Mother Teresa at the National Prayer Breakfast here in DC in  1994. I agree with those words. Frankly, it is shameful that the  Democrats and pro-abortion activists have resorted to despicable  tactics--some even illegal, some violent--in a last-ditch effort to  intimidate the Justices in the Dobbs case to get the outcome that they  want.   What began with the unprecedented leak of the majority draft opinion  last Monday has quickly devolved into protesting at the Justices'  homes, threatening and disrupting church services, vandalizing  pregnancy resource centers that offer support services to pregnant  moms, and even throwing Molotov cocktails at the offices of a pro-life  organization. Frankly, it is chilling. It is unacceptable. We cannot  let the far left's outrageous behavior obscure the fact that the Dobbs  draft opinion authored by Justice Alito is a triumph of the  Constitution and the rule of law.   There is no right to abortion in the text, in history or structure of  our Nation's founding document, and the draft opinion masterfully  marshals 98 pages of argument and evidence to demonstrate that very  fact.   This watershed decision would be a tremendous victory for the fight  for life and turn the page on a dark chapter of our Nation's history in  which more than 62 million unborn children have been tragically killed.  If the draft opinion stands--and I pray that it does--it transfers that  power from unelected judges and gives it back to the American people,  back to legislatures and elected representatives to enact compassionate  laws that protect unborn babies and their mothers.    If the Democrats exploiting the unprecedented leak of the majority  draft opinion, if it is to stir up the far left base and intimidate  Justices, that is not bad enough, they are now trying to pass a radical  bill to impose abortion on demand without limits across the entire  country, even up to the moment of birth. Leader Schumer has once again  scheduled a vote for tomorrow on the ``Abortion on Demand Until Birth  Act.''   Now, my distinguished colleague from Connecticut used the words  ``radical'' and ``extreme'' a number of times in his remarks. Let me  tell you what is radical and extreme about what is going to be voted on  tomorrow. This is barbaric. It is a radical abortion bill that would  mandate that every single State be a late-term abortion State like  California or New York, where unborn children can be brutally aborted  up to the very moment of birth.   Let me say that again, the Democrats would allow abortion up until  the very moment of birth itself. The Democrats' radical abortion bill  would confer special benefits on the predatory abortion industry and  eliminate popular State laws that protect both pre-born children and  their mothers.   Commonsense laws requiring parental involvement in abortions for  minors, health and safety standards for abortion facilities, informed  consent laws, late-term abortion limits, bans on sex-selective or Down  syndrome selective abortions, and conscience protections for doctors  who don't want to perform abortions would be eliminated. That is how  radical this bill is that will be voted on tomorrow.   Under this radical abortion bill, an unhatched sea turtle would have  more protections than an unborn human baby. If you look at Federal law,  if you were to take or destroy the eggs of a sea turtle--now, I said  the eggs, not the hatchlings, that is also a penalty, but the eggs--the  criminal penalties are severe, up to a hundred thousand dollar fine and  a year in prison.   Now, why? Why do we have laws in place to protect the eggs of a sea  turtle or the eggs of eagles? Because when you destroy an egg, you are  killing a pre-born baby sea turtle or a pre-born baby eagle. Yet when  it comes to a pre-born human baby, rather than a sea turtle, that baby  would be stripped of all protections, in all 50 States, under the  Democrats' bill that we will be voting on tomorrow.   Is that the America the left wants? I would ask my Democratic  colleagues if the pre-born child in the womb is not a living human  being, then what is it? Unborn babies feel pain, unborn babies have a  heartbeat, they smile, they yawn, in fact, just last week in a telling  slip of the tongue, President Biden himself admitted that abortion  involves a child. A child. That is correct.   This is, in fact, the truth and the brutal reality of abortion that  every abortion kills a precious child, the Democrats have tried for  decades to avoid admitting this. And the science is clear, it has come  a long way since 1973. It is time for the law to catch up with great  advances that have been made in science and technology, in medicine,  that indisputably show the humanity of an unborn child.   Instead, however, the Democrats' radical abortion bill denies the  science. It would completely erase pre-born children from the law. That  is chilling. Under the Democrats' bill, a pre-born child simply for the  crime of being unwanted, inconvenient, or unplanned could be subjected  to brutal dismemberment procedures in which the unborn child bleeds and  feels excruciating pain as she dies from being pulled apart limb from  limb.   The Democrats' abortion bill would codify an extreme abortion regime  that is aligned with seven Nations that would have the most brutal--the  most brutal laws that relates to abortion, also includes China and  North Korea. That puts the United States in that category if this were  passed.   It would impose abortion up until the moment of birth, without any  limits, in all 50 States. In a nutshell, this radical bill would make  the United States of America one of the most dangerous places in the  world to be a pre-born child.   As I asked my colleagues in the hallway on the Democrats' side, give  us just one restriction you might put in place for abortion, you just  don't hear a response for that.   In tomorrow's vote, I pray that my colleagues will reject this  horrific and barbaric legislation and take a stand for the most  vulnerable among us. As the Justices continue to deliberate in the  Dobbs case, I pray the Court will resist the intimidation tactics of  the far left. By sticking to the Constitution, and repudiating the  unprincipled and abominable Roe and Casey decisions, the Court has the  opportunity to make history and strike a blow for justice for the most  defenseless among us. The American people, those born, and millions yet  unborn, deserve nothing less.   I yield the floor.
