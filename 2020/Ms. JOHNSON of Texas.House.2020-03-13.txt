 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the  Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which will provide the crucial  support for our workforce and economy amid the current public health  emergency associated with COVID-19. It is our duty to care for all  members of our society, and this stimulus package will do so. We will  ensure that hourly workers and families have access to emergency paid  sick leave, food security, and--most importantly--free testing for  corona virus regardless of insurance status.   For families' economic security, we have secured paid emergency  leave, with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid  family and medical leave. We have also secured enhanced Unemployment  Insurance, a step that will extend protections to furloughed workers.   For families' food security, we have strengthened nutrition security  initiatives, including SNAP, student meals, seniors' nutrition and food  banks. For the twenty-two million children who rely on free or reduced- price school meals for their food security, we must ensure that they  have food to eat.   For families' health security, we have increased federal funds for  Medicaid to support our local, state, tribal and territorial  governments and health systems, so that they have the resources  necessary to combat the coronavirus.   As representatives of Americans from all corners of our country, we  have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our  communities in times of crisis. I urge my colleagues to support the  Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
