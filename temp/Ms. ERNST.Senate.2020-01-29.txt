 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Burr, McSally, Daines, Moran, Young, and Sasse.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators' question is directed to counsel for  the President.         Is it true the Trump administration approved supplying       Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine? Is it also true this       decision came on the heels of a nearly three-year debate in       Washington over whether the United States should provide       lethal defense weapons to counter further Russian aggression       in Europe? By comparison, did President Obama refuse to send       weapons or other lethal military gear to Ukraine? Was this       decision against the advice of his Defense Secretary and       other key military leaders in his administration?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators. Thank you,  Senators, for the question.   Yes, the Trump administration made the decision to provide Javelin  anti-tank missiles, and there was a significant debate about that for  some time. Authorization had been granted by Congress, and many of you  voted for that statutory authorization during the Obama administration  to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine, but the Obama administration  decided not to provide that.   It was only the Trump administration that made that lethal assistance  available, and there was a significant amount of testimony in the House  proceedings that President Trump's policy toward Ukraine was actually  stronger.   Ambassador Volker explained that America's policy toward Ukraine has  been strengthened under President Trump and that each step, along the  way in decisions that got to the Javelin missiles being provided, was  made by President Trump. It is something that has substantially  strengthened our relationship with Ukraine and strengthened their  ability to resist Russian aggression.   Ambassador Yovanovitch said that President Trump's decision to  provide lethal weapons meant that our policy actually got stronger over  the last 3 years, and she called it ``very significant.''   Another point to make in relation to this is, again, that the pause-- the temporary pause that took place over the summer--is something that  the Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister described it as being so short  that they didn't even notice it. So President Trump's policies, across  the board, have been stronger than the prior administration's in  providing defensive capability--lethal defensive capability--to  Ukrainians, and I think that that is significant.   As to the specific part of the question, Senators, whether it was  contrary to the advice of the President's Defense Secretary and others,  I believe that that is accurate. It was against the advice of the  Secretary of Defense. It was President Trump's decision to provide the  lethal assistance, and that has been made public in the past. Thank  you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
