 Madam President, I arrived in the U.S. Congress in  January 1983--a new Congressman from downstate Illinois, the son of an  immigrant mother--and I was in awe.   Just listen to this list of House Committee chairmen back then:  chairman of the Rules Committee: Claude Pepper; Judiciary chairman:  Peter Rodino; Veterans Affairs chairman: Sonny Montgomery; Interior  Committee chairman: Mo Udall; Ways and Means Committee chairman: Danny  Rostenkowski.   Yet even among these legends, John Dingell, chairman of the House  Energy and Commerce Committee, stood out. He was a giant among giants,  and not just because he stood 6 foot 3. A 26-year veteran of the House  at the time, he was revered as the architect of Medicare and a driving  force behind some of the most important civil rights and environmental  laws in America's history. He went on to become the longest serving  member of Congress in American history. But it is the quality and  courage of John Dingell's service, even more than its length, that made  John Dingell one of the most influential legislators of all time. He  helped write most of the Nation's major environmental and energy laws.  He helped save the American auto industry twice: in 1979 and again  during the great recession.   His nickname--``Big John''--was a reflection not only of his  commanding height but also of his moral stature. Of the more than  25,000 votes he cast in Congress, the one he as most proud of was his  vote in support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That vote led to a brutal  reelection fight later that year. It was the second time John Dingell  ever had a cross burned on his lawn and the closest he ever come to  losing a race. But John Dingell was unbowed. He went on to champion the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 and--many more major civil rights laws.   John David Dingell, Jr, was born in 1926, the eldest of three  children. His family, he once said, was as ``poor as Job's chicken.''   In 1932, when John was 6 years old, his father was elected to  Congress, where he became a leading champion of the New Deal. He stood  behind FDR as he signed the law creating Social Security.   In 1943, John Senior introduced America's first national health  insurance bill--to help seniors and children from poor families. The  bill never passed.   In 1955, John Senior died in office from tuberculosis. That same  year, at the age of 29, his son was chosen in a special election to  finish his father's term.   At the start of every new Congress, John Dingell introduced a bill to  create a Medicare Program to provide health insurance for older adults.  He never gave up on fulfilling his father's dream. When Medicare  finally came up for a vote in 1965, he was given honor of presiding  over the House, in memory of his father. He lent the gavel he had used  that day to Speaker Nancy Pelosi when the House voted to pass the  Affordable Care Act in 2010. John Dingell sat by President Obama's side  when he signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. Millions and  millions of Americans can afford to see a doctor today and retire with  a bit of security and dignity because of John Dingell.   Chairman Dingell's father taught him that public service through  politics can be a noble calling. He treated everyone with dignity. He  cared about people who struggle, as his own family struggled when he  was young. The priest who officiated at his funeral mass in Dearborn  yesterday told a story about a woman who approached him recently and  told him, ``If not for John Dingell, I would not have been able to put  food on the table.''   Last week, on the day he died, John Dingell dictated some reflections  to his wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She was John's partner and  his rock for 40 years, and she now holds the seat that John and his  father once held. John's ``parting thoughts,'' as he called them, were  published in the Washington Post. They are profoundly moving and wise.  One in particular stands out for me. Chairman Dingell said that it  always grated on him to hear it said that a person ``has'' power. ``In  democratic government,'' he wrote, ``elected officials do not have  power. They hold power--in trust for the people who elected them.''   I'll close with one last story--one final more bit of wisdom--from my  friend John Dingell.   In 1944, when he turned 18, John enlisted in the U.S. Army. The  following year, he was supposed to be among the first wave of American  soldiers to invade mainland Japan. Only the surrender of Japan saved  him from what would have been near-certain death. All of his life, he  remained proud of his service and deeply committed to other veterans  and to their families.   When President George H. W. Bush died shortly after Thanksgiving,  Chairman Dingell wrote a posthumous tribute--the last World War II  veteran to serve in Congress, writing to honor the last World War II  veteran to occupy the Oval Office. It was published in the Detroit  News. This is what John Dingell wrote:         Both of us understood how fragile this American democracy       was and the atrocities that were occurring in the world. Both       of us signed up immediately when war was declared and knew       our moral responsibility to defend America and fight for the       freedom of mankind.    He went on to say:         We were from a political generation that understood       delivering for the American people was more important than       political wins. The success of government and good public       policy is the success of hard-working men and women.    He closed with a plea, almost a prayer:         May the stories of my good friend help us find our way back       to a society that promotes dialogues, not demagogues, and       that it helps us to remember we, the people, have the ability       to restore this great nation to common ground rather than       letting it continue its downward spiral into constant chaos.    In closing, Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to John's  wife, the love of his life, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell moreover, to  John's three surviving children: Chip, Christopher, and Jennifer; and  their families, including John's three grandchildren; to his brother  and sister; his countless friends and the countless more who thought of  him as a friend and mourn his passing.                            ____________________
