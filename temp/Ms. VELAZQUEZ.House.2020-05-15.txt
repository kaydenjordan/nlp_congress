 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the HEROES  Act, and I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairwoman from  the Appropriations Committee for yielding.   This bill contains important provisions to help stop the economy's  free fall. For small businesses, it authorizes an additional $10  billion in disaster grants.   It improves the PPP initiative, allowing businesses under stay-at- home orders to extend the loan coverage period until the end of the  calendar year. Also, we are eliminating the 75-25 rule, to make it  easier for small businesses to apply for PPP loans. It also sets aside  25 percent, or $30 billion, of the remaining funds for firms with fewer  than 10 employees.   Equally important, this legislation assists struggling families. In  this bill, we increase funding for SNAP by 15 percent to address the  record increase in hunger that we are seeing in this country. The bill  extends unemployment benefits, including $600 per week in pandemic  unemployment insurance. For New Yorkers and hardworking people in this  country struggling with rent, this measure provides $100 billion in  rental assistance.   Many essential workers will receive hazard pay under this bill and  better access to personal protective equipment, like nurses, door  persons, transit workers, and those cleaning buildings so that the rest  of us stay safe. Those are the real heroes of this crisis, and the  HEROES Act compensates them more appropriately.   The HEROES Act will also help States and localities with enormous  fiscal challenges.   Finally, this bill puts forth a strategic plan to test, trace, and  treat the virus. Until we have widespread testing, consumer confidence  will remain weak.   I urge everyone to support this bill.
