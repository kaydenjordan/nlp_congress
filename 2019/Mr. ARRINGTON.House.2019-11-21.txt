 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a dear  friend and local leader in my district, former Bailey County  Commissioner Floyd ``Butch'' Vandiver, who is currently battling cancer  back home in Muleshoe, Texas.   Butch is the epitome of a servant leader, and he personifies the  spirit of west Texas through his honesty, humility, and hard work.   Having operated the family farm for more than 35 years, Butch  understands the trials of tilling the soil, the blessings of a  bountiful harvest, and the faith and freedom it requires.   During his two decades as a Bailey County commissioner, Butch served  with excellence, always putting the interests of the people he served  over himself.   I first met Butch on a flight back to Lubbock. He was returning home  from treatment at MD Anderson. Clearly fatigued from his fight against  cancer, he never once complained. Instead, he encouraged me.   Butch, you inspire me with your authenticity, your humility, and your  unwavering faith. I want you to know we love you, we are praying for  you and your family, and we know you are in God's loving and capable  hands.   God bless, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
