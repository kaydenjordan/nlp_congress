 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Ruth  Samuelson, a long-time leader in the North Carolina House of  Representatives and a former member of the Mecklenburg County  Commission. Ruth is now in Heaven following a courageous battle with  ovarian cancer.   Ruth infused her faith in God in all aspects of her family,  political, personal, and civic life. Because of her vibrant faith and  commitment to focusing on what truly matters, Ruth was known as a  thoughtful mediator throughout her tenure in the North Carolina House,  someone who approached tense, partisan issues with grace, yet never  backed away from her convictions.   In 2013, Ruth was in line for a top leadership role, but instead, she  walked away, choosing instead to focus on her passions for family,  faith, and philanthropy. Ruth's last public statement was: ``I want  people to know that God is my good friend.''   May the Lord bring comfort to her husband, Ken; to her children,  Bobby, David, Joy, and Alex; her four grandchildren; and the countless  lives that she touched.                            ____________________
