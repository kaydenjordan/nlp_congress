 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. I  support his amendment, and I support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, if you look at this piece of legislation, both the bill  and the underlying amendment, if you go back to when this $6 billion  swap for $6 billion in cash was initially negotiated earlier this year,  many could argue, me included, that it was an ill-advised negotiation  back then, and this was prior to the invasion of Israel by Hamas.   I think it is important to understand the context. Everybody in the  world knows that Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of  terrorism, including funding Hamas.   The idea that you can just take Hamas and keep it separate from Iran  has always been a farce. Iran funds Hamas, and everybody knows it.   The idea that you would be negotiating in August or September to help  Iran get $6 billion boggles the mind prior to the invasion and attacks  on Israel. After the attacks, the administration should be joining us  in supporting this bill.                                time  1415    The administration should be standing there saying: We are not giving  them the money anymore.   Who is the money going to? The President of Iran has already told you  what he is going to do with the $6 billion.   You have the Biden administration saying, don't worry, it is all  about humanitarian aid. The problem is that the people that are getting  the $6 billion aren't saying that.   Mr. Chairman, the President of Iran himself went on TV, 60 Minutes,  and said: This money belongs to the Islamic Republic of Iran. And  naturally, we will decide, the Islamic Republic of Iran will decide, to  spend it wherever we need it.   They can give it to Hamas tomorrow if they got this money, and the  President of Iran said so.   I don't care what John Kerry says when he flies around over there, or  what Joe Biden might even say. Once the President of Iran gets the $6  billion, it is his money, and he said he is going to do whatever he  wants with it.   Why would we give it to him today? We shouldn't have even thought  about giving it to him prior to the attacks by Hamas in October. We  surely shouldn't be thinking about it today.   Thank goodness in this House we are going to take a vote, and we are  going to pass this bill. Hopefully, it is an overwhelming bipartisan  vote to send it to the Senate and help wake up our Senate friends to  say that this is a position that we should be vocal on, as they still  haven't figured out what to do with funding for Iran.   We passed a bipartisan bill to help Israel get the funding that they  need to push back on the attacks, to go get more hostages, as we are  seeing.   We are hearing senators talking about a permanent cease-fire, or more  conditions. We ought to be all coming together to support Israel on  whatever tools they need.   This House has been vocal in a pretty bipartisan way almost every  step of the way to do that. Today can be another one of those moments  where we don't just stand up to Hamas, but we stand up to the group who  funds Hamas, as well.   Everybody knows who funds Hamas. It is Iran; $6 billion going to the  President, who said he is going to take the money for whatever purposes  he wants.   They shouldn't get the money. Let's keep it.   Let's continue to support our great ally in that region at the time  they need it the most. We will be there with Israel every step of the  way, with all the tools they need to be successful at destroying this  terrorist organization, Hamas, and anybody else who wants to join with  them in helping embolden terrorism against the Jews, against the anti- Semitism we see growing not just in the Middle East, but here in this  country as well.   We all ought to be vocal with one united voice against it. It is  wrong. Let's stand with Israel. Let's stand with our friends, and let's  stand against anybody who wants to support terrorism around the world.  [[Page H6012]]    Let's pass this amendment, let's pass the bill, and let's get the  Senate to put this bill on the President's desk.
