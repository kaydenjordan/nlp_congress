 Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to the  distinguished and exceptional career of my friend, Command Sergeant  Major John F. Sampa, the retiring Command Sergeant Major of the Army  National Guard.   It is one of my greatest honors and privilege to have served with  then-Sergeant John Sampa when I was a lieutenant with Bravo Company 4th  Battalion 112th Armor, in Rosenberg, Texas. He mentored and advised  countless soldiers and airmen throughout his career.   His rise to the highest enlisted rank in the National Guard was not  by chance. Command Sergeant Major  [[Page H46]]  Sampa is an extremely talented and competent noncommissioned officer  who led by example, outworked his peers, and always took care of his  troops.   Along with the citizens from the great State of Texas, and the Army  National Guard soldiers throughout the country, I wish Command Sergeant  Major John Sampa a well-deserved retirement. He has served his  neighbors, State, and country well.   I wish John, his wife Carlette; son, John; and daughter, Julia, all  the best in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
