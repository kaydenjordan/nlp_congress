 Madam Speaker, House Republicans are playing political  games and threatening to default on our country's debt.   The extreme MAGA Republicans have taken over the House of  Representatives, and they are creating a crisis. It is a crisis that  they created, they manufactured in their minds, and now they are trying  to convince the American people what they are doing is right.   It is not right for them to make cruel cuts to hurt children,  seniors, veterans, and teachers, threatening a devastating default on  our debt.   Ladies and gentlemen, Madam Speaker, the Republicans gave billions of  dollars in tax cuts to the biggest corporations and the wealthiest  people in America. That was step one.   Now, step two, they are coming after you, the hardworking American  people, saying now we are going to take away from you after you have  actually done so much for your country.   They are stepping into this situation. They want to take food away  from children and seniors. They want to see us lay off 100,000 teachers  and take away childcare from children.    They are doing this only to try to score political points.   Let's get back to work, Republicans. Let's do the right thing.                            ____________________
