 Mr. President, I usually don't give such lengthy  speeches, but today I will be on the floor for a little while, and I  have 12 sections to my speech. The first section is on voting rights,  of course.   The first section is history, equality, democracy, and the Founders'  vision. And I begin with a quote.         To understand political power right, and derive it from its       original, we must consider, what state all men [and women]       are naturally in and that is a state of perfect freedom to       order their actions and dispose of their possessions and       persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of       nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of       any other [person].    John Locke published those words in England anonymously-- anonymously--exactly 100 years before the Constitution of the United  States came into effect a very, very long time ago, at least to the  human mind.   They were published not in the era of Republics but of kingdoms; not  of Presidents but of Monarchs; not of citizens but rather subjects. It  was an era when many argued and took up arms for the idea that the King  derived power from the decrees of Heaven, and here John Locke said, no,  political power, in fact, comes from free individuals.   These words were circulated for years in secret--in secret--because  to hold these views back then was treason. Locke went further:         The natural state is also one of equality in which all       power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, and no one has more       than another. It is evident that all human beings . . . are       equal amongst themselves.    These words, these ideas, a third of a millennia old, but it is right  there staring us in the face. All men and women are naturally free, and  all men and women are naturally equal.   I will admit this may be lofty stuff, but history lessons matter-- because these ideas were the initial blueprints for a different sort of  political order that would take shape here in this continent,  articulated a century later in the words of the American Declaration of  Independence.   These were the original ideas for what would inspire the Framers to  create--not a kingdom but a Republic, a democratic society, a place  where people equal in rank decide their own leaders and create free  elections.   It reminds me of the words of James Madison as well:         Who are to be the electors of the federal representatives?       Not the rich, more than the poor; not the learned, more than       the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names. .       . . The electors are to be the great body of the people of       the United States.    Section 2: American History is a Long March Toward Universal  Suffrage. That is the noble side of our early history, worthy of  remembering and pursuing to this day. There is, of course, a more  complicated, more frustrating reality, one we should not be afraid to  admit and to recognize. And one we hide from or, worse, try to erase at  our own peril.   We all know that when our country was founded, mass participation in  representative government might have been the object of the Founders,  but it certainly was not a practice. Immediately excluded were 700,000  enslaved men and women, counted as three-fifths of a person for the  purpose of congressional allotment, but zero-fifths of a person for all  other matters of human dignity. Women, too, were left out.   Also cast aside and brutalized were those who lived on this continent  for thousands of years before the colonial era, for whom full  participation in political life, in practicality, has never, never been  made real, even till today. And through it all--through it all--voting  requirements were left to the States to choose for themselves so that  depending on which side of a State boundary you lived on, a different  side or set of rules might apply to you in determining your worthiness  to choose your own leaders.   So despite Madison's sentiments, at the time of our Constitution's  ratification, you had to be a White male, oftentimes Protestant,  landowner to vote.   By the election of 1800, barely more than 1 in 10 Americans were even  eligible to vote. Of the 16 States then in the Union all but 3 limited  suffrage to property holders or taxpayers.   And here is another truth too: Despite all that, the story of  democracy  [[Page S90]]  in America has been a long march, a very long, torturous march toward  universal suffrage.   In America, our holy struggle has been to take these words of our  Framers, to take the idea that everyone should live freely and equally  and to make it real in whatever way the people can make it real.   It is an exercise in making better what was once woefully imperfect,  of having hope that we can make even more progress in the future.  Indeed, this is written into the very, very first statement of  our Constitution, making a more perfect Union.    So, from the get-go, generations of Americans have sought to truly  establish the United States as a full democracy. We fought a bloody  Civil War to end slavery. Women organized and reached for the ballot.   The civil rights movement brought an end to the vicious segregation  of the mid-20th century. And here in Congress, yes, in this Congress,  we passed the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act,  and the 14th, 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th Amendments to expand the  franchise until there were no more boundaries.   Now, we all know, unfortunately, the march has not always been  linear. Throughout our Nation's history, moments of significant  progress have been followed by reactionary backlash. That backlash  takes many forms: White supremacy, tyranny, demagoguery, fear, and  political violence, and much, much more.   Today, it lives on in the internet, in the dark corners of online  places that deal not in truth but in conspiracies that I would call  wacky or bizarre, if they weren't so darn dangerous. It also lives,  sadly, in the cascade of deranged propaganda we see emanating from  certain cable news networks.   Unfortunately, it seems, led by one party, compelled by the most  dishonest President in history, we are entering another one of those  dark periods.   That is what we are talking about here today on the Senate floor.   Section 3: The Origins of the Big Lie. If there is anything else,  besides free and fair elections, that has been central to our national  political character, it has been our largely unbroken fidelity to the  peaceful transfer of power--peaceful transfer of power.   You can't talk about voting rights and free and fair elections and  democracy without also presupposing that the leaders are willing to  step down when their turns are over, when they have lost elections.  Thankfully, our leaders have, by and large, honored this tradition,  whether that has been in victory or in defeat. Nobody likes losing, but  sometimes you have to move on. That is life.   But then came Donald Trump. Like many before him, Trump ran for  reelection in 2020 and lost his race. In fact, he lost to Joe Biden by  7 million votes and 74 electoral college votes. I shouldn't have to say  that, but it is the truth, and sometimes the truth gets distorted  around here.   But rather than accept defeat, rather than follow in the noble  tradition of those who came before him, Donald Trump rejected the  results of the 2020 election and claimed, without a shred of evidence,  without any evidence, that the election was rigged, that it was stolen,  that it was a con job unlike anything we have ever seen before.   He planted the seeds of that lie long before the election even  happened. Yes, the Big Lie was born then.   Section 4: The Big Lie is Just That, a Lie. It is a lie. It is not a  misinterpretation. It is not one person looks at it one way; one person  looks at it the other, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  want us to believe. It is just a lie.   To this day, there is not a shred of evidence supporting the fantasy  that Donald Trump won the election only to have it stolen from him.   As a general principle, extraordinary claims should come with  extraordinary proof. We haven't seen anything close to proof in the 14  or so months since the 2020 election. On the other side of the aisle,  the biggest--biggest--loudest talkers about the election being stolen  have not presented any facts. It is appalling.   So let's examine the record. First, Donald Trump has had plenty of  chances to prove his allegations in the court of law. In virtually  every instance, he has failed. Let me read an excerpt from USA TODAY,  published last year on the day of the insurrection:         The President and his allies have filed 62 lawsuits in       state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results       in states that the President lost.    A little further it reads:         Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential       election, 61 have failed.    Sixty-one.   Sixty-two lawsuits in a little under 2 months, and if that is not  good enough for some people, let me read further from the article.         Some cases were dismissed--    Says the article--      for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the       voter fraud allegations. The decisions have come from both       Democratic- . . . and Republican-appointed judges--including       federal judges appointed by [President] Trump.    So Trump and his allies went to court to try and make the case for  voter fraud and virtually lost at every turn.   Now let us move from the courts to what actually happened in the  States during the 2020 election.   Across the board, state officials in States, both red and blue--and,  in fact, States that ultimately made the difference in the election-- all said the same thing: There was no--no--voter fraud.   Here is what the Republican Secretary of State in Nevada said in  April of last year, the State GOP concerns did ``not amount to  evidentiary support for the contention that the 2020 general election  was plagued by widespread voter fraud.''   No voter fraud in Nevada.   In Arizona, Secretary of State Hobbs said last year:         There is absolutely no merit to any claims of widespread       voter fraud.    Just this week--just this week--the election department at Maricopa  County, the largest county in Arizona, headed by a Republican, released  a 90-page document delivering a point-by-point refusal of claims of  voter fraud. Their conclusion? The November 2020 election in Arizona  was administered with integrity, and the results were accurate and  reliable. This has been proven throughout statutorily required accuracy  tests, court tests, hand counts performed by political parties, and  post-election audits. No fraud in Arizona.   Let's turn to Georgia. The secretary of state in Georgia published an  op-ed in the Washington Post last year to defend his State's results.   He wrote:         Georgia's voting system has never been more secure or       trustworthy.    They had multiple recounts in Georgia, importuned by Trump  supporters. They had a hand recount. The result was the same every  time: No voter fraud in Georgia.   In Pennsylvania, one Pennsylvania Republican legislator said the  following about his own party's efforts to conduct a so-called forensic  audit:         The current attempt to discredit the 2020 election runs       headlong into an unmistakable truth: Donald Trump lost       Pennsylvania because Donald Trump received fewer votes.    No fraud in Pennsylvania either.   In Wisconsin, the same story. Newsweek: ``GOP-Aligned Group Finds No  Evidence of Wisconsin Voter Fraud After 10-Month Investigation.''   It reads:         A close review, including a hand count of roughly 20,000       ballots from 20 wards, uncovered no evidence of fraudulent       ballots or widespread voter fraud.    The report reads:         Our hand review found that the counts closely matched those       reported by the Wisconsin Elections Commission.    The review found no evidence of fraudulent ballots.   Then we have Michigan. By now, I expect you know how this is going to  end. Last summer, the GOP--the Republican-controlled State senate  released a much anticipated report examining allegations of fraud  within their own State. According to the Detroit News, the report's  main author, Senator Ed McBroom, a Republican, said ``he found `no  evidence of widespread or systematic fraud,' contradicting months of  assertions from some members of his own party, including former  President Donald Trump.''   So let's just take a moment to review. No voter fraud in Nevada. None  in Arizona, nor in Georgia or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. No voter fraud  in Michigan.  [[Page S91]]    So it is clear that the reason Donald Trump is not in office today is  because he didn't receive enough votes to win the election. It is that  simple. It is indisputable. The court said so, the States say so, and  the facts say so. Indeed, even Donald Trump's own administration said  so.   A month after the election, it was none other than former Attorney  General Bill Barr himself who made clear that the President was lying  to the American people.   In an interview with the AP, the Associated Press, about a month  after the election--here is a quote. Barr told the AP that ``U.S.  attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific  complaints and misinformation they have received, but, to date, we have  not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome  in the election.'' Bill Barr, Donald Trump's acolyte, said that.   Months later, Barr said:         My suspicion all the way was that there was nothing there.       It was all [BS].    I will note that Mr. Barr used a different word at the end of that  quote, which I am not repeating here.   But this is the Attorney General, the President's acolyte, who sided  with him through impeachment and issue after issue. Even he says there  is no fraud.   How can so many people still cling to this? Elected officials,  responsible elected officials--they are doing damage, true damage, to  our Republic--true damage.   I rarely agree with the Attorney General. On this, he is on the mark.  The Big Lie is BS--BS.   So let me state once again, although it should hardly need repeating,  that the 2020 election was not in dispute. Donald Trump did not have an  election stolen from him. Nothing about 2020 was rigged, as he says.  But today--today--a frightful amount of Americans still believe what  Mr. Trump is saying is true, tens of millions of Americans--a minority,  yes, but a sizeable one that cannot be ignored. That is the Big Lie in  a nutshell. To them, it doesn't matter that there is no substance to  these arguments. To them, it doesn't matter that the President's own  allies have debunked it. They want to believe it anyway, and believe  it, they do.    Donald Trump, about the most pernicious President we have ever had-- not about; the most pernicious President--no President has done this.  Well, he understands that. He understood from the moment the polls  closed on election night that all he had to do was repeat the lie again  and again and again, and it would take a life of its own.   Now, sadly and greatly troubling the whole country, the Big Lie is  poisoning our democracy--poisoning it. Conspiracy theories are  spreading online. Cable news anchors are spewing falsehoods and  generating a sense of rage among their viewers.   When the courts refused to back the former President, when the States  refused to back him, and when some of his own administration refused to  back him, he was left with one last-ditch effort to hold on to power:  to get the Vice President to reject the results of January 6.   By now, we all know about the dreaded tweet he posted in December of  2020: ``Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!''   What a sad documentation this all is in 21st-century America.   Section 5: The Attack on the Capitol. A Short Review.   It was Donald Trump's Big Lie that soaked our political landscape in  kerosene. It was Donald Trump's rally on the Mall on January 6 that  struck the match. And then came the fire, and all of us were here 1  year ago yesterday to watch the fire burn.   Yesterday, many of us spent much of the day recounting what it was  like to be here in the Capitol on January 6. I want to commend my  colleagues for doing so. But it is shameful my Republican colleagues  had to come to the floor to speak as well. January 6 was every bit an  attack on them as it was on anyone else. It is shameful that my  Republican colleagues did not come to the floor to speak as well. They  did not come to the floor. This room was empty on this side of the  aisle. January 6 was every bit an attack on them as it was on anyone  else. All of us suffer when democracy is assaulted. This is not a party  matter.   So I want to thank my colleagues who did come to the floor yesterday  and everyone across the Capitol who shared their stories yesterday.  Many of these stories are painful to visit, but they radiate with the  light of truth, and I applaud them all.   Of course, we also pay tribute to all those who put themselves in  harm's way to protect us and protect this building: our Capitol Police,  our DC Metro Police, our National Guard. They were outnumbered,  unprepared, largely left on their own, but they held the line.   When rioters cleared out of the building, another wave of heroes came  in: the men and women who work as the maintenance staff, as  technicians. They came in into the night, without complaint, and  brought the Capitol back to life so that we were able to continue to  count the votes and not let this insurrectionist mob stop American  democracy from proceeding forward.   Those who came in represent the best of us--the best of us.   Section 6: The Disease of the Big Lie Lives On.   The attack on the U.S. Capitol may have been limited to a single day;  the attack on our democracy, unfortunately, has not ceased.   Since last year, there have been no outright attempts to storm this  building to undo the will of the people, thank God, but the disease of  the Big Lie continues to spread. Donald Trump has not changed his tune.  He keeps insisting that our democracy is rigged and that our elections  have been riddled with voter fraud. He did it as recently as yesterday.  In fact, he was going to have an entire press conference on it before  calling it off. It was reported that his own Republican colleagues  didn't want to hear him spew his lies on this day that has become so  sacred to so many. What Donald Trump does is poison. The consequences  of the former President's words continue to erode our democracy day by  day.   If the enemies of democracy fail to get their way with baseball bats  and pipe bombs, they have now turned their focus to a much quieter,  much more organized effort to subvert our democratic process from the  bottom up--in other words, a slow-motion insurrection but equally as  insidious and ultimately more damaging.   Slow-motion insurrection. ``Democracy experts alarmed over GOP  takeover of election machinery.'' That is the AP.   I want to read the following from the AP:         In the weeks leading up to the deadly insurrection at the       U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, a handful of Americans--well-known       politicians, obscure local bureaucrats--stood up to block       then-President . . . Trump's unprecedented attempt to       overturn a free and fair vote of the American people.      [But] in this year since, Trump-aligned Republicans have       worked to clear the path for the next time.    The article continues:         In battleground states--    That is the headline here--       In battleground states and beyond, Republicans are taking       hold of the once-overlooked machinery of elections. While the       effort is incomplete and uneven, outside experts on democracy       and Democrats are sounding alarms, warning that the United       States is witnessing a ``slow-motion insurrection''--    Slow-motion insurrection--       with a better chance of success than Trump's failed power       grab last year.        They point to a mounting list of evidence: Several       candidates who deny Trump's loss are running for offices that       could have a key role in the election of the next president       in 2024.    The efforts are poised to fuel disinformation and anger about the  2020 results for years to come.   This is the heart of the matter of why we are here today. The  insurrection that occurred a year ago yesterday is still going on. It  may be slow-motion but, in all likelihood, if we do nothing about it,  far more damaging to this Republic than even the insurrectionists were  on the sixth.   Section 7: Voter Suppression in the States.   It merits repeating again. Twenty-twenty was the safest election we  have had in a long time. A record number of Americans cast a ballot  that year--over 159 million people. As I have said already, there have  been no indications that the result was anything less than free, fair,  and accurate.  [[Page S92]]    But despite the fact that the 2020 election was free, fair, and  accurate, in the year following the 2020 election, at least 19  Republican-led legislatures suddenly decided to rewrite the rules that  govern the way people vote in their respective States. At least 33 new  laws have been passed across the country that will, as I will explain  in a moment, have the effect of making it harder to vote, harder to  register to vote, and, worst of all, potentially empower partisans to  arbitrate outcomes of future elections instead of nonpartisan election  workers. Hundreds--hundreds--more such laws were proposed, and they may  very well get enacted in the near future, particularly if we don't act.   Now, the Republican leader has pointed repeatedly to the 2020  election as proof that there was no effort to suppress the vote. This  is nothing but a sleight of hand from the Republican leader. He ignores  that the problem today is not about what happened during the 2020  election, it is what happened after.    So, I say to Leader McConnell, when you say there was no problem in  2020, then why do we need to change it? And why do you ignore all the  changes that are occurring after 2020? It is sophistry.   Let me say it one more time. It is amazing. The Republican leader has  argued that the 2020 election is proof there is no effort to suppress  the vote in America, but it is not what happened during 2020 that we  are arguing, although Donald Trump called 2020 ``the Big Lie.'' Mr.  McConnell is contradicting him, although he never does it directly, for  many different nonadmirable reasons.   So any objective observer will admit that different rules have made  it harder for people to vote, but the danger is not then, it is what  the States have done after the 2020 election, even though some States  tried to do it before.   We need to be clear. The timing, the sheer volume, and the nature of  these new election laws is not an innocent coincidence. It didn't just  happen, springing up in each State on its own. No. Over the course of  the year, we have kept hearing the same justification for many of these  laws. State Republicans said we need to preserve ``election integrity''  over and over again. They said we need to safeguard against voter  fraud.   But take a look at the actual policies that are now law, and tell me  if you think they have anything to do with election integrity: Reducing  polling hours and polling places within a State? That is now the law in  Iowa, Montana, and Texas. What does that have to do with election  integrity? Limiting the number, location, or availability of absentee  ballot drop boxes--now the law in Georgia, Indiana, and Florida--what  does that have to do with election integrity?   Making it harder to register to vote, that is now the law in Texas,  Florida, Kansas, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Montana; shortening the  window to apply for a mail-in ballots, now the law in Alabama,  Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, and Kentucky; and the use of risky or  potentially faulty voter purges, now the law in Arizona, Iowa,  Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas, Utah, and New Hampshire; increasing  barriers for voters with disabilities, that is now the law in Alabama,  Iowa, and Texas--which passed not one but two laws which will have that  effect.   Telling disabled people it is going to be harder for you to vote,  what does that have to do with election integrity?   Here is an especially egregious one: limiting early voting days or  hours--Georgia, Iowa, Texas. And, of course, as many have condemned for  months, criminalizing giving food and water to voters waiting in line  to vote. That is now the law in Georgia and Florida.   When Republicans say it is a crime to give voters some food or water  in line, do they think they are preventing fraud by denying people a  snack?   Kafkaesque--Kafka was writing about the demise of democracy.   Now, in addition to these new laws that are actually on the books, we  also need to remember all the proposals they have tried to pass but  have not been able to do to date. They tell us all we need to know  about the true intentions of these reforms, these so-called proposed  laws.   The most reprehensible were, of course, the attempts in States like  Georgia and Texas to eliminate early voting on Sunday--a day, of  course, when many churchgoing African Americans participate in ``souls  to the polls.'' Did they show that Sunday voting is more fraudulent  than other voting? No. We know what they are up to.   What an astonishing coincidence, outlawing voting on a day when  African-American churches sponsor a get-out-the-vote effort. Have they  shown that using drop-off ballot boxes creates more fraud than other?  No. These are aimed at suppressing certain types of people from voting,  not everybody.   Policies like these have nothing to do with election integrity. When  you say you can't vote on Sunday, it is the same intention of those old  restrictions that used to require African Americans to guess the number  of jellybeans in a jar before they were allowed to cast a ballot. What  regression.   Now, of course, our Republican friends--many of them--reject these  ideas. It is not a surprise. But every so often, they speak with  astonishing and stunning honesty. As one State rep in Arizona said when  defending his State's efforts to defend Republican voting: Everyone  shouldn't be voting.   That is what he said. I wonder who ``everyone'' was? Indeed, he  actually said, ``We don't mind putting security measures in that won't  let everybody vote--but everybody shouldn't be voting.''   And every now and then, the very plain and simple truth makes its way  to the surface.    When you lose an election, you are not supposed to stop people from  voting, even if they didn't vote for you. That is democracy, my  Republican friends. That is democracy. If you lose an election, you are  supposed to try harder to win over the voters you lost. Instead,  Republicans across the country are trying to stop the other side from  voting. That tears apart--rips apart--the very fabric of our democracy.   So let's be abundantly clear. These anti-voter laws are on the books  today only--only--because their authors cited the Big Lie and are  trying to succeed where the insurrection failed. A slow-motion  insurrection, that is all it is, equally, if not more damaging to our  Republic.   Section 9: Election subversion. Disenfranchising millions of  Americans is bad enough, but there is actually another more sinister  component to these laws, because Republicans aren't just trying to  suppress the vote, they are trying to subvert the vote. They are trying  to subvert the very machinery of the Democratic process itself.   It is not enough that they make it harder for people to vote; they  are making it more likely that those who do vote could see--God  forbid--their ballots called into question, subject to unwarranted and  dangerous scrutiny, and maybe get thrown out entirely.   In States like Arizona, Kansas, Arkansas, Georgia, Republican  legislatures are trying to give more power to themselves and other  partisan bodies to undermine, override, or neuter bipartisan election  boards and county election officials. In a number of States, they have  already succeeded.   Last August, a report from ABC News noted that at least 10 new State  laws have shifted power over elections from nonpartisan election  officials to partisan entities--from nonpartisan people to partisan  entities. Why? It is obvious to figure that out.   Here is what ABC News said:         Among the dozens of election reform laws changing rules       regarding how voters cast ballots, several have also       diminished secretaries of states' authority over elections or       shifted aspects of election administration to highly partisan       bodies, such as state legislators themselves or unevenly       bipartisan election boards.    A separate report from Protect Democracy, a nonprofit founded by  former White House and DOJ officials, warned last summer that:         Many state legislatures are pursuing a strategy to       politicize, criminalize, and interfere in election       administration. Their course of action threatens the       foundations of fair, professional, and non-partisan       elections.    Let's go through some of the examples. In Arizona, ABC News reported  last August that under a new law passed by the Republican legislature:         The Arizona Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, can       no longer represent the state in lawsuits defending its       election code. The power now lies exclusively with the       Republican attorney general--but only through January 2,       2023, when [coincidentally] Hobbs' term ends.   [[Page S93]]     That is now the law in Arizona.   In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has now been  effectively fired from the State election board, months after refusing  to go along with President Trump's request to ``find enough votes'' to  secure him a win.   Appalling, my friends. Donald Trump calls up and asks the secretary  of state of his own party to find enough votes. He gets fired, and they  are all defending it or shrugging their shoulders or putting their  heads in the sand. I have never seen anything quite like this.   By the way, for those who don't know, the State election board in  Georgia is responsible for, among other things--investigating voter  irregularities. Amazing, just amazing.   There are other examples across the country. Let's turn to Texas.    According to the Voting Rights Lab, a particularly sinister new  policy is now the law in that State:         The recently-enacted election omnibus bill, S.B. 1,       prohibits local officials from modifying election procedures       to better serve voters. It also increases the likelihood of       partisan poll watchers disrupting polling places and ballot       verification and counting locations. The bill increased the       ability of poll watchers to move freely throughout an       election location, including areas containing voters waiting       in line, checking in, or casting their ballots.    Again, it is helpful to look at those pernicious proposals that were  introduced at the State level but to date have not been enacted into  law.   One bill in Arizona would have given flat out to the State  legislature the authority to cancel the certification of electors by a  simple majority vote.   So looking through the record, the conclusion is not in doubt.  Republicans across the board justify these new laws by saying they want  to make it easier to vote but harder to cheat, but when you are looking  at what they are actually doing, it is perfectly clear that they are  doing the opposite--the exact opposite--making it harder to vote and  easier to steal an election.   And this, my friends, is just the tip of the iceberg. These State  legislatures will soon return to session this year and keep going, all  importuned by Donald Trump's Big Lie.   And what is missing is the profile in courage--enough profiles in  courage--enough people, whether it is in this Senate Chamber, in the  House Chamber, in the legislatures on the Republican side, saying: I  want to be a Republican. I want Republicans to win, but I am not going  to stoop to this level of beginning to dismember our democracy.   Let's make a final crucial point about what we are seeing playing out  in the States. Everything I just described at the State level is being  done on a partisan basis. This is a Republican con job, with zero  efforts being made to get any input from Democrats.   Should State Republican legislatures keep going? Should we in this  Chamber fail to do something about it or respond with insufficient  force, our democracy could very well cross a fatal point of no return.   And then the unthinkable becomes real. Democracy erodes and could-- horror of horrors--vanish, as it has in other nations in the course of  world history. What history shows us is, when these pernicious  activities start, when a mob starts, when a leader just lies to gain  power, if people don't rise up, it happens.   America, don't be complacent. It is happening, and it is a great  danger. In many other countries that devolved to dictatorship, it  started in ways similar to this, and the majority of good people said,  ``Uh, we don't have to worry about it.''   Well, we do. That is why we are here. That is why Senator Merkley and  I and Klobuchar and Durbin and others have taken to the floor today.   Section 10: The Senate will vote again on voting rights.   So what is the way forward? Do we accept these developments as  inevitable? Do we say it is not so bad? Do we look the other way? Do we  tell ourselves this dark cloud will pass and the disease of the Big Lie  is just going to cure itself?   We can't. The risk is too great.   What we must do is remember the words of our great friend, John  Lewis, who shortly before his death said:         When you see something that is not right, you must say       something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state.       It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help       build what we called the Beloved Community. . . .    Well, right now, the Senate is being called to take action. So as  soon as next week, we intend to bring up legislation back to the floor  of this Chamber, to protect our democracy and shore up the right to  vote. Everyone in this Chamber will once again have the opportunity to  go on record.   Will Republicans join Democrats in a bipartisan manner moving forward  on defending democracy? As soon as next week, they will be called on to  give us an answer, and they know the eyes of history are watching.  Maybe the few ideologues don't, but most of them do--most of them do.   And next week, our Republican friends will be called to give us an  answer. If there is any fight that this body should know how to win, it  is protecting our democracy and strengthening our right to vote.   Throughout this Chamber's history, in the aftermath of the Civil War,  during the 1960s, throughout the second half of the 20th century,  passing voting rights legislation has been one of the Senate's crowning  achievements. And now, in this moment of peril for democracy, the  Senate now needs to work to pass the Freedom to Vote Act. We need to  work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   We must get both done so we can send these bills to President Biden's  desk and they be signed into law--preventing, undoing, the pernicious  activities that I have documented in the past hour.   For months--for months--we have tried to get our Republican  colleagues to join us. After all, voting rights should not be partisan.  It hasn't been in the past. It has been supported by Ronald Reagan,  George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush--hardly big liberals, hardly  Democratic sympathizers--oh, no.   We have tried to continue in that bipartisan spirit. We have tried no  less than four times to begin a simple debate here on the floor about  this matter. We have lobbied our Republican friends privately. We have  gone through regular order. We have attempted to debate them on the  floor. We have presented reasonable, commonsense proposals in June,  August, October, and November. Each time--each time--I personally  promised my Republican colleagues and my Democratic colleagues,  particularly the two who have some doubts, that they would have ample  opportunities to voice their concerns, offer germane amendments, and  make changes to our proposals. At no point did we ever ask our  Republican friends to vote for our legislation. We have simply been  asking them to begin debating, just as the Senate was intended to do.   Off the floor, we have held public hearings, group discussions with  Senators, and one-on-one meetings with the other side to try to win  some support. Senators Manchin and Kaine and Tester and King and Durbin  and Klobuchar and Leahy and many more have all met with Republicans to  initiate a dialogue. At every turn, we have been met with resistance.  Next week, we will try again. They will go on record again. But, of  course, obstruction is all we have been able to see so far.   As an aside, one of the arguments we hear from the other side is that  this is an attempt at a Federal takeover of our elections. The  sophistry, the dishonesty is legion.   The Founders, whom my Republican colleagues invoke when it is time to  confirm a rightwing judge, wrote in the Constitution that the Congress  precisely has the power to pass laws to determine the time, place, and  manner of Federal elections. This is nothing new. We have done it over  and over again with amendments and with legislation--bipartisan.   The problem isn't simply that they oppose our proposals for voting  rights legislation. They now even refuse to support legislation they  embraced in the past, including the policies in the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act.   Remember, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized five times through  its history, including by Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush.   Many of my Republican colleagues have worked in the past to improve  preclearance provisions similar to the ones contained in our latest  proposal.  [[Page S94]]  If it was good enough for Republicans back then--Republicans who were  true conservatives--it should be good enough for our Republican friends  today. But they won't even support that. In fact, they won't even  support a vote to open debate.   The sole exception in 10 months has been our colleague, the Senator  from Alaska--once on four votes. But where is the rest of the party of  Abraham Lincoln? Down to the last Member, the rest of the Republican  conference has refused to engage, refused to debate, even refused to  acknowledge that our country faces a serious threat to democracy.   Leader McConnell, this week, seemed to refer to laws I talked about  earlier as mainstream here on the floor. What is he talking about?  Maybe they are mainstream in failed democracies, but his proposals are  unacceptable in the United States.   So it is clear that the modern Republican Party has turned its back  on protecting voting rights. The party of Lincoln is increasingly  becoming the party of the Big Lie, not just Donald Trump but just  everybody here, with the rare exception.   Section 11: Restore the Senate. The Senate is better than this. A  simple look at our history shows we are better than this. The same  institution that passed civil rights legislation, the New Deal, the  Great Society, and the bills of Reconstruction, should be more than  capable of defending democracy in the modern era. But, today, the  partisanship, the Big Lie, the looming specter of Donald Trump and his  vindictiveness, his dishonesty, is a shadow that is cast over this  entire Chamber and leads to the gridlock we have.   This Chamber is not capable of functioning when one side's strategy  for legislation is inflexible, total, unthinking, unwilling to admit  fact and actually making up lies to buttress the Big Lie, such as that  the Federal Government shouldn't be involved in how Federal offices are  voted for.   The Senate is no longer a cooling saucer. It is a deep freezer.  Anyone who has been here for more than a few years knows the gears of  the Senate have ossified. The filibuster is used far more today than  ever before--by some measures, the filibuster is used as much as 10  times today compared to the past decade. My colleague from Oregon is an  expert on this, and my guess is he will speak on it.   Some might wonder if any of the great accomplishments of the past  would have had a chance of passage today. Would the Social Security Act  pass the modern Senate? Medicare and Medicaid? Civil rights? We sure  hope they would, but it is difficult to see with the way the Chamber  works this day.   As I have said since the fall, if this sort of obstruction will  continue, I believe the Senate needs to be restored to its rightful  status as the world's greatest deliberative body. It was that in the  past. It is certainly, certainly, not that now. It earned that title  precisely because, yes, debate is a central feature of this body and  always will be. But at the end of the day, so is governing, so is  taking action when needed once the debate has run its due course.   This is an old, old fight in this Chamber. Over 100 years ago, the  great Senator of Massachusetts, Henry Cabot Lodge, said that ``to vote  without debating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is  imbecile.''   ``To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and never vote  is imbecile.'' We should heed those words today, and Democrats are  currently exploring the paths we have available to restore the Senate  so it does what the Framers intended: debate, deliberate, compromise,  and end in the vote.   As I said in my ``Dear colleague'' earlier this week, if Republicans  continue to hijack the rules of the Chamber to prevent us from  protecting our democracy, then the Senate will debate and consider  changes to the rules on or before January 17, Martin Luther King, Jr.,  Day.   As we hold this debate, I ask my colleagues to consider this  question: If the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy,  then how can Democrats permit a situation in which Republicans can pass  voter suppression laws at the State-level with only a simple majority  vote but not allow the U.S. Senate to do the same?   This asymmetry cannot hold. If Senate Republicans continue to abuse  the filibuster to prevent this body from acting, then I would plead  with the Senate, particularly my colleagues on this side of the aisle,  to adapt. And we must adapt for the sake of our democracy so we can  pass the legislation I talked about earlier.   In conclusion--the last section--now, as I near the end of my  remarks, let me appeal to an important moment from history. In the  aftermath of the Civil War and as the Nation began the colossal work of  Reconstruction, America was more divided than at any point in history.  I am reading Grant's biography now. That is clear. It was hard to  imagine that a single nation could endure after the bloody conflict of  the previous 4 years.   At the time, the Congress set to work on granting newly freed slaves  the basic freedoms that had long been denied to them. Back then, it was  the party of Lincoln, which a century and a half later bears little  resemblance to what we see among their ranks today. These freedoms were  eventually enshrined federally in the 14th and 15th Amendments,  granting due process and the right to vote to all citizens, regardless  of color or race.   Today, these amendments rank as some of the greatest and most revered  accomplishments in congressional history. They are proof that our  country is capable of living up to its founding promise, if--if--we are  willing to put in the work.   But at the time, the minority party in both Chambers refused to offer  a single vote--a single vote--for any one of the civil rights  legislations put forth during Reconstruction--not one vote, not one  vote. And it was, of course, the Democratic Party that was not offering  the vote. They argued these bills represented nothing more than the  partisan interest of a majority--a power grab, they said, if you will,  from vengeful northerners.   But that didn't stop the majority. If basic freedoms meant going it  alone, they knew they had to do it.   To the patriots after the Civil War, this wasn't partisan. It was  patriotic, and the American democracy is better off today because the  patriots in this Chamber at the time were undeterred by minority  obstruction.   On this day--on this day--the day after we mark the 1-year  anniversary of an armed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, rooted in the  Big Lie that is eroding our democracy, the question before the Senate  is, How will we find a path forward on protecting our freedoms in the  21st century?   Members of this body now face a choice. They can follow in the  footsteps of our patriotic predecessors in this Chamber or they can sit  by, just as the segregationist-oriented Democrats in the post-Civil War  era did it, and try to have democracy unravel.   I do not believe that we want our democracy to unravel. I do not  believe it is the ultimate destiny of this country. It is a grand  country--as the Founding Fathers called it, ``God's noble experiment.''   I believe--I truly believe--our democracy will long endure after  these latest attacks. I believe that because of what I said at the very  beginning of my remarks: The long history of this country is a long  march toward expanding our democracy, toward making more perfect what  our Founders sought to establish.   It took millions of Americans hundreds of years to make this country  what it is today--Americans of every age and color and creed who  marched and protested, who stood up and sat in; Americans who died  defending democracy in its darkest and lowest hours.   On Memorial Day in 1884, Oliver Wendell Holmes told his war-weary  audience that ``whether [one] accepts from Fortune her spade, and will  look downward and dig, or from Aspiration her axe and cord, and will  scale the ice, the one and only one success which it is [yours] to  command is to bring to [your] work a mighty heart.''   I have confidence that Americans of a different generation--our  generation, those of us in this Chamber--will bring to our work a  mighty heart: to fight for what is right, to fight for the truth, to  never lose faith, and to protect the precious gift handed down to us by  those brilliant Framers. And by the grace of God, I know that our  democracy shall not perish in this hour but rather endure today,  tomorrow, and for generations to come.  [[Page S95]]    I yield the floor.
