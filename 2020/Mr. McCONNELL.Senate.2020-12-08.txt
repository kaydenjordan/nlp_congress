 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, some Senators indicate  they may attempt to move a privileged resolution to disapprove of the  administration's proposed sale of advanced armaments to the United Arab  Emirates, a critical partner in our fight against terrorists. It is a  little baffling to suggest that now, of all times, a protest gesture  with no chance of obtaining a veto-proof majority is of valuable use of  the Senate's time. But above and beyond that, the strategic realities  dictate that Congress should not stand in the way of this sale.   In August, the UAE reached the first of the Abraham Accords, the  landmark peace deal with Israel, brokered by the Trump administration,  which Bahrain soon went on to reprise. That step, the first  normalization of relations between the Arab nation and the State of  Israel in nearly 30 years, cemented an important new chapter in the  UAE's international relations and its close relationship with the  United States.   Of course, it is a key American objective to preserve and protect  Israel's quantitative military edge. Fortunately, Israel's Ambassador,  Defense Minister, and Prime Minister have all made sure they are  comfortable with this deal.   Senators considering this sale need to consider a reality we cannot  escape. A significant competition for influence in the Middle East is  underway, and China and Russia will be more than happy to meet the  demand for advanced capabilities if the United States simply takes our  ball and goes home.   If our colleagues make the Senate vote on this measure, I urge all my  colleagues to vote against it.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on an entirely different matter,  my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate are, to put it mildly, an  impressive bunch. It always makes it a challenge to pay adequate  tribute when one leaves our ranks.   But even by the high standards of this place, the course charted by  the Senator, whom I have to send off this morning, stands out. The  senior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, has accomplished enough  in one career to fill two. He seemingly glided from business success to  military service, to local government, to State politics, to the U.S.  Senate, where he has  [[Page S7248]]  built a remarkably productive legislative record.   Mike's prolific career began in a small town. In fact, Gillette, WY,  was so small when Mike and his wife Diana arrived and stood up the  family business, the town still carried the less-than-flattering  nickname of ``Dirt.''   But new discoveries in the American energy business were in the  course of changing everything. A major oil and gas boom meant more  people. More people meant more sales at Mike's NZ Shoes store--that is  the letter ``N'' and the letter ``Z.''   Mike could have just sat back and cruised, but Mike saw Gillette  struggling to keep up with the growth, and basic services were lagging.  Nearly everyone who encountered him in town or in the junior chamber of  commerce meetings concluded this up-and-comer had real leadership  talent. I understand the final prod into public service came from no  less a Wyoming statesman, our own former colleague, Al Simpson.   They had crossed paths. Alan had heard Mike speak. He took the  promising young man aside to tell him rather pointedly that his town  sure did need a good mayor. To be precise, Mike tells us the phrasing  was typically blunt Al Simpson: ``Put your money where your mouth is.''   Our future colleague took it under advisement. But Mike almost didn't  survive long enough to announce his campaign. The way he told it on the  floor last week, when he worked up the courage to relay that suggestion  to Diana on their long drive home, she almost swerved right off the  road. Fortunately, they were unharmed, and the more they talked, the  more they liked the idea of making a difference.   So, at the ripe old age of 30, this up-and-coming businessman ran for  mayor, and he won. On his watch, what could have been a municipal  disaster became an economic golden age for Gillette. It didn't take  long for the town's fortunes to become the talk of political minds  around Wyoming.   After a few years off, the former Mayor Enzi was representing his  neighbors as State representative and then as State senator. And just  like water seeks its own level, talent tends to seek its best outlet.  So, after squeaking out a close primary victory over his now-fellow  Senator from Wyoming, John Barrasso, Mike packed his bags for  Washington in late 1996, and this body gained, at that time, its only  trained accountant.   Now, Mike knew that if he was going to properly serve his beloved  State, he would need fellow Wyomingites working alongside him--people  who shared his no-nonsense affection for careful planning and thrift in  government.   One of his best decisions was persuading his longtime collaborator,  the onetime town manager of Gillette, Flip McConnaughey, to move to  Washington and be his chief of staff. Mike says he initially had 500  applications for that job, but none of them was the one he wanted. The  experienced salesman had to pitch his longtime friend on the opening,  and it worked.   From Gillette to the Senate, Flip was Mike's secret weapon--not just  a staffer, but as Mike tells it, a true partner in service for many  years. When Flip passed away much too soon in 2016, this entire  institution felt the loss.   Mike's staff likes to say he has a whole collection of useful hats he  can wear to approach Senate business: the perspective of a mayor or of  a small business owner or a State legislator or an accountant or a  Wyomingite. Well, that hasn't just been a winning combination for the  people of Wyoming. It has benefited our entire country.   Mike's trade secret has been what he calls the 80-20 rule. Across all  the issues he tackled, he insists about four-fifths of the subject  matter is potential common ground ripe for progress. He said: You just  can't let the controversial 20 percent blow everything up.   Well, that approach made our colleague from Wyoming downright  prolific. Mike has been directly responsible for the passage of more  than 100 bills. He has become a go-to leader on everything from budget,  tax reform, and the deficit to AIDS relief and workplace safety. His  sober, prudent approach--not to mention his practical experience  keeping the books and making payroll--made Mike exactly the sort of  person taxpayers hope are managing their dollars.   He used budget resolutions to steer the Federal Government toward  more sustainable fiscal help. He helped shepherd the first major  overhaul of the Federal Tax Code in a generation. He has keep a  watchful eye on the unintended consequences of legislation, such as the  recent work to help relieve Main Street lenders from the one-size-fits- all burden of Dodd-Frank.   Back when Chairman Enzi was steering the HELP Committee, his  Democratic counterpart was Ted Kennedy--a fastidious small-government  guy from Wyoming and the ``liberal lion'' from Massachusetts. Call it  the 80-20 rule's final exam, and they passed that exam. They worked  together to create bipartisan outcomes on things like worker safety,  pension reform, and mental health parity.   So, to be clear, there has been no lack of conservative conviction in  Mike's career. Just ask our Democratic colleagues about the times their  debates with Mike landed in the 20 percent, and that is when the gloves  came off. This is the Senator one broadcaster in 2013 called ``the Paul  Revere of ObamaCare.''    But Mike never lost sight of the mission. He kept up the hunt for  common ground, autism research, vocational training, and carried the  torch for PEPFAR, the historic fight against AIDS in Africa.   Mike's insatiable appetite for making a difference brought some  interesting characters into his life. It turned out that quite a few  high-profile celebrities were happy to meet with one of this body's  chief champions on the AIDS issue.   But let the record reflect that east coast, Washington, DC, life  never spoiled Mike. I heard from a reliable source that after wrapping  up one meeting with Bono, the world-famous front man of U2 and a leader  in the fight against AIDS, Mike cheerfully offered the following  parting remark to the well-established superstar: ``Well . . . good  luck with the band!''   If you have seen Mike in action around the Senate--devouring details,  mastering issue after issue--it is hard to imagine him making time for  much of anything outside his work. But you would be badly mistaken,  because one of the worst kept secrets around the Capitol is that Mike  is one of the very warmest Members of the Senate family.   As we prepare to bid him farewell, Mike's colleagues may miss his  wise leadership on legislation, but I suspect the loss will be greater  for future classes of Senate pages, who will be denied the pizza and  ice creams parties Mike threw to celebrate their successes. The staff  at a favorite nearby Mexican restaurant will miss a couple who, along  with the Barrassos and the Grassleys, spent years ranked among their  most devoted weekly visitors.   More than anything, I know the dedicated staff of the Senate, who  don't get thanked enough--from the Parliamentarian's office to food  services, to the Capitol Police--will miss the massive holiday cookie  parties orchestrated by Field Marshal Diana Enzi.   Diana has organized the production of hundreds of dozens of baked  treats every year. Mike is more like her assistant in that endeavor.  Their unstoppable tradition of giving back to our colleagues, even this  year, encapsulates just what kind of hearts this couple shares.   As we know, these labors of love come on top of Diana's own important  work, like her longtime focus on clearing land mines in Eastern Europe.   I don't mean any of this to guilt Mike into staying, because Mike  always has his head on straight, his plans laid, and his priorities  lined up. So he knows that even on our best days, the Senate can't hold  a candle to the joys of the next chapter he and Diana have planned.   It turns out that the man whose Senate website includes a page of  ``Grandfatherly advice'' is looking forward to more free time for  delivering that advice to his own grandkids in person.   And I understand there are still several States in which Mike has yet  to cast a line. One of the Senate's most intrepid anglers will no  longer have to plan around this body's schedule as he seeks to correct  this oversight.   So, Mike, while all of us here are sorry to see you go, I know our  colleagues join me in wishing you ``tight lines.'' We are so glad you  brought  [[Page S7249]]  your mind and your heart here to this body. Thank you for sharing your  gifts with the country you love.
