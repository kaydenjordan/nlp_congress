 Mr. Chair, I rise today because I wholeheartedly  support the Coastal and Marine Economy Protection Act, authored by my  good friend, Congressman Cunningham.   This bill does what seems obvious to almost everyone. It bans  offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean. It is an issue that brings  together business groups, environmental groups, sportsmen groups, and  many, many others. It is an issue that transcends party lines.   In my district, we had a press conference in support of this  legislation and banning, and we had Republicans, Democrats,  Independents, businesspeople, as well as environmentalists all  together.   In south Jersey, our coast is our lifeblood. It is everything. It is  our economy, it is our culture, and it is our way of life.   Our fisheries and tourism industry are worth nearly $50 billion a  year, supporting well over half a million jobs statewide. If an oil  spill would occur on our coastline, our beaches, natural resources, and  coastal properties would be wiped out in a heartbeat.   Our fishermen, casino workers, hospitality industry, restaurants, and  small businesses would all, each and every one, suffer.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1941.    Mr. Speaker, the Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor,  south Jersey, recently celebrated its 50th anniversary.   For half a century, the Wetlands Institute has been providing south  Jersey and its community with programs that work toward conserving our  wetlands and our coastal systems.   This institute was founded on the belief that those living in coastal  communities should be educated about how to keep themselves and their  environments protected, and they have been fulfilling that goal for the  last 50 years.   Our oceans and our coasts are changing, and places like the Wetlands  Institute are vital in teaching us how to protect the wildlife affected  by these changes.   I thank all those who work at the institute for all they have done  for the past 50 years. They are teaching the scientists and the  environmentalists of the future, and I know they will continue to  enhance our community and all of our communities into the future.   New Jersey, south Jersey, and the United States of America is proud  of them. They have always been on the cutting edge, and I know they  will continue to be.                            ____________________
