 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize the  25th anniversary of the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern  University Center for Autism and Related Disabilities, known as UM-NSU  CARD.   On April 28, friends, families, healthcare advocates, and community  leaders from throughout our area in south Florida will gather together  to celebrate this notable milestone at the Tropical Nights Gala on  beautiful Biscayne Bay.   Since 1993, the outstanding staff and professionals at CARD have  excelled at providing specialized services to individuals living with  autism and related disabilities. By working with a network of outreach  centers, UM-NSU CARD is able to create lasting opportunities and growth  for so many.   Currently, CARD assists over 11,000 families in our south Florida  community, offering them invaluable support, resources, and guidance.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate all of the staff, the volunteers,  the advocates, and the family members who get so much out of the  University of Miami-Nova Southeastern Center for Autism and Related  Disabilities on this proud 25th anniversary. I thank them all for  helping those with autism, related disabilities, and spectrum disorders  to achieve their full potential and leave their own beautiful mark on  our beautiful world.   Celebrating 50th Anniversary of University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame     Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate all of  the organizers and supporters of the University of Miami Sports Hall of  Fame Banquet. This wonderful event will take place this Thursday, and  this year's festivities will be extra special because we will be  celebrating the 50th anniversary of the University of Miami Sports Hall  of Fame.   I am a proud University of Miami Hurricane, where I earned my  doctorate in education. I am married to Dexter, a fellow UM Cane. My  stepson and daughter-in-law, Dougie and Lindsay, are graduates of  University of Miami Law School, as is my stepdaughter Katherine  Lehtinen. So the Lehtinen clan, we are real boosters of the University  of Miami Hurricanes, and we wish all the best to the guests and  participants of the banquet.   Congratulations to the University of Miami for its Sports Hall of  Fame 50th Anniversary.   Go Canes.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at my alma mater, the University  of Miami. Sylvester is the only university-based cancer center in South  Florida. With locations from Miami to Coral Springs, it serves one of  the most diverse regions in the Nation.   We are lucky to have Sylvester because, unfortunately, Florida has  the second highest rate of cancer in the country. This is why, every  day, more  [[Page H3383]]  than 250 doctors and scientists at Sylvester work tirelessly to  discover exciting breakthroughs and lead the search to find a cure for  cancer.   Sylvester is also committed to increasing access to prevention and  early detection for South Florida's most vulnerable and high-risk  communities. The center will soon be launching a cutting-edge mobile  screening unit to serve thousands throughout South Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate all of the doctors, the  nurses, and the researchers at Sylvester Cancer Center on their amazing  success, and thank them for providing highly specialized and unique  cancer treatment for all of our South Florida community residents.                            ____________________
