 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share how the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act is helping folks around the United States and throughout the  Third District of Georgia.   In fact, over 400 major companies across our great Nation have  announced bonuses, pay raises, and new investments in their businesses  and communities that will offer benefits to over 4 million Americans. I  am thrilled that a number of great Georgia companies are included in  this; such as, Columbus, Georgia-based, Aflac and Total Systems  Services; as well as companies like Home Depot, Carl Black, Yancey  Bros., Cox Enterprises, SunTrust, and United Parcel Service, just to  name a few. These are all major companies in my home State of Georgia  that are making investments in their people and their industries so  that they can better serve their customers, and it is paying big  dividends.   It is always exciting to hear about these announcements from major  employers around the State, but the benefits of tax reform are not just  felt by employees at major corporations, they are being felt by the job  creators here on Main Street and right here in Georgia's Third  District. Two that I will highlight at some point tonight will be  Shred-X in Griffin, Georgia, and Custom Truck and Body Works in  Woodbury. Both of these businesses are expanding and hiring more  workers, and this is a great story for the State of Georgia and the  Third District. We are awfully proud of them.   The positive impacts of tax reform have been felt by millions more  Americans just this month as the updated withholding tables took  effect. As employers implemented these tables, Americans across the  country have seen these tax cuts reflected in bigger paychecks. This  means keeping more of your hard-earned money to spend as you see fit. I  have long said that Americans know how to spend their hard-earned money  far better than the bureaucrats here in Washington. I look forward to  seeing how our economy continues to improve.   Mr. Speaker, our next speaker is my good friend Paul Mitchell.  Representative Mitchell has become a dear friend and does a wonderful  job of representing Michigan's 10th District. I want to thank him for  setting up these Special Orders to tell the truth about tax reform and  how it is helping Americans.   In Mr. Mitchell's district, people who are making the median  household income will see a tax cut of just over $1,500.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, one of the most  important and recognizable companies in the Third District of Georgia  is Aflac.   Aflac was one of the first companies to announce benefits to its  employees. Shortly after Christmas, Aflac announced that they would  increase their investments by $250 million in the U.S., increase the  company's 401(k) match for employees, and make a one-time contribution  of $500 to each employee's account. This is a long-term investment in  Aflac's employees and into the United States economy. Our new Tax Code  helps companies like Aflac to reinvest in their workers and their  communities.   Mr. Speaker, my next speaker is Mr. Palmer, who represents the Sixth  District of Alabama. Households earning the district's median income  would see a tax break of $1,534.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, as I said early on, we are seeing  tremendous growth in businesses both large and small. Previously I  highlighted a great American company, Aflac, but an example of a small  company that is seeing the benefits of tax reform is a company called  Shred-X in Griffin, Georgia.   Shred-X is a small business offering paper shredding and recycling  services to approximately 3,000 clients throughout Atlanta and central  Georgia, and they are using their tax savings to invest in their  business. They are planning on buying a new truck and hiring a  potential employee.   Now, for a company like Shred-X, that is a true small business that  employs ten people, the addition of one truck and another employee  makes a big difference. Shred-X owner Cade Joiner told me: ``This is  just one practical example of how tax reform is helping us here on Main  Street.''   It is really exciting to see our small-business owners really  beginning to see the benefits of tax reform and beginning to see the  benefits with their employees as well   Mr. Speaker, my next guest is Mr. Buddy Carter. Representative Carter  has been an outspoken advocate for the benefits of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. He represents a district where the median household income in  the First District of Georgia will see an average savings of $1,220.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, as we go through tonight and begin to  highlight some of the benefits of tax reform, we have talked a lot  about a large business such as Aflac, a small business such as Shred-X,  but this is having an effect on individual families as well.   I have heard from people all over Georgia's Third District who are  telling me that it is having an impact in their paychecks, and that is  helping their families.   Robert from Thomaston wrote in to my office to say that he had  checked his check, and he had more money in his retiree account  statement on his military pension because of tax reform, and this is  helping him meet his monthly financial goals.   Erin from LaGrange told me that she has $132 more in each paycheck.  She said, while it may not seem like a lot to some, it is her money and  every little bit helps.   These are just two of the millions of Americans who are seeing larger  paychecks because of comprehensive tax reform.   Mr. Speaker, if anyone is not sure if tax reform is helping them, I  want to encourage them to check their check, see how much more money  they are saving each and every month.   Mr. Speaker, my next guest is the distinguished gentleman from  Georgia's 12th District, Mr. Rick Allen. Mr. Allen represents a very  broad swath of the eastern part of our State. The median income family  in his district will receive a tax savings of $875 a year thanks to the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Augusta, Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  those great words.   As I mentioned earlier, another great company in the Third District  of Georgia is a company called Total System Services, as we refer to  it, TSYS.   Right in Columbus, Georgia, TSYS is a major credit card processor and  employs thousands of people in our area. Because of tax reform, they  were able to give their employees a bonus, and, just as importantly,  they have been able to invest in their business to grow at a more  profitable rate and continue to return the benefits to the community.   I have heard a lot of folks talk about tax reform being just crumbs,  but to middle class Americans in my district, if you talk about crumbs,  it is not about tax reform.   Tax reform is making a difference in middle American lives every  single day. It is helping families make their ends meet--they are going  on the vacation that they have worked so hard for--or to invest in  their home.   These tax cuts are making a difference. Companies like TSYS, that are  returning these benefits to their employees and making investments in  their business, are continuing to do their part to make this Nation the  most competitive place in the world to do business.   Mr. Speaker, I now call on my colleague from Georgia, Representative  Loudermilk. Representative Loudermilk represents Georgia's 11th  District. The median household income in his district will see an  average savings of $1,780.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk).                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia's 11th  District. The gentleman is right, if we get the Federal Government out  of the way, great things happen.   As I mentioned earlier, another small company that is now doing big  things as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is Custom Truck & Body  Works in Woodbury, Georgia. This small company creates specialty  vehicles for first responders. They had been hoping to grow their  business, but they felt hampered by a burdensome Tax Code. After tax  reform passed, they were finally able to move on with a building  expansion, able to hire new workers, and give their current employees  additional benefits.   I got to see the impact on this business firsthand on a recent visit  to their facility in Woodbury, Georgia. Everyone was excited about the  company's growth, and it really brought home, for me, the difference  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was already making in the Third District of  Georgia.   Next is my colleague from Alabama, Congressman  Mike Rogers.  Congressman Rogers represents Alabama's Third District. We are  neighbors along the Georgia- Alabama line, and the median family  household in his district will see a tax cut of almost $1,000.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for his  remarks and for taking the opportunity to share some of the great  things that are happening just across the State line to our neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons that tax reform was so important to  me, and one of the things that I campaigned so hard for is growing up  in a community where we lost our manufacturing backbone, where we lost  our job base.   We saw families just begin to lose everything. They began to lose  their homes, their cars, their small family businesses. We saw a  generation move away from our communities to look for better  opportunities because the jobs simply weren't there.   I know that every single job is important. So every time that we are  able to do something in this great Nation to create the environment,  where this is the best place on the planet to do business, and we can  grow jobs, it is good for our communities; it is good for our friends;  it is good for our families; it is good for our neighbors. It makes our  community stronger.   One of the things about tax reform that is so important to remember  is not simply about lowering the rates, but it is about helping  American families, because now companies are now making decisions based  on their employees and what is best for their bottom line, not arcane  provisions that exist in the Tax Code.   So every time that I hear someone from the other side say, ``All we  did was give a tax break,'' I think it is being disingenuous. I think,  quite candidly, it shows a lack of willingness to dig down into what  this tax reform is really about; and that is changing how American  companies operate so they can be very competitive on the world stage,  so that they can make this place the greatest place in the world to do  business and hire more of our friends and our family members, your  neighbors, in the best-paying jobs on the planet.   Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to call on my colleague from  Georgia's Seventh District, Congressman  Rob Woodall. Congressman  Woodall is on the Budget Committee, on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, and on the Rules Committee. I thank  Congressman Woodall for his leadership on those committees. I thank the  gentleman for the opportunity that he has spent with me as a freshman  guiding me along the way. I know that the folks back home truly  appreciate his efforts, because, as a result of tax reform, families  making the median income in his district receive a $1,866 increase in  their paychecks as a result.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia's Seventh District  (Mr. Woodall).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia's  Seventh District for his remarks. Well said.   Mr. Speaker, as I close out tonight, I first want to thank all of my  colleagues who joined us here tonight to share some of the amazing  stories from their districts and their States about what is happening  as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It is clear that this is  having a real impact. The benefits are clearly more than just crumbs.  They are meaningful to every single family.   I think one of the things that I see--and I am beginning to see more  and more of--is not just simply that an employee is getting a bigger  paycheck, which is great, but that enthusiasm that they have; because  not only are they being rewarded for the job well done, but they are  now seeing new opportunities because of growing businesses that they  never had before.   It is exciting and it is wonderful to see our friends, our family,  and our neighbors, the people who we care about, who we represent,  being affected in a positive way. As our economy grows and as we do  things here to put more and more back into our communities in the forms  of people's freedoms for them to make livings and to raise their  children and to do with their family what they feel like is best, I see  a bright future for this Nation.   Just looking right now, 4 million people just recently receiving  bonuses on top of their tax cuts, it has been a huge impact. It is  making a difference. This is a promise that was made and it is a  promise that has been kept.                                time  2015    And because of our growing economy, we will have a chance to keep our  other promises: our promise to defend this Nation against foreign  invaders, our promise to make sure that our important safety nets are  there in the future, making sure that we can keep every promise made to  our seniors in terms of Social Security and Medicare, making sure that  we can keep our promises to the men and women of the armed services who  were willing to die for our freedoms.   We can keep our promises to our children to make this Nation a  wonderful and great place for them because we are beginning to have the  resources that we need to tackle one of the most important challenges  that we will ever face, and that is the $21 trillion in debt that we  have burdened future generations with. A growing economy gives us the  resources to do just that, and I cannot wait to see what this future  looks like because I know that it is strong, I know that it is bright,  and I know that it is right because we will be able to keep our  promises.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
