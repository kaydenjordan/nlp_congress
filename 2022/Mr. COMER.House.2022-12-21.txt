 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly encourage our Senate  friends across the hall to oppose this omnibus spending bill and get  back to regular order and allow Congress to debate this massive  spending bill and to offer amendments on the floor the way the Founding  Fathers designed this body.   We just had an election, Mr. Speaker, and the voters overwhelmingly  said that the biggest issue to them was inflation. We have inflation  because this body has spent too much money, but apparently, this body  did not get the message from the voters.   I am going to have the honor of being the chairman of the House  Oversight Committee in a few weeks. One of the priorities of this  committee will be to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement  in the Federal Government.   We have agencies like the NIH, the CDC, the FBI, the FDA, the IRS,  and the list goes on and on, that cannot account for the spending of  massive amounts of tax dollars, yet this body is going to give all  those Federal agencies a blank check for another 12 months.   We need to oppose this and get back to regular order.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Houston native and Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was  stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. In April 2020, she was reported missing  from her unit. Tragically, her body was found 2 months later along the  Leon River near Fort Hood. It is believed Specialist Guillen was killed  by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood who had been harassing and stalking  her.   Specialist Guillen's death spurred a national policy conversation  about the way in which sexual harassment claims have been handled by  the military.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this postal naming bill honoring  Vanessa Guillen's life and legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
