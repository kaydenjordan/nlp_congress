 Mr. President, today, Senate Democrats will be voting to  protect three programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. These  programs represent core commitments our Nation has made to seniors,  low-income Americans, children, and those living with disabilities.   Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflect who we are as  Americans. At one time or another throughout our lives, most of us have  or will count on these programs for health care or for financial  stability.   During last year's Presidential debate, President-Elect Trump sought  to distinguish himself from the field of Republican candidates by  stating he was the first and only Republican candidate who would  promise not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Yet, in their  first major action of the new Congress, Republicans have taken the  first step to dramatically alter and decimate core programs that  comprise our safety net. Congressional Republicans want to gut funding,  limit benefits, constrict eligibility, and turn guaranteed earned  benefits into a voucher and a ``good luck'' wish. Their approach would  violate the pledge we have made to millions of Americans and truly  disrupt lives. This is unacceptable. That is why I am cosponsoring  Senator Sanders' amendment to prohibit the Senate from considering any  legislation that would violate Donald Trump's promise of not cutting  Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security.   I am committed to ensuring that we meet the promise we made to  Americans. Sixty million Americans, including 2 million Illinoisans,  depend on Social Security for their well-being, and we must make sure  that this vital program is there for both current and future  generations.   By 2034, without any reform, Social Security will be unable to  fulfill its promise to its beneficiaries. If Congress does not act,  beneficiaries would immediately see their benefits reduced by one- fifth.   It remains Congress's responsibility to look to the future and  protect the long-term solvency of Social Security while ensuring  benefits meet the needs of beneficiaries, especially the most  vulnerable among us.   Waiting until tomorrow to do what we could do today--an approach that  I have seen fail in Illinois--only makes the task more difficult and  likely to cause disruption.   I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, where we tried to  address our budget challenges and the long-term solvency of Social  Security. I voted for the Commission's report because I believe we must  face the difficult reality that doing nothing may harm the very people  we are trying to protect--beneficiaries that rely on the promises we  have made. I firmly believe that we, as Members of Congress, have a  duty to have these debates and make difficult decisions, not just wait  for the inevitable.   While I did not support everything in the final Commission's report,  I believe the report included some commonsense options to improve the  longterm solvency of Social Security: accelerating the alignment of  payroll taxes to their intended level of 90 percent of wages and  realigning benefits to reflect current poverty levels among seniors.   I believe there can and should be evenhanded, bipartisan agreement on  a path forward. To do so, we need a collaborative and good-faith  partnership to examine the universe of policy options.   Make no mistake--I oppose privatization of Social Security. And  recent solvency changes have weighed heavily on beneficiaries. That is  why conversations should be balanced and targeted. There must be a dual  goal of ensuring the adequacy of benefits, especially for those who  rely on Social Security the most, and the long-term solvency of this  program.   I look forward to working across the aisle in the future to maintain  and build upon our promise to Americans.                               Amendment No. 52     Mr. President, on December 28, 2016, President Obama  designated the Bears Ears National Monument in Southern Utah, and I  wish to commend him on protecting these important lands. This  designation is an important step forward in the conservation of some of  southern Utah's important national treasures.   The 1.35-million acre monument, which spans from forested mesas to  redrock canyons and plateaus, will protect the region's abundant  cultural resources, including well-preserved cliff dwellings, rock and  art panels, artifacts, and Native American burials.   The Bears Ears National Monument, which derives its name from twin  buttes that lie at the heart of the majestic Cedar Mesa, was requested  by a coalition of five Native American tribes that united to protect a  landscape revered in their shared histories and cultures. The Hopi  Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of  Zuni, and the Ute Indian Tribe have all passed through the area at some  time, leaving behind scores of fragile dwellings, pottery, petroglyphs,  and pictographs. The Bears Ears region is a living natural and cultural  landscape, where the people of these tribes still use the lands to  collect herbs and medicines and pass their stories to the next  generation.   I have fought to protect this area's resources through the America's  Red Rock Wilderness Act, a bill I have introduced every Congress since  1997. My bill would safeguard 9.2 million acres of wilderness in Utah-- some of the last great wild places in the lower 48 States.   Historically, national monuments have been the first step in  protecting some of our most beloved public lands--the Grand Canyon, the  Grand Tetons, and indeed, four of Utah's five national parks. Not only  do these monuments help preserve precious habitat, landscapes, and  history, they create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.   President Obama's decision to protect the Bears Ears came after  significant public input in Utah, with the administration holding  multiple listening sessions. Those sessions made clear that even  diverse stakeholders agreed the Bears Ears is special and needs to be  protected. It is the right decision for the present, and it is the  right decision for the future.   Republican President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act  into law in 1906, and a review of its history and its controversy  showed that, time and again, the temporary anger over designated lands  was overshadowed by the long-term benefits to our Nation. Teddy  Roosevelt said it best, ``Of all the questions which can come before  this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a  great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great  central task of leaving this land even a better land for our  descendants than it is for us.''   I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Bears Ears  National Monument and defending it and the Antiquities Act that made it  possible.                            ____________________
