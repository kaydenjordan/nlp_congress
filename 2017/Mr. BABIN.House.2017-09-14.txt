 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Criminal  Alien Gang Member Removal Act.   Remarkably, under current law, membership in a criminal street gang  does not in and of itself make a non-citizen inadmissible or deportable  from the United States.   This common-sense bill corrects this dangerous loophole by requiring  that criminal alien gang members be deported swiftly and never allowed  back into the United States.   It provides law enforcement with another tool in their arsenal to  combat dangerous and deadly criminal gangs--like MS-13. Criminal gangs  benefit from loopholes in our immigration laws and today we are taking  an important step to close the door to the United States for non- citizen criminal gang members.   Over the past 12 months, several thousand criminal aliens who were  confirmed members of gangs were removed from the United States by  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This year ICE is continuing  its focus on making our streets safer by removing criminal gang members  with a particular focus on MS-13 members.   It is past time that we strengthen our immigration laws, deport  criminal aliens and secure our borders. We have a duty to make America  safe for its citizens and H.R. 3697 is an important step in that  direction.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 513, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit
