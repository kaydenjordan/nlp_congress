Mr. President, not too long ago--I believe this was  2011--a President came to a joint session of Congress and before the  American people, he said what needed to be said about our Tax Code. He  was pretty blunt. He said that our Tax Code is ``rigged.'' He said:  ``It makes no sense, and it has to change.'' Of course, you can  imagine, that was met with bipartisan applause in the House Chamber and  across the country.   The same President called on Democrats and Republicans to ``simplify  the system, get rid of the loopholes, and . . . lower the corporate tax  rate''--one that, I might add, ranks among the highest in the  industrialized world.   That President, like the rest of us, knows that our business tax rate  is a self-inflicted economic wound because businesses figure out, How  can I move money offshore and my headquarters offshore, and if I earn  money overseas, how can I avoid bringing that back to the United States  for better wages and more jobs and to build the business? That is all  because of our self-destructive Tax Code.   But the President's name--and I gave it away by saying the year the  speech was given. The President's name might surprise you, given the  nature of the current debate in Washington. It was Barack Obama who  said that, and the straight talk came from his 2011 State of the Union  address.   Let's fast forward a few years. We have a new President from a  different party beating the same drum. President Trump has called our  Tax Code a relic and a colossal barrier standing in the way of  America's economic comeback. He is right, of course, but so was  President Obama.   Tax reform doesn't have to be partisan. In fact, it shouldn't be  because the ramifications are much more important than just the  politics and the scorekeeping of the day. The job creators in my State  of Texas are the ones who really understand what is at stake because  they are living it. They are the ones who are getting slammed by our  current system.   Take Lisa Fullerton, for example, who owns a small retail business in  San Antonio, my hometown. Ms. Fullerton is an accountant with 33 years  of experience, who used to handle her own business's tax compliance in- house. Eventually, though, the code became too complex, and enforcement  became too punitive, and she couldn't take that risk anymore. She said  that her outsourcing of tax and employment functions now costs her  small business roughly $280,000 more per year than it did in 2000.   Lisa is far from the only one who is frustrated. Kurt Summers is the  President of Austin Generator Service, a small residential power  company in the Texas capital. For him, a lower tax rate would mean the  difference between his company turning a profit or  [[Page S6333]]  a loss. It would literally make the difference between being able to  keep the doors open or have to lock them up permanently. He explained  that any extra profits realized through tax savings might enable his  company to grow more aggressively. To him, the need for change is very  simple. It means more hiring and more jobs.   So Texans, like Alaskans and like all Americans, get the picture. But  the picture is pretty messed up, and it doesn't make any sense.   Greg Brown, President of W.W. Cannon, an industrialized storage  company in Dallas, says that compliance has gotten to be a truly  herculean tax. It has gotten so difficult that he has had to outsource  that to a CPA--again, because it is so complex and people don't want to  risk the burden of not doing it right because of the punitive nature of  the penalties.   Darryl Lyons, CEO of PAX Financial Group, has done the same thing. He  is harmed each year by the passthrough taxes on his small business  income, which impair his ability to save for business emergencies, as  well as to pay off his company debt.   Lastly, in terms of my stories here, Andy Ellard, the owner and  general manager of a machine company in Dallas, regularly purchases  expensive computer numerical controlled equipment to stay competitive  in his industry. I have no idea what that is--computer numerical  controlled equipment. He said that the tax ramifications of every  purchase have to be considered. Almost every day, he asks: Can we  expense it? Do we have to depreciate it? And if we do, over how long?   Mr. Ellard isn't shy with his words. He calls the complicated  deduction scheme for business expenses ``chaos.''   Clearly, something needs to change. As I said at the outset, that has  been acknowledged on a bipartisan basis by the current President and  the past President. I even brought out some quotes yesterday or the day  before from the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, making exactly the  same argument. The ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the  Senator from Oregon, said that lowering the corporate tax rate will  make America more competitive globally and will bring money back home  for jobs and investment in our country. So it is important for us to be  consistent and, unfortunately, they haven't been.   Things are starting to change. Last week, the so-called Big 6--led by  Speaker Ryan; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; Kevin Brady, chairman  of the House Ways and Means Committee; and the Finance Committee  chairman, Orrin Hatch--released a unified framework that contains core  principles for reform. Among them are a simplified rate structure, the  elimination of the alternative minimum tax, and many itemized  deductions and incentives for companies to keep jobs on American soil.  Perhaps most importantly, the framework recommends what is widely  agreed upon as overdue, which is lowering our uncompetitive corporate  rate, which puts American employers and workers at a disadvantage.   Today, it is sad but true that we are divided on many issues in  America. But as President Trump and President Obama have suggested, tax  reform does not have to be one of them.   I listened to our friend the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, this  morning, calling for bipartisan tax reform. They are going to have a  chance to do that because, after we pass a budget resolution, I  anticipate that in the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Hatch will  call up a base bill known as the chairman's mark, which will be open  for amendment in the Senate Finance Committee. That is what people have  been asking for, a chance to participate in the writing of the  legislation in the committee and then to have it come to the floor for  open debate and amendment. It is what we call regular order around  here. But what I am hearing from our Democratic colleagues is, yes,  they want bipartisan legislation, but they don't want to participate in  the process of writing. It strikes me as pretty hypocritical. This  shouldn't be partisan, as President Obama and President Trump have  demonstrated and as Democrats and Republicans alike have said time and  again.   We in Washington have no magic wand that will make our Tax Code  suddenly disappear, but that doesn't excuse us from working to make  taxes and tax compliance a little less painful.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.
