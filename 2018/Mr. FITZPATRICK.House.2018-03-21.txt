 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Walden, Mr.  Burgess, Mr. Griffith, and my friends  Andy Biggs and Senator Johnson  for their unflinching commitment to see right to try debated, passed,  and signed into law.   Moreover, I thank the overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House,  who, just last week, supported the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello,  Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act, and proved  emphatically that right to try is about more than politics. It is about  hope.   Each year, thousands of Americans receive a life-altering diagnosis  of a terminal illness. Even with the amazing work done in American  medical research and development, for too many families, access to  these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at  all.                                time  1315    As their Representatives, we should each endeavor to support these  individuals in their time of need, as well as support new pathways to  potentially lifesaving treatment. That is what right to try is all  about.   For those patients caught between traditional drug approval delays, a  clinical trial process for which they do not qualify and limited time,  right to try simply establishes the freedom for patients and their  doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It  gives them the option of trying to save their life.   Although the FDA has a program that allows terminal patients to apply  for early access to a promising treatment, right to try is needed  because the FDA compassionate use process doesn't help enough people.  Moreover, the application process is complicated, time consuming, and  expensive. Only about 1,200 people each year can make it through the  application process.   In 2014, more than 12,000 people in France were using investigational  [[Page H1742]]  treatments through that government's equivalent program. If a country  with one-fifth the population of the United States can help 900 percent  more people then the FDA's plan, clearly, is not working.   In Australia, doctors are allowed to work directly with drug and  device manufacturers to provide investigational treatments to terminal  patients without the government's approval. They simply must report to  the government at some point that the patient received the drug. No  permission slip is required.   This bill requires robust informed consent between the patient,  doctor, and manufacturer, while requiring notification be given to the  FDA after an unapproved drug becomes available to an eligible patient  and requires doctors and manufacturers to report adverse events to the  FDA.   Mr. Speaker, when a life hangs in the balance, the Federal Government  should not stand in the way of access to these potential treatments. I  have traveled our district in all corners and have met so many  different people--L.J. Kidon and Claire Concilio, most recently. Mr.  Speaker, these people are an inspiration for this bill. They want to  see this bill passed. Let's get this done for them.
