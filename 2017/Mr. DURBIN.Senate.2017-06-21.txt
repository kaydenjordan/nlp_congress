 Madam President, it was about a month ago that the House  of Representatives, by a narrow vote, voted to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and to replace it with their own creation. That effort by the  House of Representatives passed by, I believe, 2, 3, or 4 votes. It was  very close, and it was a partisan rollcall--all Republicans voting for  it and no Democrats voting for it. So it came to the floor of the House  without any bipartisan preparation. It was only after the vote that the  Congressional Budget Office took a look at the measure and reported to  the American people its impact.   Now, that is unusual because, when you take a big issue like the  reform of America's healthcare system, historically, traditionally,  Members of the Congress--the House and Senate--will send their versions  of the bill to the Congressional Budget Office and ask for an analysis:  Tell us how much this will cost. Tell us the impact on the deficit.  Tell us what it will do in terms of healthcare coverage. But the House  Republicans chose to vote before the analysis.   Well, the analysis still came out, and when it came out, the report  was unsettling because it had a dramatic negative impact on healthcare  in America. The House Republican repeal, according to the Congressional  Budget Office, would mean that 23 million Americans would lose their  health insurance.   Remember, we started this debate 6 or 7 years ago because we were  concerned that too few Americans had health insurance and we wanted to  expand the reach of health insurance and make sure that it was good  health insurance, and that is why we passed the Affordable Care Act. We  fell short in some respects, but we certainly achieved our goal of  increasing the number of insured Americans with the Affordable Care  Act. In my home State of Illinois, the percentage of those uninsured  with health insurance was cut in half. In fact, it was even better than  that. So more and more people ended up with coverage through Medicaid,  as well as through private health insurance.   Now comes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the Republicans  in the House decide to not only erase all of that progress in providing  more health insurance for more families but to make it worse--to make  the number of the uninsured even higher than it was. So if that is the  starting point of healthcare reform, you ask yourself: Is that really a  worthy goal? Why would you do that?   Well, they were forced to do it. They really were. The House  Republicans really, in fairness to them, had no choice, because they  made the initial decision that their highest priority was to give a tax  break of about $700 billion to the wealthiest people in America. So by  creating this tax break--giving this money back to wealthy people--they  took that same amount of money out of America's healthcare system. When  you take $700 billion out of America's healthcare system, here is what  happens. People who are currently receiving their health insurance  through Medicaid, a government program, will have fewer and fewer  opportunities to take advantage of Medicaid. In fact, they acknowledged  that. The Republicans said in the House: We are just cutting back on  Medicaid.   Secondly, you reduce or eliminate the helping hand we give to working  families who can't afford to pay their hospitalization premiums. If you  are in certain categories, we give you a subsidy to pay for your  premiums. So follow the logic: If you cut the taxes by $700 billion and  take $700 billion out of the healthcare system, you have less money to  provide Medicaid health insurance for those in low-income categories,  and you have less money to help working families pay for their health  insurance premiums.   The Congressional Budget Office looked at that and said that the net  result at the end of the day is that 23 million Americans will lose  their health insurance because of this decision by the Republican  House. In the State of Illinois, a State of about 12.5 million people,  1 million people would lose their health insurance because of this  action taken by the Republican House of Representatives.   Well, from basic civics we know that here we are in the Senate and we  get our chance once the House has acted. So we have been waiting-- waiting for almost a month for the process to begin. The sad reality is  it never even started--not the ordinary, open, public, transparent  process of debating a change in America's public health system.   Instead, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, said: What I am  going to do is to take 13 of my male Republican Senators, put them in a  room, and let them write an alternative to the House bill. Why he  didn't initially include the women in his caucus, he can explain, but  it was 13 of the male Republicans who would sit in a room to write, in  secret, their alternative.   We think: Well, most legislative ideas start with that kind of a  meeting--a closed-door meeting in the quiet of a room, basic  negotiation. But it is the nature of a democracy and our form of  government that at some point this becomes public. Shouldn't it? If we  are going to change the laws about health insurance--basic fundamental  coverage for American families--shouldn't we know it? Shouldn't we know  what the changes will be before we vote on them?   Well, there is a pretty rampant rumor that tomorrow, for the first  time, there will be a limited disclosure of this Republican effort over  the last several weeks. We are told--and it is only a rumor--that the  Senate Republican leadership will sit down with the Senate Republican  caucus and show them for the first time what they want to propose that  we vote on.   One might say: Well, that sounds like the beginning of a good, long  process.   It is not. It is the beginning of a short process, because the  Republican leader has said that this time next week we will be into  debating that issue and voting on it to its conclusion--in 10 days.  That is 10 days, start to finish, to rewrite the healthcare system of  America, 10 days on a measure that has not been disclosed to the  Republican Senators--not all of them--let alone the Democratic Senators  and let alone the American people. That is what we are faced with.    When we wrote the Affordable Care Act, which was widely criticized by  the Republicans, let me tell you the process we followed with the  Affordable Care Act. In 2009, the Senate HELP Committee--or the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--held 13 public, bipartisan  hearings, 20 walk-throughs of various proposals, and a markup in the  committee that went on for 1 calendar month, and 160 amendments offered  by the Republicans were adopted. That was in 2009 with the Affordable  Care Act.   The Senate Finance Committee, which writes the tax laws, held 17  roundtables, summits, and hearings on the legislation, 13 Member  meetings and walk-throughs, and 38 meetings and negotiations.   Keep in mind that we still haven't seen the Republican proposal we  are supposed to vote on next week--this secret proposal.   The Senate Finance Committee on the Affordable Care Act held a 7-day  markup and adopted 11 Republican amendments. At the end of the day, not  a single Republican Senator voted for the measure, but they offered  amendments, and those amendments were debated and many of them were  adopted by the Democratic majority.   When the Affordable Care Act came to the floor of the Senate, we  spent--and I remember this well--25 consecutive days in session  considering that bill--25 days. As to what Senator  [[Page S3661]]  McConnell and the Republicans will offer to us in what we call  reconciliation, we will be lucky to get 25 hours. We spent 25 days on  the Affordable Care Act. In total, the Senate spent more than 160 hours  on the Affordable Care Act and more than 150 Republican amendments were  adopted, though not a single Republican Senator ended up voting for the  bill. We opened it to their amendments and adopted their amendments. It  was a bipartisan effort.   What has been the process this time around? No hearings, no markups,  no public input, no support from the medical advocacy community at all.  I don't have a single medical advocacy group in Illinois that supports  what the Republicans did in the House of Representatives--not one.  Hospitals, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, and disease advocacy groups,  like cancer and heart, are all opposed to what was done in the House of  Representatives, and we are being told, when it comes to the Senate's  turn: Get ready, it is going to be fast. Don't blink, you might miss  it.   Let me tell my colleagues what else we have. We have a record of  quotations from leaders on the Republican side who, even though the  Affordable Care Act went through all of these hearings and all this  deliberation, were very explicit in their criticism. Here is Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky, in December of 2009,  on the Affordable Care Act. He said: ``This massive piece of  legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being  written behind closed doors, without input from anyone, in an effort to  jam it past not only the Senate but the American people.''   I might say to Senator McConnell: How would you explain what you are  doing now when it comes to rewriting the healthcare system behind  closed doors without input from anyone? Is it an effort to ``jam it  past not only the Senate but the American people''?   Senator Marco Rubio last week was quoted as saying: ``The Senate is  not a place where you can just cook up something behind closed doors  and rush it for a vote on the floor.''   I agree with Senator Rubio, but that is what they are trying to do.   Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska, said: ``If we had  utilized the process that goes through a committee, I would be able to  answer not only your questions but my constituents' questions.''   Senator Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska, expressed what most of us  feel. How could we even answer an honest, legitimate question from  someone we represent when we can't even see the measure that is being  produced by the Republicans.   Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, said last month:         I want the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings,       bring the experts who know about healthcare from across the       country, bring the constituents to tell us their stories.       Then I want every Senator, all 100 of us, to have the chance       to offer amendments.    Thank you, Senator Moran. I agree with you. That is how the Senate is  supposed to work, but that is not how it is working now.   Let me tell my colleagues what some of the groups have said about  this Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. You expect:  Oh, it is a partisan comment from a partisan Senator. These are  nonpartisan groups.   The American Heart Association, what do they say? They say: ``The  House bill would seriously erode preexisting condition protections,  including for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.''   About a third of us on Earth--or at least a third of us in America-- have some preexisting condition. For the longest time, insurance  companies said: If you are a woman, it is a preexisting condition.   Go figure. But now, at least a third of us have some condition which,  in the old days, would disqualify us from insurance coverage or make it  too expensive.   So now we put in the Affordable Care Act a prohibition against  discriminating against any American because they have a preexisting  medical condition. I think that is pretty important. My family has  certainly had the same experience as other families when it comes to  preexisting conditions.   Now the Republicans have said: We are going to take that out. We want  to give you more choice. We want the insurance companies to give you  more choice. Choice means another reason to say no. Choice means  coverage that isn't there when you need it. Choice means restrictions  on your health insurance policy. That may not bother you at all today,  but tomorrow, when you go to that doctor for that diagnosis you will  never forget as long as you live or get involved in an accident and  finally take a close look at that health insurance policy, you want to  make sure it is there if you need it, don't you?   The Republicans say we need more choice. The American Heart  Association says that, when it comes to preexisting conditions, the  House Republican repeal bill would seriously erode protection of  Americans.   The American Medical Association, the largest group of physicians in  America, said: ``We cannot support [the bill] that passed the House as  drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage  and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient  populations.''   The American Diabetes Association said: ``It would give insurers the  ability to charge people with pre-existing conditions--such as  diabetes--higher prices [for health insurance] . . . and would allow  insurers to deny people with diabetes the care and services they need  to treat their disease.''   The American Association of Retired Persons has weighed in. Here is  what they say: ``This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal  sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for Americans  aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of millions of children and  adults with disabilities, and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid  program for long-term services and supports.''   AARP is working overtime to notify Americans over the age of 50 and  their kids that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act that passed the  House of Representatives is a bad deal for seniors and their families.   There is something else going on, too. For more than 6 years,  Republicans in Congress have been shouting ``repeal and replace'' from  the rooftops, and they voted more than 60 times to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. They never liked it from the start. They put  language into bills to make it more difficult for the Affordable Care  Act to work, such as funding needed to make individual insurance  markets work as intended. Then, on his first day in office, President  Trump signed an Executive order directing Federal agencies not to  enforce the Affordable Care Act.   The Trump administration cut the open enrollment timeframe in half,  making it harder for people to sign up for insurance--meaning fewer  people covered, fewer people in the insurance pools, and premiums going  up as a result. The President, to this day, continues to make  uncertainty in the insurance market. He refuses to say whether he will  continue providing cost-sharing reduction payments to help 7 million  Americans afford health insurance. Without the payments, insurers tell  us premiums will skyrockets 20 percent next year.   Let me mention one other thing that has happened as part of this  health insurance debate. We decided to make a historic change in  healthcare in America. I have told the story repeatedly, and I will not  tell it in detail, but it was Paul Wellstone, a progressive from  Minnesota, who sat right there, and Pete Domenici, a conservative from  New Mexico, who sat right there, who came together--these two unlikely  partners--because they each had members of their families who suffered  from mental illness. They said: Why is it that we don't treat mental  illness like an illness? Why is it that health insurance just covers  physical illness?   They were right. They fought the insurance companies for years, and  they won. We put it in the Affordable Care Act. We said: If you offer  health insurance, you have to cover mental illness. My friends, it is  time for us to step out of the shadows, where mental illness was  considered a curse and not an illness, and deal with it as something  that can be successfully treated. We put it in the bill, and most  Americans would agree that it was the right thing to do.   There was another part of it, though, that slipped my attention and  now I know it is critically important. It wasn't just mental illness.  It was coverage for mental illness and substance abuse treatment.  [[Page S3662]]    How important is substance abuse treatment in America today? Go to  Maine, go to Iowa, go to Illinois, and ask the question: Are there any  problems with opioids? Heroin? Overdosing? Death? Of course.   When you go to the rehab and addiction treatment centers and you ask  people: How is your family paying for this care to try to rescue this  young child in your family or someone dealing with addiction, they say  they are either under Medicaid, the government insurance program, or  their health insurance policy covers substance abuse treatment. Why?  Because Wellstone and Domenici effectively included that in the bill.  Now, under the bill that passed in the House of Representatives, an  estimated 1.3 million Americans with mental disorders and 2.8 million  seeking help with substance abuse will lose their coverage for  treatment. It is no longer a priority under the Republican idea of  giving you choice with your health insurance.   Choice--when you are a father buying health insurance for your family  and you are picking out a health insurance policy and you have a  choice, could you anticipate the teenaged daughter you love with all  your heart will one day face an addiction and desperately need  substance abuse treatment to save her life? Did you think about that  when you signed up for the right choice in a lower cost health  insurance plan?   I feel, and many feel, that this is essential when it comes to  services and health insurance. Republicans say: No, it is an option;  take it or leave it. People who leave it and then need it find  themselves in a terrible predicament. They can't provide the lifesaving  treatment their kids and other members of the family they love  desperately need.   I see my colleague on the floor, and I will not go any further other  than to say this: Why are we in this position when, 10 days before the  final vote on changing healthcare for 360 million Americans, it is in a  proposal that no one has seen and no one has read and no one has  analyzed? It is an embarrassment to this great institution, the Senate,  that we are not deliberating on this measure--this lifesaving, life- and-death measure--with the kind of respect that it deserves, with the  kind of expertise that it deserves.   My Republican Senate colleagues have said it well--Senator Murkowski,  Senator Moran, and others: The Senate ought to do what the Senate was  elected to do. Take up an important measure like this, read it  carefully, debate it, amend it, bring in the experts, and don't move so  quickly on it that you could jeopardize the healthcare of millions of  Americans. I am sorry it has reached that point.   If 3 Republican Senators out of 52--if three of them--will step up  and say: This is wrong; we need to do this the right way, a transparent  way, a fair way, a bipartisan way. If three will step up and do that,  then we can roll up our sleeves and do the right thing for America.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.
