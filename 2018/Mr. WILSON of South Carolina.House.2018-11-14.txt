 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, the world  recognized the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, which ended  on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918.   As a 31-year veteran, son of a Flying Tiger, and father of four sons  who have served in the military overseas, I have a personal  appreciation for servicemembers and families. South Carolina has a long  history of patriotic military service, including in World War I. Our  State is grateful that eight South Carolinians received the  Congressional  [[Page H9514]]  Medal of Honor, which was bestowed upon only 78 veterans for the Nation  during the war.   I appreciate representing Fort Jackson, which was created in 1917 as  the United States entered the Great War. Each time I meet our soldiers,  I am so impressed by their professionalism of the troops and their  leadership.   Let us never forget the sacrifices to preserve America while  liberating occupied allies. Freedom is not free.   I thank VA representatives Lee Becker and Brendon Gehrke for the  commemorative pin.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
