 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 305, I  [[Page H3090]]  call up the bill (H.R. 244) to encourage effective, voluntary  investments to recruit, employ, and retain men and women who have  served in the United States military with annual Federal awards to  employers recognizing such efforts, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendments thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on further consideration of  H.R. 244 and that I may include tabular material on the same.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 3, 2017, on page H3289, the following appeared: 244 that may  include tabular material      The online version has been corrected to read: 244 and that I  may include tabular material    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.   I rise today to present the House amendment to H.R. 244, a bill that  will provide funding for the Federal Government for the rest of the  year 2017.   This bill reflects shared values, which will help make our Nation  stronger, safer, and more prosperous. It fulfills our constitutional  duty to fund important services the American people rely on every day,  and it does this in a responsible way, making the best use of every  single taxpayer dollar, ensuring more reliability and predictability  than a government operating under a continuing resolution. In short, it  moves our Nation forward in the right direction.   The bill includes full-year funding for the remaining 11 annual  appropriations bills for defense, infrastructure, health, and safety  programs through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, as well as  critical emergency and defense and border security funding requested by  the President.   In total, it provides $1.63 trillion in base and overseas contingency  operations funding. These levels meet the caps provided by the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.   This bill makes the smart decisions investing funding where it is  needed most: rebuilding our military, securing our borders, and  bolstering economic growth, getting people back to work.   First and foremost and most importantly, this bill prioritizes  funding for national defense, restoring the strength and capacity of  our Armed Forces. Overall defense funding is increased by $25 billion  above fiscal year 2016 levels.   This funding will help ensure our military has proper training, the  best weapons and equipment needed to defeat ISIS, battle radical  extremism around the world, and support our allies in the critical  regions around the world against threats from Russia, China, Iran,  North Korea, and other sources. To rebuild our end strength, this bill  includes $1.6 billion for an additional 36,000 troops above the  previous administration's request.   Most importantly, this bill supports our men and women in uniform-- all volunteers--and provides them with a 2.1 percent pay raise, the  largest in 6 years, and it takes care of their families.   To help secure our borders and protect our homeland, the bill  provides Customs and Border Protection with a total of $12.2 billion,  nearly a billion increase over fiscal year 2016. In fact, this is the  largest increase to border security technologies and infrastructure in  a decade, a downpayment on stronger, more effective systems and  barriers.   Funding is also prioritized to tackle gang and drug crime, combat  terrorism, and support law enforcement. Vital agencies like the FBI,  the U.S. Marshals, the DEA, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement all  receive funding boosts.   Other domestic funding is directed to proven, effective programs that  improve the health and safety of all Americans. This includes increases  for the National Institutes of Health and the CDC.  [[Page H3290]]    Significantly, we have increased funding to battle the opioid abuse  epidemic by $781 million from last year. This funding will provide  treatment, education and enforcement, and help the unacceptably high  numbers of communities that have been devastated by this crisis.   Lastly, this legislation funds important national priorities like  critical infrastructure and essential disaster relief, and supports our  local communities, including renewing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship  Program and giving choice in the District to parents.                                time  1430    This bill should also be noted for what it doesn't do. Our  legislation cuts, freezes, and eliminates funding for dozens of  programs that have been wasteful, ineffective, or just plain  unnecessary. For example, we cut funding at the EPA by $81 million and  reined in its regulatory program to prevent overreach.   We froze IRS's funding at current levels and directed funds to  improve services to taxpayers. And to ensure that each and every tax  dollar is well spent, the bill implements strong oversight and  accountability at every level of government.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, as it reflects the  needs of the American people and our common values. We are investing in  the security and success of our Nation, and, for that, this bill  deserves solid bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, there are many people to thank for their help in  bringing this bill to the floor today. First and foremost, I want to  thank my colleagues in the House. Each and every Member contributed to  this effort, and, as a result, it is a better bill.   I especially want to thank my committee chairmen. They are stewards  of these bills, and I appreciate all the hard work they have done to  get us here today with their committee members.   I would also like to thank my counterpart, ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee, Mrs. Lowey, for her dedication to bringing  this bill to the floor today, as well as our colleagues in the Senate  for their partnership.   Lastly, I must thank the hardworking staff of the House  Appropriations Committee. They have put in months of nonstop work to  bring this bill before the House today. We wouldn't be here without the  leadership of the full committee staff, led by Nancy Fox and Jim  Kulikowski on the majority side, and Shalanda Young and Chris Bigelow  on the minority side.   In the front office, we have, also working hard, Stephen Sepp,  Shannon O'Keefe, Carol Murphy, Jennifer Hing, Marta Hernandez, Tammy  Hughes, Rachel Kahler, David Roth, and Brad Allen. I thank all of you.   I also want to thank our hardworking clerks and their Democratic  counterparts. All deserve our gratitude. The clerks: Tom O'Brien, John  Martens, Jennifer Miller, Donna Shahbaz, Dena Baron, Valerie Baldwin,  Dave LesStrang, Susan Ross, Liz Dawson, Maureen Holohan, Craig Higgins,  and Doug Disrud.   Lastly, I want to thank Katie Hazlett, my chief of staff, and my  personal staff.    I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Our subcommittees, as well as the minority staff, have worked night  and day to get these fiscal year 2017 bills behind us and to get ahead  and move ahead to the 2018 process. I appreciate all of them and their  hard work.   Before I close, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge one  special member of the committee staff, Dale Oak, who retires this week.  Dale has dedicated over 20 years to the committee and even more to the  government. He tacked one extra week on to that total, sticking around  to help us complete this bill. This commitment is true to form for him,  and we are immensely grateful for it.   Dale, we thank you for your years of service, and we wish you the  best of luck in the future.   Mr. Speaker, it is now 7 months into the 2017 fiscal year. We must  complete our work today. It is time to look ahead and begin work on the  2018 priorities. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), my predecessor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Granger), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.   (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), chairman of the Energy and Water Development,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chair of the Subcommittee on Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to  the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland  Security of the Committee on Appropriations.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), chair of the Subcommittee on  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Legislative Branch of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, as a fiscal  conservative, let me set the record straight. This bill's recognized  $296 million of Medicaid funding is just a bridge, half of the bridge.  This legislation simply reprograms this funding to partially address  the impending Medicaid cliff in Puerto Rico.   This allocation does not constitute new money for the island. There  should be no mistake about the territories' Medicaid program, which  historically has been underfunded and treated differently from the  States. This cliff is the result of ObamaCare.   Congress should understand that that failure to address this issue  will provoke a complete collapse of Puerto Rico's healthcare delivery  system and make worse the already ongoing mass exodus from the island  to the mainland States, such as Florida and North Carolina.   Over 1.4 million United States American citizens in Puerto Rico  receive health services through the Medicaid program at a per member,  per year rate of $167 versus $500 to $600 in the 50 States.   It is quite a difference. I want to recognize and thank Speaker Paul  Ryan, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairman Cole, Members of this House, and  all of my colleagues for supporting this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time. I thank the gentlewoman and my ranking counterpart, Mrs. Lowey,  for that kindness, and may I associate with her our remarks, pay  tribute to her leadership, the wonderful work of the staff that she has  behind her and that I have behind me. I think the debate and the  comments have been positive today.   The men and women of the greatest military in the world, the United  States Armed Forces, are waiting for our support today with the passage  of this package, this appropriations bill. Please don't let them down.  Please support this bill, which provides for our national and economic  security and takes us out from a very damaging and restrictive  continuing resolution.   Today is a vote to keep the government open and get back to our  appropriations process, which is our responsibility under the  Constitution, the power of the purse. Let's take it and use it wisely.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
