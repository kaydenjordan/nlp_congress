 Section 4:   ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a  Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against  invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive  (when legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule  and the underlying REINS Act because I was sent to Congress to help  hardworking Hoosiers create jobs, keep jobs, and raise wages. As a  small-business owner myself, I understand how difficult it is to build  a business in today's economy, and I want the Hoosiers of Indiana's  Ninth Congressional District to have control over their futures without  fear of unaccountable government bureaucrats with political agendas  creating regulations to restrict their pursuit of success.   I believe the REINS Act will ensure the constituents in Indiana's  Ninth District will not only have a voice, but also a choice in the  laws that govern this great Nation. Hardworking Hoosiers are shining  examples of what Americans can do with the freedom to make their own  economic decisions, and I don't want unelected bureaucrats in  Washington impeding the job-creating growth of Indiana's and America's  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule  and vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
