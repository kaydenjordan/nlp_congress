 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 116 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 116         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House any joint resolution       specified in section 2 of this resolution. All points of       order against consideration of each such joint resolution are       waived. Each such joint resolution shall be considered as       read. All points of order against provisions in each such       joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on each such joint resolution and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and the Workforce; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 2.  The joint resolutions referred to in the first       section of this resolution are as follows:         (a) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 66) disapproving the       rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings       arrangements established by States for non-governmental       employees.        (b) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 67) disapproving the       rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings       arrangements established by qualified State political       subdivisions for non-governmental employees.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 116 provides for  consideration of two joint resolutions designed to protect working  families by blocking harmful regulations through the Congressional  Review Act process.   In 1974, Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. This legislation,  which has broad and bipartisan support, sets standards for employer- provided retirement plans to protect the workers of the United States  of America. This regulatory framework for employer-provided retirement  plans has been largely successful at helping working families save for  retirement over the last 40 years.   Unfortunately, in the waning days of his administration, President  Obama put forward regulations to uproot this system that has worked for  decades. The Obama administration's rules would pave the way for  government-run IRAs--for bureaucrat-run IRAs--managed by States and  certain municipalities. Employees in several States would be forced to  automatically enroll in these government- and bureaucrat-run IRAs that  are not subject to the important protections established by ERISA.   In other words, in the waning days of the Obama administration, they  sought to take back from workers the protections that were given to  them when ERISA was passed 40 years ago. Let me say that again.  Workers' ERISA protections will be out the window for those people in  these government- and bureaucrat-run plans.   These regulations remove important protections for American workers  as they relate to their retirement plans. American consumers would be  directly hurt by this regulation were it to go forward.   Just as bad, workers would have less control over their retirement  savings. Withdrawals or roll-over investments to a private-sector  account could be restricted and even penalized.   These regulations would create disincentives for small businesses to  offer their retirement plans and invest in their employees' retirement,  resulting in fewer options for workers. Instead, smaller employers will  likely simply shift their employees on to these government- and  bureaucrat-run plans.   These regulations could also create a confusing patchwork of rules  that vary State to State or, even worse, city to city. This confusion  would directly hurt the consumer.   Another concern with pushing people on to government- and bureaucrat- run retirement plans is that taxpayers would end up footing the bill.  We have seen how poorly managed many State and city pension plans have  been all over this country. If these government-run IRAs are also  mismanaged, taxpayers may be asked to pay and to honor the government's  promises.   Ultimately, these regulations are simply another attempt to exert  control over the American people with a ``government knows best''  policy.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are not children that need direction  from their parents. They should not be forced by the heavy hand of the  government and faceless bureaucrats to obtain certain plans the  government  [[Page H1140]]  likes that they may not need or want. People are free today to decide  whether they want their IRAs or not. This will put them in a position  where they can be forced to have them whether they want them or not.   We have seen the problems caused when the government tries to tell  the American people what to do or what the government thinks is best  for them. These types of heavy-handed policies simply do not work and  they are counter to the principles our country was founded on.   So these two bills would use the Congressional Review Act process to  block these anti-consumer regulations from taking effect. By passing  these two bills, we will protect working families, we will support our  Nation's small businesses, and we will be shielding the taxpayers from  potential liabilities.   As I pointed out last week on this floor, just because we pass these  bills using the CRA does not mean we cannot continue working toward  solutions that improve our Nation's retirement programs. Just as the  CRA gives Congress power to block regulations, the legislative branch  can also give agencies further instructions and directions if a  regulation is needed at some point in the future.   As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I look  forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  find solutions to help Americans save for their retirement. Attempting  to use the regulatory pen to skate around ERISA and its important  protections is just not the right answer.   So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this rule and  these pro-consumer bills and protect American families, workers, and  their retirement plans.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' remarks. We are not  here today to talk about Russia, but I do remember about a month ago  when we were on this floor counting electoral college votes, my  colleague from Massachusetts objected to the Electoral College votes  from my home State of Alabama because of Russian interference.   I want to put his mind at rest. As a Representative of Alabama, I  think I can say with complete confidence that the Russians had no  influence over the Presidential vote in the State of Alabama last  November. We get our electoral information like most people in America  do: from watching FOX News or something like that.   But in the fall, in Alabama, we are also paying real close attention  to college football. So far from letting Russian influence have  anything to do with our vote in Alabama, we were doing what most people  in America were doing and paying close attention to college football.  We gave no more credence to what the Russians think about our political  votes in Alabama than we do to what they think about our college  football teams.   But let's get back to the substance of his remarks. He says that  there is no debate. This rule provides for at least 2 hours of debate,  perhaps more if we get into motions to recommit. And the truth of the  matter is, under the Congressional Review Act, the actual form of these  laws are prescribed by statute. We have no control over what can be in  them. We can either vote for them or against them. And we are going to  have clear debate--over 2 hours, maybe more--whether we are going to  vote for or against it.    There are people who are going to vote for them, and there are people  who are going to vote against them, and people are going to have  reasons for doing each. That is standard order here in the House. I  think the American people would agree, on these sorts of fundamental  things when you know what is simply in them, that is plenty of debate.   He calls these regulations that we seek to overturn ``consumer  protections.'' But remember what I said earlier: They take these  employer plans, these IRA plans that are forced by the government, they  take them out from the protections of ERISA. They take consumer  protection away from the people that have these plans. So far from  being consumer protection regulations, they are anticonsumer protection  regulations. They are antiworker.   So what is really going on here is this is not some effort--or was  some effort by the Obama administration--to protect workers. It is an  effort to try to get government more involved in people's lives, and  the people of America don't want the government more involved in their  lives.   The gentleman mentioned that there are 55 million people in America  today who don't have a retirement plan. Every one of those 55 million  people have access, if they choose to get it, to an IRA. Anybody can  set up an IRA. You don't need your employer to set it up for you. You  sure don't need the government to set it up for you. There are plenty  of people around the country that will help you set it up, and it is  pretty easy, pretty simple.   Maybe some of these people, or a lot of these people that don't have  them, don't want them. So why would the government come in and tell  them you have got to have them unless your real interest here is in  empowering government and not protecting consumers? I will leave it to  you to make the decision what the real motive was here.                                time  1245    Now, the gentleman talked about the fact that these come to us  without going through the committees of jurisdiction; but, as I said  earlier, because the form of these bills are prescribed by statute,  there is really nothing for the committees of jurisdiction to do. But  he will be glad to know that I am informed that, after we come back  from the Presidents Day week break, there will be a number of bills  coming to the floor that will have, in fact, gone through the  committees of jurisdiction, including bills, I predict, that will both  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. So there is going to be  plenty of things coming through regular order to this floor.   But as we go through the Congressional Review Act process, we are  pretty constrained in what we can say and not say in these bills, and  we are simply following that which is prescribed by statute. As I said  earlier, we can all decide, based upon that statutorily prescribed form  for what we do, whether we are for it or we are against it, whether we  want to force workers in America to get some government-forced type IRA  and take them out from the protections of ERISA, or  [[Page H1142]]  whether we want to let them have their freedom and keep the protections  of ERISA.   We want to keep freedom for the American people. We want to keep  freedom for the American workers, and we sure want them to keep the  protections they have had for over 40 years under ERISA and not take  those protections away from them so that we can force something down  their throat from some government-bureaucrat-run plan.   Getting back to what we are here to talk about today, we are here to  reverse ill-considered regulations in the waning days of the Obama  administration that hurt the American workers. By adopting this rule  and by adopting these two pieces of legislation, we protect the  American workers. I hope all of us are here to do exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when I was a young lawyer, an old lawyer one time gave  me a piece of advice that I was fortunate to never have to follow. He  said: Son, when you are strong on the facts, pound on the facts. When  you are strong on the law, pound on the law. If you are weak on the  facts and the law, pound on the table.   What we just heard is pounding on the table about Russia, and that  has nothing to do with the two bills that are covered by this rule.  Nothing in the bills that underlie this rule has anything to do with  Russia. But because there is not a good argument against the rule,  there is not a good argument against these bills, we are pulling up  something else and pounding on the table. Let's get back to the rule  and the underlying legislation.   This legislation will reverse two regulations that hurt working  people in America, period, end of sentence. Far from being a press  release, as my colleague from Massachusetts talked about, this bill is  going to pass not only this House, it is going to pass the Senate, and,  yes, it is going to be signed by the President of the United States.  Two of the Congressional Review Act bills that have already come  through this House have passed the Senate and, I am told, are going to  be signed by the President this week. These aren't press releases.  These aren't messaging bills. These are pieces of legislation that are  going to become law and protect American workers after an attempt by  the Obama administration, as it is going out the door, an attempt by  them to take ERISA rights away from American workers through a  regulation. I would think everybody in this body would be outraged,  after 40 years of bipartisan support for ERISA, that we would think it  is okay for anybody to take away workers' ERISA rights. It is not.   What we are doing today is the right thing to do, not if you are for  Big Government. But if you are for the American worker, this is the  right thing to do. Rather than pound on the table, let's work together,  pass this rule, pass this underlying legislation, and do the right  thing for the American worker.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that this  is, indeed, serious business. Looking out for the workers of America is  perhaps the most serious business that we do.   We have heard a lot of speechifying about trying to do the right  thing for the average person in America. On the way out the door, the  Obama administration promulgated two regulations that attempt to force  government-tight retirement on people when they don't want it and take  away their consumer protection rights under ERISA. That is very serious  business.    But instead of having a debate about that, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle tried to switch the subject to something else because  they don't want to have to defend the indefensible. These two  regulations that these two CRA bills would reverse would take away  protections for American workers.   This debate is not closed. I completely disagree with that assertion.  We had a full debate on this yesterday afternoon in the Rules  Committee. We devoted an hour of debate to it right now. Of course, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to chew up most  of their time, instead of talking about this rule and the underlying  legislation, talking about something else; but that is their right if  that is what they want to do.   If they had some serious debate that they wanted to have on this rule  and the underlying legislation, we wouldn't be talking about Russia. We  would be talking about these bills. We would be talking about these  regulations.   If this rule is adopted, we will have at least 2 hours of debate here  on the floor on the bills themselves, and perhaps more if there is a  motion to recommit. There is plenty of debate here. There is plenty of  time to decide that you are for the American workers and protecting  their consumer protection rights under ERISA or you are against  American workers--either/or. It doesn't have anything to do with  Russia. It has nothing to do with the Presidential election. It has  everything to do with whether you stand with the workers of America or  not.   I stand with the workers of America. I think the vast majority of the  people in this body want to stand with the workers of America. If they  do, I hope that they will vote for this rule and vote for the  underlying legislation so that we can reverse these two regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 116 and the  underlying joint resolutions.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 116 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
