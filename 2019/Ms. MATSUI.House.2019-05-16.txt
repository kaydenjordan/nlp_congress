 Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H.R.  987, legislation that advances Democrats' commitment to rein in the  soaring costs of healthcare for consumers.   I am pleased that we are taking important steps forward to address an  issue I hear from constituents almost daily: the rising cost of  prescription medicines. Just recently, I heard from Mary, who is living  with a lifelong chronic condition. The cost of her medication has  skyrocketed in recent years to the point that it has forced her to  cancel prescriptions and forgo treatment. This is really unacceptable.   The bills before us today represent an opportunity to make progress  by allowing lower cost generic drugs to come to market sooner.  Furthermore, these efforts aim to make healthcare more affordable for  patients with preexisting conditions by reversing the Trump  administration's relentless and ongoing sabotage of the ACA.   This is critical for people like Charis, a constituent in my district  who fears that, without the ACA, she would have to hide her rare  disease in order to get adequate medical care. No patient should have  to live with such a worry.   I am pleased to be able to support these patient protections on the  floor today, and I remain committed to keeping the pressure on tackling  prescription drug and insurance costs and working to defend Americans'  rights to quality and affordable healthcare.
