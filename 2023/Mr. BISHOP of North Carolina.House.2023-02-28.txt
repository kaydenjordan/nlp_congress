 Madam Speaker, right now, family and  friends have gathered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to celebrate  the life of a giant of North Carolina politics, Jim Broyhill, who  passed away last week at 95.   Mr. Broyhill served in this House for 23 years and briefly as a  Member of the United States Senate.   His story began in the town of Lenoir, where he was born the son of  James Edgar and Satie Hunt Broyhill, whose Broyhill Furniture had  become a thriving business and brand name known nationwide.   Ed Broyhill, Mr. Broyhill's father, despite living in a State where  the Republican Party was almost extinct, was a Republican national  committeeman. Jim Broyhill listened at the kitchen table as community  and business leaders and politicians discussed current events with his  father. It sparked Jim's interest.   He attended and graduated from the University of North Carolina,  class of 1950, joined the family business, and emerged as a leader of  the business community in his own right. He married Louise, and they  started a family, raising three children.   Like his father, Mr. Broyhill was passionate about politics. He also  believed fervently in competition. More than anything, he wanted to  build in North Carolina a competitive two-party system. In 1962, he  materially advanced that ball in a surprise election to Congress.   In the preceding districting process, the Democrat-dominated State  legislature drew districts designed to eliminate the only North  Carolina Republican in the State's congressional delegation, Charles  Jonas of Charlotte, but the plan backfired and elected two Republicans  to Congress, Mr. Jonas and Mr. Broyhill.   Once in Washington, Representative Broyhill formed relationships with  members of both parties and learned how to be an effective Member. He  served patiently his entire career in the minority as Democrats ran  Congress, just as he patiently nursed political competition back home.  He advocated for lower taxes and less regulation, but he set the gold  standard in constituent service.   As a result, after that first bare win in 1962, he never again faced  a serious challenge in reelection campaigns. Even now, North Carolina  Members pay heed to the Broyhill model for serving constituent needs.   Mr. Broyhill worked across the aisle for more rational business  regulation and served as a mentor to fellow Republicans in Congress,  meeting one-on-one with freshman Members and instructing them on the  importance of constituent service and attending local events in the  district.   After his retirement, he briefly returned to Lenoir, and then served  as secretary of commerce and chairman of the North Carolina Economic  Development Commission. He worked hard to bring new business to the  State and had a great deal of success.   Mr. Broyhill leaves behind his wife of 71 years, Louise; son Ed, who  serves as a Republican national committeeman himself; daughter Marilyn;  6 grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren. His son Phil passed away,  sadly, in 2014. In addition, he leaves many friends and supporters,  grateful constituents, loyal former staff, and Members of Congress who  followed him into this Chamber.   Just 15 months ago, I had the privilege to meet Mr. and Mrs. Broyhill  myself. It cemented for me the larger-than-life figure of Jim Broyhill,  who has long since entered the pantheon of foremost North Carolina  leaders.   For all the care he furnished to the Republican Party as it broke  one-party dominance in North Carolina, his first priority was Louise,  Ed, and Marilyn, his extended family whom he loved.   Jim Broyhill was a distinguished gentleman, a humble public servant,  and a loyal husband, father, and friend. It is my honor to pay tribute  to his memory today.   Jim Broyhill, rest in peace.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is my honor to gather  with other Members of the North Carolina delegation on the floor this  evening to acknowledge the passing of a great North Carolinian, the  Honorable Jim Broyhill, who passed away at the age of 95 last week.   Today, there was a gathering in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in  celebration of his life, and my fellow Members and I have come to the  floor this evening to ask the House to stand in a moment of silence in  recognition of the service of this North Carolinian, who served 23  years in this House, served briefly in the United States Senate, and  was substantially responsible for re-creating political competition and  a revitalized Republican Party in the State of North Carolina.   On behalf of the North Carolina delegation, I ask the House do now  observe a moment of silence in honor of Senator Jim Broyhill.                            ____________________
