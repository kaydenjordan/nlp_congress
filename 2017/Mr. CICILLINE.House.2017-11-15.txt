 Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have gone too  far. Their tax scheme gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires  and billionaires as well as wealthy corporations. It raises taxes on 36  million middle class families; makes deep cuts to Medicaid and  Medicare, education, and infrastructure investments; and creates more  incentives to ship American jobs overseas.   Now they are planning to sneak in a provision that targets the heart  of the Affordable Care Act and strips more than 13 million Americans of  their access to healthcare. This is not a tax reform plan. It is a tax  scam.   Democrats and Republicans should be working together to fix an  economy and a Tax Code that is rigged against working people. The  American people need real tax reform that invests in middle class  families, stops corporations from shipping jobs overseas, and protects  Medicare and Medicaid and other vital investments in healthcare,  education, and infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does just the opposite. It deserves to be  defeated, and the American people deserve a better deal.                            ____________________
