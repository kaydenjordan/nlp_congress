 Madam President, earlier this evening, Democratic and  Republican negotiators finally released, after a lot of hard work, a  bipartisan gun safety bill.   This bipartisan gun safety legislation is progress and will save  lives. While it is not everything we want, this legislation is urgently  needed. As the author of the Brady background checks bill, which passed  in 1994, I am pleased that for the first time in nearly 30 years,  Congress is back on the path to take meaningful action to address gun  violence.   I will now take the first steps to move this lifesaving legislation  on the Senate floor for a vote, with an initial procedural vote  tonight. Following that, we will move to final passage as soon as  possible. I expect the bill to pass the Senate by the week's end.   I want to commend all of my colleagues--so many who worked so hard on  this bill--for their diligent and astute efforts to finalize this  legislation. I want to particularly single out Senators Murphy, Sinema,  Cornyn, and Tillis, who really led the charge to put this together.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, it is my understanding the Senate has  received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany S.  2938.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany S. 2938, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to S. 2938 with an amendment.    I ask consent further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have an amendment at the desk.    I ask consent further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I move to refer S. 2938 to the Committee on Environment  and Public Works with instructions to report back forthwith with an  amendment.    I ask consent that further reading of the motion be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have an amendment to the instructions at the desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, June 21, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 685, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m. on  Wednesday, June 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the House message  to accompany S. 2938.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it be adjourned forthwith--I like that  word--under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:07 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 22, 2022, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
