 Mr. President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       ACTS-SCK-DO      Subject: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.           Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International           Airport on 26 August 2021.         (b) Training.        (i) Prior to deploying to the CENTCOM AOR in the spring of       2021, the units assigned to the SPMAGTF completed typical       pre-deployment training, focused on their core METs (exhibits       53, 55, 56, 57, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81). Additionally, 2/1       conducted training at the Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) at       Camp Pendleton, where they trained on embassy reinforcement       and crowd control operations (exhibits 76, 77, 86). While       deployed, 2/1's companies were distributed throughout the       AOR, and conducted various training events that would prove       beneficial while operating at HKIA later in their deployment.        (ii) Echo Company, 2/1 conducted two Mission Rehearsal       Exercises (MRXs), along with STP, CLD-21 and MWSD-373, at       PSAB in July 2021, where they focused on ECC operations and       security and response to a MASCAL event (exhibits 53, 54, 56,       57, 76). Echo Company, 2/1 also conducted non-lethal weapons       training at PSAB and additional medical training in Kuwait       (exhibit 82).        (iii) Golf Company, 2/1 deployed three platoons to Jordan,       and one platoon initially to Djibouti, and then to PSAB,       where it supported the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and       Personnel (TRAP) mission. In Jordan, Golf Company focused on       its core METs, but had the unique opportunity to train       alongside the U.K.'s 2 PARA, and the 77th Royal Jordanian       Marine Battalion (77th RJMB). Training with 2 PARA helped       build a level of interoperability and familiarity that proved       useful when Golf Company, 2/1 served alongside 2 PARA at       Abbey Gate, HKIA, whereas training with 77th RJMB helped Golf       Company Marines grow accustomed to operating with non-native       English speakers, a skill that also proved useful at HKIA       (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 80, 86, 89, 90). Third Platoon, Golf       Company, 2/1 received extensive medical training while       serving as the TRAP platoon, to include Tactical Combat       Casualty Care (TCCC), Combat Trauma Management (CTM)       training, and Valkyrie walking blood bank training (exhibits       86, 98). The rest of Golf Company conducted Combat Life Saver       (CLS) refresher training, TCCC refresher training, and MASCAL       training in Jordan, while Golf Company's junior Hospital       Corpsmen conducted CTM and Valkyrie training prior to       deploying to HKIA in support of the NEO (exhibits 77, 98).        (iv) Fox Company, 2/1 deployed to the BEC, where the       company executed fixed site security and crowd control       operations, and trained on non-lethal weapons employment, all       of which prepared them to operate at Abbey Gate (exhibit 81).       All 2/1 companies discussed ROE and the importance of       treating people at the gates of HKIA with empathy and respect       prior to deploying to HKIA (exhibits 53, 54, 56, 57, 76, 77,       78, 81). The STP completed multiple MASCAL drills while       deployed at Al Jaber, Kuwait and PSAB, prior to deploying to       HKIA (exhibit 66).        e. Leadership.        (1) Key Finding. COMREL and Task Organization. The task       organization worked. This was in large part due to pre-      existing or quickly forged relationships among leaders at the       highest echelons and adaptability at the lower echelons.        (a) The 82nd Airborne Division, led by MG Donahue, executed       their mission with a clear chain of command (exhibits 10,       121, 124, 125). The Division rapidly adapted to the changing       situation, as they were responsible for security of the       airhead, support to the NEO, planning for the retrograde of       all personnel and equipment, demilitarization of arms and       equipment, and executing the JTE (exhibits 121, 125). In       addition to security, the Division conducted initial       screening and recovery of AMCITs, LPRs, locally hired embassy       personnel, SIV applicants, and at risk Afghans at South and       West Gates (exhibit 143). Once identified and screened, these       evacuees were processed through the ECC for manifesting and       departure from HKIA (exhibits 121, 125).        (b) General McKenzie established the NEO COMREL, and       officially granted 82nd Airborne TACON of JTF-CR (exhibit 10,       11, 238). In reality, JTF-CR was TACON to USFOR-A FWD, and       merely coordinated with the 82nd Airborne Division (exhibits       18, 21, 40, 125). This adjusted COMREL, along with the mixing       of tactical responsibilities, resulted in the 82nd conducting       airfield security and NEO for one sector, and JTF-CR       conducting airfield security and NEO in another sector       (exhibits 15, 121, 125, 143, 155). The senior officers made       this division of tasks work under the circumstances with       adjusted COMREL, mutual trust, and shared understanding.        (2) Engaged and Responsive Leaders.        (a) The leadership of the U.S. Forces tasked with       conducting a NEO at HKIA worked collaboratively to adapt in       an uncertain, chaotic, ambiguous, and high-threat       environment. U.S. Forces experienced rapidly changing,       complex relationships and compressed timelines to conduct a       NEO. These leadership challenges were exacerbated by the       reality that the Taliban, who could be described as a       supporting effort, were operating under a unity of effort as       opposed to a unity of command (exhibits 53, 125). This was       demonstrated at each location around the perimeter of HKIA,       where Taliban assistance ranged from actively supporting       crowd control, to non-support, and even actively taunting the       Marines (exhibits 23, 53, 100, 102, 125, 146). RADM Vasely,       MG Donahue, and BGen Sullivan conducted Key Leader       Engagements (KLE) to coordinate activities, ensure mission       accomplishment, and protect the force (exhibits 21, 23, 125).       Their coordination with the Taliban facilitated crowd control       and force protection, and minimized the incidence of kinetic       engagements between U.S. Forces, and Taliban (exhibits 53,       104, 125). While the ROE may not have been entirely clear at       all times, due to the rapidly changing situation, U.S. Forces       retained the right to self-defense, the ability to engage       individuals committing hostile acts or demonstrating hostile       intent, and the ability to utilize riot-control measures in       defense to protect the force and civilians.        (b) Military leadership at every level was engaged and       responsive, enabling security of the airhead, executing the       NEO, and planning to execute the Joint Tactical Exfiltration       (JTE). There were numerous examples of great leadership       during an operation amounting to simultaneous combat,       evacuation, and humanitarian tasks during a compressed time,       with constrained resources, and severe restrictions on       terrain. There are three examples to highlight, the first       being how leadership engaged the NSU and Taliban forces to       assist with inner and outer perimeter security and checkpoint       screening. Another example was the emplacement of the Chevron       obstacle at Abbey Gate, which in combination with outside       influences, had a profound impact on the flow of evacuees.       The last example was the battlefield rotations conducted       before 26 August and immediately before the blast at Abbey       Gate. It should be noted that several leaders and Marines       interviewed stated operations at  [[Page S3606]]       HKIA were so chaotic, that even with the tremendous amounts       of training conducted prior to deployment, no training would       be able to prepare someone for what they faced (exhibits 107,       101 ). All of these examples tested leaders' ability to       remain flexible in a dynamic environment and challenged them       to rise above adversity.        (c) These challenges began when civilians breached the       perimeter and started to occupy the southern area of HKIA on       15 August (exhibits 15, 53, 54, 56). This caused the JTF-CR       to send 50 out of 53 personnel, emptying their JOC, to assist       in pushing back the crowd (exhibit 15). It took almost       everyone on the airfield to get the civilians off the runway       in order to continue operations (exhibit 15, 53, 54, 56).       Leadership recognized that they had to build and leverage       relationships in order to provide better security and       screening. This led to negotiations between RADM Vasely, the       NSU, and the Taliban (exhibit 53). The NSU helped to clear       the airfield and manned their gate, while MG Donahue       instructed the Taliban regarding which areas they would need       to control and clear to facilitate the NEO (exhibit 18, 21,       123, 125). The Taliban would later establish outer       checkpoints and, more notably, provide security at the       Chevron outside the outer corridor of Abbey Gate (exhibits       54, 77, 81, 84, 85 86, 89).        (d) The coordination to install the Chevron, which       ultimately changed the dynamics at Abbey Gate, involved the       U.K., Taliban and the Commander of Golf Company, 2/1 Marines,       (TEXT REDACTED) The U.K. Forces devised the idea and the       placement location, but were having trouble executing (TEXT       REDACTED) and other members of the senior leadership were       conducting KLEs with the Taliban to discuss security and       future operations (exhibit 54, 18). (TEXT REDACTED) had the       Taliban move the broken vehicles that were in the way and       preventing the Chevron from being emplaced, and help to help       to control Afghan civilians (exhibit 77). The Taliban would       later provide security in front of and on top of the Chevron       containers (exhibits 54, 77, 81, 84, 85 86, 89). (TEXT       REDACTED) also coordinated with the MEU engineers to use       their equipment to move jersey barriers and emplace the       containers forming the Chevron (exhibits 54, 77, 81, 84, 85,       89, 103). This helped to create standoff between troops and       the crowd and control the flow of personnel coming into the       Abbey Gate for processing.        (e) Leadership, from USFOR-A FWD down to the company level,       would visit the gates to ensure the Service members were       cared for and to gather situational awareness of the rapidly       changing environment. The USFOR-A FWD team would visit       gates multiple times a day (exhibit 21, 22, 23). The       USFOR-A FWD (TEXT REDACTED) would visit the gates to check       on Marines/Soldiers and to provide reports on the current       conditions and situation at the gates (exhibits 17, 21,       96). On 26 August, just before 1700, BGen Sullivan, (TEXT       REDACTED) (all of JTF-CR) had visited Abbey Gate and left       the area 20 minutes before the blast (exhibits 17, 19).       (TEXT REDACTED) 3/10 IBCT, (TEXT REDACTED) 2/501 PIR, and       (TEXT REDACTED) 1/8 visited Abbey Gate on 26 August as       well (exhibits 104, 123, 126). The (TEXT REDACTED) of 2/1,       (TEXT REDACTED) attended a meeting at the Barron Hotel       with Taliban and U.K. Forces to discuss the impending       closure of Abbey Gate at 1600 on 26 August. As he was       leaving Abbey Gate, (TEXT REDACTED) was caught in the       blast (exhibits 53, 90).        (f) Leaders on the ground engaged with their teams in order       to work through the evolving situation. They were       coordinating support with friendly units while also       negotiating with the NSU and Taliban to provide security for       gate operations and retrograde planning. Junior leaders were       empowered to make and execute decisions, as demonstrated       through the emplacement of the Chevron. Overall, military       leaders executed the mission and protected their Marines and       Soldiers to the best of their ability.        f. Medical Considerations.        (1) Key Finding. The wounds sustained by the KIA were so       catastrophic none could be saved. Medical providers at       multiple echelons stated access to additional advanced       treatment and equipment would not have saved more lives. The       capability at HKIA's Role II-E saved several Service Members       who otherwise would have succumbed to their wounds. Providers       stated the capability at HKIA was the most robust they had       experienced in an operational setting. Every Service Member       who could have been saved with medical treatment survived due       to the medical capability at HKIA.        (2) Capabilities.        (a) Role II. Throughout the Afghanistan NEO, there were two       Role II facilities at HKIA, one on North HKIA (NHKIA),       referred to at times as the NATO Role II, Role II-E, or the       Military Treatment Facility (MTF), had the most robust       capability, while a second facility at Camp Alvarado was       operated by 1/82 IBCT medical personnel (exhibits 66, 98,       128, 130, 131). The MTF hosted eight surgical teams,       including three Army Forward Resuscitative Surgical Teams       (FRST), one Army light surgical team, two U.S. SOSTs, one       Norwegian SOST, and one U.K. surgical team. The MTF had two       ORs, with the ability to surge to four patients       simultaneously, and space for seven intensive care unit (ICU)       and 14 ward patients, with the ability to surge on both. The       MTF also had CT scanning and x-ray capability, a lab, a       pharmacy, and an ER that operated 24 hours a day (exhibits       128, 131). According to multiple medical officers, the MTF at       HKIA had more assets and capability than any field facility       they had ever seen (exhibits 66, 128, 130, 131). The second       Role II facility, located at Camp Alvarado, was operated by       personnel from 1/82 IBCT and hosted an Army FRSD. The FRSD       was capable of providing limited damage control surgery and       resuscitation (exhibit 130).        (b) Role I. There were two Role I-E facilities at HKIA       throughout the NEO. The 24th MEU's STP operated next to the       PAX Terminal on NHKIA, while the SPMAGTF's STP operated out       of a building between East Gate and Abbey Gate. The MEU STP       had two physician assistants (PA), two nurses, and 15       corpsmen (exhibit 16). The SPMAGTF STP had two ER doctors,       one PA, two nurses, and 12 corpsmen (exhibit 66). In addition       to the two Role I-E facilities, the U.K. operated a Role I       facility out of the Barron Hotel, in vicinity of Abbey Gate       (exhibits 77, 98).        (3) MASCAL Plan. Prior to executing the NEO, the MASCAL       plan for HKIA was not comprehensive, in that it did not       incorporate every compound surrounding the airfield. Instead,       the existing MASCAL plan only referred to NHKIA, where the       aforementioned NATO Role II/MTF was located. Leading up to       the NEO, TF MED leadership began refining the MASCAL plan,       and attempted to designate CCPs and evacuation routes       throughout the airfield (exhibit 128). The updated plan was       not finalized prior to the beginning of the NEO, and as a       result, during the NEO the MASCAL plan was reduced to, ``In       the event of a MASCAL event, utilize all available vehicles       to transport casualties to the MTF as quickly as possible       (exhibits 66, 128, 130, 131)''. The lack of a comprehensive       MASCAL plan caused some frustration and concern for units       operating away from NHKIA (exhibit 66). Despite the lack of a       comprehensive plan, each unit conducted internal MASCAL       rehearsals that undoubtedly contributed to the rapid,       successful response witnessed following the Abbey Gate attack       of 26 August (exhibits 66, 98, 128, 130, 131).        (4) Medical Rules of Engagement (MEDROE). At the start of       the NEO, the MEDROE were unclear among the various medical       providers (exhibits 66, 130, 131). The SPMAGTF STP and 1/82       IBCT Role II were initially under the impression they were to       adhere to the standing CENTCOM MEDROE, which was complicated       by the fact that service members were coming into close,       regular contact with large numbers of civilians at the HKIA       gates (exhibits 66, 130). After operating for several days       under an ambiguous MEDROE, TF MED's (TEXT REDACTED) passed       guidance to all providers at HKIA stating that they were       responsible for providing care to anyone within the gates of       the airfield (exhibits 66, 130, 131). The lack of initial       clarity regarding MEDROE presented a challenge for some       medical providers, and served as a source of frustration       (exhibit 66).        (5) MASCAL Preparations Prior to 26 August. Upon his       arrival at HKIA, 82nd Airborne's Commander, MG Donahue,       identified the likelihood of a MASCAL event during the course       of the NEO, and tasked the 82nd's senior medical officer with       preparing for a MASCAL (exhibit 125). In the days leading up       to the attack on 26 August, units at all echelons conducted       MASCAL rehearsals (exhibits 16, 18, 21, 66, 98, 128, 130,       131). In response to the increased threat leading up to 26       August, the SPMAGTF STP (TEXT REDACTED) ran MASCAL rehearsals       in her clinic, and staged an ambulance with an en route care       team inside the inner gate at Abbey Gate on the evening of 25       August (exhibit 66). Beginning on the morning of 26 August,       Golf Company, 2/1 established a CCP inside the outer gate,       and consolidated medical supplies, litters, and corpsmen at       the CCP in anticipation of a potential attack and MASCAL       event (exhibits 77, 98). Following a phone call from the       USFOR-A FWD (TEXT REDACTED) at 1310 on 26 August warning of a       likely attack, TF MED (TEXT REDACTED) consolidated all       medical personnel at the MTF, and kept them on standby       throughout the afternoon so that they were prepared to       respond rapidly to a MASCAL (exhibit 131).        g. Chronology/Timeline of Events. See enclosure 9.        4. Recommendations.        a. TBI Screening. During the course of the investigation,       it became apparent Service Members received inconsistent       evaluation for concussion and TBI after the attack at Abbey       Gate. Since the initial medical evacuation of the wounded,       twelve Service Members have been added to the list of those       wounded in action; many for TBI. I therefore recommend       forwarding findings and recommendations to all CENTCOM       Service Component Commanders for consideration that all       Service Members at Abbey Gate during the attack, and present       in any blast zone depicted in exhibit 137, slide 7, be       evaluated for TBI.        b. Mental Health Evaluation. A consistent trend during       interviews with young Marines were stories involving       traumatic injuries and death of children, separation of       families at gates, and outright rejection of evacuees       culminating in their distraught return to the civilian       population outside the gate. During the response to the       attack at Abbey Gate, young Marines heroically recovered the       wounded and rendered life-saving care. Others carried the       bodies of their deceased friends away from the canal. In       consideration of the mental and emotional strain placed on       these young Marines and other Service Members, I recommend       forwarding  [[Page S3607]]       the findings and recommendations to all CENTCOM Service       Component Commanders. Recommend mental health evaluations and       treatment options for all personnel executing entry control       point operations at Abbey Gate from 17-26 August. Evaluations       and treatment options should also be pursued for personnel       involved in the medical response to the attack on Abbey Gate       on 26 August.        c. Interagency NEO Doctrine. Many leaders observed planning       and execution with interagency partners was difficult,       because there was no shared understanding or baseline       concepts common to the various entities involved in the       execution of NEO. To address this shortcoming, I recommend       forwarding this investigation to the Joint Staff for       consideration in drafting and publication of interagency       doctrine for Non-combatant Evacuation Operations.        d. Further Investigation. During an interview with Platoon       Commanders of Golf Company, 2/1 Marines, a Platoon Commander       stated a civilian was killed by a flash bang grenade. The       investigator did not pursue the line of questioning, because       of the group setting and potential for misconduct and a       rights advisement. After speaking with my legal advisor, I       assessed this line of inquiry was outside my scope to       investigate and would incur a significant delay in meeting my       timeline and mandate. I recommend forwarding exhibits 84 and       128 to MARCENT for potential investigation into statements       made by the Platoon Commander from Golf Company, 2/1 Marines,       concerning a possible civilian casualty caused by use of a       flash bang grenade.        5.
