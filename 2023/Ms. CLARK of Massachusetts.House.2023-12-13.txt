 Mr. Speaker, the MAGA majority is putting  forward an impeachment inquiry even as their own leaders admit there is  no evidence of wrongdoing.   They have already reviewed tens of thousands of documents,  interviewed dozens of witnesses, and nothing.   Why?   This has never been about the truth. This is about avenging Donald  Trump. This is about undermining our democracy and influencing the 2024  election.   President Ford once said, ``Truth is the glue that holds government  together.''   Mr. Speaker, it is truth that allows this Chamber to function.  Abandoning truth in favor of political gamesmanship creates nothing but  chaos. That dysfunction isn't a byproduct of the majority's behavior,  it is the point.   They don't want the government to function. They have sought nothing  in service of the American people, nothing to lower costs, nothing to  create good-paying jobs, to grow the middle class, to make everyday  people feel more secure.   What has the majority delivered?   The kind of extremism that chooses rich tax cheats over working  people, that obstructs the ballot box and hikes the cost of healthcare,  that protects guns over kids, that bans abortion and criminalizes  doctors, that rewards polluters and corporate greed and tells everyday  Americans, you foot the bill.  [[Page H6885]]    This sham impeachment is below the dignity of the people's House. It  is an affront to the people who sent us here to work for them. What a  disgrace.
