 Madam Speaker, this past Saturday, I had the great  pleasure of addressing a number of homeschool graduates in Cary, North  Carolina, 55 of them, in fact.   I was impressed by these students, and I was inspired by their  parents, who have made so many sacrifices and who have dedicated  immeasurable time to ensuring their kids get a good education.   Today, we were supposed to be voting on legislation that would help  homeschoolers. Tens of millions of Americans choose 529 savings plans  to cover K-12 expenses. This money can be used for public schools,  private schools, and religious schools, but it cannot be used to cover  homeschool expenses.   This bill was supposed to fix this inequity by enabling homeschool  parents to use their 529 savings plans. This would help erase and ease  the financial burden on homeschool parents and give homeschoolers the  same opportunities and resources enjoyed by other kids who go to  private and public schools.   As Chairman Neal said, Republicans and Democrats on the Ways and  Means Committee came together, passed this bill out of our committee.  Then it went to the Rules Committee, and Democratic leadership  intervened. At the last minute, the bill was changed, and the language  ending this discrimination against homeschoolers was removed.   Why would anyone object to ending the wrongful discrimination against  homeschool families? There are over 130,000 homeschoolers in North  Carolina and 1.6 million across the country. They deserve fairness, and  their incredible parents deserve our help.   Sadly, Madam Speaker, that is not going to happen today. Otherwise,  this is a good bill, but it certainly could have been a better bill.
