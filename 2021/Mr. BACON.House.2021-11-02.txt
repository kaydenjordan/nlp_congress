 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Native American Heritage Month and to honor the 35th anniversary of the  Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition, a private nonprofit  organization in Nebraska.   The Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition provides community  healthcare and services targeting the urban American Indian and Alaska  Native population in the greater Omaha metropolitan area, Lincoln area,  and Sioux City, Iowa, since 1986. Their rehabilitative healthcare  services and their diabetes self-management program are nationally  recognized. Currently, they are led by their CEO, Dr. Donna Polk.   Donna Lee Mays was raised by her father after her mother was hit and  killed by a drunk driver on Christmas Day in 1949 at the age of 23. Dr.  Polk was only 7 years old. Dr. Polk credits her grandmother, Annie Lee  Mays, as one of her inspirations because of her spirituality and  wisdom.   Dr. Polk firmly believes in having vision and that you have to be  able to see how things can be. If you don't, Mr. Speaker, you don't  work to effect change.   Between 1972 to 1985, Dr. Polk served as an affirmative action and  equal opportunity officer at the State of Nebraska. She volunteered in  the Nebraska corrections system for 26 years and starred in her own TV  show called ``Frankly Female,'' a show for and about women.   Dr. Polk earned her bachelor's degree in university studies, her  master's in counseling psychology, and a doctorate in administration,  instruction, and curriculum, all from the University of Nebraska at  Omaha. In addition, she is a published author. She wrote her book,  ``Black Men and Women of Nebraska,'' in 1981 to shine the light on  prominent African-American individuals in our State.   She joined the Urban Indian Health Coalition in 1991, running the  counseling program for women. She leads a team of over 40 employees  that offer services such as inpatient and outpatient substance abuse,  transitional living, alcohol and drug recovery, healthcare services,  and transportation to their facilities. Dr. Polk takes great pride in  the community programs--Project Upstream, the Tired Moccasins Elders  Program, and the Elder's Program--which help Native youth and families  overcome socioeconomic disparities and provide meals, educational  opportunities, and even extracurricular activities for all ages. Dr.  Polk is thrilled about the inauguration of their new headquarters  scheduled to open in the spring of 2022.   In recognizing the Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition, we shine a  spotlight on 35 years of helping elevate the health status and  disparities of urban Indians and other underserved populations in  Nebraska and Iowa through education, collaboration, advocacy, and  health service delivery.   Congratulations to Dr. Polk and her team for 35 years of excellence  and serving our great community.                            ____________________
