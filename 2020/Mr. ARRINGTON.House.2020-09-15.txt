 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order, which I am proud  to host, is about defending America's values and protecting America's  communities.   I have no doubt that the greatness of our beloved country can be  found in ``We the People,'' and I would say that America is great  because of the people and the values which they hold so dear: the  things that we believe collectively, the ideals that we hold out and  strive for as a nation, imperfect people striving for a more perfect  Union. And those values distinguish this experiment in liberty and  democracy.   There is a reason that people from all over the world literally risk  their lives to come here to be a part of this experiment in self- government, and I would say those ideals consist, first and foremost,  in the belief that the American people run the affairs of this country,  and we believe in that doctrine of popular sovereignty.   We believe that strong and healthy nations are nothing more than the  cumulative effect of strong and healthy families; that is, the family  is the cornerstone, at the cellular level it is the  [[Page H4421]]  strength of the fabric of this country, and we should not make any  apologies for policies that strengthen that core fabric.   We believe in the rule of law. We believe in the Constitution. We  believe that we are a nation of laws, not of men. And we in this  Chamber, in this great body of the people's House, should uphold,  should promote, should defend these values; and when they are under  assault and when they are not being lived up to, we should call that  out. We should make sure that we are keepers of these values.   I have a lot to say about one element that is a cornerstone of our  democracy, and, quite frankly, it is a cornerstone of civil society  anywhere, and that is law and order. That is justice.   These are words, Mr. Speaker, that are easily found in the mission  statement of our Federal Government, articulated, framed in the  Constitution's preamble.   Domestic tranquillity--nobody, I would submit, knows more about the  importance of rule of law, justice, and domestic tranquillity than my  colleague, Mr. Clay Higgins from Louisiana. He has been a decorated law  enforcement officer.   Like all of our men and women in uniform, he has put everything on  the line to keep the bad guys away from our law-abiding citizens and  their families and to make sure that we restrain evil and chaos so that  we can continue the persistence of this great constitutional democratic  Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins),  my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that my colleague and  dear friend, Representative Higgins, joined this important  conversation.   It is clear, Mr. Speaker, my friend was not prepared or scripted  formally, but he carries this great American story and the love and  passion for public service and for a better, stronger, safer, freer  America in his heart. If you cut this man, he bleeds red, white, and  blue, and I feel blessed to serve alongside of him.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, as we talk about those values that have made America  great and as we look out on the near horizon, we see a tremendous  contrast and a distinct, maybe as definitive and distinct as we have  ever had before the electorate of the vision, plans, and policies of  one party versus another:   One with vast greater authority and power in the government; one that  would continue to treasure, defend, and promote free people in a free  country.   One would want to plan the economy from Washington, D.C.; the other  vision and plan and policies would trust the ingenuity and the God- given gifts of the American people to create value for their fellow  Americans and the free exchange of ideas of services and products, the  free enterprise system, which has made this country the most prosperous  country on the face of the planet and in the history of the world.                                time  1830    Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is freedom. And it is our core values of in God  we trust and out of many one that we have elevated the human spirit  like no other system of self-governance.   And I have friends here who are friends of freedom. They are  champions of the Constitution. And they are keepers of the flame of  these precious values that every day they take to the floor of the  House to defend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Chip Roy, a fellow Texan, so he may come and  share his heart. He was so eloquent in our first series on defending  America's values. Today we have added to that defending and protecting  our communities and respecting rule of law.   Mr. Chip Roy from the Lone Star State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, and I  would just pose the question to the American people who are watching us  in the people's House: Should we be focused on what our Speaker and  Democratic colleagues suggest is an imperative in this time of  unprecedented crisis, unprecedented lawlessness, to have a sense of  Congress, or a House Resolution that condemns the use of the place of  origin of this virus? Or should we have a sense of Congress uniting all  Americans in condemning the lawlessness and the violence that is  burning through the great American cities without nigh even a word.   I would suggest my colleagues who remain silent are complicit as much  as the local leaders who have abandoned their law-abiding citizens at  such a time as this.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Roy for his love of country and  his passion for public service.   Mr. Speaker, I will pass the mike, if you will, to my colleague from  the Peach State, who is--I think he would be okay with me saying that  he works for the people of the 10th District of Georgia, but he serves  the King of Kings. He was a minister of the gospel and will always be  first and foremost a proud representative and ambassador of our Lord  Jesus. Again, honored to serve with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Georgia's 10th District Representative Jody  Hice.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have Representative Jody  Hice, a warrior for America's traditional values, for our Constitution,  for our rule of law join in this important conversation with the  American people in the people's House. I am honored to have you and  grateful for your words.   Who would have thought that we would be here while once great  American cities are being terrorized by violent, mob thugs who kill law  enforcement officers in cold blood and then go to the hospital for  those who have survived and to cry death to the cops. These are men and  women who risk their life and limb to make sure we have civil order,  justice, and domestic tranquility at the heart of this great Nation,  defense, safety, security for our fellow Americans.   Mr. Speaker, Vicky Hartzler is another champion for the people of the  Fourth District of Missouri. She is the chairwoman of the Value Action  Team, so she is the lead keeper of that flame, and we are honored that  she is here from the Show Me State.   And after all is said and done in Washington--more is said than  done--she is a show-me leader. She is a doer, and she is fighting every  day for these American values and for the next generation of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mrs. Vicky Hartzler.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and dear friend  from the Show Me State for showing us the right path to condemn this  violence, to support our men and women in uniform who are risking life  and limb to keep us safe and to keep the bad guys away.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on our Special Order? I fear  my time is running short, as you stand from your chair.    Mr. Speaker, I know we have 30 more minutes that the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy) was kind enough to share in the context  of Defending America's Values.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Chip Roy for joining me tonight  on the Special Order, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we have one more defender of America's  values, and he is a constitutional scholar and attorney, but he also is  the leader of the largest conservative caucus in the Republican  Conference and a dear friend of us all. We are grateful for his time,  Mr.   Mike Johnson from the great State of Louisiana.
