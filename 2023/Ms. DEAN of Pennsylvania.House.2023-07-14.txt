 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to lift the  story of McClure, Pennsylvania, native Susan Renninger, or as her  family calls her, Sue.   Sue is a loving mother and grandmother. She was diagnosed with lung  cancer 6 years ago, yet she refused to let that hold her back. In the  face of three rounds of chemo, eight rounds of radiation, Sue, an avid  traveler, completed a remarkable feat seeing all 50 States, and she did  not do it alone.   Sue's children, Heather and Eric; and her stepchildren, Kelly, Paula,  and Karla, often joined her, filling this difficult time with  adventure, memories, and an abundance of love.   Now, her 9-year-old granddaughter wants to do the same.   We as lawmakers have so much to learn from Sue: her resilience, her  perseverance, her fight. We have an obligation to fight for the  millions of Americans waging the battle with this devastating disease.   Now, in the midst of this budget season, there is no better time to  dedicate funds to beat cancer once and for all. That is why I am  advocating for more than $140 million in research to end cancer.   Let's support research. Let's support screenings early and often.  Let's win this fight for Sue and everyone in all 50 States.                            ____________________
