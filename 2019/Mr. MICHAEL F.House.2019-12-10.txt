DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5035.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Television Viewer Protection Act will help ensure  that millions of Americans, including nearly 1 million satellite  television customers, will not lose access to broadcast television  content.   It is important we get this legislation passed and to the President's  desk before the end of the year. I urge our colleagues in the Senate to  take this bill up and move it through their Chamber as quickly as  possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I urge all our  colleagues to support this very important bill. I thank my friend for  his cooperation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
