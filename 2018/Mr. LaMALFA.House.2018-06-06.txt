 Mr. Chairman, when I first got to the U.S. House, a WRDA  bill hadn't passed in 6 years. Since then, Chairman Shuster has led a  renaissance in the committee, putting us back on the 2-year cycle,  which I applaud him and all of our colleagues on the committee for  spearheading these efforts. What we are looking for is predictability  and stability in this process. Just a few weeks ago, that process  continued, as the Water Resources Development Act of 2018 passed  through the committee in a unanimous and bipartisan fashion.                                time  1515    Now, WRDA stands before the House ready for final passage. This  legislation will institute, importantly, a review process of the Army  Corps of Engineers' backlog that can save, in the near term, $3  billion. Now, with $100 billion worth of work identified, and maybe $2  billion per year allocated, when will we ever get caught up on this  unless there is a review and new process put in place?   We will also implement a study to improve Army Corps' administration  and procedures, and greatly increase the role of local shareholders in  carrying out water development projects like we have seen in Sutter and  Butte Counties in northern California. Indeed, the public will be much  better served in safety when working on these levee projects and  getting them done timely and for lower costs.   This whole WRDA legislation will be key for important flood control  work and levee work, in addition to the many other things that have  been talked about today. This bill is an important next step in moving  this process forward, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to remember and honor the  [[Page H4847]]  men who stormed the beaches of Normandy 74 years ago today, June 6,  1944, known as D-Day. The largest amphibious assault in the history of  the world was also one of the bloodiest. By the end of the day, 10,000  Allied soldiers were killed or wounded.   But with that, the irreversible liberation of Nazi-occupied Europe  had begun, and just a couple of years later, it would be complete. It  is now 74 years again from that day, and most of those who were there  to witness it are no longer with us.   It sometimes seems we may forget that sacrifice that they and many  others made so that we could all be free--liberate Europe and keep  America safe. We must not lose sight of what is important.   The obstacles we face today do not compare with the nightmare our  fathers and grandfathers faced on those beaches. On D-Day, Allied  soldiers indeed carried the weight of the free world on their  shoulders. The Nazi threat was obviously very real, and that threat was  soon defeated.   I pray that this generation and the next recognizes the gravity of  this heroism, never forgets, and takes into account what it takes to  remain free as a nation and as a people that love freedom and export  that freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 46 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, June 7, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
