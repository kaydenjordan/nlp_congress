 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  President's cruel decision to terminate temporary protected status for  El Salvador, hurting 200,000 people and their 193,000 U.S. citizen  children.   Mr. Speaker, many of these people have lived alongside us as friends  and neighbors for decades. It is unfathomable that the administration  would deport people back to one of the most dangerous parts of the  world.   When it comes to the rights and lives of immigrants, we cannot be  silent. Defending temporary protected status to protect those fleeing  war, disease, and natural disasters is a priority that crosses party  lines and political barriers. That is why, last month, I joined my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle to introduce the ASPIRE-TPS Act  that would help bring justice for immigrants who are deeply woven into  the fabric of our society. It is apparent that congressional action is  necessary now more than ever to protect people with TPS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help  us advance bipartisan legislation to protect the hundreds of thousands  of people who rely on these protections.
