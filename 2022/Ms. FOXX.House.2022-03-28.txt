 Madam Speaker, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh needs to  remember that he is a Cabinet member, not an activist. His one-sided  involvement in active labor disputes is unfair and unprecedented.   He is a former union president and the first union member in nearly  half a century to lead the Department of  [[Page H3868]]  Labor. If you believe he can be an impartial arbiter, then I have  swampland in New Mexico to sell you. The head of the AFL-CIO herself  expressed approval of Walsh's willingness to work ``behind the  scenes.''   Walsh's infamous picket line participation with strikers at the  Kellogg's factory won't be his last attempt to interfere with labor- management disputes. Politico recently reported Walsh is ``eager to  help with others.''   Walsh's pro-union advocacy disqualifies him from acting as an honest  broker. He would rather protect his union boss cronies than protect  workers and job creators.                            ____________________
