 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the majority leader going  [[Page H165]]  through those bills. There were a few bills that the Speaker had  referenced earlier this week that would also be considered.  Congresswoman Lee's resolution to repeal the 2002 AUMF, and there was  also some legislation by Congressman Khanna that would eliminate the  ability for the administration to use certain funds related to Iran.   I wanted to ask if those two bills were going to be part of that  package for next week, and I yield to the gentleman.    As it relates to the War Powers Act, obviously, we had a  heated debate on the floor yesterday.   We have had a robust debate for years in this House on whether or not  to modify and make changes to the 2002 AUMF. It has been a constant  debate.   There has been a lack of an ability to form consensus, clearly, on  both sides. I know the gentleman is aware there are a number of Members  on our side who have brought up this issue before, as well as Members  on your side.   Yesterday, we were literally in the middle of a crisis. We had just  taken out one of the worst and most brutal terrorists that we have  seen, in Soleimani. I haven't seen a lot of disagreement that he was a  brutal terrorist. The Obama administration designated him as the head  of a terrorist organization, and he was in violation of international  law that prohibited him from being in Iraq.   In the time of crisis, instead of having a conversation separate from  that on actual changes to the AUMF, if that is where my friend's  majority would like to go--clearly, again, on our side, there were  people who were interested in having that debate. It was disappointing  that, instead, we went into what turned out to be more of an effort to  take a cheap shot at the administration by bringing a resolution that  had absolutely no effect of law.   If the AUMF is going to be changed, it has to be an act of Congress.  I know the gentleman is aware of that. On our side, we are aware of  that, too. Instead of trying to engage in that kind of conversation,  debate, and negotiation, it was just a resolution that everyone  recognizes would not have made any changes to the AUMF.   Why, during this time that we are in right now, was that the path to  go, as opposed to trying to have a sincere debate on whether or not  real changes to the AUMF should take place?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, to start with, the comment that the  gentleman referenced on the floor yesterday, I will read from a  statement from the gentleman who made that comment yesterday: ``Let me  be clear: I do not believe Democrats are in love with terrorists, and I  apologize for what I said earlier this week.''   So the gentleman has apologized for that statement.    Mr. Speaker, I point that out and that that not be used  for any kind of justification for the other disagreements and issues  and concerns we had with what happened on the floor yesterday.   Frankly, there were statements made on the gentleman's side as well  that I think ought to be addressed, apologized for.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   First of all, to start with, it is the President's not just  authority, but it is the President's responsibility under the  Constitution as our Commander in Chief to keep this country safe.  President Trump has made it very clear that he is going to protect this  country from terrorists or people who want to do us harm domestically  or abroad.   In the case of Soleimani, there was a redline issued a long time ago.   I know, in the past, previous administrations have issued redlines  and then let those lines be blown through without taking any action,  and I would argue that makes our country less safe when people don't  think we are going to back up our words with actions as not just the  greatest military force in the world, but the greatest defender of  freedom throughout the world, anyone who seeks freedom, including  people in Iran who seek freedom today from this oppressive regime.   They have one place they can look to, and that is the United States  of America. That is what makes us such a great nation is that we don't  shed our blood to conquer more land; we shed our blood to keep people  safe, not just here in America, but to provide freedom all around the  world to anyone who seeks it.   The fact that President Trump maintained a redline that was crossed  is something we all should applaud.   And I would say this. You can go back to when President Obama was in  office and Osama bin Laden had been the number one target of this  country since the September 11 attacks, and President Obama made the  decision. It was his call to take out bin Laden when they thought--they  weren't positive, but they thought--they might have a real intelligence  understanding of where he was. And the President made that call.   We had a lot of disagreements with President Obama during that time  on policy, but we applauded that decision. We united behind that  decision because it was the right thing to do to take out a terrorist  who had been a major threat to our country.   By the same token, I understand that your side has a lot of  differences with the President. I just wish in a time like that, when  everyone acknowledges how brutal a terrorist he was and he crossed a  redline--he was in Iraq plotting to kill more Americans. We don't have  to wonder if he was going to do it, because he has a decades-long  history of killing Americans. The blood of hundreds of our men and  women in uniform were on his hands, and no one disputes it.   And so he is taken out by a call that I think is the right call by  our President to take him out in Iraq, which the 2002 AUMF gives him  the authority to do, the Constitution gives him the authority do.   Again, if there are some that didn't want the President to have that  legal authority, that debate should happen here under the guise of  changing the law, but the law gives the President that authority.  Congress gave that authority to the President in 2002. I wasn't here. I  know the gentleman was. It was heavily debated.                                time  1145    But ultimately, that law was passed, and that law is still on the  books today. If there is a desire to change the law, that debate should  happen, not through a resolution in the middle of this conflict, where  missiles are being fired back and forth, but where we can actually talk  about changing the law in a responsible way that focuses on the longer- term objective; not just to try to undermine the President in the  middle of him acting out his duties as Commander in Chief under the  Constitution and under all legal authority.   There are Obama administration officials, multiple Obama  administration officials who, just in the last few days, very publicly  said that President Trump had the full legal authority to take the  action he did.   Now, we can debate whether or not you think he should have done it. I  think he should have. I am glad that Soleimani is no longer on this  planet plotting to kill more Americans, which is what he was doing  illegally in Iraq. And that, ultimately, is something that we can  debate.   But a lot of us felt it was inappropriate to be bringing a  resolution, not to change the War Powers Act, not to have this serious  discussion about whether or not the 2002 AUMF should still be in place  as it was; but to just take a cheap political shot at the President in  the middle of this.   There was a Presidential candidate just yesterday, Democrat  Presidential Candidate, a major candidate for President, who said  innocent civilians are now dead because they were caught in the middle  of an unnecessary and unwarranted military tit-for-tat.   So, in essence, equating the killing of one of the most brutal  terrorists, who killed hundreds of Americans, and plotting to kill  more, equating that to Iran shooting down an airplane and another 176  people dead because of Iran's actions, the two of those are not on the  same level.   Those kinds of comments are unnecessary as well. I am not sure what  is unwarranted about taking out Soleimani, if that is what he is  suggesting, and others have suggested it too.   So, again, we can have that disagreement. But the legislation was not  only untimely, but it wouldn't even achieve the purpose that many on  both sides of the aisle would like to see, and that is a real  discussion about whether the War Powers Act operates properly.  [[Page H167]]    Frankly, there are many scholars who suggest the War Powers Act may  be unconstitutional. We have never challenged it in the courts. On a  number of fronts there were times when President Obama took action,  many times, using drone strikes, using other attacks, where he never  notified us.   I surely wasn't notified in advance of the Bin Laden killing. I am  not sure if the gentleman from Maryland was notified by President Obama  in advance of the Bin Laden killing, and I am okay with that. I don't  think the President needed to get permission. He notified us  afterwards, which is what the law requires, by the way. The law does  require notification after.   I think it would be irresponsible to require the President to notify  Congress prior to the taking out of a terrorist every time they are  trying to take out a terrorist.   Again, President Obama used that authority multiple times to take out  terrorists without prior notification of Congress, but clearly meeting  other legal requirements along the way. If those legal requirements  should be changed, let's have that debate.   I haven't seen that legislation come forward. Maybe the gentleman is  going to bring the legislation to the floor next week that would repeal  the AUMF. I think that would be an unwise move to do, but let's have  that debate, if that is where the majority wants to go. But yesterday  wasn't that debate because it wasn't a change of law.   A 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision made it clear that measures do not  have the force of law unless they are formally presented to the  President; and we all know that that, even if it were to pass the  Senate, which I doubt highly it would, it doesn't go to the President.  It doesn't change the law.   So typically, when we have conflicts like this, Congress comes  together behind our Commander in Chief to stand up for America against  terrorists. A lot of us felt that that wasn't the case yesterday, it  was disappointing.   Again, the gentleman from Georgia made his comments apologizing for  that comment he made, but in the broader context of what happened  yesterday, it was just disappointing that, instead of having a sincere  debate about whether the 2002 AUMF should stay in place as is or be  changed, which is a longer negotiation; that resolution just took a  swipe at the President and tried to limit his ability. I mean,  literally language that says directing the President to do certain  things is disingenuous when the resolution doesn't have the effect of  law.   You can't direct the President to do something. You can't call him on  the phone and say I direct you to do something. You could pass a law to  direct him to do something, but that is not what happened yesterday,  and that is the point and the concern.   Again, as the gentleman knows, there is strong interest on both sides  to revisit, maybe to keep it in place. But the 2002 AUMF has been a  topic of conversation for a long time and will continue to be one.   But if there is going to be a sincere effort to change it and a  desire to change it, then it ought to happen through the proper course  of legislation, and that wasn't what happened yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, finally, to talk about where we are on the  impeachment resolution that was passed last year, at the end of last  year by the House. Ultimately, it is typically an administrative duty  to send papers over to the Senate if legislation passes, obviously  impeachment managers would then need to be named.   There is breaking news that the Speaker is announcing that she has  asked Chairman Nadler to be prepared to bring impeachment managers to  the floor next week. I am not sure if that is ongoing, or if that is  something that had already been in the works.   But does the gentleman expect that legislation to come to the floor  next week? And does that mean that the papers either have been  transmitted to the Senate or would be transmitted to the Senate within  the next few days?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, of course we have been seeing a chorus of  Democrat Senators in the recent days expressing concern that the papers  should be sent over. Obviously, on our side, we felt that there was no  case, there was no crime, and it was clear I think in so many areas of  this.   But ultimately, if the House passes legislation, any legislation,  whether the Speaker voted for it or against it, it is not some power of  the Speaker, exclusively and dictatorially, to hold onto that if the  Speaker doesn't want to send it to the Senate. Ultimately, for the  ability to function as a legislative body, if the House passes  legislation, it goes to the Senate so that the Senate can take it up  and do whatever they are going to do with it.   But this idea that one person out of 435 can make a decision that  even if the House passes legislation and the motion to reconsider is  tabled, then it goes to the Senate.   Hopefully, that is resolved by next week and that charade ends, and  we finally get true justice where it is disposed of, which I think  everybody acknowledges that will happen once it goes over to the  Senate.   But let us get back to the business of doing the people's work. And  hopefully, we can then get to some of the broader bipartisan  legislation that has been in the works for a long time to address real  issues like lowering drug prices, like securing our border, like so  many other things that Republicans and Democrats actually in the middle  of all of this are working on together to try to accomplish.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the gentleman talks  about fairness in the trial. It is quite rich of the Speaker to call  for fairness in the Senate when she denied fairness in the House.   You can look at House rules that require the minority gets a day of  hearings on impeachment, and that rule was thrown out the window.   The gentleman said an honest trial tries to elicit all the evidence.  Of course, we had multiple witnesses we wanted to bring forward that  were denied. Clearly, all the evidence didn't get out.   I guess, by definition, it was not an honest trial in the House. I am  confident they will have an honest and fair trial in the Senate. In  fact, there are negotiations to make sure it will be fair.   By the way, I want to make this point because when the impeachment  proceedings were moving forward with President Nixon, it was a  Democratic Congress that negotiated with the Nixon administration, with  the Nixon White House, to determine a fair set of rules, and the House  adopted those rules. That was a Democratic conference.   Then, fast forward to the Clinton impeachment where you had a  Democratic President and a Republican House. The House negotiated with  the White House to come up with fair rules. Ultimately, they adopted  the Nixon standard because everybody agreed that was a fair process.   Whether or not you like the outcome is one thing, but it was a fair  process. That never happened here. This House didn't make an effort to  try to negotiate a fair set of rules with us in the minority or with  the White House.   Again, House rules actually require a minority day of hearings, and  that was broken and not allowed. We didn't get that minority day of  hearings. We requested it multiple times to try to get some fairness to  elicit facts from all sides, but we weren't given that opportunity.   The Senate now has a case that was sent over to them. By a lot of  estimates, it is an inadequate case, and it is a weak case. I think the  majority must acknowledge that, which is why they are holding the  papers and hoping for more things, which is what this was all about  anyway.   It seems like every week we would hear more rumors that, next week,  the big witness is going to come out and everything is going to be  exposed, and then that witness would testify under oath that, no, they  didn't see a crime. But don't worry, next week, there is going to be  another one.   This will go on forever. It is like a Groundhog Day of impeachment.  At some point, I would hope the majority says enough is enough, that  they will actually let the people of this country decide, which they  will. It is going to be the people of the country that decide the  President at the end of this year in the election.   This President, obviously, has a very strong case to make with what  he has done to get this economy back on track, to rebuild this  military, to protect America, to secure our border, and all the other  things that he will have a case to make to the people.   Of course, the gentleman is going to have a nominee who is going to  make their case, however far left that case will be. We will see  through the primaries. But the people will, ultimately, make that  decision.   Our job should be to focus on doing the work of the American people,  and hopefully, that happens. The Senate is going to have their  opportunity. I am confident they are going to have a fair  [[Page H169]]  trial. I wish that would have been the case here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, as the gentleman knows, it is the  Senate's job to try the House's case. If the House failed to make its  case, that is the House's fault. To suggest that the Senate needs to  mop up the mess that was done here because there was not fairness,  because both sides didn't get the opportunity, if one side wants to  say, ``I have a case to make. I am going make my case, but I am not  going to let them make theirs, and I am not going to let them call  their witnesses,'' and we had a long list of witnesses we wanted to  call that we were denied.    You are in the majority. You get to make the rules. If that is what  you want to call fair, you can, but it is not.   The Senate has it, but it was all done according to the majority out  of urgency. That is the word we heard over and over again. If the  gentleman wanted to have other people come to testify, the President  and every President exerts executive privilege, so if the standard is a  President exerting executive privilege equates to obstruction of  Congress, then you would have to retroactively go back and impeach  every President, including George Washington.   Exerting executive privilege is not an obstruction of Congress.  Congress can have a disagreement with the President. We have surely had  disagreements with previous Presidents exerting executive privilege  when we were in the majority. You fight those out in the courts. The  gentleman is well aware of that. Maybe the courts will say yes, and  maybe the courts will say no, but that attempt wasn't made. Why?  Because according to your own leader, Speaker Pelosi, ``urgent'';  Chairman Schiff, ``The timing is driven by the urgency''; Chairman  Nadler, ``The threat is urgent.'' They rammed it through, and other  facts and other witnesses that they didn't want, they discarded.   The actual rule of the House, clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI requires--not  allows but requires--the minority to have a day of hearing. That was  denied because there was urgency. They didn't want all the facts to get  out. They were concerned about urgency.   Lo and behold, it passes, and all of a sudden, what happened to the  urgency? The Speaker says we are going to hold the papers. You had  Democratic Senators: I think it is time to send the impeachment to the  Senate. Let Mitch McConnell be responsible for the fairness of the  trial. He ultimately is.   Other Senators said very similar things. At some point in time, if it  was urgent and then it happened, and then you don't send it over  because now all of a sudden you realize it is a weak case and you are  hoping something else pops up, you are hoping maybe the Senate can do  the things that weren't done here because it was an urgency, it was  expediency, appeasing a political base.                                time  1215    There was no crime. Every other impeachment started with a crime, not  the hope of a crime. You can listen to a phone call and suggest  something.   Interestingly, I never saw any attempt to impeach President Obama  because he didn't give that aid to Ukraine. If the aid was so important  that it was impeachable not to give it, Obama didn't give it. We didn't  try to impeach him. It was bad foreign policy that he didn't provide  Javelin missiles to Ukraine. It wasn't impeachable.   But President Trump did give the aid, President Trump did sell the  Javelin missiles to help Ukraine stand up to Putin.   President Obama didn't help Ukraine stand up to Putin. If that is who  you are most concerned about, then maybe the impeachment would have  been in the other direction.   But, again, that was bad foreign policy that President Obama didn't  give Ukraine the tools that they asked for and were denied by the Obama  administration, but it wasn't impeachable.  [[Page H170]]    Here you might have a disagreement with President Trump's foreign  policy. You might have a disagreement that he did sell the Javelin  missiles, maybe you agreed with it. But ultimately the President did  send that aid. There was no investigation and he sent the aid. But  impeach him for it anyway because you disagree with other things. I  think that became very clear.   At some point, if it is focused on personality, I think that is what  people are most fed up with.   If there were facts, then both sides would have been able to present  all of the evidence, both sides would have been able to call all of the  witnesses.   If the majority had confidence in their case, they would have said,  Okay. You can call your witnesses, because our witnesses are better. We  have higher confidence in our case. But that didn't happen.   We were denied what the rules of the House requires: a minority day  of hearing. We wanted it, we asked for it, the rules required it, but  they blew through it, they threw that away.   That is not fairness. But the Senate will conduct a fair trial based  on a weak case. If the case was stronger, regardless, the Senate's job  is to try the case that was made in the House, whether it was a strong  or a weak case, and that ought to happen. Justice is being denied every  day it is not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman wants to talk about how  the process works, I have made it clear. The gentleman is in the  majority. They get to make the rules however they want.   But to say, as the gentleman said earlier, an honest trial tries to  elicit all of the evidence, no one can make the argument that all of  the evidence was presented.   Again, we called and asked for multiple witnesses and were denied. We  were denied the ability to have the witnesses we asked for.   Now, they are in the majority. They said no, and they were able to  roll over that because they had the votes. But don't say it was fair.  Don't say it was an honest trial, when by their own definition, all of  the facts in evidence have to come out.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Probable cause is not the  standard in the Constitution.   To remove a sitting President, the Constitution is very specific:  treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, not probable  cause. That would be in the Constitution if that is what the Framers  intended for impeachment to be used for, but that is not what  impeachment is to be used for.   There were witnesses called, multiple witnesses.   There were tryouts, by the way, in secret that Chairman Schiff had  prior to asking the President at the last minute, after all of this  innuendo and you would hear leaks and leaks and this is going to  happen, and then they would have a secret hearing where witnesses were  sworn in, but none of us could find out what was happening in those  secret hearings.    And as we talked to Members that were there, all of the leaks and  innuendos turned out to be disproven. We couldn't find that out,  because the chairman closed those hearings to the public, closed those  hearings to most Members of Congress.   But ultimately the Senate's job is to try the case that was made in  the House, weak or strong. And clearly it was weak, because the urgency  that was talked about, it would already be going on if it was a strong  case. But even if it is a weak case, it is not the Senate's job to mop  up that mess.   It is the Senate's job to go and hear the case that was made in the  House with one side presenting their witnesses.   And, again, the majority got to have that opportunity. We didn't have  the opportunity to present witnesses we wanted to bring forward. And  there were witnesses. They were sworn in. I don't know if you would  call them something different, but that is what they were. They were  there to present facts.   Many gave innuendo, but when asked under oath, Can you name the  crime?   No.   Was there bribery?   No.   But let the Senate do their job, and hopefully they get that next  week. I would encourage that the House get that done next week. It  should have been done a while back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman if he has anything else.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
