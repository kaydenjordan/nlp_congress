 Mr. Speaker, at a time of hyperpartisanship when  traditions of consensus are seldom upheld, I am pleased to see Congress  continue its tradition of passing FDA user fee reauthorization with  broad bipartisan support.   It is absolutely critical that the FDA continue to promote medical  innovation and support public health. To do so, it must have consistent  funding, which this bill helps assure. I am also so proud that this  bill builds directly on the 21st Century Cures Act, which I coauthored  with Representative Fred Upton.   Consistent with Cures, the bill before us today ensures that both the  patient's voice and evidence from clinical practice can be considered  during drug development when it is appropriate. It also helps establish  a process for the FDA to qualify so-called biomarkers, which will  facilitate the development of future cutting-edge therapies.    By reinforcing these key provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, I  am fully confident that the bill will help deliver on our bipartisan  promise to jump-start treatments for families and for patients with  unmet needs.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone for incorporating provisions into the bill that will deepen our  understanding of the psychosocial impact of disease. These provisions  are based on the bipartisan Patient Experience in Research Act which  Representative Lance and I coauthored.   As more is learned about the social and emotional effects of disease,  we can deliver better outcomes for patients by improving medication  adherence, tailoring treatment regimens, and enhancing participation in  clinical trials.
