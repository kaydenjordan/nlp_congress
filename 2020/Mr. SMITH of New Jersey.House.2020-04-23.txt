 Madam Speaker, in New Jersey, 100,000 people  have tested positive for COVID-19, with more than 5,000 suffering  death. Forty percent of those who have died are women and men in  nursing homes and veterans in long-term care homes. We grieve their  loss.   My constituents have shown remarkable strength, resolve, and  resiliency, especially those in healthcare, first responders, postal  workers, truckers, supermarket employees, and more. Without their  courage and sacrifice, things would be far worse.   Signs outside of CentraState Medical Center in Freehold say it all:  Heroes Work Here.   For our hospitals, the $70 billion in this legislation, on top of the  $100 billion for the CARES Act, is critically needed to sustain our  overworked, cash-starved hospitals that risk insolvency, in large part,  because they have been compelled by law to postpone elective surgeries.   A few days ago, Secretary Mnuchin said 30 million jobs have been  saved by the Paycheck Protection Program, the PPP. Today's $310 billion  replenishment continues and expands this historic bridge to assist  businesses with forgivable loans to prevent layoffs and bankruptcy.                                time  1330
