 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my unwavering  support for the United States' greatest ally in the Middle East and the  region's only democracy, Israel.   When I visited the region, I saw firsthand the proximity of the  danger Israelis face on a daily basis.   With the Gaza Strip controlled by the Iranian-funded terror group  Hamas, rockets are always pointing at the Jewish state. It is estimated  that the militant group has more than 30,000 rockets and mortars at  their disposal.   For the past week, Israel and its people have been bombarded by more  than 3,000 rockets launched from within Gaza. Thank goodness for the  Iron Dome, which, despite being overwhelmed, saved countless lives.   While some on the other side of the aisle and in the media attempt to  draw a moral parallel between Hamas and Israel, there is simply no  comparison to be made.   As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ``You cannot equate a  democracy that values life with a terror organization that glorifies  death.''   Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, and while they make  every effort to keep Palestinian civilians from harm, Hamas continues  to intentionally target population centers, seeking death and  destruction.   Hamas is not interested in peace. They are not interested in working  toward a lasting solution. Their only objective is to eliminate the  Jewish state.   Why some would choose to back Hamas despite its atrocious human  rights record is beyond me. Why back a regime that stifles free speech,  prosecutes and assaults the press, treats women as second-class  citizens, and has laws on the books that condemn its own citizens to  death simply for selling land to a Jewish person?   Madam Speaker, it is mind-boggling.   I stand with Israel, and in doing so, I stand for peace.                   Congratulating Grace Christian Golf Team     Madam Speaker, author and avid golf fan P.G. Wodehouse  once remarked: Golf ``is the infallible test. The man who can go into a  patch of rough alone, with the knowledge that only God is watching him,  and play his ball where it lies is the man who will serve you  faithfully and well.''   Fittingly, I rise today to recognize Grace Christian School of  Staunton, whose golf team won its first Virginia Association of  Christian Athletics State championship.   The Warriors shot an 18-hole total of 355 in the championship  tournament at the Club at Ironwood to overcome its closest competitor  by 32 strokes.   Caleb Maas led the Warriors with an impressive 86, while Preston  Fitzgerald and Maddie Helmick each shot a pair of 87s, with Isaiah  Farlow carding a 95.   Maas, Fitzgerald, and Helmick were also named to the all-State team  for their performances throughout the season.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the athletes, coaches, and staff on an  excellent season. I wish them all the best of luck moving forward. And  keep hitting them straight.                            ____________________
