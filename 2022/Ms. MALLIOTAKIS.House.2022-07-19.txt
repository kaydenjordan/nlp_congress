 Madam Speaker, 48 years this week, on July 20, 1974,  the Turkish military invaded the Republic of Cyprus in direct violation  of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.   To this day, there has been no accountability for the deaths,  displacements, and destruction caused by this illegal invasion and  occupation.   I urge the President, Secretary Blinken, and this body to join calls  for the immediate removal of Turkish troops, the return of property to  rightful owners, and the reunification of Cyprus.   Today Cyprus, Greece, and other nations in the eastern Mediterranean  face more aggression and continued threats from Turkey under President  Erdogan, who has threatened exclusive economic zones, ordered repeated  military flyovers over the Greek islands, and undermined NATO sanctions  on Russia and U.S. operations in Syria.   Despite Turkey's aggression, President Biden plans to sell U.S.  fighter jets to Turkey. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for supporting our amendment last week to prevent this sale and  our efforts to deliver justice for Cyprus once and for all.                            ____________________
