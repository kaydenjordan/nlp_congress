 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 150, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 83) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of Labor relating to ``Clarification of Employer's  Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each  Recordable Injury and Illness'', and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 83.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res.  83, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense,  regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. Let  me say that again. America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense  regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions.   They deserve a Federal Government that holds bad actors accountable,  and a government that takes proactive steps to help employers improve  safety protections and prevent injuries and illnesses before they  occur. Just as importantly, they deserve to know that Federal agencies  are following the law.   For years, Republicans have called on OSHA to reject a top-down  approach to worker protections and, instead, collaborate with employers  to identify gaps in safety and address the unique challenges facing  workplaces.   Unfortunately, under the Obama administration, our concerns usually  fell on deaf ears. In fact, one of the administration's parting gifts  to workers and small businesses was a regulatory scheme that reflects  not only a backwards, punitive approach to workplace safety, but one  that is completely unlawful.   Here's why. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers  have long been required to record injuries and illnesses and retain  those records for 5 years. The law explicitly provides a 6-month window  under which OSHA can issue citations to employers who fail to maintain  proper records; 6 months. It is written in the law. This approach helps  ensure workplace hazards are addressed in a timely manner.   However, in 2006, OSHA took action against Volks Constructors for  recordkeeping errors that occurred well beyond what the law allows,  well beyond 6 months. The errors were from nearly 5 years earlier. That  is why a Federal appeals court unanimously rejected OSHA's overreach.  The opinion for the Court stated: ``We do not believe Congress  expressly established a statute of limitations only to implicitly  encourage the Secretary to ignore it.'' Even President Obama's Supreme  Court nominee, Judge Garland, agreed OSHA's action was ``not  reasonable.''   What came next was an outright power grab. OSHA decided to take its  unlawful action one step further. This time it would not only ignore  the law, but rewrite it. The agency finalized the ``Volks'' rule,  unilaterally extending the statute of limitations from 6 months to 5  years. OSHA undertook for itself the power that only this Congress has  to write laws.   The agency created significant regulatory confusion for small  businesses. Many would likely face unwarranted litigation because of  unlawful regulatory policies. Of course, further judicial scrutiny also  means hardworking taxpayers will foot the bill when OSHA is forced to  defend its lawless power grab once again.   Simply put, OSHA had no authority to do this. We have a Constitution  that grants Congress, not Federal agencies, the power to write the law.  But that is not the only reason we are here today. We are also here  because this rule does nothing to improve workplace safety.   Maintaining injury and illness records is vitally important and can  help enhance worker protections. But that is not the goal of this rule.  This rule only serves to punish employers. As we have said repeatedly,  OSHA should, instead, collaborate with employers to help them  understand their legal responsibilities and ensure safe measures are in  place to prevent workplace hazards in the future.   Fortunately, Congress has the authority to reject this failed  approach to workplace safety and block an abuse of executive power that  began under the Obama administration.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I hope we can  all work together to encourage a more proactive approach that prevents  injuries and illnesses from happening in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to read very briefly a quote from the  court's decision: ``We find this statute to be clear and the agency's  interpretation unreasonable in any event''--in any event.    There is no way to rewrite this regulation to comply with the law  that is clear. There is no way for the agency's interpretation to  become reasonable. It is unreasonable according to the court in any  event.   My friend from Virginia talked about the fact that OSHA just updated  the regulation to impose a continuing obligation. OSHA does not have  that authority. Only this Congress has that authority. No agency can  unilaterally decide to change a statutory provision that the court has  said is clear. He said this applies to only a few categories of  employers. It applies to nearly every category of employers that has 10  employees or more. So you could have an employer with 50 employees, and  they are subject to this regulation. This applies to virtually any  employer.   OSHA has 6 months to enforce this law--6 months--from any violation.  Now, why 6 months? Because it is important to investigate these things  quickly and determine whether there has been a violation because things  get lost and people leave their employment. Congress made the decision  for 6 months because that was a period of time in which OSHA could  perform its duties reasonably, and we could get justice the way it  ought to be done.   We can amend OSHA, but we have not chosen to do so. Until this  Congress chooses to change OSHA, the agency has to comply with the  clear wording of the statute as it has been passed by this Congress.  The agency does not have the right to do this. It would be a waste of  taxpayer money and time to force an employer to go challenge this in  court when we already know what the result is going to be. It is not up  to the committee or to the Congress to go back and review an agency  interpretation we know, as a matter of law, is wrong.   So this is a responsible act to take, and I would suggest to the  agency and to my fellow Members of Congress that if we want to  reconsider a statute of limitations we do it on this floor and not in  that agency.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from  [[Page H1423]]  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) who is the chairwoman of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia referred to continuing  violations. There is no provision in this law for continuing  violations.   Looking again at the court's decision. They said this: the statute of  limitation provides that ``no citation may be issued . . . after the  expiration of six months following the occurrence of any violation.''   They go on to say this: ``Like the Supreme Court, we think the word  `occurrence' clearly refers to a discrete antecedent event--something  that `happened' or `came to pass' `in the past.' ''   By any common definition, there was no occurrence; i.e., no discrete  action, event, or incident, no coming about, and no process of  happening within the requisite 6 months. You can't take that wording  and slip into it a continuing violation requirement unless you change  the statute. The agency can't change the statute.   The court, in its decision on the Volks rule, also looked at  something very important, and that is: Why do we require this agency to  do its work in a good period of time?   It says: ``Nothing in this statute suggests Congress sought to endow  this bureaucracy with the power to hold a discrete record-making  violation over employers for years, and then cite the employer long  after the opportunity to actually improve the workplace has passed.''   In other words, we gave the agency 6 months to do its job, and it  should do its job.   Now, other people have looked at this, people who are experts in  workplace safety. I refer you, Mr. Speaker, to a letter that was  written on October 27, 2015, by the American Society of Safety  Engineers, which I include in the Record.                                                 American Society of                                                Safety Engineers,                                   Park Ridge, IL, October 27, 2015.      Re ASSE Comments on OSHA Notice of Proposed Rule           Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make           and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury           and Illness [Docket No: OSHA-2015-0006].       Hon. David Michaels,      Assistant Secretary, Occupational Safety and Health           Administration, OSHA Docket Office, U.S. Department of           Labor, Washington, DC.        Dear Assistant Secretary Michaels: As you well know, the       more than 37,000 member safety, health and environmental       (SH&E) professionals of the American Society of Safety       Engineers (ASSE) intimately know the details of collecting       workplace injury and illness data, recording that data for       employers, and the careful work needed to report that data to       the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).       Perhaps more than any stakeholders, our members understand       the value of this data in managing workplace safety and       health risks as well as its appropriate use by OSHA in       developing better means to focus the agency's resources on       the most difficult risks facing American workers. Our members       use injury and illness data to help them protect workers.       They expect no less of an effective OSHA.        That being said, ASSE cannot support the requirement that       employers have a duty to record an injury or illness       continues for the full duration of the rccord-retention-and-      access period--five years after the end of the  [[Page H1425]]       calendar year in which the injury or illness became       recordable--that OSHA proposes in its July 29, 2015 Notice of       Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) Clarification of Employer's       Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record       of Each Recordable Injury and Illness [Docket No: OSHA-2015-      0006]. ASSE respectfully opposes the adoption of a Final Rule       as proposed in this rulemaking for the reasons that follow.                             nature of violations         ASSE members do not look at the issues raised in this       rulemaking with the same viewpoint of the occupational safety       and health bar that, no doubt, will provide substantive legal       arguments against the case OSHA makes for addressing the       Volks II decision through this rulemaking. Rather, our       members' view is a practical one that comes from years of       experience on the job as the professionals charged with       meeting OSHA's recordkeeping requirements.        Our members know the inadvertent mistakes they themselves       can make in recordkeeping and reporting. They also know what       they typically find when they are hired by a company to help       improve workplace safety and health. As they assess the       workplace's risks and past safety performance to help them       develop safety and health management plans, the reporting       mistakes our members typically find are not very often the       worst cases that, unfortunately, seem to be creating this       rulemaking. The errors in reporting they see are, by far,       minor, isolated, and, if continuing, it is only in the sense       that a typo can be repeated day after day.        They also see mistakes that come from a widespread lack of       understanding of OSHA's detailed reporting requirements. When       seasoned safety and health professionals consistently use       ASSE's educational conferences, our social media, and       opportunities to meet with OSHA staff through the ASSE-OSHA       Alliance to get the best and latest information about OSHA       recordkeeping requirements, we know that, even for them, the       task of meeting those requirements can be too often       confusing. Given that the vast majority of employers report       to OSHA without the help of a safety and health professional,       it is not difficult to see that the significant increase in       records retention that OSHA is attempting to require of       employers here will not succeed in a significant impact on       safety and health among American workers.                           unintended consequences         No reporting error is excusable. But a company's errors to       which OSHA is determined to have access to for a period that       can be up to six years through this rulemaking will not very       often correlate to the risks facing workers, especially the       risks a safety and health professional is trying to address       for the company in the present. The statements OSHA makes       about the value of data collected through current injury and       illness recordkeeping are merely conclusory and are counter       to our members' experience.        Measured against our members' belief that the additional       data will provide little help to them or OSHA, they are       particularly concerned that this rulemaking can only succeed       in driving more employers towards greater expectations that       safety and health professionals will focus energy and       resources on collecting and reporting the lagging indicators       that OSHA requires, taking them away from risk assessment and       management tasks and their efforts to move their employers       towards performance measurements based on leading indicators       that we know can better measure a company's safety and health       performance.        Many of our members, especially those who work in or for       mid-sized and small companies, face a difficult uphill climb       in selling their employers risk management and moving from       lagging to leading indicates. We know OSHA values these       approaches also. But when OSHA uses its limited resources to       focus on measures that do not reflect cutting-edge safety       principles and push our members' efforts backwards, OSHA is       making their job more difficult. Our members value OSHA but       want an OSHA that works with them to advance the best ideas       for advancing workplace safety and health. Requiring this       data to be available for OSHA's use for nearly six years does       not meet our members' hope for an effective OSHA.                                direct burden         ASSE is also concerned that the OSHA's estimates of the       direct burden this rulemaking will place on employers are       inadequate. The economic analysis states that there will not       be a new cost burden. This was based on a 2001 analysis that       it takes 0.38 hour to record an injury or illness, with a       total cost per case of $17.75. From an informal survey of       involved ASSE members, a more realistic estimate is that an       hour is needed for each case over the five-year period,       taking into account the variety of tasks involved, including       determining if there was medical treatment beyond first aid,       verifying lost and restricted day counts, and adjusting for       changes in the status of a case. An updated economic analysis       is needed, which we urge OSHA to conduct before a Final Rule       is proposed.                           a measure of the problem         Related to our members' concern over the rulemaking's       direct burdens on employers is OSHA's failure to discuss in       the NPR why OSHA faces such difficulty in obtaining adequate       data from employers. No doubt, employers are responsible for       meeting OSHA's reporting requirements. Our members suspect       that OSHA's reporting rules and. deadlines are not effective       and cost employers unnecessarily.        Before requiring more extensive reporting, it would be       helpful both to OSHA and the safety and health community to       know more about why employers do not report. How many       employers blatantly disregard the requirements and how many       are simply making errors? What do employers and their workers       not understand about the requirements? What training or level       of expertise would help fill the gaps in reporting that OSHA       believes exist? We urge OSHA to examine these issues as an.       extension of its economic analysis. With more knowledge,       there may be better ways to address recordkeeping that can       support better employer reporting.                                  conclusion         As we say above, our members want a strong and effective       OSHA, But their view of an effective OSHA is an OSHA that can       embrace the best our members already understand about how to       achieve safe and healthy workplaces. An OSHA injury and       illness prevention plan standard that is truly risk-based       would help make OSHA more effective. Greater reliance on       control banding to achieve better protection limits, as we       have recently suggested to OSHA, would. Establishing       professional competencies to define ``competent person'' in       OSHA standards would. Finding a better way to update       consensus standards in OSHA's standards would. Rethinking       OSHA's reporting requirements to help move employers towards       leading indicators and more advanced ways to measure safety       performance certainly would. The areas where OSHA and our       members agree on making OSHA more effective are many. Adding       lengthier reporting burdens that will do little to help OSHA,       employers or occupational safety and health professionals       better manage workplace safety and hcalth will not.        As always, ASSE is more than willing to discuss these       concerns further. Thank you for listening to our members'       views.            Sincerely,                                              Michael Belcher, CSP,                                                         President.     What it says is that this regulation does nothing to  enhance workplace safety. That is from the American Society of Safety  Engineers.   Also opposing this regulation is the Coalition for Workplace Safety.  I include in the Record a letter from them dated February 17 of this  year.                                 Coalition for Workplace Safety,                                                  February 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      Majority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx      Chairwoman, Committee on Education & the Workforce,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bradley Byrne,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Whip       Scalise, Chairwoman Foxx, and Chairman Byrne: The undersigned       groups strongly urge you to introduce and move a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of       disapproval to invalidate the Obama Administration's OSHA       regulation overturning the decision in Volks regarding the       statute of limitations for recordkeeping violations.        At its core, the Volks Rule is an extreme abuse of       authority by a federal agency that will subject millions of       American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,       while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety.       Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend       to five years the explicit six month statute of limitations       on recordkeeping violations in the Occupational Safety and       Health (OSH) Act of 1970. This regulation simultaneously       represents one of the most egregious end runs around       Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to       the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from       exceeding its authority to interpret the law.        In 2012, citing the unambiguous language in the OSH Act,       the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held       that OSHA could not sustain citations against an employer for       alleged recordkeeping violations that occurred more than six       months before the issuance of the citation because, as the       employer asserted, they were outside the six month statute of       limitations set forth in the OSH Act. The court was       unequivocal in its rebuke of OSHA. Judge Janice Rogers Brown       expressed particular concern on the issue of the agency's       overstepping its authority: ``we were rightly troubled by the       notion of being asked by an agency to expand that agency's       enforcement authority when Congress had evidently not seen       fit to do so.'' Judge Merrick Garland, in his concurrence,       plainly rejected OSHA's rationale for issuing the fines,       ``the Secretary's contention--that the regulations that Volks       was cited for violating support a `continuing violation'       theory--is not reasonable.'' The Volks decision has since       been endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision,       issued in December 2016, where the court found ``its       reasoning persuasive.''  [[Page H1426]]         In response to the Court of Appeals ruling, OSHA       promulgated this regulation specifically to negate the Volks       case ruling and extend liability for paperwork violations       beyond the six month window permitted under the Act. OSHA       issued the final rule in the waning days of President Obama's       Administration with an effective date of January 19, 2017.       Although the regulation was issued in December, it was not       submitted to Congress until January 4, meaning that the       window for CRA consideration is for a regulation that has       just been issued, and is therefore shorter than if it was       being considered under the ``reset'' provisions of the CRA.        We urge you to help put a stop to OSHA's abuse of its       authority and support swift passage of a joint resolution of       disapproval for this burdensome, unlawful rule. Because the       final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language       and two U.S. Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be       allowed to stand.        Thank you for your consideration of this request and for       your continued efforts to rein in agency overreach and reduce       the regulatory burden on America's job creators.

To the point, there is nothing in this statute that allows  for continuing violations, and there is nothing in this regulation that  provides for workplace safety. This is a power grab by an agency in  violation of its authorizing statute and by a clear decision of this  circuit court of appeals.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that the experts on this,  the American Society of Safety Engineers, have said that this  regulation does not enhance workplace safety. So if we are about  workplace safety, this regulation isn't it. Let's talk about something  that will help with workplace safety, not something that is a lawless  power grab by a Federal agency.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from  California. He said that, if we pass this resolution, we will be  granting amnesty to bad actors. We are not granting amnesty to bad  actors. They will have no amnesty if OSHA does its job in a timely  fashion. Five years is not timely under anybody's commonsense  definition. They need to do their job within the 6 months that we have  allowed for them to do it, and they have the tools to do their job  within 6 months.   So there is no amnesty being granted here. We are expecting a Federal  agency that has a lot of money and has a lot of power to simply do its  job within 6 months, and they come forward and try to make a new  statute of limitations because they don't do their job within 6 months.   I say to this body, I would say to people outside this body, it is  time for OSHA to get its job done in the time allotted by the United  States Congress and not come running out with some unilateral change in  the statute which they have no power to do because, for some reason,  they don't think they can do it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated February 28,  2017, from the Associated General Contractors of America; a letter  dated February 28, 2017, from Associated Builders and Contractors; a  letter dated February 27, 2017, from the National Association of Home  Builders; and a letter dated February 28, 2017, from the United States  Chamber of Commerce.

Re AGC Key Vote--Support Joint Resolution Disapproving of           ``Volks Rule.''       Hon. Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Associated General       Contractors of America (AGC) and its 26,000 commercial       construction company members, I strongly urge you to support       the Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of       disapproval to stop the Occupational Safety and Health       Administration's (OSHA) expansion of the statute of       limitations for recordkeeping violations in the ``Volks       Rule.'' AGC will score this vote as a key vote for the       education of its members on its congressional candidate       scorecards.        This resolution repeals a rule that was issued by OSHA as a       challenge to the judicial branch and congressional authority.       Section 9 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act       subsection (c) says ``No citation may be issued under this       section after the expiration of six months following the       occurrence of any violation.'' That seems pretty clear and       the courts agreed. In 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the       District of Columbia Circuit held in AKM LLC dba Volks       Constructors v. Secretary of Labor that section 8(c) of the       OSH Act (the section that requires accurate recordkeeping)       does not supersede 9(c) and therefore does not permit a       continuing violation for paperwork errors and that the agency       is overstepping its authority. Additionally, in 2016 the       Fifth Circuit endorsed the Volks decision in Delek Ref. Ltd.       v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission. When OSHA       issued its rule, it deliberately and specifically designed       the rule to counter the ruling in the Volks case. Because the       final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language       and two U.S. Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be       allowed to stand.        The rule is designed to be punitive. It is a regulatory       attempt to expand opportunities to cite companies for       paperwork violations. It was issued in the waning days of the       Obama Administration as an attempt to get around the existing       statute of limitations for recordkeeping violations and       expand that limitation to sixty-six months. It creates no new       recordkeeping requirements. It does not change the data       required under recordkeeping requirements. It does not exempt       smaller companies from this regulation or these       investigations. It does not create any new, safer work       practices. The rule tells OSHA inspectors and company       employees to fix typos from years ago rather than walking the       jobsite, providing safety training or otherwise preventing       tomorrow's accidents. We take worker safety very seriously       and, unfortunately, OSHA's rule would require a colossal       misallocation of resources. That is why we urge you to       support the Congressional Review Act resolution.        Thank you for your consideration of this request.            Sincerely,                                               Jeffrey D. Shoaf,                                          Senior Executive Director,      Government Affairs.                                   ____                                             Associated Builders and                                               Contractors, Inc.,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and       Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade       association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000       chapter members, I am writing to express our strong support       for H.J. Res. 83, introduced by Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.),       which would block implementation of the Occupational Safety       and Health Administration's (OSHA) ``Volks'' final rule. Also       known as Clarification of an Employer's Continuing Obligation       to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable       Injury and Illness, the final rule extends the time period in       which an employer may be cited by OSHA for recordkeeping       violations from six months to up to five years. ABC urges you       to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 83 and will consider this a KEY       VOTE for our 115th Congressional Scorecard.        Currently, the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act       clearly states the statute of limitations for recordkeeping       violations is six months. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals       also unanimously issued a decision holding OSHA could not       issue a citation for a recordkeeping violation beyond the       six-month statute of limitations, and it was later endorsed       by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Delek case. The       Obama administration's final rule not only contradicts the       clear statutory language of the OSH Act, but also two federal       appeals courts.        Nullifying the ``Volks'' rule does not remove an employer's       obligation to record injuries or illnesses. OSHA still has       the right to cite employers for a recordkeeping violation       under the OSH Act. ABC members understand that safety and       health practices are inherently good for business; however,       this rulemaking does nothing to improve workplace safety and       is simply a paperwork burden. OSHA's promulgation of this       rulemaking is a clear overstepping of its authority and a       contradiction of the OSH Act and U.S. Court of Appeals       decisions.        We urge you to SUPPORT H.J. Res. 83 and we thank Rep. Byrne       for introducing this important resolution and look forward to       working with Congress to restore the rule of law.            Sincerely,                                             Kristen Swearingen,                                     Vice President of Legislative &      Political Affairs.                                   ____                                        National Association of Home                                                        Builders,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan:  On behalf of the more than 140,000       members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),       I write in strong support of H.J. Res 83. This important       legislation will disapprove OSHA's Volks Rule, which is       nothing more than a regulatory end run around Congress and       the courts. If this rule is not disapproved, small businesses       will be subject to recordkeeping paperwork violations that do       nothing to improve worker safety. NAHB is designating support       for passage of H.J. Res 83 as a KEY VOTE.        Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend       to five years the explicit six-month statute of limitations       on recordkeeping paperwork violations in the Occupational       Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970. Subsequent court rulings       have affirmed applicability of the six-month statute of       limitations; nonetheless, the Agency proceeded with its       rulemaking. This regulation is an egregious end run around       Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to       the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from       exceeding its authority to interpret the law.        Given the vast overstep the Volks Rule represents, one       might expect significant gains in worker health and safety as       the result. Unfortunately, that is simply not the  [[Page H1430]]       case. The Volks regulation only changes the window during       which OSHA can issue a citation for recordkeeping paperwork       violations. Employers will have the exact same obligation to       record injuries as they always had, and OSHA will have the       exact same opportunity to issue a citation as the statute has       always permitted. The regulation is about paperwork       violations and does nothing to improve worker health and       safety.        NAHB urges you to support H.J. Res 83, and designates a       vote in support of H.J. Res 83 as a KEY VOTE.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III.                                   ____                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.      Re Key Vote Alert!         To the Members of the United States Congress: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports H.J. Res. 83, which would       invalidate the regulation issued by the Occupational Safety       and Health Administration (OSHA) entitled ``Clarification of       an Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an       Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,'' and       will consider including votes related to it in our 2017 How       They Voted scorecard.        The rule would have the effect of extending to five years       the statute of limitations on recordkeeping violations that       the Occupational Safety and Health Act sets at six months. It       was OSHA's attempt to negate a 2012 decision from the D.C.       Circuit Court of Appeals involving a construction company       known as Volks Constructors. The decision blocked OSHA from       sustaining citations for recordkeeping violations that       occurred beyond the six month statute of limitations       specified in the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The       court's unanimous 3-0 ruling included Judge Merrick Garland.        The court unequivocally rebuked OSHA, expressing particular       concern on the agency's overstepping its authority: ``We do       not believe Congress expressly established a statute of       limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to       ignore it . . . The Act clearly renders the citations       untimely, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary relies       on an interpretation that is neither natural nor consistent       with our precedents.'' The Volks decision has since been       endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision, issued       in December 2016, where the court found ``its reasoning       persuasive.''        OSHA's Volks Rule will improperly subject millions of       American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,       while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety. It       simultaneously represents a usurpation of Congress' power to       write the laws and a direct rejection of the judicial       branch's authority to rein in an agency when it exceeds its       authority.        The Chamber urges you to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 83, to       invalidate OSHA's Volks regulation and restore the statute of       limitations for citations enacted by Congress.            Sincerely,                                                       Jack Howard.     All of those groups I just mentioned support the repeal of  this regulation that would come about by virtue of the bill that is  before us. Why? Because we have a right to expect in this country that  these regulatory agencies that Congress sets up will do their job with  the significant sums of taxpayer money that they are provided by this  Congress, the money that comes from the people of America to do their  job in a timely fashion. And this agency comes forth and tries to act  like it doesn't have the money or the authority to investigate  violations and enforce the law within 6 months of a violation. That is  balderdash. The American people have a right to expect more from these  agencies than that.   But more to the point, the reason we are here today is really simple.  We are here today to overturn a rule that is blatantly unlawful. We are  here to put a stop to a rule that does nothing--I repeat nothing--to  improve workplace safety. We are here to put a check on the very top of  executive overreach the Congressional Review Act sought to address.   By blocking this punitive and overreaching rule, we will affirm  Congress' commitment to proactive health and safety policies that help  prevent injuries and illnesses before they occur. If we wait until the  illness or injury has occurred, we have waited too late. OSHA has  waited too late. It is time for OSHA to work with these employers, work  with these people in the workplace to make the workplace safe, not show  up 5 years after the fact when they don't have the authority and say:  now we are going to issue a violation.   Mr. Speaker, the approach that we have demanded of OSHA for years is  to proactively work in the workplace to ensure that it is safe, and we  will continue to do that under this new administration. I urge my  colleagues to overturn OSHA's unlawful power grab.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
