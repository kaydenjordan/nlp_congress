 Madam Speaker, our troops risk their lives and make  sacrifices every day in service to our  [[Page H3181]]  great country. Many have given their lives to defend the freedoms we  take for granted, including my Uncle Roy, who died fighting Nazis in  France during World War II.   Unfortunately, our military has become a victim of the woke agenda.  The Federal Government should focus on strengthening our Armed Forces,  but Democratic leaders lost sight of that a long time ago.   Defense leaders in the Biden administration are now focused on  creating the most diverse military instead of the best military. They  spend time and taxpayer money pandering to those folks because it  scores political points, Madam Speaker. It scores points with the woke  mob, and the world is laughing at us for it.   Military leaders are forcing soldiers to read books on critical race  theory and scheduling drag shows on the bases, of all things.                                time  1215    President Biden requested around $150 million in the defense budget  for diversity and inclusion programs. That is the American people's  money spent on this nonsense, Madam Speaker.   If the Biden administration is so serious about prioritizing so- called equity, then no one should have a problem with my amendment to  the National Defense Authorization Act, which would require anyone who  identifies as a man to register for the Selective Service. If these  folks want to be treated like men, they need to act like men.   I don't support the woke agenda, as you know. I am fully against it,  but if Democrats want to play ball, then let's play some ball. Let's  see what excuses they come up with for opposing this plan that puts  some real responsibility on the folks.   We are all sick of these games. We are sick of the Democrat leaders'  hypocrisy. If they insist on going down this road, they should expect  the responsibility that comes with it, or we could toss the whole woke  agenda in the garbage can where it belongs.                            ____________________
