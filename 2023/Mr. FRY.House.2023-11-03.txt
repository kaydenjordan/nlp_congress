 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate My FM WCRE 93.9 in  Chesterfield County which celebrated its 70th anniversary this year.  [[Page H5395]]    WCRE has brought news, entertainment, and sports to the people of  Chesterfield County and Cheraw for over 70 years.   From broadcasting information through Hurricane Hugo in 1989 to  allowing the Cheraw Police Department to use their radio signal  following the devastating tornado at the Cheraw Primary School in 2004,  WCRE has played a key role in making sure that the people of the PeeDee  in Chesterfield County are always informed during times of crisis.   Their success goes beyond serving in South Carolina's Seventh  District. They have been named South Carolina's Radio Station of the  Year in 2003 and 2007.   Mr. Speaker, I thank WCRE for their commitment to our community. I  wish them many more years of great success.                            ____________________
