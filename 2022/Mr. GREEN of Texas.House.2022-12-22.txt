 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today  because I believe we have a duty, a responsibility, and an obligation  to protect the great and noble American ideals that are the foundation  of this country.   We have a duty to protect what John Adams, the second President,  brought to our attention, that we are a country of laws, not men, and  what Teddy Roosevelt, the 26th President, brought to our attention,  that no one is above the law.   The President has awesome authority. The IRS is under the auspices of  the executive branch. We must put in place laws to assure us that there  are no conflicts of interest being perpetrated by a President who has  control of the agency that is supposed to audit his taxes.   We have a duty, a responsibility, and an obligation. I thank Mr. Neal  for living up to the duty, the responsibility, and the obligation.   I respect my friend on the other side from Texas. We disagree. I wish  him the best. But we have to go on, and the country needs this  legislation. I encourage my colleagues to support it.    And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. And I rise  saddened because I find myself on a mission of mercy. I rise to explain  the circumstance that causes one Mr. Jaime Avalos to find himself  separated from his wife and his baby in another country.   Mr. Avalos came to this country some 27 years ago, and he was brought  here by his mother. His mother was here to seek a better life for  herself and her young baby. He came to this country as a child, and for  7 years he was only in this country. He was being educated in this  country. This was, in fact, the only home that he knew.   His mother decided that she would marry a man whom she met, and this  man loved Mr. Avalos as a baby to the extent that he wanted to adopt  him. The mother took Mr. Avalos--Jaime is his first name--she took  Jaime back to Mexico. She took him to Mexico for the purpose of  registering his adoption.   They were there for a brief period of time, and then they returned to  the United States where he for some 20 years educated himself here. He  went to a school in Houston, Texas. He worked, and he stayed within the  law. For all moral purposes, he is a citizen of this country. But  lawfully, of course, he is not. Jaime met a woman, a beautiful lady,  Yarianna. He and Yarianna are married. They now have a child, Noah.  Noah celebrated his first birthday just recently.   Yarianna, wanting her husband to become a citizen, and Jaime wanting  to become a citizen because he has a child who is an American-born  child and, as a result, a citizen, his wife is a citizen, he wanted to  do that which would put him in good standing in this country, to come  out of the shadows.   He is a DACA recipient, so he had the privilege of staying, but he  did not have a pathway to citizenship. He came at the age of 1 and left  at the age of 7 because his mother took him to Mexico to register his  having been adopted, brought him back to this country, he meets  Yarianna, they are married, and they now have a 1-year-old child.   They lawfully petitioned the consulate in Juarez, Mexico, for the  opportunity to come in for the interview that allows a person with the  standing of Jaime Avalos to ask for a visa lawfully. He is living here  as a DACA recipient, and he only leaves because this is a part of the  process of acquiring the visa.   He goes to Juarez, Mexico, and at the consulate, they process him. In  the course of processing him, they discovered that he did come to  Mexico at the age of 7 with his mom. He has little to no recollection  of this, but they discover it. When they discover that he came to  Mexico, left America with his mom, they then point out to him that  there is a law that will not allow him to return to his 1-year-old son,  Noah, and to his wife.   He is now banned from the United States of America for 10 years.   Some things bear repeating. His wife is here. He is banned from the  country for 10 years. He is banned from his home, and he cannot return  to his work. He is literally living in a country that he knows very  little about. When he leaves the place in which he is residing, he is  always in the company of someone who can assist him.   Understanding his circumstance, I decided to travel to Juarez,  Mexico, to visit him. I did. I was there, I met with him, and I had an  opportunity to have his wife and his child with us. I saw him interact  with his young son. It really does cause tears to well in one's eyes to  see a baby grasping for his father, hugging his father, holding on to  his father, and loving his father and the father reciprocating.   It was a wonderful thing to see, but I was saddened upon looking at  it because I knew that at some point we would leave--the wife would  leave, the baby would leave, and I would leave--and Mr. Avalos would be  left in Mexico.   The experience has caused me to conclude that I must do anything and  everything that I can to unite this family--reunite this family. This  is unbelievable that we have a law that will not allow him to come back  into the country merely because his mother took him out of this country  as a DACA recipient--he is a DACA recipient now. She took him out of  the country in order to register him as having been adopted. A man  loves him. He adopts him as a 7-year-old child, and this law will not  allow him back into the country.   There is something wrong when we have laws that will ban husbands  from their wives and from their babies because they left the country,  came back, and have always been law-abiding. There is something wrong.   When we talk about comprehensive immigration reform, we don't talk  about the Jaimes of the world, people who are entrapped in these arcane  laws, these laws that only make sense to those who somehow conclude  that if we could find any way to bar a person or ban a person from  coming into the country that is a great thing to do. I am not one of  those people. I don't want to see this happen to this man, this baby,  and this woman.  [[Page H10041]]    We have a necessity to engage in comprehensive immigration reform and  to engage in immigration reform that goes beyond the walls at the  border. I am amenable to discussing walls at the border, but we have to  go beyond walls. There are those who want to do more at the border. I  understand. I am amenable to having that conversation.                                time  1630    We also have to talk about the other aspects of comprehensive  immigration reform that will include Jaime Avalos and the many others  who find themselves in similar circumstances.   It is a very painful thing to know that we have within our power to  bring Jaime home or to allow him to come home, yet we have not done it.   You see, there is another aspect of this law that allows a person who  has the circumstance that Jaime Avalos has to negotiate to be returned  home on what is called humanitarian parole.   This is where you make your appeal. You make your appeal to our  country. You make your appeal, and you explain that this is going to  create a hardship.   Our law allows for this appeal to be granted--it is discretionary--if  we conclude that there would be a hardship by virtue of a person such  as Mr. Avalos being separated from his wife and baby.   Well, it is intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer that  there will be a hardship when a husband is separated from a wife and  child, when they have a mortgage, and when he is the breadwinner for  the family. Yes, there is a hardship.   We have made our appeal. I am making the appeal tonight because I  want the world to know, and I want my record to show, that I left no  stone unturned when it comes to trying to get this family reunited.   I am making the appeal tonight, and I will be sending a letter to the  Secretary of Homeland Security asking for the Secretary, by and through  his good offices, to use his awesome power that has within it the  discretion to grant Mr. Avalos, to grant Jaime, the opportunity to  return home to his wife and baby. It is within the Secretary's  discretion.   Now, the Secretary doesn't handle all of these cases himself. There  are people in the office who acquire the materials, review the cases.   I am asking for the people who understand this and who know that this  is not a case where a foreign power has one of our own and is refusing  to release one of our own. This is not the case. He is not being held  by a foreign power. This is not the case. If he is granted the right to  return, he won't need transportation. He can get here.   We are not looking at having to get him through harm's way with some  form of transportation that would necessitate the Federal Government  having to make an expenditure.   This is not the case where if he comes to this country, returns home,  where he will need assistance. He won't need food from the government.  He won't need the shelter of the government. He won't need to be  clothed by the government. He can provide his own food, clothing, and  shelter, as well as his transportation.   He only has to be given a document that says he can return to the  country that he has lived in for more than a quarter of a century, the  country that he knows as home, where his wife resides, where his child  lives, where he was living.   He only needs a document that is within our discretion--``our,''  meaning our country--to allow him to return to the life that he has  known in this country for more than a quarter of a century.   I believe that we can all, at some point, put ourselves in the shoes  of another person. I believe that if we say to ourselves: What would we  want if this were your son or your daughter?   There are times when we ought to examine circumstances from a  personal perspective. This is not a criminal. This is a law-abiding  person who has a baby and wife in this country.   What would you want? What would you want for your son were the  circumstances similar?   There will be those who say, well, he came to this country illegally.  Well, let's examine this. Did he really come, or was he brought to the  country?   He was approximately 1 year old. As a 1-year-old child, he had little  to say--and I think most persons would agree--about where his parents  would take him.   He wasn't brought here by some third party, some person who was paid  to bring him in. His mother brought him to this country.   There are those who would say, well, his mother was not right for  bringing him. She broke the law.   I thank God that I have not always been as blessed as I am today  because it inculcated in me a sense of caring, a belief and an  understanding that I haven't always had what I have now and that, but  for the grace of God, but for the grace of God, I wouldn't have what I  have now.   I am not who I am because I am so smart. Most of the people here are  not here because they are so smart. Most of the people are here because  somewhere along life's way, they were afforded what we would call a  break. It happens.   But for the grace of God, I am not sure I would be here, but I thank  God I was born in this country. I love this country.   I am not a guy who puts the country down, doesn't salute the flag,  won't sing the national anthem, and doesn't say the Pledge of  Allegiance. That is not me, but I do defend those who choose not to  pledge allegiance, who choose not to sing the national anthem.   I think that is what makes this country great. Every person has the  right. Every person has the right to choose. I choose to do these  things.   I also understand that I am fortunate. I didn't control where I was  born. I understand that if my mother had been born on the other side of  this southern border, I believe that my mother would do everything that  she could to get to this country so that her young child could have  opportunities and not be in fear of harm from various and sundry  circumstances that are occurring across the border, on the other side.   But for the grace of God, it could be me or you or any of us, and I  am thankful that I have been granted this sense of understanding the  plight of others.   I am not a guy who says that we ought to open the borders and bring  everybody that wants to come into the country into the country. That is  not me.    I think that we ought to have comprehensive immigration reform so  that we can make decisions about immigrants and migrants, people who  simply want to come to work and people who want to come to make a life  here.   We ought to do this. This is what comprehensive immigration reform  should be all about.   Yes, we ought to talk about what is happening at the border. I am not  shying away from that. But I do believe that we ought to talk about  some other things that are exceedingly important.   I want to talk about what we are going to do with the Jaimes of the  world. I think that we have to have comprehensive immigration reform  because we need to know who is going in and out of the country. We  ought to know who is coming into and going out of our country.   I am not one of the persons who believes that we just ought to have  an open border, to come and go as you please. That is just not me, but,  look, I respect the opinions of those who do believe it.   I think that we ought to have comprehensive immigration reform so  that we can establish standards, policies, procedures, methodologies,  so that we can have all the things that would make it acceptable for  those who qualify to come. Those who do not? Well, they can't make it  this time if they don't.   So, I am not an open borders guy, but I am a person who has great  sympathy and empathy for people who are not as fortunate as I happen to  be.   As a result, I am making this appeal for Mr. Avalos, Jaime Avalos. I  think that we don't have to wait until we get comprehensive immigration  reform to allow him to return to his wife and baby.   I don't think we have to wait. I believe we can do this under the  discretion that is accorded the Secretary under the law.   I believe that comprehensive immigration reform is something that we  ought to work on immediately, if not sooner. I think that we can see a  need, but there are other needs that we don't  [[Page H10042]]  see. They are not as visible. Mr. Avalos happens to be one of the  persons who is in that invisible zone and won't be seen, won't be heard  of, just suffer.   We in this country think that families ought to stay together. We  encourage families to stay together. Yet, we find ourselves now with a  baby being separated from his father while we have the authority to  change it, knowing that he is not in the hands of a hostile power.   He is in the hands of people in this country who, with the stroke of  a pen, can make a difference in the life of a law-abiding person who  stayed in this country for more than two decades, more than a quarter  of a century, and left lawfully but cannot lawfully return.   He left lawfully because he went to the consulate that I visited, by  the way, in Juarez, Mexico. People at the consulate are not proud of  the decision that they had to make to tell him that he can't return to  his baby, his child.   They are not proud. They genuinely believe that this is something  that is going to be reviewed, hopefully, and that maybe we will get a  different circumstance.   I believe we can get a different circumstance. I just hope that it  won't take us until we finally pass comprehensive immigration reform to  have it occur.                                time  1645    I am honored to speak on behalf of Mr. Avalos, and I pray that we can  get a Christmas miracle that he can come home for Christmas to his  family. I am begging. I am pleading with the Department of Homeland  Security and the Secretary to please let him come home to his family.  Let him come home and spend this special time of the year with his baby  and his wife. Please, let him come home.   Mr. Speaker, I have introduced legislation that can help those who  find themselves similarly situated in the future, but that is not going  to help him. The chances of our passing legislation between now and the  end of the year are not good at all--not good. This has nothing to do  with the mindset of a given person or personalities or the political  philosophy of any given party. It has nothing to do with that.   It is just at this point in time very few things are going to pass  this House. This is not casting any aspersions or any sort of  negativity toward any other persons. It is just the facts. But I do  believe that this discretionary act can make a difference.   I will talk to Mr. Avalos, I will talk to his wife, and I will talk  to them within the next day or so. It is my hope to those who may be  listening and can speak to the Secretary--it is my hope that the  Secretary and those who are listening, that we can have this Christmas  miracle, and that I can give them some good news. I can say to them, He  will be home for Christmas.   Christmas is a holiday that he respects, that he celebrates. This is  a family that celebrates Christmas. I want to give them some good news.   Mr. Speaker, I want to mention one additional thing before I leave  this Chamber. It will probably be my last time to speak this year. I  will mention a piece of legislation that I will be introducing next  year, this too is very near and dear to my heart.   I don't expect everybody to understand this piece of legislation, but  it is pretty important to me and pretty important to a lot of other  people. And for many people who are not aware of the circumstance, it  is pretty important to them, too.   In my research, we discovered that this House of Representatives on  July 18, 1956, accorded Congressional Gold Medals to Confederate  soldiers.   We live in a country where we revile the slaves, those who were  enslaved, my ancestors. We reviled my ancestors who were enslaved, and  we revere, by virtue of our actions--that is some proof of it, there is  much more--but we revere those who were the enslavers. Revile the  enslaved and revere the enslaver.   I refuse to accept it. There is something in the way I have been  wired that just won't allow me to accept certain things. This is a  wrong that has to be corrected.   When I say, ``revile the enslaved,'' let's examine that statement,  the statement of reviling the enslaved.   What does it mean to be enslaved?   What did it mean to be enslaved in this country?   It is almost a word for polite society to say enslaved because the  truth of the matter is for this to occur someone was kidnapped,  stolen--stolen from their homeland. By the way, a good many of them  were sold into slavery by people from their own land--a good many.   We cannot cheat history; we can't overlook certain facts because they  are uncomfortable. I don't feel good knowing that people of African  origin sold other people of African origin into slavery, but it is the  truth--the undeniable truth. I have to accept the truth.   I just pray that others will accept the fact that there were many  that were kidnapped, put on a ship, and then brought across the vast  ocean. But it wasn't just that simple. It is easy to say those words,  but those words, when properly amended, would include those who didn't  make it across the ocean, those who were thrown over to the shark- infested waters.   Sharks would follow ships waiting for bodies to be thrown over to  feast upon. Just to say that they traversed the ocean doesn't include  how they were shackled and chained, treated like lumber, treated like  just another piece of property to be brought from point A to point B.   Just to say they were brought to this country does not acknowledge  that along the way women were raped, along the way they were dropped  off at various ports, and that at some point they were sold, families  were separated. To just say they were brought here or kidnapped doesn't  speak to how many were brutalized.   Yet, they were brought here, forced into labor, and they served this  country for centuries.   Here is a fact that ought to cause somebody to pause. We enslaved  babies in this country. We enslaved babies. If you were born of parents  that were slaves, then you were a slave at birth. Many were born,  lived, and died, human beings, as slaves.   It is just not enough to say they were slaves without explaining  their circumstance--forced into labor, forced to do unthinkable things.  It was their humble hands that helped to facilitate the construction of  the Capitol, the White House, roads and bridges, planted the seeds,  perfected the harvest. Literally, in some cases, fed the masters. Yet,  they are reviled, and the Confederate soldiers are revered.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask this House to correct the injustice to  the extent that the injustice can be corrected. If we accord  Congressional Gold Medals to the Confederate soldiers, then we can  accord Congressional Gold Medals to those who were enslaved.   I believe that there is a certain amount of righteousness in this  House. I have been told that it will never happen, but I believe there  is a certain amount of righteous in this House for people to see the  injustice in this. I just believe that there are people who will take a  stand with me. I don't know how many, but I hope that we will have 290  because that is what it will take to pass this type of resolution. I  hope that the Senate will take it up. I hope that the Senate will pass  the resolution as well.   I would like to see a President of the United States place these  Congressional Gold Medals in appropriate venues.   We have granted Congressional Gold Medals posthumously--yes, we have.  There is nothing but the will that is missing. The way is clearly  there. It is just a question of will.   The question of: Will we revere the slave to the extent that we  revere the enslavers?   I believe there is a certain amount of righteousness that will allow  this to happen. I don't believe that everybody that we assume will vote  or not participate in a positive way in this type of debate--I don't  believe that we should assume that everybody that we already assume  will do this. I just think that there are some people, they have  principle within that we have not necessarily seen, and that they will  stand forward and that they will challenge those who would see things  differently and conclude, no, we can't do this.   Why? We can.   So I just believe that there are people of good will who will take a  stand for  [[Page H10043]]  the righteousness associated with giving those who worked, lived, and  died as slaves, giving them a Congressional Gold Medal just as we gave  the persons who sought to keep them in bondage Congressional Gold  Medals.   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for this next year. I have already  prepared the ``Dear Colleague.'' I have within my hands the ``Dear  Colleague'' that we will be circulating. There will be some people who  will be offended because I have said that the Confederate soldiers were  enslavers. Well, they fought to maintain slavery.   Now, I know there are many who are going to say they were fighting  for economic reasons. Well, that economic reason had to do with  slavery. But whatever you choose to think, put that aside, if you  would, and just look at what happened to the people. Let's try to  correct this injustice.   I will be circulating the ``Dear Colleague,'' and I will let the  world know the progress that we are making. This is the kind of thing  that you don't simply put in motion and then see if it will make its  way to the finish line. I am not wired that way to just watch and see  what happens.   I plan to announce the names of those who have signed on. Those who  sign on, I plan to announce their name and I plan to thank them for  signing on, thank them for doing a righteous thing hundreds of years  after the event that occurred.                                time  1700    I will keep a log, and I will let the world know who is signing on to  the legislation. I just believe that we need this kind of transparency.   By the way, it won't surprise me to know that there will be people  who won't sign on, but I just believe that there are enough who will  such that this can move.   My hope is that those who will have an antithetical view as it  relates to this, who may be of the same hue as I--yes, there are some  people who look like me who will have an antithetical point of view  because there are some who are going to say, keep the medal, give us  the gold. They will make this an issue associated with reparations and  they will say, let's go for the reparations.   I am going for dignity. I want respect. Gold can't buy it. I am not  opposed to those efforts, but I would hope that they wouldn't be  opposed to these efforts. But I am addressing it now because I want  people to understand that that will not deter me.   I believe that we have a duty to the people that helped this country  become the great country it is. I call them the foundational mothers  and fathers of the country; those who were enslaved, the economic  foundational mothers and fathers because they helped to build the  economy. They gave us the start that we benefit from to this day.   So to those who would say let's just go for the gold, you do what you  choose. I am not getting in your way. But this is about dignity, and  this is about Maya Angelou's commentary that some of us, she said, we  are the hope and dream of the slave.   They never had what I have; but I have what I have because they  survived and suffered such that my parents and my grandparents and  those that I associate with my lineage, produced me.   Mr. Speaker, as I close tonight, perhaps for the last time this year,  as a Special Order, I want to express my gratitude, not only to those  in this House who have shown me kindness and have been of great  benefit, but I want to express my gratitude beyond the walls of the  Capitol buildings.   I want to express my gratitude to a country that has noble ideals,  noble ideals. I am grateful to live in this country. I am proud to wear  this necktie. I love this country. I love it because I believe that we  can make real these noble ideals of liberty and justice for all; that  we have, as Lincoln put it, government of the people, by the people,  for the people. But we have to protect it.   I believe that all persons are truly created equal, and endowed by  the Creator with these inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   I love my country, I just want to make my country--help my country  live up to these great ideals and, among them, as I thank the country  itself and the people within it, among these great things that we can  do would include honoring those persons who were brought here in  chains, the foundational mothers and fathers, economic foundational,  foundational economic mothers and fathers of this country, and babies,  I might add as well.   This is my last opportunity to speak this year, but I will be back,  if it is God's will. When I come back, I am humble, but I am not the  person who is going to be so humble as to walk away from my duty. That  is not me. I am not wired that way.   I will be back, and I will have these two--no, I am praying that Mr.  Avalos will be home with his family and I will be presenting this piece  of legislation for us to correct a centuries-old injustice.   Thank you, Madam Speaker Pelosi, for all you have done.   Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. You have been a great help.   Thank you, Mr. Clyburn, for the sage advice you have accorded.   All of the persons in leadership I thank. The newly formed leadership  that is coming in, I appreciate and will celebrate and work with you.   But I also plan to appreciate and celebrate and work with persons  across the aisle. I believe in compromise. I abhor capitulation. I  don't want persons to capitulate as it relates to me and what I  present; and I trust that they don't want me to capitulate as it  relates to them and what they present.   I think cooperation and a certain degree of negotiation will allows  us to get some great things done. So I look forward to working with  all.   I am grateful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
