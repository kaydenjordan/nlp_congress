 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It prioritizes national security  at TSA. I have concerns about the underlying bill, including its  expansion of collective bargaining that could put our national security  at risk by subjecting new procedures or requirements imposed by the  Administrator of the TSA to collective bargaining.   This amendment, like I said, is simple. It would just clarify that  the Administrator of TSA is not limited in his or her ability to  swiftly respond to national security and/or public safety threats under  this bill.   Specifically, the amendment ensures that any procedures or  requirements shall not be constrained by collective bargaining. The  very nature of airport security requires that TSA remain agile and  flexible to new and emerging threats. It is for this very reason that  Congress exempted TSA from title 5 when it stood up the agency just two  months after the terrorist attacks on 9/11.   It is imperative that the Administrator continues to have the  authority to swiftly make these changes to ensure public safety in  response to national security threats and risks. Now, this amendment  would ensure that the Administrator does not have to negotiate with  union representatives whenever changes would impact the TSA workforce  regardless of the national security implications. It adds language that  specifically preserves the Administrator's authority and exempts  changes to security screening procedures from collective bargaining.   We all are exceptionally grateful and appreciative for the work that  our TSA officers do and the national security service that they  provide, which is exactly why we need this amendment to ensure our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this clarifying amendment to ensure that national security  threats are addressed immediately at TSA, their prime mission, and not  let collective bargaining get in the way of our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Mississippi (Mr. Guest).                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the commentary from my colleague and friend,  Representative Guest from Mississippi. What is the harm of this  amendment if what you say is true? If you believe that it is currently  in place, why is the majority opposed to codifying it to ensure that  national security remains the top priority?   It seems very simple to me. This is a simple amendment. This is not a  partisan amendment. This should be an American, bipartisan amendment  that we can all agree that national security comes first. That is the  role of TSA.   My question and statement as I close is: Why not codify it? Why not  accept this amendment?   I just feel that sometimes we are so hyperpartisan in this Chamber  that we can't see the forest for the trees.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support and adopt  this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
