 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4738, the COVID-19  American History Project Act. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Julia  Letlow of Louisiana, for championing this important legislation.   When the COVID-19 pandemic reached our shores, our lives were all  impacted. Some of these changes were temporary, and some of them were  permanent.   Congresswoman Letlow continues to live every day with the impact this  pandemic has had on her family, and I am inspired by her courage and  willingness to share her story. Unfortunately, her story is not  entirely unique, and many families across this Nation have been forced  to say good-bye to a loved one far too soon.   Their lives and memories deserve to be recorded, collected, and  preserved so that this unprecedented pandemic is accurately understood  by historians, students, and Americans from all walks of life.   Over the last 2 years, we have all felt fear of the unknown. In a lot  of ways, when the pandemic hit, our Nation was caught off guard. This  project will help ensure future generations can learn from the trials  we have overcome and the triumphs we have been able to achieve.   The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress is the  largest and most extensive library in human history, and I can think of  no better place to house the personal histories, testimonies, written  materials, and photographs of Americans whose lives were lost, those  who bravely stood on the front lines, and also all those who  demonstrated the American spirit through innovation, resilience, and  compassion.   As Congresswoman Letlow has expressed, this project is about  providing healing and hope for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to my  colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, against my better  judgment, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Louisiana (Ms. Letlow), the sponsor  of this piece of legislation and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have been in this  institution now and had the privilege to serve here for over 9\1/2\  years. And that was, by far, one of the most inspiring personal stories  that I have had a chance to witness.   I can tell you, based upon what I learned about Luke Letlow from my  colleagues like Garret Graves and   Steve Scalise and Clay Higgins and  others, was that Luke Letlow was so excited to be a part of what we  sometimes take for granted here in the House.   I was a former staff member just like Mr. Letlow was, but his runoff  election was right at the time between orientation, where I would have  had a chance to meet him, and a chance for him to be sworn in. And that  is when the tragedy that Congresswoman Letlow talked about her family  facing took place.   Luke Letlow didn't get a chance to raise his right hand and be a part  of this House, but his legacy will live on forever as part of this oral  history project.   I cannot think of a better way for a mother to be able to give her  children, in honor of their dad and her husband, the legacy that he  deserves than by passing this bill tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone in this institution to vote ``yes'' to  preserve the legacy of not only Luke Letlow but of those whose families  have been impacted the exact same way as the Letlow family by this  pandemic.   Let's move beyond this pandemic but let us never forget. Let us  remember our heroes, and let us remember those families, and let us  remember how great our country is to be able to move beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3294. As all Members of  Congress and every American who has visited the United States Capitol  when it was completely open know, the Halls of this foothold of  democracy are lined with statues to honor and commemorate the lives of  great Americans from all corners of this country, all walks of life,  and different political leanings.   The National Statuary Hall collection includes two statues donated  from each State, and in addition to the base collection, Congress has  been able to accept donations or authorize the commission of statues of  other individuals who have shaped our Nation and contributed to the  excellence of this country.   Such additions have included the statue of Abraham Lincoln,  commissioned by Congress in 1866, the portrait monument to Lucretia  Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony in 1920, and most  recently, the statue of Rosa Parks, which was officially unveiled in  2013. It is among these giants that today we consider the addition of  the first two women confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court of the  United States.   It took nearly 200 years after the creation of the Supreme Court for  the first woman to sit on America's highest bench. Appointed by  President Reagan and confirmed by the Senate in 1981, with a vote of  99-0, a record for the most votes in support of a Supreme Court Justice  that stands to this day, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor blazed a  trail that has forever changed the Court for the better.   In the years that have followed, the Senate has confirmed Associate  Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom this bill also honors, Sonia  Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and, most recently, Justice Amy Coney Barrett.  I have no doubt that the legacy of women on the Court will continue.   The art collections throughout the Capitol Grounds play a very  important role. The pieces honor the ingenuity, courage, creativity,  and patriotism of so many who came before us. They inspire us and  remind us of the extreme weight and honor of our duties as elected  representatives. Congress rarely commissions the addition of statues to  its collections, a practice that signifies a rare and high honor. The  addition of the first two female Justices to serve on the Supreme Court  is welcomed, and I look forward to their presence in these great Halls.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't point out a bit of irony  that exists as we discuss honoring anyone by adding a statue or a bust  to the Halls of the Capitol when for the past 745 days this building  has been closed to the American people. Despite what is being called a  reopening, it continues to be closed to most Americans.                                time  1815    This is about the last place in America to remain closed, and for no  legitimate reason whatsoever. The honor of being memorialized in the  Halls of Congress is far less an honor when no one is around to see it.   It is past time for Speaker Pelosi to reopen the people's House to  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   One of the things I most appreciate about this bill is the balance  that it brings in recognizing the first two women Justices of the  Supreme Court, and they have very different ideologies and views. While  I may have significant disagreements with Justice Ginsburg and her  rulings and positions on certain issues, that doesn't mean her role in  the history of this country is not worthy of being recognized. In the  same way, Justice O'Connor is worthy of recognition despite the fact  that I am sure many people on the other side of the aisle take issue  with her beliefs and positions on certain issues.   Cancel culture is a disease infecting our society today. Those who  seek to wipe out the accomplishments and contributions of historic  figures simply due to opposing politics is wrong. I am certainly not  going to engage in that kind of mentality even though I may not have  cared for Justice Ginsburg's politics.   In fact, Justice Ginsburg herself spoke out against cancel culture.  She was once asked how she could be friends with the late Justice  Antonin Scalia. They held vastly different views. In her response, she  quoted Justice Scalia by saying: ``I attack ideas. I don't attack  people, and some very good people have some very bad ideas.''   She is also famously quoted as saying: ``Fight for the things you  care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.''   In short, Mr. Speaker, it is okay to fight for what you believe in.  It is okay to disagree or even despise what someone else believes, but  it doesn't mean they don't have a right to those beliefs.    Unfortunately, this contrasts with some of the actions of my friends  on the other side of the aisle these past few years. I hope this serves  as an example that we can disagree without being disagreeable, that we  choose to rise above being easily offended and instead respect  alternative points of view, and that the Halls of Congress are a place  where everyone feels their viewpoints and beliefs are given equal  credence.   Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the balance of this bill. I rise in  support of this legislation. I urge everyone to adopt it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
