 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  principal leadership on this issue for so many years. He is a great  model to us all.   Mr. Speaker, we in the Pro-Life Caucus are happy to join the March  for Life tomorrow here in the Nation's capital, but we are here today  to acknowledge the tragic anniversary of Roe v. Wade.   As has been said, more than 63 million unborn children have been  denied their right to life in the past 49 years since that tragic  decision was handed down.   As we fight to protect the liberties of all Americans here in  Congress, we have to remember to fight first for the most defenseless,  and that is the child in the womb, who from the moment of conception is  a unique human being with unique DNA.   In the coming months you are going to hear a lot of vague and  euphemistic language from defenders of abortion. Do not be swayed. The  truth is very simple, and it has never changed. Abortion takes a baby's  life, a person made in God's image.   We hope, we pray, we believe that 2022 is the year the Supreme Court  will finally recognize this truth once again.
