 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6382, the  Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act.   Small businesses are the heart of American enterprise, and we must  ensure a level playing field for all of them to compete for Federal  contracts. My legislation is the first step to addressing the many  concerns of the small business community regarding the current  administration's efforts to expand the use of category management.   Although category management has been billed as the procurement  strategy that can get Federal agencies the lowest price, the actual  numbers tell a very different story. In fact, the data shows us that  small business vendors on the Multiple Award Schedule continually  provided agencies with lower prices than those offered by category  management contract holders.   However, due to the changes under this administration, many Federal  agencies and contracting officers can no longer take advantage of  increased competition and lower prices because some category management  vehicles are the only option available.   Unfortunately, the current trend of this administration is to  increase the number of agencies heading in this misguided direction.  This will result in wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars because a  reduction of competing vendors means Federal agencies will pay more  than necessary for goods and services.   Furthermore, the harmful effect of the use of the category management  business model could mean further exclusion of minorities, women,  veterans, and other already disadvantaged small business owners in the  Federal marketplace.   My bill requires the Small Business Administration to include in  their annual report information on best-in-class contractors, which are  the companies that largely benefit from category management.   This bill would also provide lawmakers with information on whether  category management is reducing the role of small firms, women-owned  firms, minority-owned companies, and veteran-owned enterprises in  Federal contracting.   I am also proud to say that my bill is endorsed by the National  Defense Industrial Association, an association whose 1,600 corporate  members and over 85,000 individual members are 70 percent small  business. NDIA works to help small companies grow and remain a strong  part of the defense industrial base.   The ability for Congress to see this data allows us to determine the  effectiveness of such contracting vehicles for small firms and to make  needed changes where appropriate.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. I thank very  much our chairman and our ranking member for their support.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act.   As the world's leader for innovation and entrepreneurship, the United  States has historically been a breeding ground for the best ideas and  creative approaches that improve our quality of life and solve some of  the world's most complex problems. However, currently, women, people of  color, and low-income communities hold significantly fewer patents than  other demographics. A recent study even showed that children born to  parents in the top 1 percent of income are 10 times more likely to  become an innovator and hold a patent than those born into low-income  families. Innovation should not be a skill set only available to the  superrich or those with the most resources.   The SUCCESS Act is an important first step to better understanding  why the patent gaps exist. It will take a collective effort to create a  more equitable system. With data collected via the SUCCESS Act, timely  research and the number of programs across the Nation addressing  underrepresentation, the Federal Government can better promote policies  that increase the opportunity for those underrepresented groups to  successfully qualify.   I strongly believe that it is our duty to ensure that all people have  an equal opportunity to compete for patents and participate in the  innovation economy. The future of American innovation is diverse, and  the SUCCESS Act will help us begin to close the gap in patenting and  ensure that all innovators, creatives, and patent seekers have a seat  at the table.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.
