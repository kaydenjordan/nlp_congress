 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Texas  Christian University's men's basketball team on their National  Invitational Tournament championship.   After a 12-win season last year, the Horned Frogs showed the grit and  tenacity my hometown of Fort Worth is known for. They finished the  season with 24 wins.   With their win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in the title game  last week, the Horned Frogs capped off a memorable and historic  comeback season. In fact, this 2017 NIT title is Texas Christian  University's first postseason championship in school history.   I want to recognize the TCU players and coaches for a job well done.  Go Frogs.                            ____________________
