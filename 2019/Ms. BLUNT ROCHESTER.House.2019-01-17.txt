 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 800,000  Federal workers and millions of Americans who have been negatively  impacted by President Trump's shutdown. Like many of you, hundreds of  my constituents have written into my office to share how the shutdown  is impacting them.   One of my constituents in Bear, Delaware, is an air traffic  controller at the Philadelphia International Airport. He has been  working without pay to ensure travelers can travel and continue living  their lives during this shutdown, something he is struggling to do  himself.   He shared how the shutdown is placing immense financial strain on his  family and the needs of his child, who has a disability, that the  stress of not receiving a paycheck and not knowing when the next will  come is too much.   Our constituents deserve better. We are on day 27 of this  unprecedented shutdown. Democrats have already voted eight times to  reopen the Federal Government, and yet, still, we wait on the Senate  Republicans to act.   This shutdown is unprecedented, but we have an opportunity to set a  new precedent, a positive one, where we work together on comprehensive  immigration reform and border security.   First, let's open the government.                            ____________________
