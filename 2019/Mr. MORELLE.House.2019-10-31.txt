 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res.  660.   Madam Speaker, I am deeply troubled that this process has become  necessary at all, but we have no choice. We must continue to  investigate alarming allegations of misconduct by the President, and we  continue with a public process through which all Americans will have  the ability to access and to assess the evidence.   This has been and will continue to be a fair and sober inquiry.  Members on both sides will continue to have the opportunity to question  witnesses, seek evidence, and refute testimony presented during these  proceedings. Indeed, the President will have strong protections as we  weigh the evidence during our deliberations.   Our only goal is uncovering the truth: Did the President pressure  Ukrainian leaders with the threat of withholding critical military  assistance in order to serve his political interests? Has the President  endangered American interests abroad by engaging in domestic political  intrigue? These are serious issues, not of politics, but of national  security.   This inquiry is our solemn obligation, but it is our obligation,  nonetheless.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution so we may uphold our oath to the Constitution and preserve a  transparent process on behalf of our Republic and the citizens it  serves.
