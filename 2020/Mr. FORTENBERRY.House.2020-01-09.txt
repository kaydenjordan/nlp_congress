 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Boyle.   Frankly, it is my honor and privilege to join the Pennsylvania  delegation as they honor their friend and mine, Congressman Mike  Fitzpatrick.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Boyle would appreciate this. I had never  heard of Bucks County until I came to Congress, but I learned of it  quickly because of a young Congressman named Mike Fitzpatrick, who  consistently talked about his home, his relationship with the people  whom he served, whom he loved, whom he was devoted to.   The gentleman gave some beautiful, generous comments about the nature  of his character: He was devoted to his family; he was a man of high  principle; he was personable. I think it is important to point out as  well: The gentleman is a Democrat; he was a Republican; I am a  Republican. And here we are, talking about things that actually unite  us because of the character of people, good Americans like Mike  Fitzpatrick, who looked for a way to be in authentic dialogue--while  standing on his principles. He was a fighter, as well, but looked for a  way to be in authentic dialogue, even with people he might have a  disagreement with.   He was my friend. I remember in that corner back there, we had a very  intimate conversation one day of how he was facing a true dilemma  because there was a vote that was about to be taken, for which he said,  ``This may cost me my election.'' He took that vote anyway, and it did  cost him the election, but then he came back and joined us again.   Mr. Speaker, let me join with Congressman Boyle and the entire  Pennsylvania delegation in expressing my condolences to Kathleen and  his six kids, whom he talked about and whom we got to know as well.   Being from Nebraska, again, I am a long way from Bucks County, but  learned a great deal about the gentleman's home and, of course, the  deep character and the place that formed this wonderful public servant,  Mike Fitzpatrick.
