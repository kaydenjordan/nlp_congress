 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my bipartisan amendment, which  would help provide critical protections for all Americans and their  right to due process under the Constitution.   My amendment would prohibit the use of funds for the Department of  Justice to implement its adoptive seizures policy. These forfeiture  adoptions provide a loophole that helps law enforcement evade stricter  laws governing civil asset forfeiture by seizing property and  transferring it to Federal authorities in exchange for up to 80 percent  of future proceeds.                                time  1330    Now, while I support law enforcement and oppose the ridiculous idea  to defund law enforcement, for many years I have worked in a bipartisan  way to highlight civil asset forfeiture abuses and call for reform to  the practice. And I thank my colleagues, Representatives Raskin, Amash,  Rush, Gabbard, and McClintock, for joining me on this bipartisan effort  today.   The Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund contains proceeds  from equitable sharing agreements between the Federal Government and  local law enforcement. These arrangements create perverse incentives to  seek out forfeiture opportunities, and it is used to circumvent State- enacted--like Michigan's--civil asset forfeiture reforms.   In recent years, we have learned of a growing number of instances  across the United States where the government has confiscated property  from citizens and small businesses without any criminal conviction or  any criminal charges being brought. Moreover, civil forfeiture  disproportionately affects minorities and individuals who cannot afford  to represent themselves.   Mr. Speaker, current civil forfeiture practices are deeply unpopular  with the public, and there is strong bipartisan support for reform. As  such, proponents for reforming forfeiture practices include a broad  coalition, like the ACLU, FreedomWorks, the NAACP, and Americans for  Prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, the current civil asset forfeiture system is ripe for  abuse and has undermined the constitutional rights of far too many  Americans. This amendment has already passed the House twice by voice  vote. I ask my colleagues to once again support this bipartisan  amendment and protect the right of due process for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that the current  forfeiture system is ripe for abuse, and it has undermined the  constitutional rights of far too many Americans. This amendment has  already passed the House twice by voice vote. We support it here.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to once again support this  bipartisan amendment and protect the right of due process for all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
