 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 302) to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a  program to provide financial assistance to graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of study relating to  cybersecurity and energy infrastructure, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 302         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Cybersecurity       University Leadership Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. ENERGY CYBERSECURITY UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP                     ACTIVITIES.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 302, the bill now under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 302, the Energy  Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 led by Representative  Ross and Representative Carey.   Cyberattacks from foreign adversaries on the U.S. energy sector  present a major and constantly evolving threat to our national  security, energy independence, and global competitiveness.   Multiple attacks over the past few years have shown us that whether  it is our liquefied natural gas industry, our electric grid, or even  our national laboratories, all critical U.S. energy assets can be  attractive targets for adversarial cyber campaigns.   Troublingly, many of these cyberattacks are just preparations for  future operations. As the FBI, CISA, and other security agencies have  warned, the CCP is using smaller attacks now to provide inroads so they  can inflict major damage to our energy infrastructure in the future.   The threats to our energy cybersecurity have only increased recently  due to several factors such as the war in Ukraine, increased aggression  from the CCP, and the development of new energy technologies and grid  modernization practices.   To protect our energy sector, we need to take a whole-of-government  approach, and the Department of Energy plays a central role in planning  for and countering these attacks.   H.R. 302 is one way to support the DOE's energy cybersecurity  mission. This is important, bipartisan legislation that will help  address expanding vulnerabilities in our energy sector by strengthening  the next generation of our energy cybersecurity workforce.   I thank my colleague, Representative Ross, for reintroducing this  timely bill and Representative Carey for joining her as the Republican  lead of this bipartisan effort.   On the Science Committee, energy cybersecurity initiatives have long  been a bipartisan priority. H.R. 302 is just the beginning of our work  on this issue in the 118th Congress.   I pledge to continue working with all Members to pass legislation  that will keep the U.S. energy sector safe, reliable, and competitive  for years to come.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Carey).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, there has never been a more critical issue than to  ensure the cybersecurity of our Nation's energy sector. H.R. 302 will  help develop the most important long-term weapon we have in our arsenal  against cyberattacks: a highly skilled and informed American workforce.   It is bipartisan, forward-looking legislation, which is why it passed  the House on suspension last year.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, once again,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
