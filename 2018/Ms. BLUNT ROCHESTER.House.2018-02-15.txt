 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Mr. Nadler, for  yielding and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, as a former Delaware Secretary of Labor, I rise today  to strongly oppose H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017.  This bill on the floor today would roll back the clock on civil rights  for people with disabilities.   Twenty-seven years ago, Congress passed the transformative Americans  with Disabilities Act, which prohibited discrimination against people  with disabilities and mandated that they have an equal opportunity to  participate in society. Before the ADA, a person with a disability  could be barred from a meaningful career, education, and, really, to  live a fulfilling life.   Mr. Chairman, some claim that the ADA exposes businesses to  exorbitant costs or damage awards, but this is not the norm. It is one  of the myths that has perpetuated. According to the Department of  Labor, 57 percent of accommodations cost nothing at all, while the rest  typically cost only $500.   So once you peel back the myths surrounding the ADA, we are left with  one simple question: Why not comply?   The monetary cost is typically minimal in comparison to the value of  providing qualified Americans with a job or a shot at the American  Dream; or giving an individual with a disability the means to go to the  grocery store, pick up their children from childcare, or travel, or  work.   That is why these standards are so essential. They ensure real, fair,  and equal access for everyone.   People with disabilities simply want to live an independent life,  free from discrimination. This bill rolls back that progress.   I will be voting against this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.
