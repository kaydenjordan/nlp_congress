 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing U.S. Army MAJ Robert Bourgeau of Missoula County for his  heroism on and off the battlefield.   Since graduating high school, Robert committed his life to military  service. Growing up in Missoula, the uniform and the duty that came  with wearing it inspired him. We all know being a member of the U.S.  Armed Forces is more than a job; it is a noble calling to serve that  translates beyond one's time spent in uniform.   On October 3, 2022, at Torii Station in Okinawa, Japan, Robert  demonstrated his steadfast commitment to putting others before himself.  Around 2 p.m. that day, Robert and some of the students he instructed  in scuba diving were at Mermaid's Grotto, a diving spot in Okinawa,  when they noticed a Japanese woman calling for help with her 11-year- old daughter and a U.S. soldier who were trapped in a rip current 100  yards off shore. As 6-foot waves came crashing in on the endangered  snorkelers, Robert made his way to the young girl as well as her mother  who became engulfed in the waves in the process. He grabbed them both  and swam as hard as he could until he reached the shore and brought  them both to safety. His strength and energy were depleting, yet he  made his way back out to the dangerous waves for the soldier and was  able to direct him safely to shore.   Robert's commitment to his oath to protect and serve sets him apart  from his peers. Being willing to lay down his life for others is more  than a choice; it is his duty. Robert is a proud husband, father, and  grandfather, and I know his leadership and bravery are inspiring not  only to his family, but people around the world.   It is my distinct honor to recognize U.S. Army MAJ Robert Bourgeau  for his commitment to putting service over self. The Treasure State's  rich legacy of military service is carried on for generations because  of brave men like Robert. Thank you for your service. You make Montana  proud.                            ____________________
