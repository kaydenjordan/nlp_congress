 Mr. President, this has been another important week  here in the Senate. We are moving forward on multiple aspects of the  President's agenda.   Later today, the Senate Finance Committee will release its plan for  tax reform. I will have more to say on this in a moment, but I would  once again like to commend Chairman Hatch for his leadership to get us  to this point.   The Senate is also focusing on confirming the President's nominees so  they can finally get to work. We have built strong momentum from last  week, when we confirmed four circuit court nominees. This week we have  confirmed nominees for the Department of Defense, the Department of  Justice, and the National Labor Relations Board.   Soon we will also confirm the head of a critical office at the EPA.  William Wehrum will put his experience to good use as Assistant  Administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. This office is  one of the EPA's most important but, unfortunately, under the Obama  administration, was also among the offices with the most significant  overreach. Obviously it was in desperate need of new leadership from  someone who understands how to implement clean air policies in a  balanced way. That is William Wehrum. I look forward to advancing his  nomination shortly.   Confirming President Trump's talented nominees to the Federal  Government will continue to be a priority of this Senate, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues to get this done.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back all time on this side and  reserve one minute for Senator Carper.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the Kan nomination  be yielded back and the confirmation vote on the Kan nomination occur  at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, November 13.

Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the  Finance Committee is on the cusp of the accomplishment of his career.  This comprehensive tax reform will make a huge difference for America.  I wish to commend him for the efforts that have gotten us this far.   We have heard members of the Finance Committee speaking to the bill  that has been presented to our conference. This is going to be an  extraordinary accomplishment, not only for the American people but for  the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee.    Mr. President, I was listening carefully to the  remarks of my friend from Alaska, and I am very much supportive of the  effort to open up this small footprint in the Alaskan wilderness. It  struck me that my friend from Alaska is right on point when he said the  only talking points that haven't changed are the ones on the other side  from 40 years ago. The advances in technology are truly impressive, and  the opportunity not only for Alaska but for America to realize these  natural resources is something very important to the country. I thank  my friend for pointing that out.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 373, 374, 375, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 440,  441, 442, 459, and 460.
