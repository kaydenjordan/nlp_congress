 Mr. Speaker, the Midlands of South  Carolina were shocked to learn of the shooting death Sunday of Cayce  police officer, Andrew ``Drew'' Barr, age 27.   Killed in the line of duty, Officer Barr was a brave, dedicated  public servant, who will always be cherished as a champion for law and  order.   Officer Barr was familiar with danger. Shortly after graduating from  the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy in 2017, he and another  Cayce police officer were shot during an incident that involved a car  chase and foot pursuit. They were awarded medals for bravery.   ``Our hearts are breaking in Cayce. Officer Drew Barr has been an  important part of the Cayce family since 2016,'' heralded by Cayce  Mayor Elise Partin.   ``Officer Barr gave the ultimate sacrifice for us to make us safe,''  confirmed by Cayce Police Chief Chris Cowan.   Cayce is fortunate to have Mayor Partin, Chief Cowan, and a law- enforcement-experienced councilman, Tim James.   Our prayers for the family of Texas National Guardsman Bishop Evans,  who is a hero for trying to protect the drug-infested southern border.   God bless Ukraine. God bless Volodymyr Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
