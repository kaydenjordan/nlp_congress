 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent,  Ms. Tijuana Fulford, founder and executive director of the Butterfly  Effect Project in Riverhead.   In 2014, Ms. Fulford set out to establish a free program to provide  young girls with the tools they need to achieve self-confident futures  in hopes of bringing forth a generation of strong, independent, and  knowledgeable women.   This program has grown from 4 to 108 young girls with an ever-growing  waitlist. These are girls who are empowered with the resources  necessary to secure a prosperous future for themselves and their  families.   Through financial, educational, emotional, and career support, the  Butterfly Effect Project is building community involvement and  curtailing the effects of cultural and mobility limitations.   With locations in Riverhead and Bellport, the Butterfly Effect  Project is having such a positive effect on young girls from Riverhead,  Flanders, Calverton, Mastic, Shirley, Bellport, Westhampton, Peconic,  Patchogue, and West Islip.   The Butterfly Effect Project has provided an invaluable service to  our community. I applaud Ms. Fulford for her dedication, and I look  forward to witnessing the growth of her organization and the bright  future of so many of the young women it supports.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4771, the  Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, and I commend my friend from  Utah, Mia Love, for her amazing leadership on this important issue and  her tireless effort to bring relief to the community banks that lend to  small businesses and families in my district and in towns all across  America.   By reforming the onerous one-size-fits-all regulations mandated by  the Dodd-Frank law that roped small community financial institutions in  with large global too-big-to-fail megafirms, this commonsense bill will  give community banks and the customers they serve more clarity and  allow them to focus on their important mission of lending to homeowners  and businesses.   This legislation also makes it easier for small- and medium-sized  institutions subject to Dodd-Frank mandates to form new holding  companies, fund existing holding companies, and make acquisitions by  issuing debt at the holding company level.   Now that they are subject to the Basel III capital requirements, many  community banks have found it difficult to access and raise capital.    The consequence of this choke hold on community lending  means less mortgages, less small business loans, and less economic  growth. H.R. 4771 fixes this and facilitates the ability of community  banks and savings institutions to raise needed capital.   I urge adoption of this bill.
