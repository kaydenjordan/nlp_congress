 Madam President, you know, there is a lot that we do  not agree on here in the Senate, but I think everybody, including the  Presiding Officer, can agree that we need to secure our country. We  need to be safe. Our citizens need to feel safe. Our job as elected  officials is to make sure that those who have stepped up to defend our  country have the resources they need to do their job and do it safely.   The President's recent budget proposal for the Defense Department  does not, and I repeat, does not give our men and women in uniform the  tools to do their job properly. It is clear that President Biden thinks  we don't need further investment in our military. It is clear he thinks  it is OK to ask our men and women to do more with less, and that is  impossible. This should alarm the Members of this body and all American  people.   The world has changed a lot in 50 years. When President Biden first  came to Washington in 1972, there were two superpowers: the United  States and the Soviet Union. Back then, we spent 6.5 percent of our  Federal budget on national defense--6.5. Today, we spend less than 3.5.   In 2021, we are facing different but very, very serious threats.  Secretary Austin has said that China remains the top ``pacing threat''  for our military. It is much, much more than that. China isn't just  trying to dominate Asia and its neighbors; they are trying to dominate  much of the world through its growing military and economic influence.  Simply keeping pace with China is not enough.   We have got to outpace all of our adversaries, but doing that  requires smart, substantial, and strategic investments in our  military--much more investment than the President and many people here  in Congress publicly propose.   Let me walk through some of the ways that a supposedly flat defense  budget hurts our national security.   President Biden says he wants his administration to trust the experts  on things like COVID, but this defense budget shows he doesn't apply  the same principle to the Pentagon. Unlike the President and some of my  Democratic colleagues, I think we should take seriously the advice of  our commanding generals, for they are the experts in this purview.   Here is what ADM Charles Richard, commander of U.S. Strategic  Command, who is over our nuclear capabilities, said in last week's  hearing to the Senate Armed Services Committee:         I have what I need today to deter. . . . but I need it       modernized. . . . There's no remaining margin.    His warning is clear. We must modernize our greatest deterrent and  keep peace among our adversaries with our nuclear arsenal. That means  updating all three legs of the nuclear triad: submarines, bombers, and  intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is necessary to do so, and it  is also possible. As former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said,  ``America can afford survival.''   The Russians have made modernizing their nuclear arsenal a priority.  The Chinese have made growing their nuclear stockpile a matter of  national pride. But the United States? Each day we rely on nuclear  weapons that, in many cases, were designed by an analog mechanical  computer. The free world, meaning the United States, works and sleeps  under a nuclear umbrella that hasn't been updated to the digital age.   Meanwhile, the Chinese are fielding hypersonic missiles, which are  missiles that go into space and then return to their target. Ours are  still on the drawing board.   China's arsenal of ground-based and medium-range missiles continues  to grow. They are pointed right at our forces in the Pacific and our  allies in the region. We need investment to maintain our missile  defense systems so we can protect our people and deter the Chinese from  attacking our allies   We are also in a new space race, and it is a race we must win.  Americans may not realize how much we rely on space for our daily  lives. Our satellites allow us to get GPS for our phones or even watch  football games on television, but the Chinese want to weaponize this  new frontier of war, and we are falling way behind.   Right now, the Chinese have set up satellites over Taiwan as they  continue to ramp up their threats on this democratic neighbor. It is  unbelievable. I heard about the growing gap between us and the Chinese  when I visited Army Materiel Command at Redstone Arsenal a few weeks  ago in Huntsville. These folks shared with me how desperate we need to  modernize our space-based systems that contribute to our missile  defense.   The U.S. Army is the largest consumer of space products, and our  military relies on Materiel Command to provide the resources to train  our soldiers for research, development of new equipment, and defend our  Nation. They should not have to beg the President of the United States  for the money to invest in the capabilities that we need.   The United States must ensure secure and reliable access to space.  Our budget needs to demonstrate commitment to defending our existing  space assets and developing new technologies so we can win this next  theater of conflict. We also need to invest in the safety of our  service men and women, especially in aviation. Currently, the average  age of an airplane in our military is older than the pilots flying  them--older.   According to a recent report by the National Commission on Military  [[Page S2194]]  Aviation Safety, the military had more than 6,000 noncombat aviation  accidents since 2013, destroying 157 aircraft, at a cost of $9.41  billion. Even worse was the human cost. There are 198 souls that have  been lost in these tragic accidents, affecting hundreds more spouses,  children, family, and friends.   When asked why these causes occurred, servicemembers pointed to  inadequate training programs, risky maintenance practices, and spotty  funding, among other reasons. Alabama is home to Fort Rucker, where  every Army helicopter pilot comes to get their training. When I visited  the folks at Fort Rucker, they told me about the very real need for  increased flight training hours for our pilots, which requires more  investment and prioritization in the defense budget.   This last week, two pilots were injured in a helicopter crash at Fort  Rucker during flight training. I am sure General Francis and the U.S.  Army safety center will do a thorough investigation and provide  feedback on the improvements needed to ensure that this does not happen  again. The safety of our flight program must be a top priority. We must  listen to our men and women in uniform and invest in the proper  training and safety measures that will prevent these crashes.   Alabama stands ready to continue to build our military so we can  maintain our status as a preeminent fighting force in the world. We  have got hundreds of contractors and more than 200,000 employed in the  defense sector across the State of Alabama. These topnotch men and  women support our military installations from shipbuilders in Mobile to  Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and many places in between. As Winston  Churchill said, ``Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.''   We are willing and able, but those tools require sustained funding  from the Federal Government. Telling our forces to fight a war with  outdated tools is like giving a football team some leather helmets and  decades-old poorly fitted pads and expecting them to compete against  modern equipment. But that is exactly what President Biden's defense  budget is asking our military to do. Frankly, it is a huge  disappointment, coming from our Commander in Chief. We cannot let our  men and women down.    Thankfully, it is Congress--not the President--which has the power of  the purse. And, really, this should be our first order of business  every year. It is that important.   In the coming weeks, I will be working with my colleagues on the  National Defense Authorization Act and budget that will enable our  military to do the job better today and prepare for all the challenges  tomorrow. This debate is ultimately about whether or not we have the  willpower to fight to defend our way of life and our great country.   Well, I am willing to keep fighting for the United States by  investing in the men and women who keep us safe. I urge my colleagues  and President Biden to do the same.
