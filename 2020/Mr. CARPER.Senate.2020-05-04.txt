 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the  nomination of Robert Feitel to serve as inspector general of the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the safety and security  of almost 100 nuclear powerplants throughout this country--an important  job.   This is a nomination I urged the majority to take up and pass, not  this week, not this month but before we went into recess on April 8. We  are  [[Page S2202]]  here, and this is a good nomination. I hope my colleagues will support  it.
