 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Charter Schools Week. It  is my pleasure to celebrate alongside the students who have benefited  from these innovative institutions. Charter schools serve over 3  million students nationwide, providing students in rural, urban, and  suburban settings with unique educational opportunities.   The reforms in the Every Student Succeeds Act enable charter schools  to serve more students and allow States to support new, high-quality  charter schools to address the growing demand for these schools. And  the demand is high. Currently, 5 million students are awaiting their  chance to attend. Charter schools offer American families the right to  choose what environment is best for their child. It is clear that  parents and students want this choice available to them, and they  deserve to have it.                             Honoring Sean Vestal     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Sean Vestal of  Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This year the North Carolina High School  Athletic Association awarded Mr. Vestal the Homer Thompson Memorial  Eight Who Make a Difference Award. This honor is awarded each year to  one coach from each region of the State for excellence in  sportsmanship, dedication, and being a student role model.   Known for his supportive relationships with athletes and using the  game to teach life lessons that go beyond the court, Mr. Vestal  finished his career as North Forsyth's head basketball coach after 12  seasons to spend more time with his family. However, he continues his  dedication to students as the school's athletic director.   Congratulations to Mr. Vestal in receiving the Eight Who Make a  Difference Award. We are fortunate to have him as an example of  sportsmanship and an encouraging role model in North Carolina's Fifth  District. I wish him success in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
