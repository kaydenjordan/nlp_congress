 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, before I begin, Madam President, I want to remind  Senators to wear a mask as much as possible on the floor. I personally  take my mask off when addressing the Chair, so long as other Senators  or staff are not nearby. Otherwise, a mask should be worn at all times  on the floor.   This is not only for the safety of other Senators. This is for the  safety of our staffs, everyone who works here on the floor, and  everyone who works here in this building, as well as setting the right  example for the American people.                            ____________________     Madam President, on Judy Shelton, today the Senate will  vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to serve as a member of the  Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve.   Ms. Shelton is, without a doubt, one of the most unqualified nominees  I have ever seen for our Nation's central bank. When her nomination  first came before the Senate Banking Committee, a former Republican  aide to a Senator on the Banking Committee said that she was so  unqualified and so far out of the mainstream that the ``idea of even  calling Ms. Shelton as a witness for something was beyond the pale.''   That is a former Republican aide saying that Shelton wasn't qualified  to be a witness in a committee hearing, let alone a nominee to the  Federal Reserve Board of Governors.   It is not hard to understand why. For years, Ms. Shelton has  advocated for the resurrection of the gold standard, a long since  discarded policy that in part led to the Great Depression. She has  questioned the independence of the Fed and, beyond that, has even  questioned whether the Fed should exist.   Ms. Shelton has also suggested that we put an end to Federal deposit  insurance, an institution that has protected American savings since the  1930s. That is why over 130 of the nation's top economists, including  seven Nobel laureates, have opposed her nomination, as have countless  alumni of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.   Ms. Shelton's views have another strange quality: They seem to change  when it is politically convenient. When President Obama was in office,  Ms. Shelton harangued the Fed to increase interest rates, despite the  economic downturn. But in 2017, when President Trump took office, Ms.  Shelton abruptly switched her position and argued that the Fed should  reduce rates, in her words, ``as fast, as efficiently, as expeditiously  as possible.''   It may surprise few to learn that she was an adviser to President  Trump's 2016 campaign. She has defended his candidacy and his policies  and encouraged world banks to hold international conferences at Mar-a- Lago. Imagine--a nominee for the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to  be an independent body.  [[Page S7021]]    I have fought both Democrats and Republicans when they have tried to  interfere with the independence of the Fed, but Ms. Shelton doesn't  seem to care about it at all. So that might be the most concerning  thing about her nomination: her stunning lack of independence.   The Federal Reserve Board must make decisions based on objective  economic analysis and judgment, not whatever is best for one party or  one occupant of the Oval Office. That is why terms on the Federal  Reserve board last 14 years. We are supposed to trust Federal Reserve  Governors to be neutral arbiters, no matter which party is in power in  Washington. We are supposed to trust that everyone who serves on the  Fed is first and foremost well qualified and truly independent.   But, unfortunately, Judy Shelton is neither. Ms. Shelton has shown  herself to be an economic weathervane, pointing whichever direction she  thinks the partisan winds are blowing.   Every single Democrat will oppose her nomination today. I understand  a few of our Republican colleagues will oppose her nomination as well.  The question is, Will enough of our colleagues on the other side stand  up and do the right thing today?   Members of this Chamber have stood up before to prevent President  Trump from putting unqualified partisan advocates on the Federal  Reserve. During these final few weeks of the Trump Presidency, it is  time to do it again. I plead with my Republican colleagues, for the  sake of an economy that is hurting from COVID, for the sake of our  future economy and its growth, to reject Ms. Shelton's nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, on COVID, by all rights, the Senate  should not be spending its time this week on so many nominees,  especially such unqualified nominees, while COVID-19 is surging  throughout the country.   The urgent need for another relief bill has been confronting the  Senate since March of this year. The Republican leader put the Senate  on ``pause,'' as he said, all summer, while the virus got worse and  worse. And when he finally decided it was time to do another bill, he  crafted a partisan, emaciated proposal that fell drastically short of  what was needed to address a burgeoning health and economic crisis.   Now, President-Elect Biden has urged the Senate to pass a  comprehensive bill that actually meets the needs of the American  people. He pointed to the HEROES Act, and that is the right focus. We  need a comprehensive bill that meets the needs of the American people,  but, of course, we would want to sit down and negotiate with our  Republican colleagues.   The Republican leader should come to the table and negotiate with  Democrats on a bipartisan COVID relief bill with a bipartisan process  that addresses all of the challenges we now face.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
