 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, the Trump Justice Department  filed in court to say that the entire Affordable Care Act should be  voided.   The President said: Don't worry. We are going to have a great and  better plan to replace it.   Then Mitch McConnell said: No, no, we are not doing that.   Then Trump said: Well, we will run on healthcare in 2020 and promise  a better plan.   And his consultant said: No, better not do that.   So now he has a secret plan that will be unveiled after the next  election to replace the Affordable Care Act. Twenty-one million  Americans would lose their insurance if it went away tomorrow.   We had another guy running for President back in 1968, Richard  Milhous Nixon. He had a secret plan to end the Vietnam war. Actually,  he didn't have a plan to end the war, but it helped him win the  Presidency.   Shame on us if a fake promise to have a better healthcare plan  undisclosed will come out after the election.  [[Page H3140]]    133 million Americans have preexisting conditions. They would lose  their healthcare at the discretion of the health insurance industry,  312,000 in my district alone.   Twelve million Americans would lose their expanded Medicaid, 350,000  in my district.   Medicare would go broke 4 years earlier if President Trump prevails  in repealing the Affordable Care Act in its totality.                            ____________________
