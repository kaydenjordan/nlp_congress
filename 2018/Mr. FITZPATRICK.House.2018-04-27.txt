 Mr. Speaker, April is Autism Awareness Month, and I  would like to recognize a family landmark in my district that has gone  the extra mile to assist individuals with autism.   Sesame Place, a theme park located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in  my district, and my former employer, was recently designated as a  Certified Autism Center. This distinction, developed by the  International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education  Standards, certifies facilities that are compatible for those with  autism, and their families.   To earn this designation, all staff at Sesame Place underwent  extensive training on autism awareness and sensitivity. When the park  reopens for its 38th season this year, it will also include two new  ``quiet rooms'' with adjustable lights and noise-canceling headphones.   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud to say that Sesame Place in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, is the first theme park in the world to be  designated as a Certified Autism Center. I would like to thank the  staff and all of my friends at Sesame Place for making the park a  hospitable and fun place for our entire community.                            ____________________
