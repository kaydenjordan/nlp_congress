 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today on a solemn occasion. I rise  in memory of George Nettels, Jr., a man who lived a life of service to  his community and to our State.   Affectionately referred to as ``the face of Pittsburg''--Pittsburg,  KS, that is--George was a loving husband to Josie and a devoted father  to Chris, Meg, Kate, and Becky. He was born in Pittsburg, KS--the very  southeast corner of our State--where his dedication, hard work, and  thirst for adventure was cultivated.   As a young man, George joined the U.S. Army in the closing years of  World War II. Upon his return home, he attended the University of  Kansas, where he was a letterman on the swim team and graduated with a  degree in civil engineering.   George spent most of his career in his beloved hometown, where he  became the proud owner of Midwest Minerals, a crushed limestone  aggregate and agricultural lime supplier with a strong four-State  presence.   In 1966, he served as the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party and  the National Limestone Institute, so civic and politics, as well as his  devotion to his profession and those it employed. It was the preceding  association to what we in Washington, DC, and across the country know  as the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association.   His work at the National Limestone Institute led to his appointment  in 1970 as president and CEO of McNally Manufacturing, which started as  a small boiler shop and helped transform Pittsburg into a Southeast  Kansas industrial powerhouse.   George's leadership included serving as chairman of the National  Association of Manufacturers and as director of Kansas City Power and  Light.   In 1986, the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas honored him with the  distinction of Kansan of the Year--a fitting tribute for his life of  service to his community, State, and profession.   His deep involvement in civic business and philanthropic endeavors  kept him busy in Pittsburg, where he served as president of the chamber  of commerce, chairman of the Mt. Carmel Hospital board of trustees, a  member of the United Way, and president of USD--Unified School  District--250 Board of Education. His devotion to Pittsburg's public  schools is one he inherited from his father, who spearheaded a campaign  to build an elementary school that ultimately would be named for him.   George Nettels' appetite for adventure led him to 24 countries,  skydiving in tandem with his grandson, Jack--he did that at age 84--and  taking a 6-day bike tour through the hills of Italy. Whether around the  world or at home, he never turned down a new physical challenge, which  led him to being named the honorary starter of the Get Busy Livin' 5K  Run and Friendship Walk in Pittsburg at 87 years old.   I heard this story from one of my staff, who saw George jogging in  100-degree heat just over 2 years ago. Worrying about his age and the  heat, my staffer offered George a ride, to which he replied:         I grew up working in this heat and it doesn't bother me one       bit.    George learned from his father that life is a gift and the length is  not guaranteed. He took that lesson to heart, making sure that while he  was on Earth, he bettered his hometown, made countless memories with  his family and friends, and was always ready for an adventure.   Southeast Kansas's dynamic industrial sector, the city of Pittsburg,  and our entire State have George Nettels, Jr., to thank for his  advocacy, leadership, and commitment to excellence.   Robba and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends  and all those who knew and loved him.                            Remembering Roger Kemp    Madam President, I rise as the entire Kansas City community mourns  the death of Roger Kemp.   Over the years, Roger and I became close friends, and I knew him to  be a passionate member of the Kansas City community. Nowhere was this  passion and drive more evident than his work following the death of his  daughter.   In 2002, Roger and his wife Kathy's daughter Ali was murdered at the  age of 19 while she was working at a local pool as a lifeguard.   Living through a parent's worst nightmare, Roger channeled his grief  into bringing his daughter's murderer to account for this heinous  crime. Roger demanded nothing less than absolute justice for his  daughter. He worked tirelessly, including through a billboard  advertisement campaign, to find Ali's killer. This campaign not  [[Page S1092]]  only worked to bring her killer to justice but led law enforcement,  both locally and nationally, to adopt a similar strategy that has been  credited with helping to apprehend hundreds of other suspected killers.   His work did not stop there. Roger wanted to devote his life and his  efforts to making certain that other women, other young girls, were not  caught defenseless as Ali was and that no other parent had to  experience the torment and loss that he and Kathy endured. So Roger  founded The Ali Kemp Educational Foundation and T.A.K.E. Defense  programs. An honor student, Ali was, at both Blue Valley North High  School and Kansas State University; her life was just getting started.  She had just finished her freshman year at K-State, where she was a  member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and a volunteer in her church.   But even though it was tragically cut short, Ali's tragic death  touched thousands of people, and The Ali Kemp Educational Foundation  continues to positively impact the lives of many and allows her legacy  to live on.   ``I don't care what it cost to do this program,'' Roger said. ``If we  save one life out there, it's worth it.''   That was Roger's mantra, and he lived up to it. Over the nearly 20  years since its founding, The Ali Kemp Educational Foundation and its  T.A.K.E. Defense programs have trained more than 70,000 girls and women  across the country, ranging from the ages of 12 to 90, no doubt saving  more than one life.   Roger was an active member and served on the board of directors of  the Ad Hoc Commission Against Crime and on the committee which reviewed  and awarded grants to shelters and homes for victims of abuse for three  different Kansas attorneys general.   But it wasn't just those of us in Kansas that recognized just how  special a person Roger was. In 2011, I had the honor of successfully  nominating Roger to receive the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second  highest civilian award presented by a President. He was 1 of 13  recipients out of more than 6,000 nominees.   I think a quote from the foundation he created in Ali's honor  perfectly captures who he was, and it reads:         Roger's faith in the American justice system; his belief       that 99 percent of the world is good, his powerful love for       his daughter Ali and sons Tyler and Drew and his deep       dedication to his wife Kathy drove him every day, fighting       the good fight, to make our world a better place.    Roger Kemp was a loving father and husband, a dedicated member of his  community, and a man who created good from the devastating disaster,  the murder of his daughter.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Kathy, Tyler, and Drew and all who  knew and loved Roger in this time of sorrow. I am honored to have  considered him a friend, and it comforts me to know that he has  reunited once more with Ali.   I yield the floor.
