 Mr. Speaker, this morning, at the House Armed Services  Committee, Secretary James Mattis applauded the bipartisan  collaboration and demonstrated political courage for lifting the  spending caps of sequestration so that the military readiness of this  country could catch up with the huge demands that are happening in  terms of our national security.   I cite that reference this morning because, in looking at this  balanced budget constitutional amendment, a FOX News reporter described  the effect of this is that ``a balanced budget requirement would be  sequestration amped up on a cocktail of anabolic steroids and fiscal  fentanyl.''   If people worried about the U.S. military over the last 4 years since  the Budget Control Act was passed because of sequestration, they should  not vote for this balanced budget amendment because it is not only a  straitjacket, it is a straitjacket with a constitutional lock that  would freeze Congress' ability to provide the resources to defend our  Nation.   Again, just look at the sequence of what happened in terms of  sequestration and the damage it did to our country, and listen to what  that FOX News analyst said that it would do to our national defense and  to our country's ability to address its basic needs and kill Social  Security and Medicare, which will be the target if this ever were to  pass.
