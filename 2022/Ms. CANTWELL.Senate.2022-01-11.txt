 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of our next  vote, the nominee to head the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration at the Department of Commerce, Alan  Davidson.   My colleagues know now, in an information age, how important access  to broadband is. They know because of COVID-19 how important it is for  healthcare, how important it is for education, and how important it is  for people to have the flexibility in all parts of the United States to  have access to the ability to connect and to connect with people around  the world.   We have long talked about the need for an NTIA Administrator who  understands the public sector and understands the private sector. Mr.  Davidson does that. He comes to us with a wealth of experience in both  sectors, and he is coming at a time when my colleagues have been asking  for more leadership from the administration on broadband issues. That  is to say, many of my colleagues, like Senator Wicker, Senator  Klobuchar, and many others, have asked for coordination between various  programs that exist within the Department of Commerce, the Department  of Agriculture, and the issues in coordination with the FCC and  oversight of their programs to better maximize the delivery of  broadband.   The Presiding Officer knows how much money is now on the table for  broadband. We all know that this implementation is going to take a very  skilled hand at trying to address both the issues of affordability and  access. But more importantly, we will be getting with Mr. Davidson  somebody who understands these issues well and will help us strive to  get America better connected as quickly as possible.  [[Page S132]]    We can't say enough about how important that is as COVID-19 continues  across the United States of America with different variants. I am not  saying it is going to be the new normal and continue for the next  several years, but we know this: We need Mr. Davidson's help. We need  his help effectively and speedily to get broadband deployed to both  sectors of our economy--those who are unserved and those who are  underserved.   We look forward to advancing this nominee and putting him to work as  quickly as possible, and I personally look forward to working with him  on these very important issues. There is much to do to leverage the  dollars we have made available, but we have to work cooperatively with  all parts of the United States to make that a reality.   Nothing could be more important now to upgrading U.S. infrastructure  than getting fiber deployed, getting broadband to American homes, and  making our grid more secure. With all of these things, I look forward  to working with Mr. Davidson, and I appreciate his comments to me about  his commitment to those issues as well.   I yield the floor.                         Vote on Davidson Nomination     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  scheduled vote occur immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
