 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Triple  Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, which is recognized around the  country on March 3 each year.   This day is especially meaningful for me, as my daughter, Lauren,  battled triple negative breast cancer for nearly 2 years before her  death in August 2017.   Between 10 and 20 percent of breast cancer patients are triple  negative, meaning they don't respond to traditional hormone therapies.  They are considered more aggressive cancers, and the prognosis is poor.   My daughter was very public in her fight against breast cancer, and I  know that she would want me to use today to raise awareness and to  encourage those at risk to be screened.   I am humbled to have reintroduced a resolution officially designating  this day in the hopes that, together, we can bring greater awareness of  triple negative breast cancer and encourage early detection and  treatment.   May we resolve to fight together with the strength and courage that  Lauren demonstrated each and every day to finally find a cure for this  awful and dreaded disease.                            ____________________
