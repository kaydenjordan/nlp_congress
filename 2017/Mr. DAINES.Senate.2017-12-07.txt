 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing June Rychalski for her service with the Montana  Department of Military Affairs. She has served Montana with grace,  diligence, a positive attitude, and genuine care for the people of the  Treasure State.   During her 35 years of service, June has been secretary to the senior  Army adviser, administrative assistant to the adjutant general and next  month will complete her career with the Montana Veterans Affairs  Division. June demonstrated compassion and professionalism on a daily  basis. Her ability to help a grieving family member navigate the  challenges of veteran burial honors or steer a distressed veteran in  the right direction to attain benefits is highly commendable. Her  presence in the in the Montana Department of Military Affairs will be  missed, but the mentorship she provided agency personnel over the years  will ensure that her legacy endures. To her coworkers, June was  regarded as their greatest advocate.   When June retires, she plans to do what she has always done, continue  to take good care of others. At age 83, June's example is inspiring.  Her work ethic, compassion, and commitment to excellence represent the  best of Montana values. Thank you, June, for your service. I wish you  the best in retirement and appreciate all you have done for our  State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a fifth generation Montanan and an avid  outdoorsman, I know how important access to our public lands are.  Having hiked, camped, biked, and snowmobiled countless miles in the  wilderness, forests, and other public lands of Montana, I share with  other Montanans the desire to explore the beauty of our state. That is  why today I am introducing the Protect Public Use of Public Lands Act.  This bill follows calls from countless Montanans and the U.S. Forest  Service recommendations to open up Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) that  the Forest Service recommended to manage as non-wilderness after the  congressionally mandated study in the 1970s. The bill would allow new  uses to be considered in the public planning process. For too long  these lands have remained in limbo and many forms of recreation have  been significantly reduced. For this reason, the Montana Legislature  passed a measure calling on Congress to take action on these Wilderness  Study Areas, and I have continued to hear from County Commissioners,  local Montanans, farmers, ranchers, and recreation groups since I have  been in Congress of their support for action. Hearing this call I today  introduce the Protect Public Use of Public Lands Act and ask my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as, follows:  [[Page S7931]]                                       S. 2206         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
