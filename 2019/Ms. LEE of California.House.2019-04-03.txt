 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and also for her tremendous leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1585, the  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. This critical bill will  expand crucial protections for all Americans making very important  enhancements to VAWA.   When I was in the California legislature, Mr. Speaker, I authored the  Violence Against Women Act for the State of California, and, yes, it  was signed by a Republican Governor.   In addition to the protections this bill has provided for 26 years,  it will now expand protections for Native American women and will  protect the transgender community. Every woman has the right to live  free from abuse.   Although my Republican colleagues argued differently in committee,  sexual orientation or gender identity should not put victims in a  second-class status. This bill will now make sure that every victim of  sexual violence has access to support.   VAWA is critical for the 1.3 million individuals who benefit from  this program. We must continue to improve these services for victims  and survivors by passing this bill here today.   Mr. Speaker, I know from personal experiences, yes, the life-and- death implications of this very important bill. So I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on this bill to ensure that all women are protected  from sexual and domestic violence.
