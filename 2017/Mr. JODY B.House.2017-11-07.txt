 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my  good friend from Arizona for holding this Special Order. What an  incredibly important issue.   Over the past year, we have heard nearly on a daily basis accusations  of what Russia tries to do to undermine the United States. I think most  of my colleagues would agree that Russia's actions over the past 2  years, which include everything from cyber attacks to supporting  Assad's bloody regime in Syria, all of it demonstrates that their  intention is to disrupt the stability both of the United States and the  entire world.                                time  1945    But here is the deal: none of this happened overnight. No one in  Russia flipped a switch on their foreign policy and it suddenly changed  from being friendly to the United States to trying to cause us harm.   The fact is the United States did not remain vigilant. Our foreign  policy suffered. We ignored the fact that Russian interests and goals  are not our interests and goals. Nothing demonstrates this more than  the Uranium One case.   In 2010, the Committee on Foreign Investments of the United States  approved a partial sale, as you have heard this evening, of a Canadian  company to the Russian-owned nuclear giant Rosatom. We have heard about  all of this. One-fifth of our uranium capacity gone.   In the United States, we have been long aware of the fact that the  Russian Government's request is, among other things, to control the  production of energy, both at home and in other nations, and then use  that energy as a source of leverage during conflicts.   Furthermore, striking information has been uncovered that Federal  agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian  nuclear industry to gather extensive evidence that showed Moscow had  compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and  kickbacks, all, of course, in violation of the law.   Rather than bringing these charges up, however, the FBI kept this  secret. They didn't tell anyone about it for 4 years. That is  unacceptable. We need to know why the FBI didn't share this  information. Why was this crucial information about Russia's actions in  our nuclear energy sector not shared? This is absolutely unacceptable.   Then, as we have been hearing tonight, we have the cases where  Russian officials spent millions of dollars to benefit former President  Bill Clinton's charitable family foundation while Hillary was Secretary  of State.   These are all extremely serious allegations, and it is absolutely our  responsibility to investigate them. There was a fundamental conflict of  interest here, and I think you would have to be blind not to recognize  that. Our Secretary of State was making decisions that impacted the  entire world while, at the same time, receiving massive amounts of  money from foreign donations.   As the Russians assumed control of Uranium One, the company's  chairman was giving tons of money to the Clinton Foundation. Of course,  none of this was disclosed as it was supposed to be.   So from what we know, the decision to allow the Clinton Foundation to  continue soliciting foreign donations was, at best, naive, if not  criminal. This seems to be a pattern of the previous administration. It  is absolute cluelessness and self-interest, at best, perhaps even worse  than that. It is hardly surprising that Russia believed it could pull  the wool over our eyes with impunity and increased its malicious  behavior.   I look forward to this investigation going forward, and I thank my  friend  [[Page H8590]]  from Arizona for having this Special Order.
