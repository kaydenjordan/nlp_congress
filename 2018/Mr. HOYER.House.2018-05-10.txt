 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information and  for the bonus of a little longer-term view of what we might be  considering on the floor of the House.   One of the things I didn't hear on that, and perhaps I asked the  majority leader about this before, is whether the majority is expecting  to offer on the floor or consider a budget resolution this year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, although it was not on this list, I wonder if  we might expect a budget resolution to be offered at some point in time  in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Of course, April 15 is  the day set forth. Many times we did not meet April 15. Clearly, last  year we didn't meet April 15 by many, many months, but I appreciate the  gentleman's answers.   Let me say that I will be joining Sunday night at the National Law  Enforcement Memorial here in Washington, D.C., the ceremony to honor  those who have given their life in service to our country as law  enforcement officers. We ought to pause not just next week, but every  week, to recognize the extraordinary service given to us by what I call  our domestic defenders, both our police and firefighter personnel, and  emergency medical response teams.   It is appropriate that we say thank you. They obviously have a very,  very tough job. They get a lot of flack from time to time, but without  them, we could not maintain the system of order that we have in this  country that allows democracy to proceed. So I want all of us to join,  not just next week, but next week particularly, to recognize. We will  have, of course, a ceremony on the west front of the Capitol.   We just had a ceremony the other day, which the Capitol Police  conducted, remembering the loss of life that we experienced here in  this Capitol to Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson in defending the  Capitol and those who reside therein and who visit this Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, on the farm bill and on rescissions, the farm bill, as I  understand it, again, I think pursuant to what the Speaker said after  we passed the tax bill in which we gave 83 percent of $1.5 trillion to  the wealthiest in America, the farm bill is now trying to fill that  $1.8 trillion hole that was constructed by the tax bill by reducing  benefits to those most in need in this country.   I would not so much ask a question of the majority leader, Mr.  Speaker, but simply to observe that I would hope we would not try to  fill that very, very deep hole that we have dug by passing that tax  bill by taking it from those who are most in need.                                time  1145    I notice that, as well as the farm bill, the rescission bill was  referred to by the leader as coming to the floor as well, and that  seeks to cut a very substantial amount from the contingency fund for  child health insurance.   The majority leader will make the point, well, that is money that is  not necessarily expected to be spent. In fact, he wrote to CBO asking  them a question. The CBO said they didn't think any children would be  dropped off because if the contingency is not realized, no children  will be dropped off. If, however, the contingency is, and there are no  contingency funds available to do that, then, in fact, children will be  at risk, unless we pass additional legislation.   I think it is unfortunate the majority is pursuing a policy now, both  on the farm bill and on the rescission bill, that seeks to undermine  the safety and security of those who are nutritionally underserved in  this country.   It is amazing, in the richest country on the face of the Earth, we  have people--one out of five children is going, Mr. Speaker, to bed at  night hungry. We ought to be moving in the other direction.   This bill has, historically, been a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Lucas  and Mr. Peterson, in the last reauthorization, brought a bipartisan  bill to the floor. Very frankly, it was turned into a partisan bill on  the floor, Mr. Speaker, when an amendment was offered and voted on by  much of the leadership on the majority side, which would have cut $40  billion from food stamps for those who are hungry Americans among us.   This is less than that, but I understand that the Heritage Action,  Club for Growth, and Americans for Prosperity are opposed to the bill  because it is not a deep enough cut, either in farm programs or in  nutritional programs.   I would say, Mr. Speaker, that we hope that these will not be  policies that we will pursue as a House of Representatives, or as a  Congress, and, very frankly, we think the farm bill has little chance  of passing the Senate. I would say zero, but that perhaps is a little  bit too strong, but certainly little--so that we will be spinning our  wheels to send an ideological message to constituencies, I suppose,  that want to undercut the ability to ensure that people have food that  are hungry in our country.   As to the rescission bill that the majority leader mentioned, Mr.  Speaker, rescissions are pretty common. Rescissions are common and  mostly done by the Congress of the United States, and we do it  annually. In almost every appropriation bill that we pass, or omnibus  that we pass, not so much CRs, but they have been present in CRs as  well, that we have rescissions.   The Congress has also gotten, as the majority leader will point out,  rescission requests from the executive department. Largely, those have  been not agreed to by the Congress. Only in one instance has one  President had even a majority of his requests acceded to, and that was  President Clinton.   But the fact of the matter is, for the most part, rescissions have  been pursued by the Congress of the United States, appropriately so,  doing its job. And, of course, President Bush asked for no rescissions.  President Reagan asked for a lot of rescissions, but President Bush  asked for no rescissions--I refer to the second President Bush--nor did  President Obama, notwithstanding when the Republicans were largely in  charge of the Congress of the United States. And we exercised our  judgment and did, in fact, do rescissions in the appropriations  process.   Now, we have not had a budget. It is the middle of May. It is a month  after the budget was to come forward. Our side does not see a budget  moving, but perhaps the majority leader is correct, the committee is  considering that, and that would be another place where the Congress  could take initiatives and a decision to rescind various amounts of  spending.   Last week, Mr. Speaker, I said if there was spending that was neither  necessary nor had been authorized over long periods of time, then I  would have no objection, personally, to that rescission, and would  think that we could initiate that action. But I would hope that, in  both of these instances, we would not take actions which would  adversely affect those who are challenged in America, either because of  health reasons or nutritional reasons.   I would secondly say, and lastly--the majority leader, I am sure,  wants to make some comments--60 percent of the budget that we passed,  which our Republican friends apparently think  [[Page H3915]]  was too much, was defense. Not a single red cent is included in the  President's rescission from the defense side of the budget, only the  nondefense discretionary funding, the people part of the budget.   Now, I am a strong supporter of national security, Mr. Speaker, and I  have been for the 37 years that I have been in this House. But I do not  delude myself that every bit of money that has been appropriated-- trillions of dollars over the last 4, 5, or 6 years--has either been  spent or is not subject to, perhaps, the Congress saying, well, we put  that money on the table but it hasn't been spent.   But apparently the President can't find a single red cent for that,  but he can find places where we can undermine research for innovation,  Children's Health Insurance Program.   I understand the leader is going to say that CBO says not a single  child will be dropped. That may be true; but if we drop the contingency  fund, which has been available and has been used year after year,  either directly for health insurance or for related programs for  children, then we will be at risk of hurting people whom I don't think  anybody in this body wants to hurt. So I would hope that, before those  bills are brought to the floor, we would keep those matters in  consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    2000, as I recall, when Mr. Clinton was President.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He  mentioned a number of facts.   Economically, I think all of us can be happy that unemployment is  down. The gentleman then mentioned that there are less unemployment  requests being made.   Is the gentleman aware that, in 2016, we created 400,000 more jobs  than we created in 2017? Is the gentleman aware of that fact? That is a  fact.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I presume the answer is the gentleman did not  know that there were 400,000 more jobs created in 2016 than were  created in 2017. I didn't get the answer to that question, Mr. Speaker.   Let me ask, however, if the gentleman is convinced that there is not  a single nickel that can be rescinded from the Defense Department  budgets over the last 10 years, trillions of dollars of money, and that  only the nondefense side of the budget is subject to rescissions, Mr.  Speaker, is the gentleman of the opinion that there are no sums  available from the defense budget to try to fill the $1.8 trillion hole  created by the tax bill?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, of course the answer to that question is yes.   Mr. Speaker, as I have explained to the majority leader, the Congress  has rescinded billions of dollars through the years, and I have voted  for rescissions that have been sent down by Presidents of the United  States and there may well be rescissions that are sent down that I  could support.    I do not intend to support rescissions, Mr. Speaker, that I view as  undermining children's health. I know what the majority leader says:  nobody is going to be hurt.   Now, interestingly enough, in that answer, he does not answer my  question except we all want a strong defense. Nobody on this floor has  longer supported Israel's right to be safe and defended than I have.   The issue is I asked the majority leader this does not include a  single red cent of rescissions from the trillions of dollars to the  Defense Department, not because I want to undermine the Defense  Department any more than he says he wants to undermine children's  health, but this is not about rescissions, per se. What it is about is  the flack that the majority party is getting, that the President is  getting from the Club for Growth, from Heritage Action, from Americans  for Prosperity, saying: Your budget was too big. The omnibus was too  big. We don't like it. Show some fiscal discipline.   So in an effort to show fiscal discipline, who do they go after? The  Children's Health Insurance Program.   He can say it all he wants, but he well knows, and the appropriators  will tell him, Mr. Speaker, that that money has been used on an ongoing  basis by the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee and by the Appropriations Committee to backfill  in places where there were clearly shortages on services to children  and families.   The gentleman may want to say whether or not he believes--because  outlays are not affected, he says--that, in fact, this rescission will  lower the nondefense discretionary baseline in 2019. That is what I  think the real purpose is, Mr. Speaker, and that is why the majority  leader has not answered the question about whether there is a single  cent to save the taxpayer money--we all want to save the taxpayer  money--out of the Defense Department side of the budget or whether that  is simply sacrosanct and not worthy of oversight by the Congress or by  the President.   That was my question. It was not answered, and I regret that.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly will yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, is the majority leader aware of the fact,  when he says that the rescission was cut or the CHIP was cut, is the  gentleman aware of where that money went when it was cut, or--I would  say it in a different way--reprogrammed to other items in the omnibus  or in the Labor-Health bill in previous appropriations? Is the  gentleman aware of the difference between the cut and the reprogramming  of money for a different objective related to the appropriation that  was included?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has not answered either one of  my questions, A, whether there was a single red cent available in the  Defense Department for rescission, because that money has been laying  there 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years. Is there a single red cent  there? B, he did not answer the question whether or not this rescission  will adversely impact the discretionary baseline for the 2019 budget.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I did yield to the gentleman about the single  red cent, because all of this deals on the nondefense side of the  budget, which is, by the way, the smallest part of the budget.   The gentleman keeps saying we need to make sure we do these cuts. He  wasn't as concerned, apparently, about balancing our budget when he cut  $1.8 trillion, $1.5 trillion--$1.8 trillion when you include the  interest. I know they say it is going to pay for itself. I have been  here a long time. They have said that before. It never has paid for  itself.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman will not answer those two questions: Is  there not a single red cent in the Defense budget; are they looking at  the Defense budget to see whether or not we put money on the table that  is either no longer necessary or has not been used for a significant  period of time--that seems to be his rationale--or, secondly, whether  or not it is going to have an adverse effect on the budget deal that  was reached in terms of where the nondefense discretionary spending  base will be for the 2019 budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Is the gentleman aware that there are $95 billion of  unobligated funds in the Department of Defense?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask the majority leader--he wants to  do these rescissions. Congress usually does these. They do them in the  appropriations process, and that is fine. Presidents have also done  that.   My question to him was: If you want to see rescissions, and--as he  has quoted me over, and over, and over again--funds that are not  necessary, not needed, not going to be spent, obviously, we will  consider rescissions for those.   However, what I have asked the gentleman is, you make the assessment.  Very frankly, the first time we make a rescission suggestion on  defense, he will stand up, or others on his side will stand up, and  say: See, they are against defense.   I am strongly for our national security, and I always have been. But  I think it is perverse in the farm bill to look at people who need  nutritional help. This CHIP program, if there is $500 million as he  claims, and he is probably accurate--I don't want to assess the  gentleman's saying something inaccurate--but clearly, these funds have  been used for other issues almost annually by the Appropriations  Committee. Mr. Cole would say that. Mrs. Lowey would say that.   I would expect, Mr. Speaker, for both the President and the majority  to propose where those $95 billion in unobligated funds might also add  to his desire to make sure that taxpayers get some money back that is  not being used.   I yield to my friend and then we will conclude.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has mentioned numerous times  that I voted against some of the bills that were offered on this floor,  and he is right. He tries to make it as if I voted against the CHIP  program. He knows that is not an honest representation, Mr. Speaker,  any more than the chairman of the Armed Services Committee voting  against one of those bills with me being against defense.   I was against it, frankly, because the Speaker and the majority  leader made a representation in September that we are going to solve a  problem we have yet to solve. And I am sorry about that. I think it is  wrong not to have solved it, and we were told we were going to have a  solution to it.   But the fact of the matter is, what I am saying is, the Republicans  talked and talked mightily about deficit reduction and giving money  back to the taxpayer. But if you break their bank, the money is going  to be taken from our children.   And so they passed a massive, $1.5 trillion tax bill, massive, and  then they come here with nickel-and-dime programs and say they are  going to give money back to the taxpayer.   I am for giving money back to the taxpayer. I am not for doing it by  creating additional debt for their children and their grandchildren. I  think that is not only an intellectually bankrupt policy, but an  immoral policy. But we are not going to resolve it today. I understand  that.   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, this administration will have the largest  deficit increase of any administration in history. They haven't been  here very long, so that is a prediction I make, and I am absolutely  positive I am correct.   They are now trying to bring that down, as I have said, by going  after investments on the domestic side of the budget, both in the farm  bill and in the rescission package. There are clearly rescissions that  are justified and that the Appropriations Committee and administrations  have made on a regular basis. When administrations have made them,  almost invariably, the majority of the rescissions requested by the  administrations--Democrat or Republican--have been rejected by the  Congress of the United States.   But I am hopeful, as the majority leader says, that we can reach  bipartisan agreement on rescissions that, in fact, make sense. I would  also hope we could reach some bipartisan agreement on solving issues  that confront this country.   The farm bill is a perfect example where it historically has been a  bipartisan bill, Mr. Speaker. It is a partisan bill this year, as they  made it the last time when Chairman Lucas reported out a bipartisan  bill and pleaded with his party not to make it a partisan bill. They  made it a partisan bill and, of course, it failed in the Senate. It  wasn't even brought up in the Senate. The Senate did its own bill.   So I would hope that the words of the majority leader about wanting  to work in a bipartisan fashion will be realized with respect to all of  these issues, including rescissions. And I would hope that we could  perhaps have some rational policies to try to stem the extraordinary  deficits that will inevitably be caused, as they have been in the past,  by a tax cut bill that gave 83 percent of its benefits to the  wealthiest in our Nation.   Without further ado, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
