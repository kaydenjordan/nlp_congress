 Mr. Speaker, we know that the economic and job creation  benefits are key components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, making the  U.S. globally competitive again, giving much-needed tax cuts to  American business, and much-needed wage increases to American workers.  But, Mr. Speaker, it is really the long overdue direct tax benefits to  the vast middle class, who don't have a lobbyist living in the rich  suburbs of Washington, D.C., that take center stage for me and my  fellow North Dakotans.   You see, 80 percent of the citizens of North Dakota file claiming  this standard deduction. That means, Mr. Speaker, that the vast  majority of my constituents will see their deductions nearly doubled if  they do nothing else. And obviously, with the doubling of the standard  deduction, it will likely inspire even more North Dakotans to claim  this simple deduction.   Mr. Speaker, this huge benefit, combined with greater job  opportunities and simpler, less expensive filing costs, and, of course,  a generous family tax credit, will put more money in the pockets and  less anxiety in the hearts of middle class North Dakotans. Supporting  this reform package is easy for me because it is right for North  Dakota, and I thank Chairman Brady for this outstanding work.
