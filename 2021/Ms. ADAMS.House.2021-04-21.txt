 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our friend and  colleague, Alcee Hastings--a pillar of our Congressional Black Caucus.   Congressman Hastings was a compassionate leader who always spoke his  mind and served his constituents with purpose.   For nearly thirty years, he used his position in Congress to speak  truth to power and advocate for our country's most vulnerable.   I admired both his courage and his unique ability to bring reason and  deep thought to the many conversations we had together. He was a friend  and mentor we all respected.   One thing I'll never forget about Congressman Hastings is his  wonderful sense of style, his fun, colorful socks, and--I have to say-- his great taste in hats.   And, while he will be deeply missed here in Congress and within our  Caucus, we will carry on in his memory by advocating for the causes he  dedicated his life to--supporting working families, communities of  color, children, immigrants and all those in need.   His legacy as a civil rights activist, judge, and powerful,  passionate leader in Congress will live on, and be a model for us all.
