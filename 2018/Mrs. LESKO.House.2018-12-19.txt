 Mr. Speaker, I ask for the members of the Arizona  delegation to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I and the rest of the Arizona delegation want to take a  minute to honor the life of Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores.   On December 6, Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores was killed during a  midair collision involving a marine refueling aircraft and a fighter  jet off the coast of Japan.   Staff Sergeant Flores always wanted to be a marine, and he did not  waste a moment. After his 2009 graduation from Valley Vista High School  in Surprise, Arizona, in my district, he enlisted in the Marines and  pursued the aviation field.   His military service made his family proud, even as he lived in  distant locations such as Japan, where he most recently served with  Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 at Marine Corps Air  Station Iwakuni.   As Americans, we are unconditionally bound together by the value of  freedom. Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores enlisted in the Marines and gave  his life to keep our country safe. His service symbolizes the values  America stands for. It represents the freedom he fought for, and for  that I am eternally grateful.   We can never repay the debt our Nation owes Staff Sergeant Flores or  his family, but we will always remember him and how he led his life in  the service of others.   His family and loved ones are in our prayers as they grieve during  this trying time, and Arizona is forever grateful for Staff Sergeant  Flores' service and dedication to our country.                            ____________________
