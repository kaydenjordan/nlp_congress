 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues in the  House for standing up and recognizing that we must get serious about  the opioid epidemic that is plaguing America.   In 2016, more than 42,000 Americans died from opioid overdose, almost  5,000 in Florida alone. We can no longer be satisfied with lip service  about this problem.   Over the next 2 weeks, we will be voting to crack down on the flow of  dangerous synthetic drugs through our postal system and strengthen  support systems for those who are battling addiction.   We will give our law enforcement the tools they need to get these  drugs out of our communities and increase medical research on  alternatives to opioid pain medication. Police and community leaders in  my district have made it clear: They need our help.   It is time to tackle the opioid epidemic head-on, and I believe we  are finally committed to doing exactly that.   I urge all my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills.                            ____________________
