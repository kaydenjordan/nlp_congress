 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S.J.  Res. 53, the resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review  Act on the Environmental Protection Agency's Affordable Clean Energy,  ACE rule. I fully support passage of the resolution.   Every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage climate change  is causing to our environment and economy. Increasing floods,  heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, and snowstorms have wreaked havoc on  communities across the country. We cannot continue to ignore that  climate change is already happening all around us. We must take  immediate action.   The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan established Federal  standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-fired power  plants. The plan set achievable carbon emissions reduction targets of  32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 to be reached by reducing emissions  from coal-fired power plants, shifting energy generation from fossil  fuels to renewable sources, and promoting energy conservation. The  Clean Power Plan not only helped drive the transition of our energy  generation to cleaner sources, it also served as the centerpiece of  U.S. efforts to lead the world in addressing climate change through the  Paris Climate Agreement.   The administration's rule would take us backward by repealing the  emissions reduction targets in the Clean Power Plan and replacing them  with less ambitious targets based on narrow energy efficiency  improvements that also wholly exempt natural gas-fired power plants. It  is clear that the new rules will likely result in more carbon  pollution, halt the accelerated trends toward low- and zero-carbon  energy, and have dire implications for our air quality and public  health.   For these reasons, I oppose the administration's rule and support  passage of Senator Cardin's resolution--S.J. Res. 53--to disapprove of  it.   Thank you.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
