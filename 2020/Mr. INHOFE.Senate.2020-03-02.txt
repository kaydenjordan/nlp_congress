 Mr. President, I rise today to honor MG Wilson A.  Shoffner, commanding general of the U.S. Army Fires Center of  Excellence and Fort Sill, OK. Major General Shoffner is one of our  Nation's finest military officers. Major General Shoffner will  relinquish command and conduct his retirement ceremony on 6 March 2020,  bringing to a close 32 years of distinguished service to our great  Nation.   In 1988, Major General Shoffner commissioned as a second lieutenant  of field artillery upon graduation from the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point. He commanded units at every echelon, from platoon to the  Fires Center of Excellence, with duty in Saudi Arabia, Germany, Iraq,  Afghanistan, and the United States. As a young officer, Major General  Shoffner deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division in support of OPERATION  DESERT STORM. Major General Shoffner commanded 2nd Battalion, 319th  Field Artillery Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division during OPERATION  IRAQI FREEDOM. Later, he served as deputy chief of staff,  communications, Resolute Support Mission, North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, during OPERATION FREEDOM'S SENTINEL in Afghanistan.   As a general officer, Major General Shoffner served as the deputy  chief of staff, G-3/5/7, for the Army's Training and Doctrine Command.  He served as the director of the Army's Talent Management Task Force  under the Army G1 and then as the director of operations for Rapid  Equipment Fielding under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army, Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. Major General Shoffner's  career culminated as the commanding general of the United States Army's  Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill, where he helped forge the  future of the Army's Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery  branches.   Major General Shoffner is an exceptional leader, an American patriot  committed to our Armed Forces, our National Security, and our Nation,  but most importantly, Major General Shoffner is a great man of  character. It is for MG Al Shoffner, a soldier, leader, and selfless  servant, whom we, with profound admiration and deep respect, pay  tribute to for all he has done for the defense of our Nation for over  three decades.   We thank Major General Shoffner, his wife Carron, and their daughter,  Kristin, for their dedication and sacrifice, and we wish them well in  the years to come.                            ____________________
