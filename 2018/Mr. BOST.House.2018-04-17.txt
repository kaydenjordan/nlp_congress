 Mr. Speaker, today I proudly honor the Murphysboro Middle  School Blue Devils Girls volleyball team for winning the Class L State  Championship for the second straight year.   Along the way, the team also captured their eighth consecutive Junior  Southwest Egyptian Conference title. That win was also a career  milestone for Coach Mike Layne. It marked the 1,000th combined career  win while coaching volleyball for Murphysboro Community Unit School  District at both the middle school and high school levels.   I extend a heartfelt congratulations to the players, coaching staff,  school officials, family, and friends who supported these young ladies  on their incredible journey. Southern Illinois is proud of you.   Go, Blue Devils.                            ____________________
