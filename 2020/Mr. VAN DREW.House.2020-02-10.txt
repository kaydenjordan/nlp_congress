 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to be removed as a  cosponsor of H.R. 51.    Madam Speaker, I honor Richard Palombo for an amazing  20 years of service as mayor of Upper Township in South Jersey.   Rich exemplifies leadership in his personal and his professional  life.   His gentle leadership is welcome at a time, unfortunately, when we  have bitter partisanship. I know firsthand of his ability after working  with him for years in his capacity as mayor.   Rich listens to every side and makes informed decisions which are  driven by his desire to have the best community possible, whether  Republican or Democrat.   At any given time of year, 1,500 to 2,000 student-age children will  be participating in sporting events at the area's sports complexes,  this is thanks to the leadership of Rich Palombo. I know how proud he  is, and should be, of this accomplishment.   Mayor Palombo has kept taxes and crime low without sacrificing  services, and I know his community always thanks him for that.   Congratulations, Rich. I look forward to our continuing relationship.  And thank you for all that you do for our great community and the  communities around you.   May God always bless you, and the best of luck for the future.                            ____________________
