 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday I voted to advance out of  committee President Biden's nomination of Pete Buttigieg as head of the  Department of Transportation, and the full Senate will soon vote to  confirm him.   I had a good meeting and discussion with Mr. Buttigieg last week. We  talked about a number of South Dakota transportation priorities.   Our Nation is due for another major infrastructure bill, and I asked  Mr. Buttigieg to commit to maintaining strong investments in rural  highway funding and other rural transportation priorities as part of  any infrastructure legislation. A strong rural transportation  infrastructure benefits the entire national transportation system by  connecting major highways and railways to the regions that produce so  many of the agricultural and industrial products that we rely on. It is  key to helping South Dakota farmers and ranchers and farmers and  ranchers around the country get their products to market.   I also asked Mr. Buttigieg to work with me to improve Tribal  transportation infrastructure. Right now, prosperous Tribes in populous  areas receive a disproportionate amount of Tribal transportation  funding, even though their needs are often less pressing than those  facing large rural Tribes, like those in South Dakota. I am committed  to ensuring that rural Tribes get their fair share of Tribal  transportation funding, and I was pleased that  [[Page S186]]  Mr. Buttigieg agreed to work with me on this issue.   I also enjoyed discussing autonomous vehicle legislation with him. He  shares my interest in the technological, environmental, and safety  benefits self-driving vehicles can offer, and I look forward to working  with him on this issue.   Highway bills have always been a place for bipartisan cooperation,  and the bill released last Congress by Senators Barrasso and Carper was  no exception. I hope that bipartisan tradition will continue in this  Congress and that Democrats and Republicans can work together to  deliver a significant infrastructure package in the near future                            ____________________     Madam President, on the subject of bipartisanship, I am  disturbed by the rumors that Democrats plan to use reconciliation to  force another COVID bill through Congress on partisan lines before even  giving good-faith effort to bipartisan negotiations.   Republicans are more than willing to work with Democrats on  additional targeted COVID relief legislation.   Now, I won't pretend that we don't have reservations about some of  the measures that Democrats have proposed. For instance, I don't think  an emergency COVID relief bill is the place to push through a change  that would more than double the Federal minimum wage and directly  increase expenses on businesses that have been decimated by the  pandemic. That is a policy with a lot of economic consequences, and it  shouldn't be pushed through Congress in a hasty fashion.   Republicans are also concerned about the enormous amount of money  that Democrats want to spend. We have already spent more than $4  trillion to address this pandemic, and we need to be very careful--very  careful--about additional spending and appropriate only what is  necessary to respond to this pandemic and with an eye to the burden  that we are putting on the economy and on young Americans as we  increase our national debt.   The higher our national debt, the greater the drag on economic growth  and the more likely it is that young Americans will face increasingly  burdensome tax bills in the future to meet our debt obligations.   But let me be very clear. While Republicans certainly have concerns  about some of the Democrats' proposals, we are committed to defeating  this pandemic and to getting Americans vaccinated, and we are ready to  work with Democrats on any necessary COVID relief legislation that  would achieve that objective.   It would be very disappointing if Democrats decided to shove a  partisan bill through Congress without even attempting to work with  Republicans.                            ____________________     Madam President, before I close, I want to take a moment  to recognize those South Dakotans participating in the virtual March  for Life tomorrow.   We have gotten used to saying ``it is going to be a little different  this year'' during the pandemic, and that applies to the March for Life  as well. Usually, tens of thousands of Americans travel to Washington,  DC, every January to participate in the march--Americans from every  State in the union, of every political persuasion, of every religion or  none at all--all united by their commitment to defending the dignity  and value and humanity of the unborn child.   This year the march will be virtual, but pro-life Americans will  still be united in spirit. To all of those South Dakotans virtually  marching tomorrow and to all those Americans everywhere united in the  pro-life cause, thank you. Thank you for standing--standing up every  year on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.   Most of all, thank you for everything that you do throughout the  year, because the biggest work of the pro-life movement happens outside  of the March for Life. It happens in churches around America, where  congregations collect money to support prenatal care for pregnant women  in need or gather diapers and baby supplies to give to struggling  mothers. It happens on college campuses, where pro-life students  educate their peers about the reality of abortion. It happens in crisis  pregnancy centers, where moms and dads facing unplanned pregnancies are  met with resources and love and support. It happens at maternity homes,  where single moms get the support they need to have their babies and to  build job skills or get an education.   Every day, you are building a culture of life in this country with  your work and your political action and your prayers. I know that is  not always easy, but the race is not to the swift nor the strong. It is  to those who endure, and I am confident that, sooner or later, right  and justice will prevail because we have the truth on our side--the  truth that every human being, no matter how old or how young, no matter  the race or the color of their skin, no matter their religion or  political persuasion, is created in the image and likeness of God and  has infinite dignity and worth.   So keep standing up for the babies, and tomorrow I will be joining my  prayers with yours that one day soon the right to life of unborn human  beings will be protected in law.   May God bless you all.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Cramer).   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 55, nays 42, as follows:                      [Rollcall Vote No. 10 Executive]                                  YEAS--55       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Van Hollen      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--42       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Risch      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--3       Cramer      Graham      Warne
