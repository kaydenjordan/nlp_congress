 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of over 3 million of our  fellow Americans who are facing a time of need right now, the people of  Puerto Rico.   Several of my colleagues have been working tirelessly to convey the  voices of the people of Puerto Rico following the earthquakes that they  have been experiencing over the past several weeks. Those voices must  be more widely heard in the media and across our society because our  fellow Americans are calling out for help.   The damage caused by this most recent disaster comes in addition to  the devastation of Hurricane Maria and the grossly inadequate Federal  response to that tragedy.   Today, the administration confirmed that it would finally end its  hold on disaster aid relief that Congress authorized for Puerto Rico  years ago. Now, in the wake of this most recent tragedy, the President  must approve a major disaster declaration today.   Constituents across my community have reached out to me with deep  concern for their friends and families, and nearly all of us represent  constituents of Puerto Rican origin. We cannot turn our backs on our  fellow citizens. We must stand with them and come to their aid.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 76, which was  introduced by my good friend and colleague from Nevada, Susie Lee, and  of which I am a proud cosponsor.   Students defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges can be left with  crushing debt, useless degrees, and none of the job opportunities they  were promised.   When Secretary DeVos has testified before the Education and Labor  Committee over the past year, on two separate occasions she has claimed  that students are her number one priority, as they should be. Yet, as  Secretary, she has acted at all times as though students are the enemy  and as though  [[Page H310]]  a quality and affordable education is her last priority.   Secretary DeVos has the ability to provide immediate relief to  students who were defrauded. Instead, she has halted loan relief for  borrowers and changed the rules to deprive them of relief. Under the  new rule from Secretary DeVos, defrauded borrowers can be denied debt  relief, even in cases where predatory schools clearly violated the law.    More than 7,000 Pennsylvanians are suffering while their applications  for financial relief are sitting in limbo at the Department of  Education. We must protect students and taxpayers by passing this  resolution, which blocks the DeVos rule from going into effect.   Students are my number one priority. Unfortunately, I don't believe  that the Secretary can say the same.   I am proud to stand up for students and to be an original cosponsor  of this resolution. I am also proud that the Education and Labor  Committee recently passed the College Affordability Act out of  committee, which would provide more protections for students and  taxpayers.
