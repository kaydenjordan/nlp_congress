 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4616) to deem certain references to LIBOR as referring to a  replacement benchmark rate upon the occurrence of certain events  affecting LIBOR, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4616         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Adjustable Interest Rate       (LIBOR) Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in more than $200       trillion of contracts worldwide;        (2) a significant number of existing contracts that       reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of a clearly       defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR       is discontinued; and        (3) the cessation or non-representativeness of LIBOR could       result in disruptive litigation related to existing contracts       that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or       practicable replacement benchmark rate.        (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--        (1) to establish a clear and uniform process, on a       nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts       the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly       defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate, without       affecting the ability of  [[Page H7480]]       parties to use any appropriate benchmark rate in new       contracts;        (2) to preclude litigation related to existing contracts       the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly       defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate; and        (3) to allow existing contracts that reference LIBOR but       provide for the use of a clearly defined fallback and       practicable replacement rate, to operate according to their       terms.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be       construed to disfavor the use of any benchmark rate on a       prospective basis.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         As used in this Act, the following terms shall have the       following meanings:        (1) ``Benchmark'' shall mean an index of interest rates or       dividend rates that is used, in whole or in part, as the       basis of or as a reference for calculating or determining any       valuation, payment or other measurement.        (2) ``Benchmark Administrator'' means a person that       publishes a Benchmark for use by third parties.        (3) ``Benchmark Replacement'' shall mean a Benchmark, or an       interest rate or dividend rate (which may or may not be based       in whole or in part on a prior setting of LIBOR), to replace       LIBOR or any interest rate or dividend rate based on LIBOR,       whether on a temporary, permanent, or indefinite basis, under       or in respect of a LIBOR Contract.        (4) ``Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes'' shall mean       any technical, administrative, or operational changes,       alterations, or modifications that--        (A) the Board determines, in its discretion, would address       one or more issues affecting the implementation,       administration, and calculation of the Board-Selected       Benchmark Replacement in LIBOR contracts; or        (B) solely with respect to a LIBOR Contract that is not a       Consumer Loan, in the reasonable judgment of a Calculating       Person, are otherwise necessary or appropriate to permit the       implementation, administration, and calculation of the Board-      Selected Benchmark Replacement under or in respect of a LIBOR       Contract after giving due consideration to any Benchmark       Replacement Conforming Changes under subparagraph (A).        (5) ``Board'' means the Board of Governors of the Federal       Reserve System.        (6)(A) ``Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement'' shall mean       a Benchmark Replacement identified by the Board that is based       on SOFR.        (B) The Board shall adjust the Board-Selected Benchmark       Replacement for each category of LIBOR Contract that the       Board may identify to--        (i) apply to each LIBOR tenor; and        (ii) incorporate the relevant Tenor Spread Adjustment.        (C) For Consumer Loans, the Board-Selected Benchmark       Replacement shall initially reflect the spread between the       Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement and LIBOR immediately       before the LIBOR Replacement Date and shall incorporate the       relevant Tenor Spread Adjustment over a one-year transition       period.        (7) ``Calculating Person'' shall mean, with respect to any       LIBOR Contract, any person (which may be the Determining       Person) responsible for calculating or determining any       valuation, payment, or other measurement based on a       Benchmark.        (8) ``Consumer Loan'' shall mean a consumer credit       transaction. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms       ``consumer'' and ``credit'' have the meaning given those       terms, respectively, under section 103 of the Truth in       Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602).        (9) ``Determining Person'' shall mean, with respect to any       LIBOR Contract, any person with the authority, right, or       obligation, including on a temporary basis, (as identified by       the provisions of the LIBOR Contract, or as identified by the       governing law of the LIBOR Contract, as appropriate) to       determine a Benchmark Replacement.        (10) ``Fallback Provisions'' shall mean terms in a LIBOR       Contract for determining a Benchmark Replacement, including       any terms relating to the date on which the Benchmark       Replacement becomes effective.        (11) ``LIBOR'' shall mean the overnight and 1-, 3-, 6-, and       12-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (formerly known as the       London interbank offered rate) as administered by ICE       Benchmark Administration Limited (or any predecessor or       successor thereof). LIBOR shall not include the 1-week or 2-      month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR.        (12) ``LIBOR Contract'' shall mean, without limitation, any       contract, agreement, indenture, organizational documents,       guarantee, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, Security (whether       representing debt or equity, and including any interest in a       corporation, a partnership, or a limited liability company),       instrument, or other obligation or asset that, by its terms,       continues in any way to use LIBOR as a Benchmark as of the       applicable LIBOR Replacement Date.        (13) ``LIBOR Replacement Date'' shall mean the first London       banking day after June 30, 2023, unless the Board determines       that any LIBOR tenor will cease to be published or cease to       be representative on a different date.        (14) ``Security'' shall have the meaning assigned to such       term in section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.       77b(a)).        (15) ``SOFR'' shall mean the Secured Overnight Financing       Rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or a       successor administrator).        (16) ``Tenor Spread Adjustment'' shall mean--        (A) 0.00644 percent for overnight LIBOR;        (B) 0.11448 percent for 1-month LIBOR;        (C) 0.26161 percent for 3-month LIBOR;        (D) 0.42826 percent for 6-month LIBOR; and        (E) 0.71513 percent for 12-month LIBOR.       SEC. 4. LIBOR CONTRACTS.         (a) On the LIBOR Replacement Date, the Board-Selected       Benchmark Replacement shall, by operation of law, be the       Benchmark Replacement for any LIBOR Contract that, after       giving any effect to subsection (b)--        (1) contains no Fallback Provisions; or        (2) contains Fallback Provisions that identify neither--        (A) a specific Benchmark Replacement; nor        (B) a Determining Person.        (b) On the LIBOR Replacement Date, any references in the       Fallback Provisions of a LIBOR Contract to--        (1) a Benchmark Replacement that is based in any way on any       LIBOR value, except to account for the difference between       LIBOR and the Benchmark Replacement, or        (2) a requirement that a person (other than a Benchmark       Administrator) conduct a poll, survey, or inquiries for       quotes or information concerning interbank lending or deposit       rates,      shall be disregarded as if not included in the Fallback       Provisions of such LIBOR Contract and shall be deemed null       and void and without any force or effect.        (c) Subject to subsection (g)(2), a Determining Person       shall have authority under this Act, but shall not be       required, to select the Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement       as the Benchmark Replacement.        (d) Any selection by a Determining Person of the Board-      Selected Benchmark Replacement pursuant to subsection (c)       shall be--        (1) irrevocable;        (2) made by the earlier of the LIBOR Replacement Date and       the latest date for selecting a Benchmark Replacement       according to the terms of such LIBOR Contract; and        (3) used in any determinations of the Benchmark under or in       respect of such LIBOR Contract occurring on and after the       LIBOR Replacement Date.        (e) If a Determining Person has authority to select the       Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement under subsection (c) but       does not select a Benchmark Replacement by the date specified       in subsection (d)(2), then, on the LIBOR Replacement Date,       the Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement shall, by operation       of law, be the Benchmark Replacement for the LIBOR Contract.        (f) If the Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement becomes the       Benchmark Replacement for a LIBOR Contract pursuant to       subsection (a), (c), or (e) then all Benchmark Replacement       Conforming Changes shall become an integral part of such       LIBOR Contract by operation of law. For the avoidance of       doubt, a Calculating Person shall not be required to obtain       consent from any other person prior to the adoption of       Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.        (g) The provisions of this Act shall not alter or impair--        (1) any written agreement specifying that a LIBOR Contract       shall not be subject to this Act;        (2) any LIBOR Contract that contains Fallback Provisions       that identify a Benchmark Replacement that is not based in       any way on any LIBOR value (including, but not limited to,       the prime rate or the Effective Federal Funds Rate), except       that such LIBOR Contract shall be subject to subsection (b);        (3) any LIBOR Contract subject to subsection (c) as to       which a Determining Person does not elect to use a Board-      Selected Benchmark Replacement pursuant to subsection (c),       except to the extent that such LIBOR Contract is subject to       subsection (b) or (e);        (4) the application to a Board-Selected Benchmark       Replacement of any cap, floor, modifier, or spread adjustment       to which LIBOR had been subject pursuant to the terms of a       LIBOR Contract; or        (5) any provisions of Federal consumer financial law that       require creditors to notify borrowers regarding a change-in-      terms or that govern the reevaluation of rate increases on       credit card accounts under open-end (not home-secured)       consumer credit plans.        (h) Except as provided in section 5(c), the provisions of       this Act shall not alter or impair the rights or obligations       of any person, or the authorities of any agency, under       Federal consumer financial law (as defined in section       1002(14) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5481(14)).       SEC. 5. CONTINUITY OF CONTRACT AND SAFE HARBOR.         (a) A Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement and the       selection or use of a Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement as       a Benchmark Replacement under or in respect of a LIBOR       Contract, as well as any Benchmark Replacement Conforming       Changes, by operation of section 4 shall constitute--        (1) a commercially reasonable replacement for and a       commercially substantial equivalent to LIBOR;        (2) a reasonable, comparable, or analogous rate, index, or       term for LIBOR;        (3) a replacement that is based on a methodology or       information that is similar or comparable to LIBOR;        (4) substantial performance by any person of any right or       obligation relating to or based on LIBOR; and  [[Page H7481]]         (5) a replacement that has historical fluctuations that are       substantially similar to those of LIBOR for purposes of the       Truth in Lending Act and its implementing regulations.        (b) Neither of (1) the selection or use of a Board-Selected       Benchmark Replacement as a Benchmark Replacement or (2) the       determination, implementation, or performance of Benchmark       Replacement Conforming Changes, in each case by operation of       section 4, shall (A) be deemed to impair or affect the right       of any person to receive a payment, or to affect the amount       or timing of such payment, under any LIBOR Contract or (B)       have the effect of (i) discharging or excusing performance       under any LIBOR Contract for any reason, claim, or defense       (including, but not limited to, any force majeure or other       provision in any LIBOR Contract), (ii) giving any person the       right to unilaterally terminate or suspend performance under       any LIBOR Contract, (iii) constituting a breach of any LIBOR       Contract, or (iv) voiding or nullifying any LIBOR Contract.        (c) No person shall be subject to any claim or cause of       action in law or equity or request for equitable relief, or       have liability for damages, arising out of--        (1) the selection or use of a Board-Selected Benchmark       Replacement,        (2) the implementation of Benchmark Replacement Conforming       Changes, or        (3) with respect to a LIBOR Contract that is not a Consumer       Loan, the determination of Benchmark Replacement Conforming       Changes,      in each case after giving effect to the provisions of section       4; provided, however, that in each case any person (including       a Calculating Person) shall remain subject to the terms of a       LIBOR Contract that are not affected by this Act and any       existing legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations to       correct servicing or other ministerial errors under or in       respect of a LIBOR Contract.        (d) The selection or use of a Board-Selected Benchmark       Replacement or the determination, implementation, or       performance of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, in       each case by operation of section 4, shall not be deemed to--        (1) be an amendment or modification of any LIBOR Contract       for the purpose of the governing law of such LIBOR Contract;       or        (2) prejudice, impair, or affect any person's rights,       interests, or obligations under or in respect of any LIBOR       Contract.        (e) Except as provided in either subsections (a), (b), or       (c) of section 4, the provisions of this Act shall not be       interpreted as creating any negative inference or negative       presumption regarding the validity or enforceability of--        (1) any Benchmark Replacement (including any method for       calculating, determining, or implementing an adjustment to       the Benchmark Replacement to account for any historical       differences between LIBOR and the Benchmark Replacement) that       is not a Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement; or        (2) any changes, alterations, or modifications to or in       respect of a LIBOR Contract that are not Benchmark       Replacement Conforming Changes.       SEC. 6. PREEMPTION.         (a) This Act and the regulations hereunder shall supersede       any and all laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or standards       of any State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or       possession of the United States, insofar as they provide for       the selection or use of a Benchmark Replacement or related       conforming changes.        (b) No provision of State or local law that expressly       limits the manner of calculating interest, including the       compounding of interest, shall apply to the selection or use       of a Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement or Benchmark       Replacement Conforming Changes.       SEC. 7. TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939.         Section 316 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C.       77ppp) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' after ``of subsection (a),'' in       subsection (b); and        (2) by inserting ``, and except that the right of any       holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the       principal of and interest on such indenture security shall       not be deemed to be impaired or affected by any change       occurring by the application of section 4 of the Adjustable       Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 to any indenture security''       after ``subject to such lien'' in subsection (b).       SEC. 8. RULEMAKING.         Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Board shall issue such regulations as may be       necessary or appropriate to enable it to administer and carry       out the purposes of this Act.       SEC. 9. REVISED CALCULATION RULE TO ADDRESS INSTANCES WHERE                     1-MONTH USD LIBOR CEASES OR IS NON-                    REPRESENTATIVE.         Section 438(b)(2)(I) of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 1087-1(b)(2)(I)) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(viii) Revised calculation rule to address instances       where 1-month usd libor ceases or is non-representative.--         ``(I) Substitute reference index.--The provisions of this       clause apply to loans for which the special allowance payment       would otherwise be calculated pursuant to clause (vii).        ``(II) Calculation based on sofr.--For loans described in       subclause (III) or (IV), the special allowance payment       described in this subclause shall be substituted for the       payment provided under clause (vii). For each calendar       quarter, the formula for computing the special allowance that       would otherwise apply under clause (vii) shall be revised by       substituting `of the quotes of the 30-day Average Secured       Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in effect for each of the       days in such quarter as published by the Federal Reserve Bank       of New York (or a successor administrator), adjusted daily by       adding the Tenor Spread Adjustment, as that term is defined       in the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021, for 1-      month LIBOR contracts of 0.11448 percent' for `of the 1-month       London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for United States       dollars in effect for each of the days in such quarter as       compiled and released by the British Bankers Association'.       The special allowance calculation for loans subject to clause       (vii) shall otherwise remain in effect.        ``(III) Loans eligible for sofr-based calculation.--Except       as provided in subclause (IV), the special allowance payment       calculated under subclause (II) shall apply to all loans for       which the holder (or, if the holder acts as an eligible       lender trustee for the beneficial owner of the loan, the       beneficial owner of the loan) at any time after the effective       date of this clause notifies the Secretary that the holder or       beneficial owner affirmatively and permanently elects to       waive all contractual, statutory, or other legal rights to a       special allowance paid under clause (vii) or to the special       allowance paid pursuant to any other formula that was       previously in effect with respect to such loan, and accepts       the rate described in subclause (II). Any such waiver shall       apply to all loans then held, or to be held from time to       time, by such holder or beneficial owner; provided that, due       to the need to obtain the approval of one of the following,       demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary--         ``(aa) one or more third parties with a legal or beneficial       interest in loans eligible for the SOFR-based calculation, or        ``(bb) a nationally recognized rating organization       assigning a rating to a financing secured by loans otherwise       eligible for the SOFR-based calculation,       the holder of the loan (or, if the holder acts as an eligible       lender trustee for the beneficial owner of the loan, the       beneficial owner of the loan) may elect to apply the rate       described in subclause (II) to specified loan portfolios       established for financing purposes by separate notices with       different effective dates.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we show that the House of Representatives can deal  with a really big problem before it becomes a crisis and before almost  anybody even knows that there is a problem. We can deal with such a  problem without drama, without deadlock, without partisanship. We can  do it a year and a half before it all explodes, so as to give the  Senate, the regulatory agencies,  [[Page H7482]]  and the private sector the time that they need to do this job long  before the impending uncertainty disrupts our economy.   As co-chair of the CPA Caucus, I am here to certify that this is the  most important genuinely boring bill that will come before this House  this year.   Mr. Speaker, there are trillions of outstanding loans that have  adjustable interest rates. The adjustment of these loans is tied to the  London Interbank Offered Rates, known as LIBOR. LIBOR has been referred  to as the most important interest rate in the world.   We are dealing here with adjustable rate mortgages, business loans  and securities, and even some student loans. For many years LIBOR was  the index. When LIBOR went up, the interest rate on these instruments  would go up. When LIBOR went down, the interest would go down. For many  years it worked well.   LIBOR is based on a survey of British bankers. A few years ago some  British bankers lied and some went to jail. Our friends across the pond  said they would stop publishing the LIBOR index. We asked them to keep  doing it. They are going to stop on June 30, 2023.   Some $16 trillion of loans and business instruments will still be  outstanding. Those instruments will specify that you calculate the  interest rate based on LIBOR, and LIBOR will not exist.   These $16 trillion of loans and other business instruments do not  specify what is supposed to happen if you go to calculate the interest  rate based on LIBOR and there is no LIBOR. That is why they are called  tough legacy LIBOR instruments.   We could do what all too often happens in Washington--we could ignore  the problem. We could then leave it up to tens of thousands of class  action lawsuits, hundreds of thousands of regular lawsuits, as borrower  and lender try to figure out what interest rate would apply. That would  be terrible for our economy and our court system.   We have got a better idea. The legislation before us today, H.R.  4616, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, which will provide  borrowers, investors, and all those in the financial space certainty as  to what happens when LIBOR is no longer published.   Before I continue, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking  Member McHenry, and their staff for working closely with me to get this  bill on the floor today. I particularly want to thank Rob Robilliard of  my staff who has poured his heart and soul into this bill for the  entire year.   I am pleased to say that H.R. 4616 has received the support of 21  business organizations, I would say every business organization with a  stake in this matter, including the American Bankers Association, the  Independent Bankers, and the Chamber of Commerce.   I want to particularly thank Kristi Leo, President of the Structured  Finance Association, for working with us on this bill. The legislation  has also won the support of so many public interest groups, including  the National Consumer Law Center and Americans for Financial Reform.   I particularly want to thank Andrew Pizor of the National Consumer  Law Center for his assistance.   Not only has this legislation received support from these important  organizations, but every word--and I mean every word--has been  carefully reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury  Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of  Controller of the Currency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have revised it again and  again based on their comments.   Each of these agencies has cleared on every word of the bill before  us today. Once again, I want to thank the staff, particularly of the  Federal Reserve, for their excellent work for helping us draft this  legislation: Mackenzie Gross, Evan Winerman, and Mark Van Der Weide.   This text before us is a consensus product and all the agencies have  signed off. We have worked with over 100 different organizations and  groups, and to my knowledge none oppose the text that is before us  today.   I want to thank the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, which was  convened by the New York Fed which created the structured overnight  finance rates, which are based on the treasury markets. Those markets  are public, transparent, and not subject to manipulation. It is a broad  market. Unlike the LIBOR rate, it is not subject to manipulation.   This bill provides that as to that $16 trillion of tough legacy  LIBOR, pursuant to regulations published by the Fed, the various SOFR  rates that are applicable will stand in for the LIBOR rate once the  LIBOR rate is no longer published. It sounds simple, but let me tell  you it has been a hell of a year as you try to get consensus on a bill  affecting $16 trillion.    Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about why this bill is  necessary and why it is so important. Just 2 months ago, October 20,  the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the FDIC in conjunction with the State  Bank and Credit Union Regulators issued a joint statement stating that  failure to adequately prepare for LIBOR's discontinuance could  undermine the financial stability and safety and soundness of the  institutions they oversee.   The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which we created in  response to the 2008 meltdown, said that a cessation of LIBOR has the  potential to significantly disrupt our financial markets. The SEC  similarly warned that LIBOR's discontinuance may pose a significant  risk to our stock and bond markets.   Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Board Chair Powell told us  that we need legislation to deal with this matter at the Federal level,  and it is bipartisan. Steve Mnuchin testified to the same thing when he  was Secretary of the Treasury in the Trump administration.   Finally, I should point out that Federal Reserve Chair Powell has  told us that failure to deal with this presents a big financial  stability risk to our entire economy.   As to the scope of this bill, it deals only with tough legacy LIBOR.  It does not deal with those instruments that expire while LIBOR is  still published, nor does it deal with those instruments that are  created in the future and do not reference LIBOR.   There was an earlier draft of this bill that set forth the obvious,  and that is the substitution of SOFR for the LIBOR index does not  constitute a sale or exchange for tax purposes. We took that out  because we wanted to move the bill quickly and not cause a referral to  the Ways and Means Committee. Mostly we took it out because it was  absolutely unnecessary.   It is very clear under existing tax law, the change of one index to  another index that is incredibly similar, in this case, designed to be  as close as humanly possible does not constitute a sale or exchange,  but especially where that change is through the operation of law and  where the change is necessitated because the original index is no  longer published. The tax outcome is obvious and does not need to be  part of the statute.   The last change we made in this bill was to add the words ``for  purposes of the governing law of such LIBOR contracts'' to section  5(d). We did that to make it clear that we weren't dealing with any tax  issue and anybody could hold it up to a magnifying glass and try to  find a tax word in it. By putting these words in it we satisfied the  Committee on Ways and Means. There is no taxation in this statute.   This law does deal and preempts the field with regard to all non-tax  law, that means contract, commercial, financial law at both the  Federal, State, and local level.   Finally, this act does not prescribe what interest rates ought to be  used in the future. That is up to the parties involved. Nothing in this  bill is designed to encourage the use of SOFR or any other particular  benchmark interest rate, nor does it encourage or authorize any Federal  regulatory agency to push any bank or other institution to use any  particular rate in the future. That is up to them.   This bill deals with $16 trillion of tough legacy LIBOR. It is a  consensus product. It is the result of the work of regulators,  industry, and the public interest community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption and I reserve the balance of my  time.

Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 4616, the ``Adjustable       Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021,'' the Committee on Ways       and Means agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as       to provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4616.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E.

Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to acknowledge your letter       dated December 7, 2021, regarding the waiver by the Committee       on Ways and Means of any jurisdictional claims over the       matters contained in H.R. 4616, the ``Adjustable Interest       Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021.'' The Committee on Financial       Services confirms our mutual understanding that your       Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and your       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Ways and Means should this bill or similar       language be considered in a conference with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Congressional Record during       Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.                                  ______                                            Committee on Education and Labor, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, December 7, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I write concerning H.R. 4616, the       Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021. This bill was       primarily referred to the Committee on Financial Services,       and additionally to the Committee on Education and Labor. As       a result of your having consulted with me concerning this       bill generally, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the       bill so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of H.R. 4616, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       we may address any remaining issues within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Committee Report filed by       the Committee on Financial Services and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4616.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Committee on Financial Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to acknowledge your letter       dated December 7, 2021, regarding the waiver by the Committee       on Education and Labor of any jurisdictional claims over the       matters contained in H.R. 4616, the ``Adjustable Interest       Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021.'' The Committee on Financial       Services confirms our mutual understanding that your       Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and your       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Education and Labor should this bill or similar       language be considered in a conference with the Senate.

Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to respond to this gentleman's remarks about the  process. First, this bill is a good bill. Vote for the bill. There is  no doubt this bill is a good bill.   I don't need to talk about the process, but I will for just a second.  As to whether we had sufficient hearings and enough hearings that match  the interest of this House, we had a full hearing of my subcommittee on  this, and it is not as if 400 Members of the House showed up and said:  We are not a member of the subcommittee, but can we participate?   It is not as if the balcony is filled. It is not as if we deprived  our colleagues of information they were anxious to obtain.   But it is not just one hearing of the subcommittee. I regarded at  least a dozen of the hearings of the Financial Services Committee over  the last 2 years as hearings on LIBOR. In my opening remarks, I quoted  what Secretary Mnuchin said. He said that in response to my questions  when he came before us at hearings. The gentleman knows that at least  probably a dozen hearings that we have had at Financial Services where  we had the Secretary of the Treasury, where we had the Chair of the  Federal Reserve, where we had other experts, I asked a question about  LIBOR. And if my colleagues had found this subject near as interesting  as I do, they would have asked questions about LIBOR as well. So we had  one hearing dedicated to LIBOR and a dozen and more hearings where  those dedicated to LIBOR could have asked questions.   As to whether people in this House should think that we are  interfering with the rights of businesses to transact business, I  include in the Record a letter in support of this bill signed by 21  business groups basically, every business group that deals with any  instrument tied to the LIBOR index.                                                  December 7, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader McCarthy: We, the       undersigned organizations, support H.R. 4616, the       ``Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act,'' to address ``tough       legacy'' contracts that currently reference LIBOR. We       respectfully request the House of Representatives       expeditiously pass this legislation.        In June 2023, all tenors of US dollar LIBOR, one of the       most important financial benchmarks that underpins nearly       $200 trillion in financial contracts, will cease to be       published. As a result, there are trillions of dollars of       hard to modify financial contracts, securities, and loans       that use LIBOR--known as ``tough legacy'' contracts--that are       unable, before this end date, to either convert to a non-      LIBOR rate or amend the contracts to add adequate fallback       language to another rate. Without federal legislation to       address these contracts, investors, consumers, and issuers of       securities may face years of uncertainty, litigation, and a       change in value. This would thereby create ambiguity that       would lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in       volatility.        H.R. 4616 provides a solution for these ``tough legacy''       contracts that have insufficient fallback language and cannot       otherwise be amended among the parties. The legislation is       narrowly crafted to allow parties to contracts that already       have effective fallback provisions to opt-out of the       legislation and to only apply to tough legacy contracts so       that new or future business will not be affected. In       addition, the legislation offers uniform, equitable treatment       for all U.S. contracts that fall under the federal       legislation. It creates a safe harbor from litigation for       parties that are covered by the legislation and prevents       otherwise inevitable litigation costs and gridlock. The need       for uniform federal legislation has been expressed by       consumer groups, investors, financial regulators, and       industry participants.        We thank the House Committee on Financial Services for       providing a bipartisan solution that offers fair, equitable       and consistent treatment for all ``tough legacy'' contracts       in support of the LIBOR transition by passing H.R. 4616 out       of the committee by voice vote. We wholeheartedly support the       Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and ask that you and all       Members of the House of Representatives vote in favor of this       critical legislation.            Sincerely,        Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association       (SIFMA); Structured Finance Association (SFA); Bank Policy       Institute; National Association of Corporate Treasurers;       Education Finance Council; The Loan Syndications and Trading       Association (LSTA); The International Swaps and Derivatives       Association (ISDA); The Real Estate Roundtable; The Financial       Services Forum; Institute of International Bankers;       Government Finance Officers Association.        Mortgage Bankers Association; Commercial Real Estate       Finance Council (CREFC); Consumer Bankers Association;       Investment Company Institute; Institute for Portfolio       Alternatives; Independent Community Bankers of America; U.S.       Chamber of Commerce, Center for Capital Markets       Competitiveness; Housing Policy Council; Student Loan       Servicing Alliance; American Bankers Association; The       American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI).     Finally, as to the issue, I agree with the gentleman  that I would like to have had this bill come up 2\1/2\ years before  LIBOR ceased to be published. We are bringing this to this House 1\1/2\  years before LIBOR ceases to be published. Compared to everything else  in Washington, that is record time. I speak today on a fiscal year that  began October 1 where we hope to pass the appropriations bills in  February. Dealing with a problem 1\1/2\ years before it happens may not  be 2\1/2\ years in advance, but it is good compared to everything else  I have seen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply say to my Republican  colleagues who may be watching: You don't have to trust the 21 business  groups who have signed the letter that I just included in the Record,  and you don't have to trust me. Listen to the words you just heard from  our colleague, Mr. Hill: This bill does not increase government or  regulatory power. You ought to vote for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would be thrilled.    Will the gentleman yield?    This bill reflects an awful lot of work by the  regulators, particularly the Fed.    Absolutely.    I have long advocated for a unicameral legislature.    If I can comment on that further?    The Senate has addressed this issue, and they have  discussed the bill. Most of the commentary has been positive. There was  a recent hearing.   In particular, I believe that Mr. Toomey had a concern that somehow  this bill would influence future instruments and that somehow  regulators would be pushing banks, particularly smaller banks, to use  SOFR in the instruments they draft in the future. That is why the  report that accompanies this bill makes it excruciatingly clear that  nothing in this bill authorizes, directs, encourages, or allows a  regulator to point to this bill and say: Now, bank, you need to use  SOFR in the instruments used in the future.   Nothing in this bill authorizes a regulator to push or give a  preference to any other regulation. The report language was drafted  with Senator Toomey in mind.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will simply comment again, for the record. This bill deals with  tough legacy LIBOR instruments drafted in the past, and nothing in it-- and you can look at every word of all 22 pages--nothing in it would  allow anyone to say you have got to use SOFR, or you ought to use SOFR,  or we give you a preference to use SOFR, or any other benchmark in any  instrument you draft in the future. And just in case that wasn't  excruciatingly clear, we put it in the report as well.   Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the right to close. I have no other  speakers, so I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am prepared to close.   As to the process, we have had a dozen hearings with the top  financial officials in the U.S. Government over a period of 2 or 3  years at the full committee, in which it was appropriate and, in my  case, I used this opportunity to bring up the LIBOR issue. They have  testified again and again that we need Federal legislation.   Then the six regulatory agencies involved each have reviewed this  down to the comma, and we have had discussions, down to the comma. They  have helped us draft legislation.   My hope is that we not only pass this legislation today, but that my  Republican colleagues help me pass this bill through the Senate in the  current form. You want a form that reflects the regulators? Every comma  reflects what the regulators would like to see.   It is important that this bill not be held up in the Senate by those  who want to change existing law and say, well, not only should this act  not allow a regulator to push a bank toward this or that index, but if  any other law gives the regulators the power to do that, we should  strip that authority from them. That is not the purpose of this bill.   If somebody wants a bill titled, regulators shouldn't be pushed to  telling banks what to do on indexes, I will work with the gentleman, if  he wants to, on a freedom to pick your own index bill. This is a bill  to just deal with LIBOR.   So my hope is that we will have Republican House Members who urge the  Senate to move quickly because, yes, it would have been better to deal  with this issue 2\1/2\ years in advance. We have dealt with it 1\1/2\  years in advance; a full hearing, a full markup, a full opportunity for  anyone to submit amendments at that full markup, and a dozen hearings,  at which it was appropriate to address questions--at least I did--of  the top officials in our country dealing with financial matters about  the importance of LIBOR.   This bill is important because it deals with $16 trillion of  instruments where we will not be able to calculate how much the  borrower must pay the lender after June 30 of 2023 unless we pass this  bill.   This is a consensus product. The consumer and public interest groups,  the business groups, the regulators, and we are passing it and need to  pass it expeditiously so that we deal with this issue long before it  disrupts our financial markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
