 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 326.   It is critical that we take serious steps to reiterate the United  States commitment towards a just two-state solution to the conflict  that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace side by  side.   Unfortunately, recent developments have put this vision, which  remains the only viable framework for a lasting peace in the region,  further out of reach.   Settlement activity in the West Bank has increasingly threatened the  viability of a future Palestinian state in the region, and there is now  open talk of Israeli annexation of the Jordan Valley. Settlements erode  any possibility of a continuous, viable Palestinian state.   Additionally, the Trump administration's recent move to overturn  decades of U.S. policy and legitimize the settlement activity  represents a body blow to future peace and prosperity. In addition, the  Trump administration's policies have discredited valid Palestinian  claims to also have their capital in Jerusalem. We also cannot forget  the humanitarian situation in Gaza which is untenable.   Mr. Speaker, this demands a response, and that is why we need a two- state solution to deal with it.
