 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing resolution.   I listened carefully to what the gentleman said just prior to my  taking the floor, and I wish that the other body had done its work. We  did ours. I am pretty proud of our Members.   This bill ensures that the Federal Government and its lights stay on,  that we pay our bills on time, and that the people's business continues  while negotiations on a full year's spending deal proceed.   While we are hopeful an agreement can quickly be reached, I am really  disappointed that the Senate continues to delay while so much is at  stake. I really don't understand the problem over there.   For each day that we delay in passing a full-year appropriations  bill, we send a message of uncertainty that has consequences for the  business of the American people. Be glad you are not a contracting  officer in one of the agencies, certainly the Department of Defense, at  this point.   For our subcommittee, my bill, the Energy and Water Development, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill, proposes key investments to the  Army Corps of Engineers, in our Nation's crumbling water  infrastructure, and in the energy innovation pipeline that is so  essential to sustaining life on Earth. The United States must remain at  the forefront of energy innovation to address climate change, so vital  to people across the globe.   This bill essentially offers a pathway, and that is all it is, for  our committees to negotiate on a final bill that makes these key  investments and many others across committees.   In addition to giving Congress the space to finalize our bills, this  continuing resolution makes key investments in the Census, and they  make those investments as soon as the bill passes.   We must ensure a complete census count. In fact, the country can't  wait even 1 month to invest in this ramp-up effort. Ads are out all  across the country. The Census Bureau has to do its job.                                time  1430    And the Census will support reapportionment and will impact  everything the Federal Government does, from grant programs to  redistricting.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so the committees  can move toward full agreement. I urge prayerful thoughts for our  colleagues over in the other body to do their work so that we don't  have to use up the full time before December 20 and we can actually  pass the bills that are necessary before that time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) of the Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations  Committee, who does such a fine job.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this  continuing resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
