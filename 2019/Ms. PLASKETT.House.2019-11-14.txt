 Mr. Speaker, I recently spent time visiting schools  throughout the Virgin Islands.   While it is always exciting to spend time with our young people, it  was sad to see that the school libraries across the territory are in  dire need of books and librarians to provide students and teachers with  educational resources, including territory-specific material that will  enlighten our young people about their rich heritage. We all have to do  better.   My office also hosted two townhalls with officials from the VA and  the U.S. Postal Service to discuss issues facing our veterans and the  community at large. Within the next few months, it is my hope that both  the Postal Service and the VA will make measurable progress.   I thank members of my community for coming out, particularly our  veterans, because, on Monday, we commemorated Veterans Day, paying  tribute to men and women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces.   Elmer Davis once said it ``will remain the land of the free only for  so long as it is the home of the brave.''   I am proud that the Virgin Islands has one of the highest rates of  military service in our country, including my father.   I thank every veteran across the Nation for your service to America  and to freedom.  [[Page H8837]]                                ____________________
