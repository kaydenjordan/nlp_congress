 Madam President, I rose in this Chamber 2 weeks ago to  again urge the Senate to reopen the U.S. Capitol and to reopen the  Senate office buildings. At that time, Democrats objected to my  resolution in support of reopening. Two weeks later, it has become even  more clear that the American public is tired of government mandates and  of COVID shutdowns.   Democrats have exploited the pandemic to execute a power grab over  American life--a power grab that allows Democrats to dictate whether  children can attend schools, whether Americans can keep their jobs and  operate their businesses, and how elections are conducted. These Big  Government lockdowns and mandates have caused irreparable damage that  will be felt for generations to come. As we move ahead, we mustn't lose  sight of this lesson.   On the bright side, even the Biden administration is seeing the poll  numbers, and they are adjusting the science accordingly. On Friday, the  CDC changed its guidance once again. Now indoor masks are not  recommended for most Americans. Masks are no longer required on either  side of the Capitol Building. Why, even Washington, DC, has opened up  and lifted its mask mandate. Amazingly, all of this happened just in  time for the State of the Union Address.   The only science that is being followed here is the political  science, but, thankfully, America is returning to normal. Americans  everywhere are safely living their lives--going to work and school,  visiting stores, attending events, and gathering with their families  and their friends. They shouldn't have to know somebody in order to  visit their Representatives, to take a tour of the Capitol, to get into  this building.   It is time for the lockdown on democracy to come to an end. Today, I  am once again asking my colleagues to rejoin reality and reopen the  Capitol to those to whom it belongs--the American people.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules  and Administration be discharged from further consideration and that  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 512.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I am glad that the Senate has agreed to  my resolution to reopen the Capitol, and I urge the House of  Representatives to pass a very similar resolution that was introduced  in that body so that all parts of the Capitol Complex are open to the  American people.   I also stand ready to work with my colleagues and with the Capitol  Police to implement this resolution so that we can welcome the American  people back into their Capitol as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
