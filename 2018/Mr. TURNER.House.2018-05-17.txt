 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of my amendment to the farm  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I had a great conversation today with Secretary of  Agriculture Perdue in which he spoke very highly of the students,  faculty, and the president of Central State University during his visit  to the university. Central State University is in my congressional  district, and I want to thank Secretary Perdue for his leadership.   I am committed to working with the Secretary's office and all of the  Historically Black Colleges to find a solution during the  appropriations process to stop the disparate funding treatment  currently in place. All 1890 land-grant institutions should be treated  equally.   My commonsense and revenue-neutral amendment evens the playing field  of Federal funding qualifications for all 1890 land-grant Historically  Black Colleges, as it is currently written now.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for his support for my  work on this amendment. I specifically want to thank Joyce Beatty, who  supports the amendment and who is the only alumnus from Central State  University.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
