 Mr. President, this tax bill is truly astounding. Only  in Washington--only in Washington--could Republicans borrow $1 trillion  from China to fund massive tax cuts for big corporations and still need  to raise taxes on millions of Americans in order to pay for it.   Look, I understand my Republican friends are in a pickle. They need  to give President Trump a win. The problem is that this White House is  asking them to pass a tax plan built on the most unpopular policies in  America, and I think my colleagues know it.   They know that after all the American people have been through--the  financial crisis, the great recession, decades of wage stagnation,  soaring education, housing and healthcare costs--after all of this  hardship, cutting taxes for corporations, taking healthcare away from  13 million people, and raising taxes on the middle class aren't exactly  a recipe for winning the hearts of voters, let alone a strategy for  building a more dynamic, inclusive, and prosperous economy for all  Americans.   So, yes, Republicans are in a tough spot. They know that if we had a  sensible campaign finance system, policies this disastrous would spell  disaster for them in 2018. That is why they designed a tax bill that  has nothing to do with simplifying our Tax Code and nothing to do with  growing the wages of American workers.   I appreciate my friend from Alaska talking about growth. I am all for  growth. But first of all, I want to see growth in American wages, and  it is really hard to have growth when you take $1 trillion, or more,  and add it to the debt of the next generation and think that you are  going to have growth when you are saddling them with greater and  greater debt. This bill has nothing to do with creating jobs and  everything to do with pleasing corporate special interests that fund  their campaigns.   That is what brings us here today. That is how Senate Republicans are  on the verge of trying to pass massive tax cuts for corporations that  will be permanent. They don't have to worry about it. They will be  permanent--paid for, however, by raising taxes on working families and  saddling our children and grandchildren with trillions in debt.   I know some at home might wonder: How does the GOP get away with  parading this bill around as a middle-class tax cut? It is because they  are using smoke and mirrors to dupe you into thinking you are getting  something of a tax cut. These so-called deficit hawks passed a budget  that gives themselves permission to add $1.5 trillion to the national  debt by 2026--only a short 9 years from now--so long, however, as they  don't add a dime to our deficit the year after, in 2027. Isn't it nice  if you can be at home and give yourself permission to go ahead and add  an enormous amount of debt and not worry about it? That is what they  do.    Here is the problem. It is damn near impossible to permanently slash  the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent without hiking  taxes on millions of average people. I call it inconvenient math. That  is why Republicans offer some families tiny, temporary--I underline  ``temporary''--tax relief without owning up to the fact that  Cinderella's chariot turns into a pumpkin really fast.   By 2019, Americans who make under $30,000 a year will be financially  worse off under this plan. By 2021, Americans earning $40,000 a year  will be worse off. By 2027, anyone earning less than $75,000 a year  will get hit.   I will admit, they found some pretty clever ways to pull off this con  job. First, they end the State and local tax deduction and force  millions of hard-working middle-class families in States like New  Jersey to pay taxes twice on the same money. These families aren't high  rollers. In fact, 83 percent of New Jerseyans who claim the State and  local tax deduction make under $200,000 a year. As a matter of fact,  nearly half of them make under $100,000 a year. I will say it again.  Ending the State and local tax deduction is like one giant hit job on  middle-class families in States like New Jersey. My constituents can't  afford to subsidize the rest of the country any more than they already  do.   Speaking about some of these comments early, earlier this evening,  the junior Senator from Pennsylvania said on the Senate floor that the  State and local tax deduction is a subsidy to States like New York and  New Jersey. He said: ``I don't know how it could be possibly fair to  force my constituent who lives in, say, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania,  why they should pay more in income taxes to subsidize somebody who gets  to live in a multimillion-dollar condo in the Upper West Side of  Manhattan.'' That hypocrisy is amazing to me. Far from subsidizing  successful States like New Jersey and New York, there are States that  are actually taker States. They get more than they send to the Federal  Treasury. In fact, according to the Rockefeller Foundation, on average,  each resident of Pennsylvania takes nearly $1,500 per year in Federal  benefits more than they pay in Federal taxes.   Even if the Rockefeller Foundation is wrong, let me read part of a  letter sent by some of the very county executives and elected officials  who represent Dauphin County. Here is part of a letter they sent to  their representatives: As county elected executives representing  Pennsylvania's counties, we are writing to express our deep concerns  with proposals to eliminate deductions for State and local taxes as the  primary funding offset for Federal tax reform.   They go on to say: Across the State--meaning Pennsylvania--more than  1.8 million households claimed the State and local tax deduction for a  total of $32.24 billion. We are particularly concerned that the loss of  the State and local tax deduction will harm middle-class homeowners and  overall property values. Without the State and local tax deduction, our  taxpayers, Pennsylvania taxpayers, would be doubly taxed. Such a policy  is contrary--I am reading from their letter--to the intentions of our  Founding Fathers and overturns the precedent set in the Civil War  income tax imposed by President Lincoln and again in the original  Federal Tax Code of 1913. There is strong rationale why the State and  local taxes are included as one of the original six Federal tax  deductions. Simply put, the State and local tax deduction is not a  special loophole but instead a core principle of fiscal federalism that  should be preserved.   That is the letter. There is more. It is signed by a series of  individuals who are elected representatives in Pennsylvania, including  those who represent Dauphin County.   Every year, successful blue-chip States like New Jersey, New York,  and Virginia contribute billions of dollars in tax revenue that goes to  Americans in less productive, lower income States. Now Republicans are  trying to take even more. We are sick and tired of it, and we want our  money back.   In fact, I will make a deal with you. Since you claim to not support  States subsidizing other States, how about you send all of the Federal  tax dollars you receive above and beyond what all of your taxpayers  paid to the Federal Government and you transfer that back to my State  of New Jersey? I will make that deal with you right now. Sound like a  deal? I didn't think so.   Here is another thing that really ticks me off. It is the sneaky,  secret tax hikes Republicans buried in this bill that bilk billions of  dollars from Americans' paychecks in the next two decades. Again, we  know why they have to do it. Even after borrowing $2 trillion from  China, there is no way to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts without  taking a bigger cut from American workers. Boy, have they found a  sneaky way to do it. It is the most complicated, convoluted, boring tax  increase in history, but, boy, it takes $500 billion out of American  paychecks and sends it straight into the coffers of multinational  corporations. That is really something to be proud of. It is called the  Chained CPI. It seems like a tiny tweak to how the government measures  the cost of living. It is something we call inflation.  [[Page S7552]]    Here is the thing about inflation. Ask any American walking down the  street if their wages have kept pace with rising costs, and they will  laugh in your face. They will tell you that their incomes have barely  budged, while everything from the cost of milk to college tuition gets  more expensive every year.   What if the government pretended that the rising costs weren't such a  hardship? That is what we call the Chained CPI tax increase. Don't take  it from me; take it from a Republican tax hero, Grover Norquist. Here  is what he had to say about this very provision, Chained CPI, in 2013.  He said:         This is one of those things invented by people who are       trying to raise taxes and pretend they're not. If you change       the law to get more money, that's a tax increase--doesn't       matter how you do it or what you call it.    We all expect to pay a little more in taxes if we get a big raise at  work. Now Republicans want you to pay more in taxes even if you don't  get a raise. Each year, more of your income, under this provision, will  be taxed in higher brackets, at the very same time your deductions and  tax credits slowly lose their value. It is a clever way for the  government to shave a bit more off your paycheck every year, even if  your income hasn't risen in years. It is a Republican tax on wage  stagnation and a Republican tax on the millennial generation. That is  right--millennials are just now entering their prime earning years, and  apparently they haven't had it hard enough, not after the great  recession, not after drowning them in student loan debt. That is what  Congress really is doing--stick it to the millennials so that the Koch  brothers can get a nice tax cut.   The American people deserve to know the big lie at the heart of the  Trump tax plan. The meager tax cuts for families are written in  disappearing ink, while the sneaky tax hikes are carved into stone. It  is the Republican majority's dirty little secret--the secret that even  after borrowing $2 trillion from China, they can't permanently cut  taxes for corporations without hiking taxes on millions of middle-class  Americans and millions more who dream of becoming middle class. We have  heard this all before--wild claims about tax cuts for the rich  trickling down to working families. The truth is, they never do.   I was in the House of Representatives when Congress passed the Bush  tax cuts. I opposed taking the historic surplus that President Clinton  had created to be used by President Bush--which he inherited and  squandered it on tax cuts, 27 percent of which went to the top 1  percent of Americans. That is chump change compared to the 60-plus  percent that goes to the wealthy in the Trump tax plan.   By 2027, Americans who make $40,000 to $50,000 a year will pay a  combined $5.3 billion more in taxes, while those who make millions get  a $5.8 billion cut--pretty close. Americans making $40,000 to $50,000 a  year pay a combined $5.3 billion more in taxes. Those who make millions  get a $5.8 billion cut. There you have it. Republicans are A-OK with  wealth redistribution so long as it is taking it from working families  and giving it to the richest 1 percent.   That 60-percent number doesn't include the death blow this plan  delivers to the Affordable Care Act, the financial cost to families  when 13 million Americans lose their healthcare coverage and everyone  else gets saddled with higher premiums.   Meanwhile, some Republicans are openly admitting that this tax bill  will be the first shot fired in their race to dismantle Social  Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. In fact, the Congressional Budget  Office--the nonpartisan scoring division for the Congress--already said  that these tax cuts will trigger huge, multibillion-dollar cuts to  Medicare. And that is not the only way this bill screws over America's  seniors. According to the AARP, 5.2 million seniors will face higher  taxes in the next decade. Think about that--asking seniors who have  given this country a lifetime of hard work to pay for corporate tax  cuts.   We know what corporations do with those tax cuts. During the Bush tax  holiday in 2005, the Republicans promised big gains for workers, but  corporations didn't bring the billions of dollars they stashed offshore  back home so they could build new factories or create millions of new  jobs or pay their workers better wages. The lion's share of that  windfall went to just two things: higher pay for CEOs and kickbacks for  their investors on Wall Street.   I am not sure why White House adviser Gary Cohn seemed so surprised  the other day when so few CEOs who were before him said that they used  the tax cuts to invest in American jobs. He asked for a show of hands.  Only a couple raised their hands. Does anyone actually believe things  will be different this time? Of course not.   How do we know? It is because, unlike my Republican friends in  Congress, corporations cannot lie to their shareholders about what they  plan to do with $1 trillion in tax cuts. Their CEOs are openly  admitting this windfall will go straight to Wall Street. That is why I  have been pushing for changes to this tax bill that would take away  these big corporate tax cuts if workers don't see bigger paychecks. Of  course, that is not what Republicans have in mind.   This tax plan has nothing to do with helping hard-working families  get ahead in New Jersey and across America. It is not about helping  folks who have good jobs but still live paycheck to paycheck. It is  about one thing--cutting taxes permanently for big corporations that  are raking in record profits and just straight-out refusing to pay  their workers decent wages. It is about cutting taxes for trust fund  kids who were born on third base and think they hit a triple. It is  about paving the way for massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social  Security. It is about bankrupting States of the resources they need to  invest in education, in infrastructure, in public health, and in  creating the growth for opportunity for all.   These are the backward priorities of this legislation--tax cuts for  big corporations and wealthy campaign donors that are paid for by  taking bigger cuts out of workers' paychecks and saddling our  grandchildren, like my granddaughter, Evangelina, with $2 trillion in  debt.   The only people who will come out on top from this legislation are  those who are already sitting at the very top. So much for draining the  swamp. This is about as mucky as it gets. I hope my colleagues come to  their senses and put the brakes on this terrible tax bill.   We can have tax reform--tax reform that is bipartisan, tax reform  that can be permanent, tax reform that creates stability, tax reform  that creates growth not just for companies but growth for American  workers' wages, and that creates a better economy for all. This deal is  a bad deal for the American people, and they deserve much better.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
