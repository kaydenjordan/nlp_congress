 Mr. Speaker, right now, as we meet in this  Chamber, the Supreme Court is releasing a new slate of opinions. And  like millions of people across the country, I have been waiting with  dread for what is coming. As we wait, we are texting, messaging our  friends and loved ones, providing support, looking for more  information, and it is all taking place on our devices. That is how we  live in 2022.   I am determined to make sure that as we continue to fight for our  rights, we do so with policies that reflect today's world. That is why  I am proud to have introduced the My Body, My Data Act, new legislation  to protect our personal reproductive health data. I am proud that  Senator Hirono and Senator Wyden have introduced a companion bill in  the Senate and that we have 43 cosponsors from across the ideological  spectrum here in the House.   When the Supreme Court's draft decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization leaked, the decision that would undo decades of  precedent and overturn the landmark opinion of Roe v. Wade, I  immediately started hearing from friends and constituents, panicked  that their reproductive health data could fall into the wrong hands,  panicked that the personal information on their phones, on their  computers could be used against them in a post-Roe world where abortion  is criminalized and where laws, like the Texas bounty hunter law, give  extremists a financial incentive to target vulnerable people.    Shortly after, experts started sounding the alarm that our personal  reproductive health data--from search engines to menstruation and  pregnancy-tracking apps--would be used to target people if abortion is  criminalized. Right now, there are no protections from that happening.   Mr. Speaker, as a young woman, reproductive healthcare is my  healthcare. And like tens of millions of Americans, I have used apps to  track my period. When the draft decision leaked, I knew we couldn't  wait for the final opinion. We couldn't just wait for Roe to be  overturned so I got to work, because it is unconscionable that our  personal reproductive information could be sold to the highest bidder  and weaponized against us--and especially against low-income people and  people of color, who would be the most impacted if Roe is overturned.   To protect access, Congress must codify the right to an abortion, and  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Women's Health Protection  Act. Alongside strong protections for abortion access, we need strong  privacy protections. That is why I introduced the My Body, My Data Act.  Our personal reproductive and sexual health information is our most  sensitive and personal data, and it deserves the highest level of  privacy protection that the government can provide.   I am proud to say that is what the My Body, My Data Act accomplishes.  It is endorsed by Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the Electronic Frontier  Foundation, and many others. This bill restricts businesses and  nongovernmental organizations from collecting, using, retaining, or  disclosing reproductive health information beyond what is strictly  necessary to provide a product or service.   The bill provides everyday people with the right to access or delete  their personal reproductive health information, if they choose to, and  it requires organizations to publish their privacy policies.   Importantly, the My Body, My Data Act includes strong enforcement  mechanisms, including a private right of action that allows individuals  to bring a lawsuit if their privacy is violated.   With 26 States likely or certain to ban abortion if Roe is  overturned, this legislation is more urgent than ever. I am proud to  lead this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
