 Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to  expand and improve the defense access  [[Page H5741]]  roads program. This critical program allows the Defense Department to  construct, replace, and maintain roads that lead to military  installations.   My amendment will improve the program by allowing DOD to construct  and maintain flood management infrastructure, such as culverts and  storm drains, and to fortify the roads that are projected to be  impacted by sea level rise.   This authority is critical to bases in the Lowcountry, such as Parris  Island, which is increasingly vulnerable to projected flooding.   Additionally, this measure will expand the program to include roads  to airports or seaports that are deemed necessary for our national  security.   Given Charleston's indispensable role in supporting the rapid  deployment of our servicemembers and their equipment, it is essential  that our local infrastructure is maintained and reinforced.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment.
