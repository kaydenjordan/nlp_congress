 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson, the great  conservative champion we have here.   Madam Speaker, the sons and daughters of America are not foot  soldiers for your party's inept, geriatric despot. They are not  expendable pawns to be dispatched at the whims of an idiot, tossed  carelessly around the world to godforsaken caves and bloody sandboxes.  They are Americans, worthy of honor and dignity. The only salute from  them Joe Biden deserves involves one finger.   American blood is not the currency of the world. It cannot be  borrowed, exchanged, or lent to any man or any nation. Its worth is  immeasurable. American patriots in uniform all signed a blank check to  their Nation, and already under this administration in Afghanistan, Joe  Biden cashed it for 13 patriots through his reckless incompetence.  [[Page H905]]    The path to American national security does not lie in American  international interventionism. It lies in securing our southern border,  not the Russia-Ukraine border.   Our greatness is forged in our resistance to interference. The war  lobby has no ally in the America First Republicans. We will preserve  our strength through nationalism. We will champion America First today  and America First forever.   Madam Speaker, we earned our greatness. Let others earn theirs. If  Joe Biden hasn't prostituted our preeminence to the military-industrial  complex by the time Donald Trump returns, we will preserve this great  city on a hill for the descendants of our grandchildren.
