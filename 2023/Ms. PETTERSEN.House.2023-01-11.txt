 Madam Speaker, I rise today because at a time when  Americans across the country are facing urgent needs, Republicans are  choosing to spend the first week of Congress attacking women's  reproductive healthcare.   This week, we should be advancing legislation to fight inflation and  lower everyday costs for families who are struggling to make ends meet.  We should be passing measures to improve our education system and  address our dire workforce shortages.   Instead, Republicans are doubling-down on their assault on women's  reproductive freedom, even though the vast majority of Americans  believe that women should have the right to choose.   I came to Congress to make a meaningful difference in people's lives  and fight against extremism just like this.   The people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District sent me here  to ensure these personal decisions are kept between women, their  doctors, and their families, not Members of Congress.   Just like I did in the State senate, I will not stop fighting until  all Americans have control over their own bodies, their own healthcare  decisions, and their own lives.
