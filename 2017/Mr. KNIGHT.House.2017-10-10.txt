 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, October 10, I missed two votes  to attend to constituent business in my district. Had I been present  for the day's vote series, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No.  558, the passage of H.R. 1858, to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty,  Pennsylvania, as the ``Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office'';  and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 559, the passage of H.R. 2464, to designate  the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 25 New  Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the ``John Fitzgerald  Kennedy Post Office''.                            ____________________
