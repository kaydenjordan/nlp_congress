Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for bringing  forward this legislation to better protect our consumers and our  neighbors from illicit financial activity and I urge passage, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6332) to require the Director of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network to submit a report to Congress on the way in which  data collected pursuant to title 31 is being used, and for other  purposes.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6332         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Strategies to       Counter Weapons Proliferation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK REPORTING                     REQUIREMENT.         Section 310 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Reports Relating to Use of Collected Data.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this subsection and every year thereafter, the       Director shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report on--        ``(A) intelligence products created by FinCEN on finance       transactions for the proliferation of weapons from filings       submitted pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 53;        ``(B) FinCEN's efforts to collaborate with law enforcement       agencies, the intelligence community, and foreign financial       intelligence units to maximize the use of data that is       collected pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 53; and        ``(C) advisory notices issued to financial institutions (as       defined under section 5312(a)) on financial activity related       to the proliferation of weapons.        ``(2) Separate presentation of classified material.--Any       part of the report under paragraph (1) that involves       information that is properly classified under criteria       established by the President shall be submitted to the       Congress separately in a classified annex.        ``(3) Sunset.--No report is required under this subsection       after the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date of       enactment of this subsection.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the consideration of this important measure  on the floor here today. The work of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance  Subcommittee on Financial Services has uncovered time and again that  the activities of terrorists and criminal organizations are powered  through financing and that illicit operations cannot continue if the  revenue streams that fund those operations are shut off.   The measure before the House today would provide greater clarity into  how exactly the global financial system can cut off financial schemes  that enable access to illicit nuclear, chemical, and biological  weapons.   H.R. 6332, the Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation  Act, would study how our financial institutions, intelligence  collecting agencies, and law enforcement share information regarding  known weapons financing activities to better identify weapons financing  schemes.   To effectively prevent the spread of dangerous weapons into the hands  of bad actors like terrorists, we must close the gaps that allow those  bad actors to take advantage of the global financial system. The ever- increasing number of threats posed by foreign adversaries and dangerous  organizations make it all the more important to close those gaps now.  By helping financial institutions and law enforcement better identify  the signs of illicit proliferation financing through this bill, these  institutions will be able to maximize the effectiveness of their  information and more easily coordinate strategies that disrupt and  ultimately prevent dangerous crime.   In the United States, we have robust protections in place to be able  to prevent financing of weapons proliferation involving suspicious  activity reports that go to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  and get reported over to law enforcement. By requiring FinCEN to report  yearly to Congress on intelligence products it generates from  suspicious activity filings on weapons finance transactions as well as  how those intelligence products have informed law enforcement action,  we can learn the indicators for proliferation finance and move to more  effectively combat those illicit financial activities.   The bill before the House of Representatives today is a good first  step in making sure the financial institutions, law enforcement  agencies, and Congress have the tools that they need to be able to  combat financing for illicit weapons proliferation, and I urge its  passage here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4753) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Vice  Chairman for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System to provide a written report, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4753         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Reserve Supervision       Testimony Clarification Act''.       SEC. 2. VICE CHAIRMAN FOR SUPERVISION REPORT REQUIREMENT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3834) to provide that members of public safety agencies who  died of 9/11-related health conditions are eligible for the  Presidential 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3834         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. MEMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WHO SUBSEQUENTLY                     DIED OF 9/11-RELATED HEALTH CONDITIONS ELIGIBLE                     FOR PRESIDENTIAL 9/11 HEROES MEDAL OF VALOR.         An individual who was a public safety officer (as defined       in section 5 of the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act       of 2001) who--        (1) participated in the response at any point during the       period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on July       31, 2002, to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center,       the terrorist attack on the Pentagon, or the terrorist attack       that resulted in the crash of the fourth airplane in       Pennsylvania; and        (2) died as a result of such participation thereafter as a       result of a WTC-related health condition (which term shall       have the meaning given such term in section 3312 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300mm-22) with respect       to a WTC responder),       shall be eligible for the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor referred       to in subsection (a) of section 124 of the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2005, in the same manner and to the same       extent as any individual who is otherwise eligible under such       section, except that no requirement under such section       pertaining to the death of that individual shall apply.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3834, the 9/11 Heroes  Medal of Valor Act of 2017, introduced by our colleague from New York,  Representative Crowley.   Mr. Speaker, the terrible sights and sounds and memories of September  11, 2001, are seared into America's memory, but none more so than the  stories of incredibly brave police and fire officers who rushed into  the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, ignoring danger to themselves, to  help others escape. 442 of those brave public safety officers died, and  in recognition of their bravery and sacrifice, in 2005, Congress  created the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor awarded in their memory to their  families.   Since then, as we now know, many more of those who rushed to help  others to safety from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center,  the Pentagon, or on the attack that resulted in the crash of the fourth  airplane in Pennsylvania have died as a result of their heroism because  of health conditions resulting from the attacks. Mr. Speaker, they were  just as brave, and many suffered terribly. We can do no less than  ensure that they are eligible to receive this medal as well.   Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we make all first responders who  have died as a result of their heroism eligible for the medal, whether  they died on that terrible day or at some later date. I support this  bill, salute those brave souls, thank Representative Crowley for  introducing this legislation, and urge its immediate passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 754) to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Anwar Sadat in  recognition of his heroic achievements and courageous contributions to  peace in the Middle East.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 754         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Anwar Sadat Centennial       Celebration Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Anwar Sadat was born on December 25, 1918, in Mit Abu       al-Kum, al-Minufiyah, Egypt, as 1 of 13 children in a poor       Egyptian family.        (2) In 1938, Sadat graduated from the Royal Military       Academy in Cairo and was appointed to the Signal Corps.        (3) Sadat entered the Army as a second lieutenant and was       posted to Sudan where he met Gamal Abdel Nasser and fellow       junior officers who became the ``Free Officers'' who led the       Egyptian revolution of 1952.        (4) Sadat held various high positions during Nasser's       presidency, assuming the role of President of the National       Assembly in 1960 and Vice President in 1964.        (5) President Nasser died of a heart attack on September       28, 1970, at which point Sadat became acting President. Sadat       was subsequently elected as the third President of Egypt.        (6) On October 6, 1973, President Sadat, along with his       Syrian counterparts, launched an offensive against Israel. A       permanent cease-fire was reached on October 25, 1973.        (7) In 1974, after talks facilitated by Secretary of State       Henry Kissinger, Egypt and Israel signed an agreement       allowing Egypt to formally retrieve land in the Sinai.       President Sadat later wrote in his memoirs that his meetings       with Kissinger ``marked the beginning of a relationship of       mutual understanding with the United States culminating and       crystallizing in what we came to describe as a `peace       process'. Together we started that process and the United       States still supports our joint efforts to this day''.        (8) Months of diplomacy between Egypt and Israel followed       the signing of this initial agreement and a second       disengagement agreement, the Sinai Interim Agreement, was       signed in September of 1975.        (9) President Sadat addressed a joint session of Congress       on November 5, 1975, during which he underscored the shared       values between the United States and Egypt. In this speech,       President Sadat addressed the path to peace, saying, ``We are       faced, together with other nations, with one of the greatest       challenges of our time, namely the task of convincing this       generation, and those to follow, that we can finally build a       viable international system capable of meeting the demands of       tomorrow and solving the problems of the coming age''.        (10) On November 19, 1977, President Sadat became the first       Arab leader to visit Israel, meeting with the Israeli Prime       Minister, Menachem Begin. President Sadat spoke before the       Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem about his views on how to       achieve comprehensive peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict.        (11) Before commencing negotiations, President Sadat       courageously announced to the Knesset, ``I have come to you       so that together we might build a durable peace based on       justice, to avoid the shedding of 1 single drop of blood from       an Arab or an Israeli. It is for this reason that I have       proclaimed my readiness to go to the farthest corner of the       world''. President Sadat further poignantly stated that ``any       life lost in war is a human  [[Page H9069]]       life, irrespective of its being that of an Israeli or an       Arab. . . . When the bells of peace ring, there will be no       hands to beat the drums of war''.        (12) On September 17, 1978, President Jimmy Carter hosted       President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin at Camp David where       the 3 leaders engaged in 13 days of negotiations that       resulted in the ``Framework for Peace in the Middle East''       (commonly known as the ``Camp David Accords'').        (13) Following negotiations, President Sadat and Prime       Minister Begin signed the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty (in this       section referred to as the ``Peace Treaty'') at the White       House on March 26, 1979. Addressing President Sadat at the       signing of the Peace Treaty, which remains an important       anchor for peace in the region today, Prime Minister Begin       commended President Sadat by saying, ``In the face of       adversity and hostility, you have demonstrated the human       value that can change history--civil courage''.        (14) The Peace Treaty featured mutual recognition of each       country by the other and ultimately the cessation of the       state of war that had existed between Israel and Egypt since       the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Israel completely withdrew its       armed forces and civilians from the rest of the Sinai.        (15) In 1978, both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin       were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for signing the Peace       Treaty, which made Egypt the first Arab country to officially       recognize Israel.        (16) While presenting the Nobel Peace Prize to President       Sadat, Aase Lionaes, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel       Committee, said, ``During the 30 preceding years, the peoples       of the Middle East have, on 4 separate occasions, been the       victims of warfare and there seemed no prospect of peace.       President Sadat's great contribution to peace was that he had       sufficient courage and foresight to break away from this       vicious circle. His decision to accept Prime Minister       Menachem Begin's invitation of November 17, 1977, to attend a       meeting of the Israeli parliament on November 19 was an act       of great courage, both from a personal and from a political       point of view. This was a dramatic break with the past and a       courageous step forward into a new age''.        (17) During his Nobel lecture, President Sadat remarked,       ``I made my trip because I am convinced that we owe it to       this generation and the generations to come not to leave a       stone unturned in our pursuit of peace''.        (18) In remarks to the People's Assembly in Cairo on March       10, 1979, President Carter praised President Sadat, telling       the Assembly, ``Your President has demonstrated the power of       human courage and human vision to create hope where there had       been only despair.''. President Carter also said that the       Peace Treaty would ``strengthen cooperation between Egypt and       the United States'' and underscored the support of the United       States for the agreement, saying, ``I fully share and will       support President Sadat's belief that stability must be       maintained in this part of the world . . . He and I recognize       that the security of this vital region is being challenged. I       applaud his determination to meet that challenge, and my       Government will stand with him''.        (19) The signing of the Peace Treaty enraged many       individuals who opposed normalized relations with Israel.       President Sadat was assassinated on October 6, 1981, by       Khalid Islambouli, a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad.       President Sadat was well aware of the controversy to which       his actions would lead, but pushed for peace anyway.        (20) Upon the death of President Sadat, President Ronald       Reagan proclaimed, ``President Sadat was a courageous man       whose vision and wisdom brought nations and people together.       In a world filled with hatred, he was a man of hope. In a       world trapped in the animosities of the past, he was a man of       foresight, a man who sought to improve a world tormented by       malice and pettiness''.        (21) President Sadat is recognized in the United States and       throughout the world as a respected leader and champion of       peace whose vision provided a roadmap for the peaceful       resolution of conflict that endures nearly 40 years after its       inception.        (22) President Sadat bravely reached out to Israel and       dedicated himself to peace, furthering the national security       of Egypt and the stability of the Middle East.        (23) On the 30th anniversary of the Peace Treaty, President       Barack Obama praised the enduring legacy of the Camp David       Accords and the ``courage and foresight of these leaders, who       stood together in unity to change the course of our shared       history''. President Obama closed by saying, ``Today, as we       seek to expand the circle of peace among Arabs and Israelis,       we take inspiration from what Israel and Egypt achieved 3       decades ago, knowing that the destination is worthy of the       struggle''.        (24) The Camp David Accords and the Peace Treaty continue       to serve the interests of the United States by preserving       peace and serving as a foundation for partnership and       dialogue in a region fraught with conflict and division.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
