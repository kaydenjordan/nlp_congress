 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Black for yielding  time.   Mr. Speaker, I hear it all the time, and it is just a false  narrative. This idea that the tax reform package presented by  Republicans is only a tax relief for the wealthy and that the middle  class and low-income families are not going to benefit from it is just  absolutely untrue.   We are talking about doubling the standard deduction. Millions of  Americans aren't even going to pay any taxes. That is particularly  important in rural areas like I represent in Ohio.   So I would urge my colleagues, let's stop this false narrative that  says that this is just a tax cut for the wealthy, because that is not  true.   By the way, when you cut taxes on businesses and corporations, who  pays those taxes, Mr. Speaker?   It is the American people who buy the products that pay those taxes.  When they get a break, everybody wins.   Look, the adoption of the Senate amendment to the House-passed budget  that we are going to vote on today paves the way for tax reform. It is  going to establish a path of balance through restrained spending,  reduced taxes, and economic growth. It is going to allow for higher  defense spending contingent on future adjustments to discretionary  spending caps for defense and national security, but it begins to  address our national debt.    It reduces nondefense discretionary spending by over $600 billion  over 10 years. It assumes more than $4 trillion in mandatory savings  over 10 years. And it provides for budget enforcement in the House in  order to strengthen fiscal discipline.   Mr. Speaker, this is a responsible path forward. The American people  are screaming for a simpler, fairer, flatter Tax Code, one that makes  American workers competitive, one that let's the American people keep  more of what they earn in their pockets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's vote, pass this  budget amendment, and let's get on to tax reform.
