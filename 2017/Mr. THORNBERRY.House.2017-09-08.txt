 Mr. Speaker, I support providing immediate emergency  assistance for those affected by recent natural disasters and was glad  to vote for such a bill earlier this week. I believe that raising the  debt limit for only three months is a mistake because it does not  provide the certainty that financial markets and our economy need.   But most concerning to me, and the reason I am voting against this  bill, is that it forces our military to operate under a stopgap  continuing resolution--once again.   Continuing resolutions do enormous, lasting damage to the American  military. We are witnessing an alarming increase in accidents, growing  evidence of a force under stress, and an eroding technological position  when compared with our adversaries. Not only does this bill fail to  remedy those problems, it makes them worse.   This bill, like other CRs, allows no new starts--the Pentagon must  spend the same money on the same things as last year. But the world is  not standing still. In fact, the threats from North Korea and others  grow every day. Yet, this CR prevents us from responding.   The Constitution places on Congress the responsibility to ``raise and  support'', ``provide and maintain'' the military forces of the United  States. It is morally wrong for our nation to send brave men and women  out on mission--even routine training or operations--without the very  best equipment, the very best training, the very best support our  country can provide. The dysfunction in the budget process has meant  that we have not provided them with the best and that we have not been  meeting our responsibilities. This bill is more of the same.   There is plenty of blame to go around between both parties and both  the Executive and Legislative branches of government. But this  negligence must stop. We must fulfill our duty. We must do better.
