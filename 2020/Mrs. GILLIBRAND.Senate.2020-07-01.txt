 Mr. President, I rise to address a glaring  inequality in the law--one that leaves our servicemembers with fewer  protections from discrimination than civilians. On June 15, the Supreme  Court issued a momentous decision--welcomed by Members of both  parties--extending civil rights employment protections to LGBTQ  individuals in workplaces across America. That decision, however, does  not apply to servicemembers. That means our servicemembers, who often  come from communities that have for generations bravely sacrificed for  the United States, currently enjoy fewer statutory protections than  their civilian counterparts.   Think about what that says about our country: The law treats the  people willing to risk their lives to defend our freedoms as second  class citizens. It is unconscionable, and it is un-American. In this  moment of reckoning on civil rights, we must ensure those rights extend  to all of our military servicemembers.   The push for the desegregation of our troops, for gender integration  into combat, and for the repeal of don't ask, don't tell were all met  with similar arguments about how increased opportunity for the group in  question would hamper readiness, unit cohesion, or otherwise weaken the  military. Those arguments have been proven wrong every single time.   It is, in fact, the lack of protections for these groups that hamper  readiness. Without protections, an able platoon sergeant can be  stigmatized and driven from the military because he is transgender. His  years of experience and the immense investments the military has made  in him can be erased with the stroke of a pen.   Our military has grown only stronger as it better represents our  country. But, right now, in the year 2020, people who are willing to  make extraordinary sacrifices for our freedoms are being told no simply  because of who they are.   We must do better. And we can. We can make sure the National Defense  Authorization Act includes discrimination protections for all  servicemembers.   My amendment with Senator Collins would codify in the law that  servicemembers of all races, religions, and sexes are protected from  discrimination. It would affirm that Americans of every race, religion,  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and national origin have the  right to join and serve and sacrifice in our military.   I was proud to have Senator John McCain join me in leading similar  legislation to protect transgender troops 3 years ago. The late Senator  said: ``Any member of the military who meets the medical and readiness  standards should be allowed to serve--including those who are  transgender.'' I hope this will be the year that we deliver the results  he wanted for our troops.   Placing language safeguarding this right into the NDAA can help us  begin to overcome an unfortunate legacy of creating artificial,  blatantly unfair barriers to service by underrepresented groups. It is  a legacy that continues to  [[Page S4092]]  this day with the Trump administration's ban on transgender  servicemembers.   That discriminatory ban is not only an insult to members of the  transgender community who have served our country; it is an insult to  every LGBTQ person who has given their life to protect it. Arguments  against open transgender service have no basis in experience or in  science.   Transgender individuals served openly in the military for more than  2\1/2\ years without any readiness or cohesion issues. I know because I  asked all four service chiefs and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, and they all confirmed it. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, Mark Milley, who was then Chief of Staff of the Army, told me  that he had received ``precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion,  discipline, [or] morale'' caused by transgender individuals in the  service.   The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric  Association, and other experts agree: There is no medically valid  reason to exclude transgender individuals from military service. Anyone  who can meet the military standards should be allowed to serve--and  serve in an environment free from discrimination. It is that simple.   Our Armed Services should reflect the best of what this country has  to offer--in their values and in their ranks. We cannot allow for laws  that unnecessarily limit their ability to recruit and retain the best  person for the job.   I ask my colleagues to support our troops with more than lip service.  I ask my colleagues to extend to them protections from discrimination  based on race, religion, or sex. These are people who are willing to  fight for our country. These are people who are willing to die for our  country. This body and our country must be willing to fight for them.  My amendment will do exactly that. I ask all of you to support its  inclusion in this year's NDAA    Madam President, I rise again to address another  issue. I rise because, according to the Pentagon's recent biannual  survey, almost 21,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted in the  year 2018. That was a 38-percent increase from the year before.   I rise because the current climate of retaliation in our armed  services and the lack of justice provided by the chain of command meant  nearly three-quarters of those assaults went unreported, and less than  10 percent of cases considered for command action went to trial--less  than 10 percent.   I rise because I stood in this very Chamber in 2013 and shared  essentially the same statistics.   Year after year, the leaders of our armed services come to Congress  and commit to making things better. They commit to us in hearing after  hearing: We will get this right. Yet, year after year, thousands of  servicemembers are raped and sexually assaulted, and their assailants  are not held accountable.   In many of those cases, the assailant is someone in the survivor's  chain of command--the same chain of command that will decide the case,  picking judge, jury, prosecutor, defense counsel--all decided by a  commander in that chain of command.   There is no other judicial system in America that would ever allow  this to happen. This system is not delivering justice. The chain of  command is not delivering justice. These decisions--these fundamental  civil rights decisions--need to be made somewhere else. They need to be  made by trained, impartial military professionals, prosecutors,  lawyers--people who are trained to make this very hard decision.   We are asking survivors to come forward in an environment where they  know that there is less than a 10-percent chance that the chain of  command will try their assailant for a crime and--worse--that there is  only a two in three chance that they themselves--they themselves--will  face retaliation.   Despite repeated efforts to stamp out the scourge of retaliation  against military sexual assault survivors, the most recent Pentagon  survey found that 64 percent of these survivors have experienced some  form of retaliation for reporting the crime. This figure is  statistically unchanged from 2016. It is unacceptable.   I ask you: Who is this system designed for?   I think so often about a Marine veteran who told me:         When I reported the assault, my command responded with       retaliation . . . ostracism, intimidation, and isolation. The       humiliation of the retaliation was worse than the assault       because it was sanctioned from those same leaders I once       would have risked my life for.    The climate of retaliation comes from the top. It comes from the  chain of command. They should not be deciding these cases. They do not  have the background or the impartiality necessary to deliver justice.  This system is broken, and it is failing our servicemembers.   This Congress has passed and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on  incremental reforms since 2013. During this time, an estimated 137,000  servicemembers have been assaulted.   Let me say that again. During that time, 137,000 servicemembers have  been sexually assaulted.   What are we doing here? Can we not hold the U.S. military  accountable? Can we not do our jobs? Can we not stand up for the men  and women who risk their lives for us every day?   Incremental change that leaves the power in the hands of the chain of  command is not enough. We have the proof and the evidence.   ``We've got this ma'am; we've got this.'' They say it every year.  They don't have it, and they haven't had it for the last 7 years we  have been focused on this very issue. It does not do enough to protect  our servicemembers from sexual assault in the ranks or to punish  perpetrators who commit these violent crimes.   Just for a minute, imagine this is your daughter or your son. Imagine  just for a minute that your children decide to go into the military. Do  you think they will be protected?   My bill, the Military Justice Improvement Act, is being offered as an  amendment to the NDAA. This amendment will professionalize how the  military prosecutes serious crimes like sexual assault, and it will  remove the systemic fear that survivors have to report these crimes.  Survivors don't report these crimes because they fear the retaliation  against them.   This bipartisan and commonsense reform leaves the majority of  uniquely military crimes, as well as all crimes punishable by less than  1 year of confinement, within the chain of command. It would only move  one decision--literally, one decision--that only 3 percent of  commanders actually have the right to make, and that decision will be  made by a trained military prosecutor.   These prosecutors, or military JAGS, are required to be licensed  attorneys in good standing with their State bar associations and are  subject to professional rules of ethics. Those are commonsense  standards, but they are not the standards that commanders have to meet.  Commanders aren't typically lawyers. They are not typically criminal  lawyers. They are not trained in how to make this fundamental decision  about whether a crime has been committed. So why wouldn't you let  military police investigate the crime just as they do today?   They take that investigation and, instead of putting it on the  commander's general counsel's desk, they will put it on a military  prosecutor's desk. The military prosecutor gets to make a decision: yes  or no; I can prosecute or I can't. Then, that file goes right back to  the commander. So when the commander wants to do nonjudicial  punishment, he gets to do it. Every time a prosecutor says there is no  case here, he gets to have the same authority he has today.   Under today's standards, only 10 percent of these cases go to trial.  That would mean the commanders don't get to make that one decision that  3 percent of them get to make 10 percent of the time because 90 percent  of the time it comes right back to the commander to do whatever  nonjudicial punishment he or she thinks is appropriate.   This is a very small but important change because when you make this  change, the survivor sees that the decision isn't being made within her  chain of command. She or he sees that the decision is being made by  somebody trained to make the decision--someone who is actually a  prosecutor. He or she will then believe it is worth reporting the  crime.  [[Page S4093]]    So many of these crimes don't even get reported and, sadly, the  percentage of those that are being reported is going up--the percentage  of those reported confidentially. It doesn't show that there is any  faith in the system if people will only report if they don't name their  perpetrator.   This reform is nothing new. This reform has been done all across the  world by our allies. Our allies in the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel,  Germany, and Australia have all removed reporting and prosecution of  violent sex crimes out of the chain of command. Leaders in those  militaries have reported that these changes have not diminished their  ability in any way. It has not diminished their commanders' ability to  maintain good order and discipline, to train their troops, and to do  what they are there for.   Congress owes our servicemembers a debt of gratitude that can never  be fully repaid. These brave men and women who have experienced the  unimaginable are counting on us this year to finally take real action.  Until we do, we continue to fail in our responsibility to protect them.   Madam President, this is something we have worked on together for  over 7 years. This is something that, on a bipartisan basis, this  Chamber has worked on for 7 years. We have been denied a vote on this  over the last 5 years--denied a vote on this the last 5 years. The  military has fought tooth and nail to not put in these fundamental  reforms. They ask us over and over: Trust us; we got this. Trust us; we  got this.   They don't have it. They haven't had it, and they don't focus on it.   If you just look at the report from this year alone, we are up to  20,000--over 20,000--sexual assaults in the last year. The percentage  of cases that are being reported confidentially is going up. The  percentage of cases that are being reported openly is going down. The  percentage of cases that are going to trial is going down. The  percentage of cases ending in conviction is going down. So under no  measure today has the military succeeded in this mission, under  absolutely none. They say they got this. They don't have it. They never  have. And if we don't do our job this year, they never will.   This is not something new. This is something that other countries  that are our allies have done. It professionalizes the military. It  gives hope to survivors. It creates permission for them to report these  crimes. If more crimes are reported, more prosecutions will be  completed, and more cases will end in conviction.   Send a message: Convict perpetrators. Protect survivors. Honor the  sacrifice and legacy of every man and woman who serves in the military  today who will give their life for this country. That is our  responsibility.   I urge everyone in this Chamber to stand with our troops. Stand with  the men and women who sacrifice everything, and do the right thing. It  is our job. We are supposed to provide oversight and accountability  over the U.S. military. It is the Senate's job, and every year that we  don't address this fundamental scourge is another year we fail.   I am tired of this Chamber failing our servicemembers. I am tired of  our commanders and our military failing our servicemembers. We owe  everything to them   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
