 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to S.J.  Res. 9, a resolution that provides for congressional disapproval to  legislatively de-list the lesser prairie-chicken from protection under  the Endangered Species Act.  [[Page H4049]]    Specifically, this bill calls on Congress to disapprove the rules  submitted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service relating to  protections for endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.   The population and habitat of the lesser prairie-chicken, an  endangered southwestern prairie grouse, is under growing threat.   Originally numbering in the millions, the population of this bird has  decreased by as much as 97 percent and it now only inhabits 16 percent  of its former habitat.   Aerial survey results from 2012 through 2022 estimate a five-year  average lesser prairie-chicken population of 32,210 across the five- state region in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, as well as my  state of Texas.   The conversion of natural grasslands to agriculture, energy  development, fire suppression, drought, and the use of herbicides to  kill Shinnery Oak habitat are all ongoing challenges that cause habitat  loss and fragmentation.   Additional harm is caused to these birds' habitats by fencing, power  wires, and other tall structures that entice perching by predatory  animals.   The lesser prairie-chicken is a sign of healthy prairies and  grasslands because it requires huge, undamaged natural grassland  parcels to support self-sustaining populations.   This makes them a crucial indicator of the general wellbeing of  America's grasslands, a treasured and iconic terrain.   It is essential that we work together to uphold the Endangered  Species Act (ESA), which is responsible for the recovery of iconic  species like the Bald Eagle.   I urge my colleagues to support science-based decisions and join me  in opposing this bill, S.J. Res. 9.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to S.J.  Res. 24, which relates to the endangered species status of the Northern  Long-Eared Bat.   S.J. Res. 24 is a resolution of congressional disapproval to  legislatively down-list the Northern Long-Eared Bat from ``endangered''  to ``threatened.''   Not only would this downgrade the Northern Long-Eared Bat's status  today, but it would effectively block the species from being moved up  to a higher endangered threat level, no matter how close the species  comes to extinction.   It would be irresponsible to use extreme legislation, not science, to  down-list the Northern Long-Eared Bat, thereby effectively scaling back  its protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Without ESA protections, states, industries, and other entities will  have little incentive to conserve or recover the Northern Long-Eared  Bat.   It is highly likely that the bat populations would dwindle further  toward extinction.   Moreover, by using the Congressional Review Act Process, this  Congress is effectively limiting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  from making similar future listings for this bat species.   This proposition would prevent the agency from using its discretion  to take the necessary measures for species conservation and will impede  long-term recovery efforts.   Ultimately, Congressional action in this regard gives industries, not  science, the upper hand in species listings.   It is clear that some of my colleagues are doing the bidding of the  timber and agriculture industries, despite the consequences that  Northern Long-Eared Bat extinction could have on biodiversity and long- term agriculture and timber industry practices.   Down-listing this species would be especially dangerous in the  current moment because the Northern Long-Eared Bat population is  actively under threat from white nose syndrome, a deadly fungus that  has caused a rapid decline in bat populations.   The Northern Long-Eared Bat's current endangered status provides  adequate protections while wildlife scientists work to address the  underlying causes of white-nose syndrome.   Congress should not be interfering with the work of the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service under its Endangered Species Act authority.   Species populations are constantly fluctuating based on environmental  factors, invasive species, climate change, and other emerging threats.   To remain up to date, the ESA requires periodic study and updates to  ensure protections align with the best available science.   By blocking future up-listing decisions, using the Congressional  Review Act undercuts the ESA's inherent flexibility and agencies'  science-based decision-making for species conservation.   I urge my colleagues to support science-based decisions for  endangered and threatened species and oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, the beauty and wonderment of this  Nation is that every single person born in this country has the  privilege of living under the flag of the United States of America.   Today, I rise to reinforce our love of country, our love of our  soldiers and our veterans, but also our love of justice.   I am introducing today the Chyna Gibson stop transgender murder  epidemic act of 2023 to respect those who are different.   This particular bill will provide a commission to understand why so  many women or so many trans have been killed over the last decade.   It will establish a commission to study and develop proposals to  combat the epidemic of the murdering of nonconforming gender expansive  and transgender women of color. The duties of the commission shall be  to document and research issues regarding gender nonconforming, gender  expansive, transgender women of color face, including, but not limited  to, limited access to healthcare and limited access to housing.    I simply want to say, Mr. Speaker, that we live in this beautiful  country. I want this commission to tell us the truth and to protect  people who deserve to be protected and to live their lives.                            ____________________
