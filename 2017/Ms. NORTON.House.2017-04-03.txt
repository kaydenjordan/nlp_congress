 Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to come to the floor this  evening to coanchor the Congressional Black Caucus hour about the  present nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch.   I am very pleased that my good friend from Texas, Representative  Sheila Jackson Lee, a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee,  has agreed to coanchor this hour with me.   Mr. Speaker, I am chair of the working group for the Congressional  Black Caucus that looks at nominees for Federal courts. So, I have  buried myself in the record of Neil Gorsuch and wrote the testimony  that we submitted to the Senate.   What I will do is speak for a few minutes generally about the  nominee, and then I will go to my good friend from Texas. I am very  pleased that another good friend, Mr. Don Payne, Jr., is here from the  State of New Jersey, and we will hear from him as well.   Now, just as the Congress has been polarized so has the court been  polarized, if you look at the liberal and conservative blocks in that  way. But, of course, since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin  Scalia, there has been a 4-4 split. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is  still a Member of the Court is not always a predictable conservative,  though he tends to vote with the conservatives.   What has happened in the Senate is entirely predictable, at least  today. In an unprecedented move, the Senate refused to hear from or  even meet the nominee of President Obama. There was almost a full year,  yet the Senate refused to take up that nominee.   What happened today was not payback. If you listened to the  testimony, you would see that there are good reasons why the Senate  Democrats today decided to filibuster Judge Gorsuch.   I want to begin because I am speaking for the Congressional Black  Caucus with his views as they affect African-Americans and, by  definition, others who depend upon the antidiscrimination laws and the  Constitution of the United States.   There is more than enough in the record on race related matters from  Judge Gorsuch's 10th Circuit service to oppose his nomination. But let  me focus for a moment on his pre-court service, which seems to have  predicted what he would do in the court of appeals.   He was a principal deputy to the principal who had jurisdiction over  the Civil Rights Division. We have to pay attention to the fact that  the inspector general, during Judge Gorsuch's time in the Justice  Department, found that the Civil Rights Division, where he had some  oversight, had been politicized in order to stifle civil rights  enforcement. As you might imagine, the Congressional Black Caucus had  to pay attention to that finding by a neutral investigator.   We also are very concerned about how Gorsuch is a Justice Department  Official treated a Georgia election law. As we know, election laws from  the South--of course, there has been a historic decision that has made  the Voting Rights Act far less effective than it was--but certainly  during most of the time of the Act, Southern states had to go through  the Justice Department to  [[Page H2622]]  see if the laws in southern States, that had kept African-Americans  from voting for reasons of race, to see if newly enacted laws affecting  voting rights, in fact, discriminated against African-Americans and  others or not.   A Georgia election law was found by the Civil Rights Division to be  discriminatory. Judge Gorsuch was part of the team that overturned the  Civil Rights Division. That was, of course, challenged in the courts.  And the ruling of the Justice Department that pre-cleared the law--that  said it was all right to go ahead with this law that the Civil Rights  Division had found discriminated against Blacks--the court overturned  that finding of the Justice Department.   It used quite pregnant language. The District Court said that the  Georgia election law was reminiscent of Jim Crow laws. Those words have  special meaning in our history--and I speak not here about African- Americans alone. But if you have found yourself in the minority on any  issue--it could be a First Amendment issue, it could be a criminal  justice issue--you want a court that will protect your rights, not only  the rights of the majority.   But this nominee has shown a hostility to litigation in the courts  that have been the primary ways we have vindicated constitutional  rights and the rights of minorities of every kind. In a telling op-ed,  this nominee, Mr. Gorsuch, said: ``American liberals have become  addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than  elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting  their social agenda.''   What? What else was there? The majority had enforced laws against the  minority--in this case, African-Americans. He conceded that Brown v.  Board of Education the school desegregation decision. But he went on to  say that liberals should ``kick their addiction'' to constitutional  litigation. This is a man who wants to get on the Court whose most  important mission is constitutional litigation.    I submit to you that even the Justice who epitomized conservatism,  Justice Scalia, never showed hostility coming to Court to vindicate the  rights of people who felt themselves to be offended. So in that  respect, I think it is clear that--and this is a very important  respect--Judge Gorsuch is more conservative than Justice Scalia was on  the Court.   Nothing could be more concerning than a Justice who says: Look, the  preferred way to vindicate your rights is the political process.   Who would disagree with that?   It is the failure of the political process that sends people to the  court.   It shows, it seems to me, little appreciation for the Bill of Rights  itself. The entire Bill of Rights is about the rights of the minority.  And again, the word ``minority'' means any of us could be in that  minority at any given point. You could be in that minority when it  comes to religious rights. You could be in that minority because of a  search and seizure case. You could be in that minority because of a  free speech case. And, yes, you could be in that minority because you  are part of a classic minority group.   That is why the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were added to the  Bill of Rights. The Framers, of course, shared Gorsuch's preference for  the political process. A Constitution is a, small D, democratic  document. But they created a separation of powers government knowing  full well that majoritarian democracy sometimes treads on the rights of  minorities. That is why we have the Supreme Court of the United States  which Mr. Gorsuch seeks a seat.   Mr. Speaker, before I go on to discuss some cases, I yield to the  gentleman from New Jersey, (Mr. Payne), my good friend from New  Jersey's 10th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne) for those cogent remarks.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    I thank my friend for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I was the chair, before I came to Congress, in another  life, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, dealing with job  discrimination in our country. I was interested, in my own research on  Judge Gorsuch to find that he has written more opinions in  discrimination cases than other cases.   Now, the Rocky Mountain States of the Tenth Circuit do not have large  numbers of African Americans, but the way in which the Supreme Court  has interpreted antidiscrimination laws doesn't, in fact, basically  differ from one group.   The EEOC also has jurisdiction over disability discrimination. For  example, the Court has always indicated that anti-discrimination laws  should be read broadly in order to capture discrimination. Whether we  are talking about the antidiscrimination laws as they affect women or  racial or ethnic minorities or religious minorities, the Supreme Court  simply will not read these laws narrowly.   But that is not how Judge Gorsuch has operated on the Tenth Circuit.  He has given a cramped interpretation of the antidiscrimination laws,  and yet it is interesting to note that, when there is a claim of  discrimination based on religion, he gives a very broad interpretation.   He is perhaps best known for his opinion in the so-called Hobby Lobby  case. This is the case in which he found that a closely held  corporation was within its rights when it refused to adopt the  Affordable Health Care Act's mandate that women and men be granted  contraceptive protection as a part of health insurance. Judge Gorsuch  found that this was a violation of the rights of the closely held  corporation, the first time there has been such a holding.   It is very interesting also to note that right after that, there was  a case called Little Sisters of the Poor. Now, the Little Sisters of  the Poor, unlike the closely held corporation, is, in fact, a religious  organization, and they too said they do not wish to have contraception  be a part of any of the institutions that they govern.   Remember, we had a religious organization there, not a closely held  corporation. The Court found that, to accommodate both women and the  religious scruples of the Little Sisters, the Little Sisters had only  to acknowledge that they did not desire to enforce the contraceptive  mandate, and then it would be taken away from them and would be done by  a third party, by the government. That was allowed as a way to  accommodate the Little Sisters. Judge Gorsuch opposed that and wrote an  opposing opinion.   So to see this difference in the way he treats discrimination,  reading antidiscrimination statutes affecting minorities of every kind  in a narrow fashion; when he finds religious discrimination by statute,  he reads those statutes very broadly.   His technical rulings are of statutes that the Supreme Court has  broadly interpreted, would have made these statutes worthless. You  simply cannot enforce antidiscrimination statutes by treating them as  though they were technical statutes that, for example, govern financial  dealings. And yet this nominee has brought that kind of interpretation  of antidiscrimination statutes.   I was shocked at his holding in Hwang v. Kansas State University,  which illustrates what I am saying. There, a professor brought a case  because her university had refused to follow the guidance of the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission. She was entitled to a 6-month leave  to accommodate her condition. This is a statute involving disability  rights. She took that 6-month leave and asked to have it extended until  a day certain, not indefinitely, to recover further from cancer and a  bone marrow transplant.   Now, the EEOC guidance said that an additional leave beyond 6 months  was possible as an accommodation to an employee unless there was an  undue hardship. There was no undue hardship.   But this nominee, Judge Gorsuch, found that the ``6 months was more  than enough to comply with the law in nearly every case''--yes, in  nearly every case--but the EEOC guidance said that there obviously  could be extensions. I can think of no case that would call for more of  an extension than a professor who said: I will come back on a date  certain, but I have a cancer diagnosis, and I have had a bone marrow  transplant.   I hope that that case would give some pause to anyone who hears about  it. The nominee has been quite consistent in how he has ruled in the  Tenth Circuit, which gives every reason to believe that he is going to  carry that consistency to the Supreme Court.   I was very interested to see how he ruled on a Planned Parenthood  case where the Governor of Utah had seen these notorious false videos  that purported to show the sale of fetal tissue.                                time  2030    Now, those videos--every court that has considered those videos have  found that they had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood and what it  actually did. So this matter has been litigated in a number of  circuits. It was litigated in the 10th Circuit in a case called Planned  Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert; and the 10th Circuit found,  as the other circuits have, that these videos were not, in fact,  associated with Planned Parenthood--the false videos that surfaced.  [[Page H2625]]    Interestingly, the court, on rehearing, which Judge Gorsuch had  sought, characterized his dissenting opinion as ``mischaracterization  of this litigation and the panel opinion at several turns.''   Here again, we see Judge Gorsuch going out of his way to rule in a  fashion that he sees as necessary to sustain his broad views of  religious claims. I am trying to give you an overview of Judge  Gorsuch's opinions in a number of different areas, and I am mystified  by how he would reach the conclusions he has reached in discrimination  cases.   Here is one that is very revealing: A.F. ex rel Christine B. v.  Espanola Public Schools, where a student was found by Judge Gorsuch not  to be able to sue for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act  because she had earlier settled a suit for violations of another act,  the so-called IDEA Act.   Well, she has a right under both laws. She would have obviously  raised perhaps different claims, but his view was that she should not  be in court. This closing of the courts must be taken seriously in  evaluating Judge Gorsuch. Because if you can't get into court in the  first place, particularly if you are a member of a minority group, or  for the moment find yourself in the minority on a particular issue,  then you are out of court before you are in court. You have lost before  you cross the threshold.   I can't imagine why Judge Gorsuch didn't allow a student to continue  when she had, in frustration, left her school because of violations of  her disability rights. That frustration, as far as he was concerned,  closed the courthouse door to her.   Why would we want to interpret discrimination laws in a fashion that  you can't get into court to make your case?   A particularly cruel case, Compass Environmental v. OSHRC, a case  where Gorsuch wrote the dissent, involved a worker who was electrocuted  and died as a result. The corporation had trained its workers. This  worker happened to be hired after the training had taken place;  therefore, was not aware of all of the safeguards.   The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission found that the  electrocution of the worker could have been avoided if the corporation,  Compass Environmental, had provided the necessary training. So it cited  Compass and it fined Compass. Gorsuch dissented. He found that the  company had not violated the law. The company hadn't provided the  requisite training. The man was electrocuted, and it is very  instructive what Judge Gorsuch said:         ``Administrative agencies enjoy remarkable powers in our       legal order. Their interpretations of ambiguous statutes       control even when everyone thinks Congress really meant       something else.''    He didn't like the administrative ruling, so he dissented and would  have ruled against the family of a man who was electrocuted.   That is not a man I want on the Supreme Court. This is not a man who  knows how to interpret the discrimination statutes which have always  been interpreted broadly by the Federal courts. This is not a man who  should sit on the Supreme Court of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), my good friend who is coanchoring this hour with me, who would  like to say a few words.    I thank my good friend for helping us document why we  believe this is not the time for this Justice to be on the Supreme  Court.   We recognize that it is not the House of Representatives that decides  this matter, but the Congressional Black Caucus represents 17 million  Americans who will be deeply affected by who sits on this Court. I  appreciate that we have had this full hour to express our views.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 45 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, April 4, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
