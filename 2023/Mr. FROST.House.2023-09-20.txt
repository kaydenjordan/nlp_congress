 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in solidarity with  the nearly 150,000 United Auto Workers who are bravely leading the  fight for fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions.   It is important that the industry supports a contract that rewards  autoworkers for the sacrifices they have made and the profits they have  built for these companies and our economy. Let's not forget that in  2008 these workers did their part. They stayed on the job and kept  manufacturing and production going while the government swooped in to  keep the industry afloat.   These workers didn't complain when we supported the big automakers,  but now it is our turn to support them. The Big Three car manufacturers  are experiencing record profits. Their CEOs are bringing home millions  of dollars and 40 percent pay increases--that is right, 40 percent pay  increases--while their workers cannot say the same.   Generation Z--something I am very proud of--is America's most pro- union generation, overwhelmingly supporting union workers time and time  again. Now Congress needs to stand in solidarity with working people  and do what is necessary in the struggle for what they deserve: fair  wages, better benefits, and safe working conditions. I am proud to  stand with the United Auto Workers.                       Fight Against the Climate Crisis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the climate  movement for a huge win today. President Biden has announced the  creation of the American Climate Corps, which will train tens of  thousands of young people to build the climate-friendly infrastructure  we deserve and that we need. This is youth workforce development and  will help us in many different issues, from gun violence to the  economy.   This transformational thinking is the policy and work that we deserve  to save our planet and save humanity. I thank the youth-led movements,  like the Sunrise Movement, that made moments like this possible. I  thank everyone who has championed this. This is a great step in the  greater fight to protect humanity, to fight against the climate crisis,  and to have a world that we deserve.   The climate crisis is here, and the cost of not doing anything is far  greater than the cost of taking bold action. Yes, in terms of dollars  and cents, which is usually the way we think about things here in  Congress, but I also think about the cost of human life and the cost of  humanity. Let's continue this fight together.                            ____________________
