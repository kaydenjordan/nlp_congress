 Mr. Speaker, recently I traveled to six  counties in my district and looked at different aspects of education,  ranging from Title I funds, STEM, school nutrition, and physical  education, to providing safe learning environments.   Mr. Speaker, after speaking with many students, I learned that they  are seeking new opportunities to live their dreams, and they tend to  respond best to caring adults such as parents, guardians, teachers,  coaches, custodians, and even bus drivers.   During my visits, I also was honored to serve as a teacher assistant  at Central Elementary in Northampton County.   Ms. Leanna Cahoon, also known by her students as Ms. C, stayed busy  as ever, grading tests, helping students with math and spelling, and  assisting classrooms when needed. We must applaud not only Ms. C, but  all teacher assistants and educators.   Mr. Speaker, education is a lifeline for the future, and we must  provide the resources for our students to succeed because, after all,  our young minds will be the ones who will transform not only eastern  North Carolina but America forever.                            ____________________
