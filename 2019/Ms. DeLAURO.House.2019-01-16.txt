 Madam Chair, I rise in support of Mr. Sablan's  amendment. As chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services and  Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe we must ensure  Americans can access vital health programs, especially in times of dire  need.   Yet, after terrible typhoons, Americans in the Northern Marianas  could see Medicaid run out. Unlike States, territories have finite  pools of Medicaid funding, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services estimates the Northern Marianas needs $36 million to maintain  care for Medicaid patients, up from $20 million, which we provided in  the underlying bill.   Mr. Sablan's amendment would provide that additional $16 million. We  have an obligation to help Americans in Middletown, Connecticut, and,  yes, the Northern Marianas access Medicaid as well, especially when  they need it the most.   Madam Chair, I strongly support the amendment.
