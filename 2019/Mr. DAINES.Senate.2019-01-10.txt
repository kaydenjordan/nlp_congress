 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Marshall Williams of Powder River County for his impact on  the community of Broadus.   Marshall has spent the last 39 years educating students in the small  southeast Montana community and ensuring their future success. Mr.  Williams recently received the 2018 Montana Career and Technical  Education Lifetime Achievement Award. The Association for Career and  Technical Education is a nationwide organization who recognize career  and technical educators for their professionalism and leadership in  their field. They are one of the largest national education association  dedicated to the advancement of education. This prestigious award is  for dedicated educators who have spent an extended period of time in  their respective fields.   Mr. Williams has selflessly given to each of his students, dedicating  his time and efforts to ensure their success. Marshall is currently a  teacher at Broadus High School, where he teaches ag education and shop.  Mr. Williams is constantly looking for ways to improve student's  education, as he works closely with teachers, administrators, and even  local businesses as a means of open communication on how to progress  their communities' education system.   I congratulate Marshall on being a selfless educator to the Broadus  community. I look forward to seeing his success continue to grow as  each of his students goes on to achieve their own success.                            ____________________
