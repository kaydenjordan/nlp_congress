 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding me the  time.   She and I have the pleasure of serving on the Congressional  Modernization Committee together--a bipartisan committee--and it is not  infrequent that we will have identified a problem and she will have  identified a solution, and I will think: Why haven't we come up with  that before. And we will move forward in partnership together.    I think that is the way the American people expect this House to run,  and doggone it, we are close to getting there today, Mr. Speaker.   But I listened to my colleague as she laid the mantle of blame at the  feet of our friends in the Senate and our friends in the White House,  for why can't they get more things done?   The truth is we have opportunities here to get things done, and I  will tell you, Mr. Speaker, the mantle of responsibility sits with us,  and we are missing some of those opportunities today to come together  and do things in a partnership way.   Over the weekend, Mr. Speaker, I was with our colleague, Denny Heck  from Washington State. We were in a forum on polarization in Congress,  and we were talking about what that has meant, how that has come to be,  and how legislation is affected by that. Mr. Heck said something that I  thought was very profound and not really understood outside of the  Halls of Congress. Folks often talk about their partisan achievements,  but, he said that--and I will paraphrase him--there is really a special  sense of pride that Members take in sorting out those really thorny  issues, those issues that you had to come together and work on, those  issues where you had to give a little to get a little, and those issues  that not just anybody could have solved but that we came together with  a unique mix of people at a unique time and that Members take special  pride in cracking those hardest of nuts.   I think that is exactly right. The media doesn't cover those  successes, I think, with the same glee that partisan bickering is  covered, but, absolutely, men and women of conscience in this body take  special pride in solving particularly hard problems.   We have an opportunity today, Mr. Speaker, to solve some problems,  and I am not sure that we are taking full advantage of that. Principled  compromise, Mr. Speaker, does not mean finding the lowest common  denominator. It means finding those things that all of our constituents  are asking us to do and figuring out how in 435 different districts and  different sets of ideas we can meld those things together.   We have in this rule today, Mr. Speaker, a whole host of bills. I  miss the days where we did one rule and one bill. I recognize the  pandemic has caused some time crunch problems, but I hope that when  these masks come off--as I am absolutely certain one day they will--we  will return to being a body that can handle one idea at a time and have  a full-throated debate on each idea, but this bill makes in order a  number of bills.   I will start with H.R. 2639, the Strength in Diversity Act, Mr.  Speaker. It must have been said by every Member who spoke yesterday  that discrimination is wrong, that it is immoral, that it is unlawful,  and that we  [[Page H4394]]  have to do absolutely everything we can to ensure that American school  children are treated equally in our schools. H.R. 2639 purports to do  that.   Again, this is an idea that has great bipartisan support. It has  moral right on its side. Separate is not equal, and learning from  diversity is part of the strength that our Nation provides. I am glad,  even though we offered a motion for an open rule so that all Members  could have their voices heard, my friends in the majority on the Rules  Committee saw fit to make 12 separate amendments in order, including  one from my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Allen) that I believe will make  this bill better.   The Allen amendment is an opportunity for us to work together and  move forward, not just on something that goes to the Senate, Mr.  Speaker, but something that goes to the Senate and moves beyond. I have  been there, and so I understand the need to say: I have sent my idea to  the Senate and the Senate isn't moving it, and shame on the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, if you talk to your friends in this Senate, whether it  is a Democratic-led Senate or a Republican-led Senate, they will tell  you that if you send them bad ideas they are not going to move them.   We can send good ideas to the United States Senate, Mr. Speaker, good  ideas that will move across the floor, ideas that will move to the  President's desk and thus ideas that will make a difference. We all  grow weary on this floor of talking about things we would like to do,  and we often mistake passing something using a very partisan majority  in the House as getting something done. It is not. It is absolutely  making a statement, but it is getting absolutely nothing done. Only  when the Senate acts and only when the President acts are we able to  get something done. We have that opportunity with the Allen amendment  today, Mr. Speaker, and I hope folks will take advantage of that.   Mr. Speaker, another bill that the rule makes in order is the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 2694.   Again, there is not a single Member in this body who believes that  discrimination is appropriate. This is another opportunity that we had  to work in a partnership way to move a bill forward. We all believe it  is important for employers to provide reasonable accommodations to  pregnant workers. We all want what is best for these workers; and, in  fact, we heard from the ranking member of the Education and Labor  Committee yesterday, Mr. Speaker, that Chairman Scott, the chairman of  that committee, had worked to try to make this bill better. The bill is  different today than it was when it was introduced because of that  partnership effort. Again, any good thing that comes out of this  institution comes out in a partnership way.   One more step that, of course, the minority was hoping we could make  would be one to protect religious freedoms in this bill, the rights of  religious institutions, Mr. Speaker. This is not a radical idea. This  is something we have been doing for 50 years when we have talked about  nondiscrimination statutes. It is my hope that Chairman Scott, having  heard the arguments yesterday in the Rules Committee and having heard  from our ranking member, the gentlewoman from North Carolina, Dr. Foxx,  that he will take yes for an answer. There is still time to come back  and improve this bill and get it across the floor in a very bipartisan,  again, partnership way that not just makes it to the Senate but makes  it through the Senate on to the President's desk to effect the law as  we all desire. I think the American people will thank us if we seize  this opportunity to find common ground.    Mr. Speaker, we see this, again, in H. Res. 908 that this rule makes  in order today. It condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment and bias  as it relates to COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage you to go and  read this resolution. As you know from House resolutions, you have a  series of ``and whereases'', and then you have what it is that we want  to do.   If you read this series of whereases, you will find it to be as  stridently partisan as you often find House resolutions to be, and it  is not necessary that it be that way. We all condemn and denounce anti- Asian sentiment, Mr. Speaker, all manifestations of racism, of  xenophobia, of scapegoating, and of intolerance. We all condemn those  ideas, and we all want Federal law enforcement to play a strong role in  ensuring that Asian-American communities across this country are  protected and that crimes against them are investigated and properly  prosecuted.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, in July of this year I joined, again, in a  partnership, bipartisan way Mr. Lieu and Ms. Chu on the Democratic side  of the aisle and Mr. Olson and myself on the Republican side of the  aisle. We led a letter to Attorney General Barr that included  signatories like my friend from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) asking that  the Justice Department bolster its work in this area and to send an  unambiguous message to the American people that anti-Asian bias and  discrimination will not be tolerated at any level of our government.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, because I do want to highlight those things  that we do together not in a partisan way but in a ``let's-get- something-done-together way'', I include in the Record the letter.                                  Congress of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, July 20, 2020.      Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General, Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Barr: Thank you for featuring the       quote ``Coronavirus is no excuse for hate'' on the Department       of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic       affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the       United States. Some Americans are facing increased       discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw       particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical       attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who       have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We       respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-      Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates       regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and       will take going forward to combat this behavior.        Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of       coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the       pandemic they have experienced continued harassment,       violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific       Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of       coronavirus-related discrimination. These and numerous news       reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of       services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to       physical assaults.        In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in       Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were       children, because he thought they were infecting others with       COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's       Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge       in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans. And most       recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for       Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans       have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the       coronavirus pandemic.        We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the       Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will       be investigated and prosecuted. However, the dangers faced by       the Asian American community today are very real and deserve       a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on       May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its       concerns ``over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward       Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result       of the COVID-19 pandemic'' and unanimously issued       recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this       sentiment.        We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute       respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration       immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against       Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to       monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with       the community.        Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist       attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent       attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American       communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting       coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out       forcefully. While these prior responses were not perfect,       they represented an important effort to acknowledge and       address the specific discrimination.        Despite the fear present within the community, each and       every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While       Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population,       17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American.       Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working       as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential       occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any       other group of people in our country.        We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department       of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an       unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination       against this community is un-American and will not be       tolerated. Further, we  [[Page H4395]]       would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the       Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for       your attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,        Ted W. Lieu, Member of Congress; Rob Woodall, Member of       Congress; Judy Chu, Member of Congress; Pete Olson, Member of       Congress.        Jerrold Nadler, Ted S.

Keating, Members of Congress.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, the Attorney General, I have no doubt,  feels exactly the same way about this as Ms. Scanlon and I do, as Mr.  Lieu and Ms. Chu do. And that is why I am saddened that we have a  resolution before us today that includes these ``whereases'' that make  it difficult to take ``yes'' for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I want you to remember that we had a very similar  conversation with H. Res. 576 last year. That was the resolution asking  that the whistleblower's complaint be provided to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I went up to the Rules Committee on that afternoon last  spring, and the conversation was the Trump administration is derelict,  it is full of scoundrels, all of these bad things are going on, and we  demand the whistleblower's report.   Mr. Speaker, well, what are we supposed to do with that? As Article I  says, we are entitled to the whistleblower's report, and we made a  recommendation to the chairman of the Rules Committee at that time and  to the House leadership to give us an opportunity to speak with one  Article I voice on whether or not the House is entitled to see a  whistleblower's report.   We said, ``Please, take out these partisan jabs and let's just get to  the heart of the matter and get access to those documents that we want.  In the chairman's wisdom, and in the Speaker's wisdom, they took that  advice. A resolution that had been on its way to being whipped ``no''  from the Republican side of the aisle, came back and passed with  absolutely no dissent when we decided to spend less time poking one  another and more time trying to make progress together.   Mr. Speaker, we have that opportunity again today, and I hope we will  take ``yes'' for an answer. This is obviously an election year, an  opportunity to get off the rails on partisan rhetoric from time to  time, but we all know that we speak with a stronger voice when we speak  with one voice here in this institution, and we have that opportunity  to find that space in H. Res. 908.   Mr. Speaker, finally, the last bill in this very long rule, is H.R.  2574, a measure that purports to strengthen Federal civil rights laws  in educational settings, creating a private right of action on the  theory of disparate impact.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I hope it surprises you, as it surprises me, that  we are talking about a fundamental change in American civil  jurisprudence, and this bill didn't go through the Committee on the  Judiciary at all. Now, again, it purports to change the laws it relates  to educational settings, but, of course, in fact, changes the law  across the entire spectrum of civil litigation and not one opportunity  for the Committee on the Judiciary to be heard.   Now, I talked about principle compromise and not seeking the lowest  common denominator. I don't want to pretend that it will be an easy  thing to find that common ground on disparate impact litigation.  Litigation is something that divides this House time and time again,  and it takes serious people, which is why serious men and women, like  my friend from Pennsylvania, find themselves on the Committee on the  Judiciary. It is not an easy path to find. But for not one  opportunity--and we asked the Judiciary chairman about that yesterday,  Mr. Speaker--and he said he looked at the Committee on Education's work  product and he thought it was appropriate. Well, I am glad that he does  not feel undermined by being completely left out of changes in judicial  procedure in the United States of America. I would feel that way if I  were chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. But even if he doesn't  feel left out, even if he thinks that is good enough, I have got dozens  and dozens of Members who are on the Committee on the Judiciary who  were placed on that committee because of their expertise in that area,  who have been placed on the Committee on the Judiciary because of their  thoughtfulness in this area. And I think America would benefit, not be  burdened, by having an opportunity for those voices to be heard.   Again, if your position is ``let's pass bills in the House and thank  ourselves, congratulate ourselves for passing something in the House,''  we have got exactly the right bill before us today.   If our position is, we want to make a difference for the men and  women that we serve--and I say, ``if our position is''--Mr. Speaker, I  take that back. I shouldn't have even said that, because I am certain,  knowing each one of my colleagues as I do, that it is their position  that they didn't come here to make a statement, that they did come here  to make a difference. I want it to come to fruition that we can make  that partnership progress together.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat this rule, we are going to have that  opportunity. I am not talking about an opportunity to quash any of  these bills. I am talking about an opportunity to perfect these bills  in those ways that I have mentioned, not so that they go to the Senate  and die, not so that they receive a veto threat from the White House,  but so that they go to the Senate and pass, so that they receive the  President's signature, and so that they make the difference that each  one of the men and women in this Chamber were sent here to do.   Mr. Speaker, we are close to that today, and I believe if we defeat  the rule, we can get that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't disagree with a word my friend from  Massachusetts had to say, and, in fact, I want to thank him for joining  the letter that we led on this very topic in a bipartisan way earlier  this year. And I do not believe I am speaking out of turn. If the  gentleman will partner with me for stripping out the political  ``whereases'' in this resolution, I am certain not only will we get a  bipartisan vote, we will get a huge bipartisan vote in the same way  that we did when you followed that same good advice that I gave about  this time last year.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will amend the  rule to make in order H.R. 1325, the Protect and Serve Act, and H.R.  8251.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Congressional Record immediately prior to the vote on  the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, these measures before us today are  critically important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), a gentleman who can speak to these critically important  issues with not just his words, but with a lifetime of service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of my friend from California.  What makes this institution strong is so many of those experiences that  each one of us brings from our lives.   Again, we have an opportunity to speak with exactly the one voice  that my friend asks us to if we can simply remove the partisanship from  this resolution and make it the condemning resolution that it should  absolutely be.   Along those lines, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 4 minutes to my  friend from Missouri to talk about, again, not hijacking the rule by  defeating the previous question, but simply adding to what is already a  very long rule, two additional bipartisan measures that won't just be  statements, Mr. Speaker. They will be opportunities to move through the  Senate and on to the President's desk.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I can't say it any better than my friends from Missouri and Florida  have just said it.   My colleague from Pennsylvania is absolutely right, Mr. Speaker. We  have a regular order process. Here we are, halfway through September.  We are back for our first day of session this month. I wish we were  here more. I wish there was more work going on. I wish there was less  campaigning and more working together, but there simply isn't.   The previous question is an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to add things  to the rule. You can use it to hijack the rule. You can use it to take  down the rule. That is not what we are doing today. What we are asking,  Mr. Speaker, is to add two commonsense, bipartisan bills.   Mr. Speaker, you heard the arguments from the gentleman from Florida  and the gentlewoman from Missouri. Did you object to a single word that  they had to say? Did you find one bit of partisanship or disagreement  in their words? You did not.   The question isn't are we going to get some Democratic votes to  defeat the previous question and add these two bills. We are. We  absolutely are because these are bipartisan ideas. The question isn't  if we are going to get them. The question is: Are we going to get  enough?   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, the question isn't if their words ring  true with you. The question is, knowing that their words rang true with  you, will you add your vote to theirs? I am asking you to do that. I am  asking my friend from Pennsylvania to do that. I am asking my friends  from Massachusetts and California to do that.   I opened the debate today, Mr. Speaker, telling you we were so close  to what I believe every man and woman in this Chamber come here to do,  and that is work together, not to pick a fight, not to make an  argument, but to make a difference. With some minor, minor tweaks, we  can do that with every single piece of legislation that my friends in  the majority want to bring forward today.   With just one vote to defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker, and  no tweaks at all, we can do that with the two measures that the  gentlewoman from Missouri and the gentleman from Florida have put  before us here today.   Mr. Speaker, vote with me. Defeat the previous question. Let's move  forward to speak with one voice, not just to condemn anti-American  sentiment, not just to protect pregnant women in the workplace, but to  stand behind the public safety officers, the men and women in this  country who show up every day of the week for us.   I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. In the absence  of that, let's defeat the rule and follow exactly the advice my friend  from Pennsylvania suggested, take all of these bills back to committee  and bring them back out one more time. It doesn't have to be that way.  We can move forward today.   Mr. Speaker, I do encourage my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
