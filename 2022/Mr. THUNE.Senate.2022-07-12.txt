 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court  overturned Roe v. Wade, returning the question of abortion to the  States and to the people and their elected representatives.   The Supreme Court's decision was an affirmation of democracy, which  had been set aside by Roe in favor of a national abortion regime  imposed upon the entire country by a handful of activist Justices. Roe  took legislative power out of the hands of the people and put it in the  hands of unelected Justices on nonexistent constitutional grounds. The  Supreme Court's decision puts the question of abortion back in the  hands of the States and the people and their elected representatives,  where it should always have been.   I am profoundly grateful for this decision, most especially because  of what is at stake here, because the Roe decision was not a failure of  constitutional jurisprudence on some arcane point; it was a failure  that infringed on our most fundamental rights as human beings--in fact,  on the fundamental right: the right to life.   Roe not only allowed for but imposed a regime that forced States to  legalize the killing of unborn human beings. So the decision to  overturn Roe not only affirms democracy and repairs a constitutional  wrong, it allows for the righting of a profound moral wrong: the legal  killing of unborn Americans.   The Supreme Court's decision does not, of course, make abortion  illegal, but it will finally--finally--allow those States to choose to  put in place protections for unborn children.  [[Page S3219]]    Since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion through all 9 months of  pregnancy, more than 63 million children have been killed in this  country by abortion--63 million. It is an unfathomable number and,  frankly, a heartbreaking number. To put it into some kind of  perspective, that is more than twice the population of the State of  Texas and more than 70 times the population of my home State of South  Dakota. Sixty-three million. Sixty-three million unique, unrepeatable  human beings--future doctors and nurses and farmers and teachers and  busdrivers and plumbers and scientists. That is a lot of innocent lives  lost.   And, yes, when we talk about unborn babies, we are talking about  human lives. Members of the pro-abortion left would like to obscure  this fact, but science and medical technology and plain old common  sense, I would add, all clearly demonstrate the humanity of the unborn  child. Every mom who has ever felt her unborn baby kick is well aware  that she isn't just carrying around a clump of cells, and ultrasound  technology and medical advancements have made the humanity of the  unborn child even more undeniable. It is impossible to hear the  heartbeat of an unborn child at 6 weeks and say that he or she is not  alive. It is impossible to look at an unborn baby on an ultrasound  kicking her feet and moving her hands and sucking her thumb and to  pretend that she is anything but a human being. And human beings  deserve to be protected.   Democrats' response to the Dobbs decision has been predictably  hysterical. We have heard cries to pack the Supreme Court because  apparently the only legitimate Supreme Court is a Supreme Court that  rules in line with Democrats' policy preferences. We have heard cries  to abolish the filibuster and to eliminate protections for the minority  party in the Senate and the Americans whom it represents. We have heard  a proposal to establish abortion facilities in national parks.   I am struggling to think of any family who wants an abortion facility  to be part of the itinerary offered on their trip to Yellowstone or the  Badlands of South Dakota; but, apparently, some Democrats think our  national parks should become abortion factories.   Then, of course, there is the flood of misinformation out there  falsely suggesting that pro-life laws would prevent women from getting  essential medical care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. And on  top of all this, multiple Democrats have started a crusade against  pregnancy resource centers. That is right. Pregnancy resource centers-- which were established to provide moms in need with things like diapers  and baby clothes, prenatal and parenting classes, help connecting with  State and local resources, emotional support, and agency referrals for  moms who want to choose adoption--are now under attack by members of  the Democratic Party.   Apparently, the pro-choice party can't stand the idea that women  might be offered a choice other than abortion.   When the Dobbs decision was handed down, the President called it a  sad day for our country--a sad day. To the President and his party,  apparently it is a sad day when the doors open to greater protection  for human life and human rights. I would say that it is a sad day when  the right to kill unborn human beings has become the signature issue of  the Democratic Party, when the party that portrays itself as the  defender of the little guy has become the party that wants to deny even  the smallest protection to the littlest guys and girls among us.   The Democrats' vision of America is not my vision of America. I  believe that America is big enough to take care of both moms and their  babies. We don't have to pit moms and babies against each other. We can  take care of them both. It is something the pro-life movement has been  focused on for years and something that a number of States have worked  to do with their Alternatives to Abortion programs. And I know that  commitment will only grow in the wake of the Dobbs decision.   Those who seek to deny human rights to some human beings are never  found to be on the right side of history, as our Nation knows, to its  sorrow. Our country was founded to protect human rights--the right to  life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness; but for almost 50  years now, our country has failed to protect the human rights of unborn  human beings.   Today, thanks to the Dobbs decision, we have a chance to change that.  We have a chance to build a society where the life of every American is  valued and where being small and vulnerable does not mean that your  human rights are any less respected. At our best, we are a country that  defends human rights, not denies them. We stand up for the innocent. We  protect them. We fight for them. It is time to live up to that.   The Dobbs decision gives us a chance to protect the human rights of  the smallest and most innocent humans among us, but the Dobbs decision  would never have happened without the tireless work of so many since  the day Roe v. Wade was decided. It would never have happened without  those who prayed, who offered help to moms in need, who fought for the  rights of unborn Americans in elections, in courts, and in State  legislatures.   ``Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,'' it says in  the book of Proverbs, and for 50 years that is what members of the pro- life movement have done. And it is their work that has brought us to  this day when we finally, once again, have a chance to protect innocent  unborn Americans in law. May the Lord reward their work and their wages  be full from the Lord.   I know that sometimes it seemed like the day when Roe v. Wade would  be overturned would never come, but it is here. And while there is  still much work to be done to ensure that the human rights of unborn  Americans are respected and that moms and their babies have the support  they need, it is, nevertheless, a moment for joy and for gratitude. I  am profoundly grateful for this decision, profoundly grateful that we  now have the opportunity to move closer to the day when we fully live  up to our founding principles and ensure that every American--born or  unborn--has the opportunity for life, for liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.
