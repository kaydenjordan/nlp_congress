 Madam Speaker, those who are fair-minded and want  to understand President Trump better should read his best-selling book  from 30 years ago, which is as timely today as it was then. It is  called ``The Art of the Deal'' and reveals these characteristics.   Donald Trump usually makes decisions quickly based on knowledge,  experience, and intuition, rather than waiting for consultants'  studies. He is a tough but practical negotiator willing to compromise  to achieve a goal. He gets a deal done sooner or later, even if it  sometimes takes years.   He is a counterpuncher who doesn't like to start a fight but will  give more than he receives. He is loyal to friends who are loyal to  him.   Most of the President's actions should be of no surprise to anyone  who has read his book. In fact, those who are objective are likely to  appreciate him more.                            ____________________
