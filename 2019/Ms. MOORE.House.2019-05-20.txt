 Madam Speaker, I am so happy that H.R. 2480 includes  several noteworthy improvements to the CAPTA Act. One is a bill that I  introduced last Congress called Family Poverty is Not Child Neglect  Act. It recognizes that 75 percent of child abuse referrals are not  because of malicious abuse, but because of symptoms of poverty that  officials categorize as neglect.   It would mandate States to treat those conditions of poverty with  service-based remedies that will reduce the parental separation risk  disproportionately affecting low-income children and families.   I am so pleased that federally-supported distinctions between  poverty-based lack and parental maltreatment unrelated to poverty has  been added to our Stronger CAPTA bill.   Poverty-related conditions should be met with poverty-alleviating  solutions, not child separation.   Madam Speaker, I just want to share my own personal story. My own  experience, at age 18, was that I was separated from my child, who was  placed in foster care, because my scholarship money would not cover  living expenses. And while she was placed in a loving foster home, this  was traumatic for me, and constituted an adverse childhood experience  for my daughter.   So I am so pleased to stand here today to say, as a witness, that we  should do everything we can to avoid child separations, and this bill  addresses it.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of the authors on both sides of the aisle.
