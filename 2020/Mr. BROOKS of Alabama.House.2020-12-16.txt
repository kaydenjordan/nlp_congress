 Madam Speaker, as an overview, House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, without a floor vote, has dictated that we wear a mask  while speaking on the House floor or we will be silenced; hence, my  mask.   Madam Speaker, this is my seventh speech in a series on voter fraud,  election theft, and the presidential election.   Today, I continue citing an August 29, 2020, New York Post expose  that reveals the sordid underbelly of voter fraud and election theft  that plague American elections.   The New York Post, after confirming a Democrat election thief  expert's ``rap sheet and long history working as a  [[Page H7164]]  consultant to various campaigns,'' reveals his stunning election theft  strategies and view that ``election fraud is more the rule than the  exception.''   The Democrat election theft expert steals elections at nursing homes,  stating: ``Hitting up assisted-living facilities and helping the  elderly fill out their absentee ballots was a gold mine of votes. There  are nursing homes where the nurse is actually a paid operative. They  literally fill the ballot out for them.''   The Democrat election theft expert steals elections by exploiting  weak voter identification laws.   ``The Democrat election theft expert would send operatives to vote in  polling stations, particularly in States likes New Jersey and New York  that do not require voter ID.''                                time  1215    The Democrat election expert describes how he deploys his election  theft team:         You fill out these index cards with that person's name and       district, and you go around the city and say: You are going       to be him. You are going to be him.        At the polling place, the fake voter would sign in and       vote.        The imposters re-create the signature that already appears       in the voter roll as best they could. In the rare instance       that a real voter had already signed in and cast a ballot,       the impersonator would just chalk it up to an innocent       mistake and bolt.        The Democrat election theft expert steals elections at       homeless shelters, which offer a nearly inexhaustible pool of       reliable--buyable--voters.        Laughing at the roughly $174 per vote Mike Bloomberg spent       to win his third mayoral term, he said he could have       delivered the same result at a 70 percent discount.    Madam Speaker, voter fraud and election theft increasingly rot at the  foundation of America's republic: our elections.   Voting by illegal aliens and other noncitizens is rampant and  flipping elections because socialist Democrats have made it illegal to  require proof of citizenship when illegal aliens and other noncitizens  demand to be registered to vote.   This year, at a minimum, hundreds of thousands and, more likely,  millions of illegal aliens and other noncitizens voted after Joe Biden  openly promised amnesty and citizenship if he is elected President.   Vote-by-mail schemes are both horribly prone to voter fraud and  illegal because they violate Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution  and Congress' ensuing designation, with minor exceptions, of one 24- hour day as the election day during which citizens can vote. Congress  could have but did not create an election week, an election month, or  an election season.   Madam Speaker, the overwhelming and irrefutable evidence compels but  one conclusion: If only lawful votes cast by eligible American citizens  are counted, then Donald Trump won the electoral college.   In 1776 American patriot Thomas Paine said it best:         These are the times that try men's souls. The summer       soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink       from the service of their country, but he that stands by it       now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny,       like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this       consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more       glorious the triumph.    Madam Speaker, I urge all American patriots to join the fight for  America and against dictatorial socialism. Why? Because America is  worth fighting for.   As such, on January 6, 2021, provided the required one Senator joins  me, I will move to reject electoral college submissions of all States  whose election systems are so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance.                            ____________________
