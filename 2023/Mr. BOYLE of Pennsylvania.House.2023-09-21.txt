 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Everett  Beauregard, who 1 year ago tomorrow was senselessly taken from us in an  act of gun violence in Philadelphia.   I thank Everett's family and friends for joining us in the House  gallery this morning and also thank them for the opportunity to stand  with them last  [[Page H4442]]  year to commemorate Everett's beautiful life.   I am here today because, like so many others, Everett impacted my  life and the lives of my staff for the better.   In 2018, Everett worked for me, helping my team in enthusiastically  engaging with Philadelphia residents about the issues that were most  important to them.   His commitment to serving the public was evident from the outset. It  was and is something for which I will always be grateful.   As we mark this tragic anniversary, I reiterate the Beauregard  family's ask that anyone with information regarding this senseless act  of violence please come forward.   Your help can bring the person responsible for this heinous act to  justice. Every piece of information, no matter how small, can help  bring a sense of closure to Everett's family and many friends. You have  the power to come forward and help. I implore you to do so.   Thank you, God, for this wonderful human being you gave us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from  that other Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for  yielding.   We are 9 days away--9 days and maybe call it 14 hours--from a  government shutdown. It is completely unnecessary.   In this Chamber just 3 months ago, we had a vote. We voted to raise  the debt ceiling, and we also voted to set the parameters and the  figures for what next year's budget would be. That vote was  overwhelmingly bipartisan. Eighty percent of House Democrats and almost  two-thirds of House Republicans voted for it. There was a similarly  large bipartisan vote in the Senate, and it was then signed into law by  the President.   I thought at that point: Well, this is good news. Not only are we  ensuring we didn't go over the cliff in terms of the debt ceiling, but  it looks like we won't have another Republican-forced government  shutdown.   Yet, here we are. Why? Because the Speaker of the House reneged on  that deal even though two-thirds of their side of the aisle joined 80  percent of us in voting for it.   Honor the agreement that we had and that you voted for. This is  completely unnecessary.   Yesterday in the Budget Committee, we marked up a completely  partisan, one-sided budget resolution in an all-  [[Page H4447]]  day markup--$16 trillion worth of cuts, completely unrealistic. The  Congressional Budget Office itself labeled it a cuts-only approach.   During that hearing, I pointed out that in previous government  shutdowns, the Republican government shutdown in 2013 cost the economy  upward of $6 billion. There were more than 120,000 fewer jobs as a  result of that government shutdown. A subsequent Republican-forced  government shutdown also cost the economy billions of dollars and also  cost us jobs.   While it might be a game for some in Washington, D.C.--there are  quotes from a number of Members on the other side of the aisle, by the  way, saying they want a government shutdown. Don't take my word for it,  just read the quotes of some of the Republican Members of the House  cheering a government shutdown, saying that there will be no problem at  all.    If only that were so. It costs us billions of dollars. Nothing good  comes out of it.   Actually, I take that back. There is one thing that is good that  comes out of it. Each and every time over the last 30 years that  Republicans have forced a government shutdown, in the subsequent  election, they are punished by the voters.   That was the case back in 1995. It was the beginning of Bill  Clinton's comeback. He was losing at the polls at that moment to Bob  Dole. Then the government shut down, the Gingrich-Dole shutdown, and  Bill Clinton came back and went on to win reelection by over 8 points.   Similarly, in 2011, Barack Obama, at that moment, the polls showed  him losing to Mitt Romney. Republican extremism forced the shutdown.  Their extremism in playing around with the debt ceiling led to the  first-ever downgrade in American history. Barack Obama ends up coming  back and beats Mitt Romney a year later by 4 points.   So maybe there is one good thing that comes out of Republican  extremism.   If there is anything clear over the last 9 months, it is that this  side doesn't have a clue about governing. I keep hearing about the  small majority. We know what it is like to have a small majority. We  had the exact same five-seat majority last term. What did we do with  it? We passed the most ambitious domestic policy legislation since  1965.   What has this side done? It takes them 15 votes just to elect their  own guy Speaker. Now, they keep haranguing the poor guy, keep  threatening him with the job day after day. Now, he is reneging on his  own agreement that he brought here and voted for and that we passed in  June.   By the way, we all know the way this is going to end, whether it is  before a shutdown or afterward. The only thing that can pass the  Senate, pass the House, and be signed into law by the President looks a  lot like that legislation that passed here in June.   I hope that it doesn't take a government shutdown for the other side  to finally get with it and learn these lessons.   The reality is ordinary Americans will suffer as a result of a  government shutdown. It is completely unnecessary, and if it happens,  it is solely the blame of the House Republican leadership.
