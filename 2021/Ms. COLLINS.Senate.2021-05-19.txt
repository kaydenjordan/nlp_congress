 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Helping  American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act, the HAVANA Act.  Our bill would provide assistance to the employees of the intelligence  community and other Federal Agencies who have suffered from traumatic  brain injuries at the hands of our foreign adversaries.   I am joined today by a bipartisan group of cosponsors, including  Senators Warner and Rubio, the chairman and vice chair of the Senate  Intelligence Committee, and Senators Shaheen, Cornyn, Bennet, Burr,  Gillibrand, Blunt, Heinrich, Sasse, Feinstein, Cotton, King, and Risch.  Most of those are members of the Intelligence Committee, and they share  my deep concern and my determination to get to the bottom of what has  happened to these brave men and women who have been attacked.   For many years, American personnel serving in Cuba, China, and  elsewhere have experienced unexplained, serious medical harm,  including, in some cases, permanent brain injuries. These conditions  are believed to be connected to a mysterious direct energy weapon used  by those who are our adversaries.   As we investigate the source of previous attacks and seek to prevent  future ones, the bill that I am introducing today would provide  additional financial assistance to Americans who were injured and who  continue to experience debilitating symptoms. Too many of the victims  have had to fight to get the medical care they need for their injuries.  This is completely unacceptable.   Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine released a report on the more than 40 American diplomats at  the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, and at least a dozen American  diplomats at the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, who suffered  symptoms ``consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed  radiofrequency energy.'' Just this month, the New York Times reported  that the number of American personnel who have fallen ill under these  mystifying circumstances is much higher, possibly more than 130 cases.  Now, we are even hearing reports of cases occurring within the United  States.   The injuries that many of these victims have endured are significant  and life-altering. These attacks have left Americans serving our  country with damage that ranges in severity but can include reduced  balance, eyesight, and hearing. Some have severe, permanent headaches.  Others have brain injuries that have resulted in reduced cognitive  function. Many of them can no longer perform their jobs and have been  forced to medically retire.   To make matters worse, some of the victims did not receive the  financial and medical support they should have expected from their  government when they first reported their injuries. This is an  outrageous failure on the part of our government to care for those who  serve.   Our bill would give additional authority to the CIA Director and to  the Secretary of State to provide financial support to these Americans  who experience traumatic brain injuries from attacks that occur while  serving our country. Due to limitations in the current law, several  victims suffering from cognitive impairment are not receiving all of  the medical care and other assistance they need to cope with the  impacts of their injuries. The authorities provided in the HAVANA Act  will help to rectify this problem.   I have spoken personally with some of the victims of these heinous  attacks. This is a group who unfortunately is growing in number. To  those victims, I want to pledge to them today that, along with the  cosponsors of our bill, I am totally committed to making sure that our  government finds out who is responsible for these devastating attacks,  and I further pledge to the victims that you will receive the financial  support and medical care that you deserve.   I have spoken several times to CIA Director Burns about these  attacks, and I am heartened by his commitment and his attitude. He has  made commitments to the Senate Intelligence Committee, as has the  Director of National Intelligence, to care for these victims and to get  to the bottom of these attacks.   We need a whole-of-government approach to identify the heartless  adversary who is deliberately targeting American personnel.   The public servants who work in our Embassies and Consulates and in  other locations overseas make many personal sacrifices to represent  America's interests. They deserve our strong support when they are  harmed in the line of duty, just as we care for soldiers who are  injured on the battlefield.   I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this vital  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):  [[Page S2785]]    S. 1718. A bill to amend the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home  Front National Historical Park Establishment Act of 200 to provide for  additional areas to be added to the park, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
