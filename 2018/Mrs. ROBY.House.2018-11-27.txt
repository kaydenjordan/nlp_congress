 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his generosity in  yielding a few minutes for this very important moment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute as well to a true public  servant, Rex Buffington. Rex has dedicated so much of his professional  life to supporting leaders in this country, most recently, as you have  already heard, as the executive director of the John C. Stennis Center  for Public Service Leadership, where he has served admirably since the  Stennis Center's establishment in 1988.   After many years of encouraging new leaders and supporting existing  ones, Rex is retiring. His tireless efforts will be greatly missed, but  I know I speak for many who know him in saying we are proud of him and  we are confident that his next chapter brings more wonderful  milestones.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Rex. His  work for the Stennis Center has positively impacted American leaders  from all generations and walks of life, from high school students to  the Members of Congress who walk these halls today. I know this  firsthand because I am one of those Members that he has impacted.   I wish Rex, John Gavin, and Catherine great success in the road  ahead. He will be missed, but his impact will be felt for many years to  come.                                time  2000
