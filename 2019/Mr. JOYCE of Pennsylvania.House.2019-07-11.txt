 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and further thank him for his leadership on border security  matters and for opposing this harmful and extremist amendment.   Madam Chair, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York. This amendment is  dangerous, and it is disrespectful to the hardworking men and women of  our Border Patrol.   To make matters worse, my same colleague who is pushing this  amendment also wants to eliminate the Department of Homeland Security.   Madam Chair, if you want to get rid of DHS and you want to take away  DOD's ability to help secure the border, who is going to be left to  stop the drug traffickers and the cartel members who continue to  infiltrate our country in record numbers?   Madam Chair, this amendment is just another step in the ongoing  effort by my colleagues across the aisle to make us a country of open  borders.   I urge all Members of the House to stand up for the rule of law and  reject this amendment.
