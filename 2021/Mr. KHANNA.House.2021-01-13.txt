 Madam Speaker, I am voting to impeach because, as Lincoln  said, no grievance is a fit object of redress by mob law.   But we must recognize that our hard work begins when we address the  real grievances and despair in left-behind communities. To be worthy of  this Capitol that we hold sacred, to fix our broken windows and broken  communities, let's finally commit to investing trillions in creating  good jobs in healthcare, in education, and in infrastructure for  communities and places that are hurting.
