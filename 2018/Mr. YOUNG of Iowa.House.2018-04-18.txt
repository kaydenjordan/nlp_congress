 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Ms.  Jenkins and Mr. Lewis, and Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal, for  working on such a commonsense bill that is very bipartisan, of course.   We expect to see that kind of support on the floor as well as that of  the committee.   I rise in support of this great bill, H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First  Act. My bill--and I thank the committee--H.R. 5386, the IRS Fair  Appeals Saving Taxpayers Act, or IRS FAST Act, was included in the  final text of the underlying bill. So this bill, in particular, will  help hardworking taxpayers navigate the IRS maze by requiring the IRS  to turn over all nonprivileged documents to an individual or business  if the taxpayer appeals the IRS' determination decision.   Taxpayers are finally being given an equal playing field. Under  current law, the IRS will only turn over a taxpayer's documents through  a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA request, a process which most  taxpayers don't know even exists. It takes a long time and is difficult  to navigate. In a court of law, everyone has the right to see the  evidence that will be used against them, and the IRS is not above the  law and should not be able to play games with taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, it shouldn't take a FOIA, a Freedom of Information Act,  request to see what evidence the IRS is going to use against you. The  IRS FAST Act, which is within H.R. 5444, will require the IRS to  provide taxpayers with their case file prior to any review of their  dispute with the IRS.   It is common sense and the taxpayers have a victory here. Allowing  taxpayers this opportunity is an important step toward bringing  accountability and transparency to the IRS. It will improve the  experience for taxpayers when navigating the IRS appeals process,  saving them time and money.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see my bill included in the final  legislation, H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act, and I thank my  colleagues for their leadership.
