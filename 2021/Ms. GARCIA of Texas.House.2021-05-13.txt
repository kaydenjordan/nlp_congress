 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my friend,  Maria Esther Estrada Campos, on receiving an honorary Doctor of Humane  Letters from the University of Houston.   Esther has been a trailblazer in public education and is a public  servant and a champion for civil rights. After Jefferson Davis--now  Northside--High School, she went to the University of Houston. While  raising four children of her own, Esther completed her degree and  became one of the first bilingual instructors hired by the Houston  Independent School District, and later was a counselor and an assistant  principal--something that was almost unheard of back in the fifties.  All of this was nearly unheard of, but she continued on.   She retired early from HISD to win a seat on its board of trustees.  In Houston, if people were organizing for the  [[Page H2300]]  betterment of the Latino community, Esther Campos was there. Esther  continued her own education and began earning a Ph.D., but serious  family challenges made it impossible for her to finish. We hope that an  honorary degree from her alma mater serves as a recognition for all she  has done.   Congratulations to Esther for her great work.   Felicidades. Bien hecho.                            ____________________
