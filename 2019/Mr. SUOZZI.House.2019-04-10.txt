 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 301,  which expresses the importance of our country's alliance with the  Republic of Korea.   A hundred years ago, the Republic of Korea declared itself sovereign,  formed a provisional government, and set the wheels in motion for it to  become the vibrant, prosperous, and free society that it is today.   The United States and South Korea have developed a special bond  formed in shared strategic interests and cemented by a commitment to  democratic values. Our alliance is central to advancing democracy, free  markets, human rights, and the rule of law in the Asia-Pacific region  and throughout the world.   South Korea is now home to around 30,000 American military personnel  who are sworn by our mutual defense treaty to help our ally defend  herself from external aggression. South Korea is also one of our  largest trading partners.   Trade and security are not the only cornerstones of our relationship.  Nearly 2 million Korean Americans live across our country, enriching  all aspects of the fabric of our society.    Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to continue to strengthen the  diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the U.S. and our vital  ally, South Korea.                            ____________________
