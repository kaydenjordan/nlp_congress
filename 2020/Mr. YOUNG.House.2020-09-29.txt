 Madam Speaker, I thank the leader for yielding.     John Shimkus has been my friend. He has done well for this House.   He and I played paddleball together. We never lost. We will be  challenged on that, but that is true.   I have a saying that many people may not recognize. Why do the good  people leave this Congress and the SOBs stay behind? I have been here  48 years, so I have to reconsider that.   But, John, we will miss you. You are a great Congressman; you are a  great ally; you are a great American; and I know you have served your  district very well. God bless you in the future for things you may do.
