 Madam President, I rise in strong support of the  nomination of Mike Pompeo, our current CIA Director, to be the next  Secretary of State. I must say, I watched with interest the proceedings  the day before yesterday in the Foreign Relations Committee. The debate  was interesting on both sides. I appreciate the fact that  accommodations were made so Mike Pompeo's nomination could be presented  to the full Senate with a positive vote.   I am disappointed that so many of my Democratic colleagues have  stated they will oppose this nomination. I heed the admonition of one  of the Members of the Democratic Party at the confirmation vote before  the committee when this Member asked that Senators not question the  motives of anyone who takes a position one way or the other with regard  to the nomination of Mr. Pompeo. I will heed that admonition and not  question the motivation of any Senator who votes either yes or no on  this nomination.   I will simply observe this: Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified  nominee, a distinguished former Member of the House of Representatives.  He served with accomplishment and great dignity and ability as Director  of the CIA. He graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point and went on to graduate with distinction at the  Harvard Law School and served as editor-in-chief of the Harvard Law  Review.   This is a man of great intellect, a man of great ability and great  accomplishment. Without impugning the motives of anyone who would vote  no, I simply observe they will be voting against a highly accomplished  and qualified nominee.   When the shoe was on the other foot during the Obama administration,  I--along with almost a unanimous majority of Members of my caucus-- voted yes, in favor of the confirmation of Hillary Clinton to be  Secretary of State. I voted yes--again, a virtually unanimous vote on  both sides of the aisle--for the nomination of our colleague John Kerry  to be the successor to Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.   I will simply note to my doubting friends, who are standing on their  rights on the other side of the aisle, that the overwhelming weight of  public opinion from the news media has come down on the side of Mr.  Pompeo. The Wall Street Journal headline says we need a Secretary of  State and that Mike Pompeo should be confirmed. The Chicago Tribune, in  an editorial, states why the Senate should confirm Mike Pompeo. The  Washington Post headline on the editorial page proclaims: ``Confirm  Mike Pompeo.'' The New York Daily News says: ``Confirm Mike Pompeo:  President Trump Needs a Secretary of State.''   I will add, this country needs a Secretary of State. The cause of  international diplomacy needs a Secretary of State. The cause of human  rights around the world needs a Secretary of State.   USA Today: ``Confirm Mike Pompeo to Fill the Void at State.''   I will not question the motives of any of my colleagues, my friends  whom I respect. I will only say, things are surely different around the  U.S. Senate nowadays than they were previously, when we rose up almost  unanimously and confirmed John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and stood for  the proposition that a President of the United States is entitled to  his or her team and that person needed strong support.   I only say that at a moment when our country needs to send a strong  message of resolve to our allies and to the entire international  community, we need to send a strong signal of unity; that the vote we  may take later this week in confirming Mike Pompeo might send a signal  of excessive partisanship and division, I regret that.   We are going to have a great Secretary of State at the end of this  process. I think this, unfortunately, narrow vote will come and go and  perhaps not be the standard we operate under in future times. I will  only say that for those colleagues who are still looking  [[Page S2400]]  for an answer and still wrestling with how they should vote, I commend  to them the example of previous days and the example of sending a  strong signal around the globe that this President is supported in his  efforts in international diplomacy and that he is entitled to the team  he has chosen.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes. I appreciate the distinguished  minority leader for indulging me and allowing me to go forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
