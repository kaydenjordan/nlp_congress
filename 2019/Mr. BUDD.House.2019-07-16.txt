 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two exceptional  students from Rowan County, North Carolina.   Recently, Grant Helms, a rising senior at West Rowan High School, and  Rowan-Cabarrus Community College student Ashton White competed in the  SkillsUSA Championships, a national competition for career and  technical education students.   Grant and Ashton each won first place in secondary and postsecondary  masonry, respectively, and we couldn't be more proud of them.   None of this would have been possible without Rodney Harrington, the  masonry teacher at West Rowan High School and mentor to these students.   Mr. Speaker, these skills are imperative in helping build and grow  our economy, so I think it is worth mentioning H.R. 2353, the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act.   This monumental bill, which became law last year, has given States  like mine more flexibility to meet the unique needs of their students,  educators, and employers.                            ____________________
