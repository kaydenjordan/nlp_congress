 Mr. Speaker, this is National Apprenticeship Week and a  good time to celebrate the renewed attention that apprenticeships have  received from the Committee on Education and the Workforce and this  administration.   Apprenticeships are a centuries-old workforce development tool  referenced as far back as the Bible. Nothing can prepare a student  quite like the on-the-job experience, and apprenticeships are a tried  and true method of preparing students to enter the workforce with the  skills they need to succeed.   We have a national skills gap with more than 7 million unfilled jobs  in the country, and, for the seventh month running, the number of job  openings has exceeded job seekers nationwide.   A recent survey of U.S. employers showed that nearly half of all job  creators struggle to hire employees with the right skills for the job,  and, for the sixth year running, skilled trade jobs continue to be the  hardest positions to fill all over the world.   Apprenticeships are a wonderful solution to closing the skills gap  and strengthening the workforce. We at the Committee on Education and  the Workforce recognize this, and we have worked hard this Congress to  make skills-based education a viable and valuable path for American  workers.    Over the course of the 115th Congress, we have made historic progress  strengthening our workforce development efforts. For the first time,  the committee reported postsecondary reform legislation that promotes  apprenticeships as key postsecondary education opportunities.  [[Page H9528]]    The PROSPER Act would improve student access to and participation in  industry-led earn-and-learn programs and apprenticeships to allow  students to hone their skills in a hands-on environment.   This summer, we sent major, bipartisan CTE legislation to the  President's desk. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for  the 21st Century Act was the first legislation in more than a decade to  modernize our Nation's CTE programs. The law will create innovative  community partnerships while connecting Americans with programs to grow  their skills and land in-demand industry jobs.   We have also continued to see the ongoing implementation of the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA. WIOA gives employers a  seat at the table and encourages collaboration between local leaders as  they work to create on-the-job learning opportunities.   In September, the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce  Development heard from witnesses about how the law supports the  development of locally based apprenticeship programs.   The President has bolstered our efforts by listening to the needs of  American workers. Since President Trump's first month in office,  American employers have hired over 400,000 apprentices. In June of last  year, the President issued an executive order creating a Task Force on  Apprenticeship Expansion, and, earlier this year, the White House  developed the Pledge to America's Workers. This groundbreaking  initiative has resulted in over 160 companies and associations pledging  jobs, education, and workforce development opportunities for more than  6 million American workers.   We made monumental strides over the course of the last 2 years, and  we are continuing to look for innovative ways to connect effective  education with in-demand jobs. Each of us knows a person with  considerable gifts and talents who may not be suited for long-term  postsecondary education. A baccalaureate degree is not the only pathway  to a good-paying job. Apprenticeships are life changing and can provide  countless Americans with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve  lifelong success.   Thanks to the leadership of this body and the administration,  Americans have greater access than ever before to the opportunities  they need to excel in the millions of good-paying, in-demand jobs  available nationwide.                            ____________________
