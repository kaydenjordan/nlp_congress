 Mr. Speaker, over the past 100 years, the life expectancy  of men has declined in comparison with that of women. Women now live,  on average, 5 years longer than men.   There is a silent crisis of men's health in America. To reverse the  decline, we must be silent no more. Too often, men are foregoing  routine health screenings, and they are dying because of it.   Colon cancer, heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, all of these  are treatable or even preventable, if you get screened. Screenings  aren't scary. They don't hurt.   This morning, my staff and I were screened by healthcare  professionals on Capitol Hill with the Men's Health Network. Knowledge  is power, ladies and gentlemen, for my staff, for myself, and for our  families.   Just a few minutes ago, my fellow chairman of the Men's Health  Caucus, Congressman Mullin of Oklahoma, joined me to introduce a  resolution recognizing June 11 to 17 as National Men's Health Week. I  encourage each of you to join us on this resolution and help end the  silent crisis of men's health in America.                            ____________________
