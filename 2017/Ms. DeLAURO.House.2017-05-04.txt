 Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare bill is reckless  and heartless:   It increases the cost of premiums and deductibles;   It imposes an age tax on older Americans;   It unravels protections for patients with preexisting conditions;  [[Page H4135]]    It eliminates maternity care, substance abuse treatment, and  prescription drug coverage;   It does away with lifetime limits and annual caps.   President Trump's claim that people with preexisting conditions will  be covered is false, and it is a betrayal. It will have threatening  consequences for millions of Americans. It will cost lives.   If this passes today, the American people should be in the street to  call out the immorality of this legislation. They should decry this  offense against humanity and this offense against the American people.  I call on the American people: Do not let them get away with it.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 254.                            ____________________
