 Madam President. I come to the floor today to comment  on statements made by the majority leader earlier today on this Senate  floor, and he made those after President Biden, this morning, signed  another expensive Executive order relating to climate change.   The President at the time said it was his goal of making half of all  new cars emission-free in less than a decade. In practice, that means  making half of all new cars electric.   Well, after the President signed his Executive order, the majority  leader came to the floor, and he talked about his own plans to give  more of American taxpayer dollars to the manufacturers and purchasers  of electric vehicles.   He said:         [W]e hope to add large parts of the plan.    Well, where does he want to add it? Well, he wants to add it to the  reckless Democrat tax-and-spending plan.   The American taxpayers are already giving billions and billions of  taxpayer dollars to electric vehicle manufacturers and owners. Electric  vehicle makers have been given free tax dollars for 30 years. The truth  is, electric car buyers don't need more taxpayer money. They have  plenty of their own.   Today, the market for electric vehicles is very well established.  There are more than a million electric vehicles on the road today. They  are being made by everyone: General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, U.S.  manufacturers, foreign manufacturers. They are being made all around  the world.   In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that  sales of light-duty electric vehicles is going to reach 4 million by  the year 2025. Electric vehicle makers are doing just fine.   They are also receiving free money from just about every State. So  who benefits from these taxpayer handouts to electric vehicle makers  and users?   Well, customers are usually wealthy. They don't need more money.   Now, seniors on fixed incomes, certainly in Wyoming, are not trading  in their cars for expensive electric vehicles. Middle-class families  who are trying to make ends meet are dealing with inflation that is  hitting them every day under the Biden economy. They are not going out  to buy expensive new electric vehicles. Seniors and middle-class  families are hurting right now because of inflation hitting them when  they buy gas, when they buy groceries, when they buy other goods. And  this is, of course, triggered by massive Democrat spending, including  the borrowing and spending that has occurred under the last  coronavirus--the so-called coronavirus relief bill.   So Democrats aren't looking out for them under the proposal. Oh, no.   Nearly 80 percent of tax credits for electric vehicles go to  households that earned at least $100,000 a year. Let me repeat that.  Nearly 80 percent of the tax credits for electric vehicles go to  households that have earned over $100,000 a year, not to mention the  fact that these drivers don't pay for the use and the abuse that occurs  to the roads from them driving on the roads. The rest of us do. Anybody  who puts gasoline in their car pays the gas tax. It goes to the highway  trust fund. It goes to repair damage done to the roads.   We are in a debate over infrastructure. Electric vehicles, no gas  tax--that is the ordinary source of funding to do repair of our roads  and our highways.   Now, even though a Tesla puts as much wear and tear on the road as a  Ford Focus, the Tesla driver pays next to nothing to fix the roads.  They contribute nothing to the highway trust fund--one more Democrat  giveaway to the rich.   Electric vehicle owners don't need our tax dollars. They have enough.  They should pay fair share for the use and abuse that they do to the  roads on which they drive.   That is why I have introduced legislation called the ELITE Act. It  stands for End Lavish Incentives to Electric Vehicles. We need to make  sure to end these incentives to electric vehicles. The bill would end  the billion-dollar giveaways to electric vehicle makers.   According to the Manhattan Institute, my bill would actually save  taxpayers $20 billion. At a time when middle-class families are hurting  from inflation caused by Democrat spending, it is unconscionable that  Democrats want to raise taxes to give more handouts to the rich. It is  certainly bad economics, and it is bad news for hard-working American  taxpayers.   Rather than increasing the giveaways, we should be bringing them to  an end. We should stop this wasteful waste of taxpayer dollars. Any  waste of taxpayer dollars is wrong, and this is certainly a case where  taxpayer dollars are not necessary to be spent.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
