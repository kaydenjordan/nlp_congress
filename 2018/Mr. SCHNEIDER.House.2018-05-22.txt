 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, joining the families and  friends in Santa Fe, Texas, grieving for another 10 lives tragically  cut short by senseless gun violence.   Yesterday, this body held the now routine moment of silence in  respect for the victims, just as we did after the Waffle House shooting  in Nashville; Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, First  Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Route 91 Harvest music festival  in Las Vegas; and the list goes on and on and on.   Forty-six times this Chamber has stood to remember the victims, and  every single time congressional obstructionists stood in the way of  doing anything concrete to change this deadly pattern. We haven't  considered background checks or bans on the sale of assault weapons or  gun violence restraining orders to keep firearms out of the hands of  the mentally ill or even, for goodness' sake, bump stocks.   I sit on the Judiciary Committee. We haven't held a single hearing  about reducing gun violence or working to keep  [[Page H4292]]  our children safe. We can't prevent every tragedy, but there are  actions we can take right now, today, to save lives. We have the power.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to find the courage to act. Our  kids are counting on us.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, Iran's destabilizing activities in the  Middle East are not a new phenomenon. However, of late, their malign  influence has dramatically expanded and intensified in Yemen, in Iraq,  in Lebanon, and, perhaps of greatest immediate concern, the  establishment of a potentially permanent foothold in Syria.   Such a presence enables Iran's increasing support for Hezbollah,  including not only weapons transfers, but also assistance in building  an indigenous rocket-producing capacity. I therefore appreciate the  work of the House Armed Services Committee in including a provision  authorizing the Secretaries of Defense and State to develop and  implement a strategy with foreign partners to counter Iran's  destabilizing activities.   My first amendment would ensure the strategy includes specific  countries in which Iran is operating, an assessment of their  destabilizing activities, and the implications thereof.   My second amendment would require a report on Iran's support for  proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon and an assessment of the threat posed  to Israel, other regional allies, and U.S. interests. It is important  to know where Iran is operating, what exactly they are doing, who they  are backing, and how this impacts the United States and our allies.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their support  for my bipartisan amendments.    Mr. Chair, we are still uncovering more troubling  evidence of the breadth, depth, and reach of Russia's interference in  our most recent election, so I am pleased that the NDAA includes a  provision requiring a National Intelligence Estimate of interference by  Russia and China in democracies around the world, including our own.   While understanding this threat is an important first step, we also  need to take action to ensure we are doing everything possible to  secure our own elections and defend the integrity of our democracy.   My amendment would add a requirement that, following the submission  of the NIE, the Secretary of Defense shall report to Congress on the  specific efforts by the Department of Defense to deter such  interference both at home and abroad.   Protecting our elections, the foundation of our democracy, and those  of our allies from outside influence by malign foreign actors is of  paramount importance.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including  my amendment in this en bloc passage.
