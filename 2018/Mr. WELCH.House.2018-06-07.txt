 Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration has enacted a policy  of stunning cruelty: cruel in its impact on innocent young children,  cruel in its impact on terrified mothers seeking safety from violence  and rape.   The cruel policy: the aggressive and forceful practice of separating  a child from her mother when that mother presents herself at our  southern border for the sole purpose of seeking safety.   The cruel policy, Mr. Speaker, is the Trump administration's  decision--willful, voluntary, calculated decision--to make it a crime  for a mother to do what mothers do everywhere and always: protect their  children.   Whatever challenges we face at the southern border, none will be  solved by ripping families apart, sending a child to one place-- strange, unknown, unfamiliar--and the parents to another, neither  knowing when, if ever, they will be reunited.   This policy is not only cruel, it is unnecessary and ineffective. Mr.  Speaker, the President must end this un-American cruelty now and  forever.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase the VA medical  services account by $5 million for the purpose of strengthening the  Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry.   Burn pits, as you know, Mr. Chairman, were commonly used on U.S.  military sites during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to burn all types  of waste--from chemicals, paint, medical waste, and human waste to  munitions, petroleum, plastics, and rubber. But, as you know, many  members of the military who were exposed to burn pits are beginning to  experience negative health effects from the toxic smoke that they  inhaled. And that is why I  [[Page H4977]]  am offering this amendment, to increase funding to address and assist  those suffering more aggressively and quickly.   On May 7, Mr. Chairman, I met with a group of Vermont National Guard  members led by Pat Cram, who have been impacted by burn pit exposure.  Pat is the wife of Sergeant Major Mike Cram of the Vermont National  Guard who died this past December from prostate cancer that is believed  to be a direct result of his exposure to burn pits in Iraq and  Afghanistan.   Sergeant Major Cram first deployed to Iraq in 2004 with a group of  MPs from the 42nd Infantry Division of the Vermont National Guard. They  joined up with the 278th Tennessee National Guard Calvary in Iraq. All  21 soldiers from this group that deployed together for 18 months  returned home to their families safely.   But since their safe return, this same group has lost two members  from prostate cancer and another has been treated for it, and they  believe their exposure to burn pit toxins is the reason.   This group is still close, they stay in touch, their families support  each other. I was so inspired to hear about how they have stuck  together throughout the years. But those members that have not had the  direct health issues that some of their comrades have are now wondering  whether they, too, will get sick.   This funding would provide resources to the VA to make necessary  improvements to the registry and prepare for the long-term care for  those affected veterans. It would also allow, Mr. Chairman, the VA to  hire analysts and epidemiologists who can connect the registry entries  to health outcomes, make necessary technological updates to the  registry, and increase the funding for essential clinical research.   The cost of a war must always include the cost of caring for the  warrior, and this critical funding helps to do just that.   I want to thank Chairman Carter and Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz  for their attention to this issue and willingness to help. I urge  support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
