 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1373.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I want to start today with a story.   Near the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits Canyon Mine, a breccia  pipe uranium mine in the middle of the Kaibab National Forest, only a  few miles from the boundary of the Grand Canyon National Park.   This mine opened in 1986 after assurances that its operations would  have minimal impact and that they wouldn't impact groundwater.   Mind you, since it opened three decades ago, uranium production has  never occurred at the site. Uranium ore has never come out of the mine.   What has come out of the mine is over 20 million gallons of  groundwater, polluted with uranium and arsenic from the ore body. The  water has flowed into the mine ever since the mine operator pierced a  groundwater aquifer in 2016.   Again, the mine operator had assured regulators its mine shaft would  be dry.   The situation is so dire that the mine operator regularly resorts to  spraying this uranium-contaminated water into the air to speed  evaporation. On windy days, this spray has been known to travel off the  site and into the surrounding areas and environment.   Meanwhile, the mine shaft continues to fill with contaminated water.   There are really only a few places that water might go if it escapes  the mine shaft: down toward other aquifers, including those that feed  the water to the Supai Village and Havasu Falls, or to the seeps and  springs that flow into the Grand Canyon and, eventually, to the  Colorado River itself.                                time  1230    Supai village has been the home of the Havasupai people for more than  1,000 years. They have made this canyon their home. Their history is  there. Their homes are there. Their lives are there. Yet this mine puts  all that at risk.   Again, no ore production has occurred at this site, but it has  already degraded millions of gallons of clean water and put lives and  culture at risk. And that contamination risk will only get worse once  mining commences and the water is exposed to more and more uranium ore.   This isn't a unique example. The Pine Nut mine on the North Rim of  the Grand Canyon was thought closed and capped for two decades, but in  2009 the mine was discovered to have unexpectedly filled with over two  million gallons of radioactively contaminated water.   Uranium mines across the southwest pollute our water, endanger our  communities and our health, and despite assurances, hundreds of these  sites are still waiting to be cleaned up, particularly those mines that  impact Tribal communities.   Madam Chair, for Arizonans, for the Havasupai, and for countless  others across the southwest, the mineral withdrawal made permanent by  H.R. 1373 is not theoretical and it is not trivial. I rise today to ask  for this House's support for protecting clean water, protecting the  health of our communities, and protecting the public lands and  environment on which we all rely.   The bill before us today permanently extends an existing temporary  moratorium on new mining claims on public lands surrounding the Grand  Canyon National Park, to prevent another canyon or Pine Nut mine from  threatening our communities and our livelihoods.   This House needs to act on this proposal because these critical  protections are under threat from the Trump administration.   Under the guise of energy dominance and fabricated arguments about  national security, they have continually pushed for these lands to be  open to exploitation on behalf of a few wealthy mining interests. The  idea that we need to mine around the Grand Canyon--mind you, the Grand  Canyon--to meet our energy needs is patently false. There is ample data  to show it, and national security and nuclear nonproliferation experts  have routinely raised the alarm that this fear-mongering about supplies  is based on fantasy. It is time to stop rehashing the same worn out  arguments. We shouldn't be mining for uranium around the Grand Canyon,  period.   This is an effort I have been involved in for over a decade, and I  hope we can move forward today. I urge my colleagues to help me protect  access to clean water and a healthy environment for the people of  Arizona by supporting H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection  Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I recognize my colleague from Arizona-- that was accurately stated, that he represents 70 percent of the  designated area in this legislation.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Kirkpatrick), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Since we are engaging in a little bit of a geology course, I would  like to point out, at the Kanab North Uranium Mine that has already  been closed, within 400 feet of the mine site where the fence is, after  20 years, levels are as high as 10 times above the naturally occurring  level for uranium concentration. This has been open and exposed for 20  years. The mine ceased operations in the 1990s.  [[Page H8616]]    I use that to say that, as far as I understand, the House of  Representatives is a national legislature, and as a national  legislature, we have responsibilities to deal with issues, regardless  of whether it is in my particular district or in my colleague, Mr.  Gosar's particular district.   Over the course of the last couple of days, we have heard our  Republican colleagues call this bill a number of things: a tired, old  retread; a national security threat; a Federal land grab; an attack on  science; and even an idle waste of time. I want to assure this Chamber  and the American people that protecting the Grand Canyon is none of  these characterizations.   The truth is, this bill is a critical safeguard for the Grand Canyon,  one of the most iconic landscapes in the world, and the vital Colorado  River watershed that supplies drinking water for communities throughout  the Southwest.   Forty million people depend on that source. We just passed,  overwhelmingly, the drought contingency plan for five States, including  Arizona, because of the imminent threat of drought and the need to  protect that river and that water source.   Most importantly, this bill is in response to Tribal communities that  have experienced firsthand the toxic legacy of uranium mining. When I  first got involved in this effort over a decade ago, it was not because  of narrow special interests. It was because the Navajo Nation, the  Havasupai Tribe, the Hualapai Tribe, the Hopi Tribe, and other impacted  communities were calling for an end to the contamination associated  with uranium mining.    These communities have lived on the land since time immemorial. Their  interests go beyond the handful of jobs associated with the boom and  bust cycle of the mining industry.   Historically, Tribal communities in the Southwest have borne the  brunt of uranium mining's impact, with some estimates placing over  1,000 abandoned uranium mines and four mills on the Navajo Nation  alone.   In 2008, health officials discovered that nearly 30 water sources in  the Navajo Nation contained unsafe levels of uranium, and 27 percent of  the residents tested positive for high levels of uranium.   The Navajos are not alone. In fact, the Havasupai, who live in the  Grand Canyon and depend on the aquifer beneath the Colorado Plateau,  are dealing with contaminated groundwater associated with the active  discharge by the Canyon Mine. This is why several Havasupai Tribal  leaders and members traveled to Washington, D.C., to be present for  this vote.   This bill is about protecting these communities. It is about  providing lasting protection for a sacred landscape.   The consequences of uranium mining are not some imagined or unproven  threat. We are forcing communities to contemplate the viability of  their ancestral homes.   The United States has an obligation to protect Tribal communities and  ensure that they prosper. We have a moral obligation to protect our  most sacred and treasured public lands. We shouldn't need a treaty to  remind us to do the right thing.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand with the Havasupai and  other affiliated Tribes to protect the Grand Canyon for future  generations.   A ``yes'' vote today on the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act  is, overall, a declaration that there are places and communities in  which extraction and destruction of a landscape, and jeopardizing  people's health and their welfare and generational advancement, that  those places should be left alone.   The Grand Canyon should be left alone. It is, after all, the Grand  Canyon. I urge swift adoption of H.R. 1373, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  McCollum) having assumed the chair, Ms. Sanchez, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1373) to  protect, for current and future generations, the watershed, ecosystem,  and cultural heritage of the Grand Canyon region in the State of  Arizona, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not a good faith effort  to protect Native communities, minorities, or women. It is simply a  ``gotcha'' amendment intended to kill the bill.   It is truly insulting that our colleagues across the aisle would try  and use Native communities as pawns to kill this proposal, knowing full  well that Native people have too often had to bear the brunt of  uranium's toxic impacts.   On the Navajo Nation, there are hundreds of abandoned uranium mines  waiting to be cleaned up. These toxic sites pollute water and damage  public health. A recent study found dozens of contaminated water  sources on the Navajo Nation, and nearly one-quarter of the residents  had elevated uranium levels in their health screenings.   The Havasupai fear this same danger for their community. They live  downstream of the Canyon Mine and of other proposed mines, and they  worry that they, too, will be forced to bear that toxic burden.   That is why the Havasupai, the Navajo Nation, the National Congress  of American Indians, and the Inter Tribal Association of Arizona, along  with other regional Tribes, all support a permanent withdrawal.   These indigenous voices are not props at a press conference. They are  not quaint or docile. They are smart and passionate advocates for their  people, for the situation now, and, more importantly, for future  generations to come. They deserve our respect. Anything less, I think,  crosses a line.   Republicans aren't lifting these Native voices. They are ignoring  Native voices and threatening the continued health of Native  communities to score some cheap political points.   This amendment won't help Native communities. It will kill the very  protections they are asking this Congress to enact.   Mining is not, and will never again be, the future of job creation in  that part of Arizona, and that is especially true for women and  minority communities.   During the extensive, multiyear analysis and public comment process  that went into the original withdrawal, the previous administration  reviewed job opportunities in the region. They found that mining could  likely support 295 direct jobs--295 jobs. This is in contrast to nearly  12,000 jobs directly supported by Grand Canyon National Park, all of  which rely on a healthy, uranium-free Grand Canyon.   If we are serious about job growth in this part of Arizona, we need  to be talking about how we can better support our outdoor recreation  and tourism economies. That would help all the communities in the area.   Mining, in particular, is not a field known for its diversity. In  2018, less than 14 percent of all workers in mining, quarrying, and  extraction were women, and less than 13 percent were minorities.   Meanwhile, the outdoor rec industry is making a major push to  diversify, developing outreach programs and pipelines to bring people  of color and women into that space.   There really isn't much of a comparison here.   Mr. Chairman, if you still aren't sure if this amendment was made in  good faith, I would point out the original sponsor's voting record.   The original sponsor voted against the Violence Against Women Act, in  which an amendment therein contained a particular focus on missing and  murdered indigenous women throughout this country.   She voted against the Equality Act. She voted against the Carcieri  fix, one of the most important votes in this Chamber to protect Tribal  sovereignty.   The Democratic Caucus has offered numerous opportunities to champion  the causes of Native Americans, women, and people of color. The  original sponsor and many of her colleagues have declined those  opportunities.   I am more than happy to work with any of my colleagues to uplift  traditionally underrepresented voices, but this amendment is not a  legitimate attempt to do so. It is simply an attempt to weaponize the  communities that our party has worked so hard to protect.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a ``gotcha'' amendment.  The substance of the amendment is misdirected, to say the least, and it  ignores history and ignores the reality that we are in right now.   That reality is that, when I began to get involved in this issue more  than a decade ago, it was in response to discussions that I had with  the Havasupai Tribe, with the Navajo Tribe, with the Hopi Tribe, and  with other indigenous nations in and around the Grand Canyon. The  consensus and the unity around the issue that we have to protect the  Grand Canyon was important, not only for religious, cultural, and  sacred reasons, but also for the fact that that is their home.   At the end of the day, the vote today is a response to that work, to  their advocacy, to their support, and to the input that they had on the  legislation. It is a vote to affirm by this Congress that, indeed, the  concerns that they raised are real and important.   Mr. Chair, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I recognize there is some sensitivity, or even a misunderstanding in  this Chamber to legislating in other Members' districts, but I would  point out that it is something we do almost every day that we are here.  We vote on policies that impact the Nation, which is why we are a  national legislature.   I would also point out that the gentleman from Arizona offered  numerous amendments to a bill in New Mexico, the Chaco Canyon  legislation, that will be considered later today, and those lands are  certainly not in his district.   If each of us only ever legislated in our own district, we would be  doing a disservice to the American people, but we would never get  anything done, as well. Furthermore, every Member of the Chamber has a  responsibility to support sovereign Tribal Nations who have asked this  body to protect the Grand Canyon.   Serving the American people requires that we take a national view  into account. The lands protected in H.R. 1373 are public lands  belonging to every American. They protect an iconic American landscape,  the Grand Canyon, important to people across this country. I can also  easily think of 30 million Americans, most of whom are outside the  gentleman's district, who want to see the clean waters of the Colorado  River protected.   The Colorado River provides drinking water to Phoenix, Tucson, Las  Vegas, Los Angeles, and to countless cities and towns across the west.  It needs to be protected from uranium mining. The lands in the  gentleman's district were not included in this bill arbitrarily. They  were added after an extensive multiyear study and public process that  accounted for a long list of regional factors before recommending  withdrawal.   The land in the gentleman's district is essential to protecting the  Grand Canyon and the Colorado River watershed from uranium's toxic  impacts.   We also need to consider the support for this proposal on the ground.  In a bipartisan poll, almost two-thirds of Arizonans supported  permanent protections for the lands around the Grand Canyon, including  those in the gentleman's district.   Representative O'Halleran, who represents the vast majority of the  lands in this bill, is an original cosponsor and a vocal supporter,  because he knows that this bill is important to all his constituents.  H.R. 1373 receives vocal support from Tribal communities, including  Havasupai, Navajo Nation, Hopi Nation, the Hualapai, the Inter Tribal  Association of Arizona, and the National Congress of American Indians.   The bill receives support from Coconino County and the city of  Flagstaff, who have a major stake in protecting the clean waters of the  Grand Canyon. H.R. 1373 is supported by recreationalists, sportsmen,  conservationists, and hundreds of local organizations and individuals  from Arizona and across this Nation.   This bill is a broadly supported effort to protect public lands that  belong to all Americans. The bill is an effort to protect the Grand  Canyon. A vocal minority of opponents who will never be swayed should  not stop the overwhelming voice of the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time in  opposition to the amendment.   As I said earlier, I think we keep forgetting the essence of what we  are talking about here today. And the essence is the Grand Canyon,  something that is recognized nationally, not only as an environmental  icon, but the dependency that 40 million people have on the water of  the Grand Canyon. And while we want to minimize this, the reality is  that the history tells us and current health studies tell us of the  impact that Native communities have suffered because of uranium  contamination in their water, in their air, and in their land. Those  are reasons enough to put aside a very special place and permanently  ban uranium mining.   This amendment cuts an exception based on territorial imperative or  some provincial thought that we are not all part of one great Nation.  This is a national issue and should be treated that way.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would allow Secretary  Bernhardt to kill this proposal in pursuit of information we already  have.   My colleagues across the aisle continually allude to the lack of  information we have about this region, the lack of study, and the lack  of science. They seem to ignore the extensive, multiyear study that  preceded the current withdrawal.   That study looked at local economies. It reviewed the best available  science. It took into account public comments. It considered how  uranium mining might impact the Grand Canyon region.   In the end, the review produced a 1,500-page environmental impact  report outlining, in detail, the rationales for different actions.  Within the report, there was a detailed analysis considering other  mineral resources in the region, the very study the gentleman is now  trying to predicate the withdrawal on.   The study did, indeed, find there were a handful of other mineral  resources in the region, but the study also made clear that these  elements were secondary to uranium and that they occurred in quantities  insufficient to drive mine development. This is why, when you look at  mineral claims in the withdrawal area, they are almost all for uranium.   We know uranium is the primary resource here, and we know the major  threat that uranium poses to clean water, to public health, and to the  Grand Canyon itself.   Uranium mines have polluted ground water and destroyed many  communities across the Southwest. The landscape is littered with  abandoned mine sites.   We only need to consider Kanab Creek Uranium Mine. It sits on the  edge of the Grand Canyon and has been offline for years, yet virtually  no remediation has been done. You can see the site is still covered in  waste rock, uranium ore tailings, and pond sludge. This toxic waste is  exposed to the environment, escaping beyond the mine, infiltrating the  soil, and elevating local uranium levels.   This mine is only one of hundreds of closed mines awaiting  remediation. Industry likes to pretend like practices have changed, but  they provide no assurances that they will do anything but despoil the  land and leave taxpayers with the bill.   Despite protests from the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), we know  what the resources are, and we know what the threats are to this  region.   We don't need to duplicate a study to tell us that we shouldn't be  mining in the Grand Canyon, and we certainly should not let misinformed  talking points kill this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, and in opposition to the  amendment, in July, the President formed a nuclear working group, the  Nuclear Fuel Working Group, essentially to deal with the questions  coming from the uranium mining industry, in particular, Energy Fuels  and Ur-Energy.   The issue there was an attempt to try to defend the indefensible in  trying to open up the Grand Canyon once more, looking at lifting the  moratorium. So the urgency for the legislation before us is based on  acts that the administration has taken at this point.   One should note that Secretary Bernhardt represented Ur-Energy USA  from 2009 to 2012.   My point is that enough advocates exist for the mining industry as we  stand.   What we are asking, in defeat of this amendment, is that the public  interest has some advocates, and that Members of this body can take  care of that public interest and not the profit interests that seem to  be driving any decisions around mining and particularly uranium mining.   The public interest is the public health, the Grand Canyon, the water  supply for 40 million people, and the Tribes and indigenous people and  communities that exist there that have been for decade upon decade  coming to this Congress, coming to their leadership, asking for support  and relief. This bill begins to provide both.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Tonko) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1373) to  protect, for current and future generations, the watershed, ecosystem,  and cultural heritage of the Grand Canyon region in the State of  Arizona, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to have my voice heard in support  of H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act.   This proposal that is sponsored by my friend, Mr. Lujan, with the  support of the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on National Parks,  Forests, and Public Lands, Representative Haaland, also from New  Mexico, is another important step towards recognizing and elevating the  voices and the presence of Native communities in this Chamber.   As the chairwoman mentioned in her opening statement, our committee  has heard from Puebloan and Tribal leaders throughout this Congress  about how important it is to protect Chaco. These communities want to  see Chaco, their ancestral homeland, protected from oil and gas  drilling.   This is an important piece of legislation. It is an agreed-upon  proposal that balances regional development with the needs to ensure  that special places and, indeed, sacred places are off limits. It fits  well into the work this Chamber is doing today and has been doing all  Congress. We are listening to diverse voices, protecting the rights of  Native communities, and conserving our public lands for the benefit of  current and future generations.   Mr. Chair, I hope our colleagues will join us in this important work  by voting today to protect irreplaceable sites that are important to  Native communities and supported by folks on the ground and that are  critical to the story of this Nation of ours.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.    Mr. Speaker, I understand the gentleman's concerns, I  really do. Hostile nations like Russia have shown their true face by  interfering in our elections and continuing to attempt to influence the  results of an American election.   Although it is hard to take my colleague seriously on this concern  when members of his own party and the President refuse to acknowledge  what the intelligence community and millions upon millions of Americans  already know, Russia interfered in the 2016 election.   But let's be clear about the true intent of this motion. What the  gentleman has put forward will kill this bill, opening a pathway for  uranium mining in the Grand Canyon. Instead, they seem to think that  the real threat to our national security is that Democrats aren't  willing to mine uranium in the Grand Canyon. And make no mistake, this  is what they are supporting when they vote against this bill or this  procedural motion. This is not theoretical.   The Grand Canyon, and I will say it again, the Grand Canyon is under  threat from uranium mining, and my colleagues across the aisle are  perfectly willing to let it happen. We don't need to open up the Grand  Canyon to uranium mining to meet our national security or energy needs.  The region that is being designated for permanent withdrawal holds less  than 1 percent of known U.S. reserves of uranium.   Meanwhile, we get the majority of our uranium from domestic mining or  from our closest allies, Australia and Canada. The Department of  Defense has testified that we have enough uranium stockpiled to meet  national security needs for decades to come. And we stockpile enough  uranium to run reactors for years without importing a single pound.   I could rattle off the facts all day about how nonsensical this  motion is and how ridiculous an argument our colleagues are making. I  can share letters from national security experts breaking down their  concerns about the need to protect the Grand Canyon from further  uranium mining. I could even show you data from the Heritage  Foundation, a known friend of our colleagues, showing the Republican  arguments about uranium security are, here in Heritage's words, ``a  hollow Russian doll.''   But at the end of the day, we can't lose sight of what this is really  about. Our colleagues want to see the Grand Canyon, one of the most  American of American landscapes open to uranium mining. They want to  block this bill. They want to stop this place from being permanently  protected, so that a very few wealthy companies can open up mine shafts  and pull uranium out of the Grand Canyon and leave the mess to the  taxpayers to clean up.   We don't need this uranium in the designated area. It is expensive to  extract. It risks our clean water and threatens our Tribal communities.   On that point, the threat to Tribal communities is based in a legacy  of antihistory, a legacy of illness, a legacy of high levels of  contamination among Navajo people in the area in the Navajo Nation. It  is based on lost land and soil-contaminated land, and it is based upon  contaminated water. That is the legacy around the Grand Canyon to the  people and the environment around there. It is a legacy that has united  Indian Country in support of permanent protection for the Grand Canyon,  and we should respect that voice. It is a voice that has been clear  about the importance, not only of the Grand Canyon as a cultural  resource, but the Grand Canyon as a resource of water for 40 million  people in this country.   We don't need this uranium. As I said, it is, frankly, hard for me to  imagine a more cynical move than to continue to mine in the Grand  Canyon. They are willing to use misinformation to ignore the people of  Arizona and the United States and to threaten one of the most iconic  landmarks just to open up a few acres for extraction.  [[Page H8644]]    So I ask my colleagues here today, if the Grand Canyon isn't worth  protecting, what is? What are we doing here if we are willing to let  public lands owned and cherished by all Americans get sold to the  highest bidder? This really shouldn't be up for debate. After all, my  friends and colleagues, it is the Grand Canyon. We owe it to ourselves,  we owe it to generations to come to do our part to permanently protect  the Grand Canyon, and in protecting the Grand Canyon respect Native  communities that came to us and said we need this, we need it for our  lives, and we need it for the generations to come.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
