 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of David ``Wally'' Waller, a Polk County, Florida, native who  passed away last month at the age of 67 following a courageous battle  with cancer.   Wally was a hero to our community in more ways than one, beginning  with his 25-year career in law enforcement. After retiring, he became a  hero to countless children while serving as program coordinator for the  U.S. Marine Corps Reserve's Toys for Tots program.   Under Wally's leadership, Polk County's Toys for Tots was named the  top program in the United States last year with more than 57,000 toys  collected for over 14,000 children. Those who volunteered with him said  he was the heart and soul of Toys for Tots, a title he richly deserved.   On behalf of our community, thank you, Wally and ``Well done, thy  good and faithful servant.''                            ____________________
