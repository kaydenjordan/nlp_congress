 Mr. President, in the wake of Senator John McCain's  passing, I was particularly moved by the announcement that, in  accordance with his wishes, he will be buried in the cemetery at the  U.S. Naval Academy. It is a fitting resting place for someone  [[Page S5974]]  who belonged, in a special way, to the U.S. Navy, and it is  characteristic of him that in death he wished to rest with his comrades  in arms.   It was during his service in the Navy that LCDR John McCain's plane  was shot down over North Vietnam. He ejected, breaking several bones in  the process, and was taken into captivity.   During World War II, ADM Chester W. Nimitz, describing the actions of  the Marines in the battle of Iwo Jima, noted that ``uncommon valor was  a common virtue.'' The same thing can be said about the American  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in the prison camps of North  Vietnam. John McCain joined their number in October of 1967.   During the years of his confinement, he was regularly beaten and  tortured. He survived thanks, in part, to the friendship of his fellow  prisoners of war. In 1968, his captors offered the malnourished and ill  McCain the chance to be returned home early, ahead of prisoners who  were next in line. John McCain said no. He spent another almost 5 years  in captivity before being released on March 14, 1973. It scarcely needs  to be said that he remained a thorn in his captors' side the entire  time.   Living in perhaps the most privileged country in the world, it is  hard for most of us to imagine going without the internet for a few  months, let alone something more fundamental like electricity or indoor  plumbing. The courage and character and sheer determination required to  undergo regular torture, malnourishment, and deplorable living  conditions is almost impossible to fathom. Yet hundreds of U.S.  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines--John McCain among them--endured  these torments and persevered.   Amazingly, it was in the prison camps of North Vietnam that John  McCain discovered the fierce love of country that would animate the  rest of his life. Years later, he noted:         I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in       someone else's. I loved it for its decency, for its faith in       the wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people. I loved it       because it was not just a place but an idea, a cause worth       fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn't my own man       anymore; I was my country's.    John McCain was his country's man. Throughout a congressional career  that spanned 35 years, he served her faithfully. He inspired those who  served with him, on both sides of the aisle. He always called on all of  us to live up to all that is best and greatest about the United States  of America.   He was a fierce crusader for the causes close to his heart, from  supporting our Nation's veterans to equipping our military with the  tools it needs, to advancing liberty around the world.   He was also a wonderful colleague and friend. Shortly after I got to  the Senate, I read his book, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' As I am reading  this book, I am starting to think that some of the dates and places  sound pretty familiar. I did a little research and ended up discovering  the Distinguished Flying Cross my father Harold Thune received had been  awarded to him by none other than ADM John McCain--our John McCain's  grandfather.   When I shared this with John, and every time I would see him, he  would say: ``We've got to call your dad,'' and that is exactly what we  did one day. I cherish that special connection with a family who has  meant so much to our country and to freedom.   It was an honor to serve with John McCain. I will miss his sense of  humor and the passion he brought to every battle. I admired him  greatly. He reminded me and all of us every day that life is not about  advancing ourselves but about serving a greater cause and that,  paradoxically, it is in service that we find freedom.   In his farewell message to his countrymen, John said, ``To be  connected to America's causes--liberty, equal justice, respect for the  dignity of all people--brings happiness more sublime than life's  fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not  circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes that are bigger than  ourselves.''   Already, the new class of midshipmen has overrun the grounds of the  U.S. Naval Academy. In the days and years and decades to come,  midshipmen will walk past John McCain's grave and the graves of other  marines and sailors who have served our country. The graves will fade  into the background of everyday life, but they will still whisper  always of the courage and sacrifice of those who have gone before.   Later, at that time of their testing, some of those midshipmen may  remember the graves of those heroes and resolve to be like them, to be  like John McCain.   When discussing how he would like to be remembered, John McCain said,  ``I want, when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy, and  we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, `This guy, he  served our country.' ''   ``This guy, he served his country.'' I think he can be assured there  will be more than a few people saying that on Sunday. There can be few  finer epithets.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining  votes in this series be 10 minutes in length.
