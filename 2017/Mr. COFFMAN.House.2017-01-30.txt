 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the Asian  Pacific Development Center, a community-based nonprofit organization,  which has been serving the Asian American and Pacific Islander  communities in the State of Colorado for over 35 years. Their  commitment to service is truly an inspiration for all Coloradans.   The Asian Pacific Development Center guides itself by its founding  mission, which is to advance the well-being of Asian American and  Pacific Islander communities of Colorado by providing culturally  appropriate and integrated behavioral, medical, and related services.  By adhering to such a noble purpose, the Asian Pacific Development  Center is able to provide crucial services in native languages with a  cultural understanding.   Originally founded in 1980 by Dr. Rudy Lie, and currently headed by  Ms. Chris Wanifuchi, I am proud of just how important the Asian Pacific  Development Center is to our community. I look forward to working with  them in the many more years of service to come.                            ____________________
