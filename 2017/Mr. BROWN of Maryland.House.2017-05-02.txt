 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Colorado (Mr. Polis) for yielding.   I rise today in opposition to this so-called Working Families  Flexibility Act, a bill that would hurt, not help, working people.   This bill would ensure workers have less time, less flexibility, and  less money. Under this proposal, workers would forego the overtime they  earn today in exchange for comp time in the future, except workers  can't choose when they can use that time.   There is nothing stopping a boss from denying a worker from using  their comp time to care for a sick child or attend a school event. The  only thing that this bill does is provide more flexibility for bosses,  while taking away hard-earned overtime pay that many workers rely on to  make ends meet.   This is an attempt to undermine hard-fought, 80-year-old worker  protections guaranteed by the Fair Labor Standards Act. If Congress  wanted to give working families more flexibility, we should give them  earned paid sick days, combat pay discrimination, give them a say in  their work schedules, and raise the minimum wage. These are the  policies that working families truly need to thrive.   They are popular, commonsense ideas that, unlike this bill, don't  force workers into choosing between time and money. Families depend on  both. Let's work together to support real flexibility for working  families.
