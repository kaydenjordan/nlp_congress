 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, farming and ranching are industries that  are particularly subject to the whims of the weather. Just one storm  can wipe out an entire herd or crop, sometimes in a matter of minutes.   Last Thursday, several storms struck eastern South Dakota and farmers  were hit hard. Fortunately, it was too early in the season to wipe out  any crops, but farmers lost essential equipment and resources, feed,  grain bins, outbuildings, and more.   My office will be doing everything it can to make sure those affected  get the assistance they need to recover, and I know many are already  planning to rebuild. Whether it is a natural disaster or an ordinary  day, farmers and ranchers are always at the top of my mind here in the  Senate. Agriculture is the lifeblood of our South Dakota economy, and I  am committed to doing everything I can to ensure that our farmers and  ranchers have the resources they need to help feed our country.   I am fortunate enough to be a long-time member of the Senate  Agriculture Committee, which gives me an important platform in which to  address the needs of South Dakota ag producers. Right now, a big focus  of mine is the 2023 farm bill.   I have already held the first of a series of roundtables to hear from  South Dakota farmers and ranchers about what they need out of the 2023  farm bill. And I have introduced the first of what will be a number of  proposals  [[Page S2557]]  that I hope to get included in next year's legislation.   My Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act, which I introduced  in March, would make CRP grazing a more attractive option by providing  cost-share payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of  grazing infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution.   It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP, which hasn't  been changed since 1985, to help account for inflation and the increase  in land value.   I am also working with colleagues from agriculture States on  legislation based on my conversations with South Dakota farmers and  ranchers. In fact, last week I joined Senator Klobuchar to introduce  the Agriculture Innovation Act.   Currently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture collects reams of data  on conservation practices. The problem is that a lot of this data is  often not analyzed and presented in a way that would be useful for  farmers and ranchers.   The legislation Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced would provide  for better processing and development of the data that the USDA  collects so that farmers and ranchers can evaluate the impact of  conservation and other production practices on things like soil health,  crop yields, and profitability.   Our bill would make it easier for farmers and ranchers to decide what  conservation practices to adopt by, among other things, helping  producers identify the ways adopting conservation practices can improve  their bottom line.   And Senator Klobuchar and I will be working to get this legislation  included in the 2023 farm bill. In addition to farm bill priorities, I  have been spending a lot of time focused on agriculture and trade. Our  nation's farmers and ranchers already send their products around the  globe. But with Russia's war in Ukraine and its devastating impact on  Ukrainian agriculture, American ag producers are facing an added  responsibility when it comes to feeding the world.   Unfortunately, for some time now I have been hearing reports of ocean  carriers refusing to transport American agricultural products. This  would be a difficult situation at any time as export markets around the  world are critically important to American producers, but it is  particularly painful at a time when inflation is soaring and the supply  chain is under significant strain and when there is an increased need  to get American agricultural products abroad--thanks to the war in  Ukraine. And that is why I introduced legislation, the Ocean Shipping  Reform Act, to address these kinds of shipping problems and create a  more level playing field for American agricultural producers.   My bipartisan legislation would give the Federal Maritime Commission  increased authority to respond to unfair ocean carrier practices,  whether that involves a refusal to carry certain cargo, like  agricultural commodities, or discriminating against certain commodities  for export.   It would also provide the FMC with tools to more quickly resolve  attention and demurrage disputes, which would bring greater efficiency  and transparency to a process that leaves many shippers frustrated,  especially agriculture producers and other small businesses.   I was very pleased that the Senate passed my bill at the end of  March, and I am working with my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to advance this legislation so we can get it to the  President's desk.   I also recently led a letter with 23 of my Senate Republican  colleagues to the U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of  Agriculture, urging them to prioritize increased access to foreign  markets for American producers, including--and especially--American ag  producers.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has not made market access  commitments a priority in its trade agenda, including the proposed  Indo-Pacific economic framework. And the administration has failed to  pursue any ambitious market-opening initiatives or comprehensive trade  agreements.   Trade has played a large part in America's economic success for  decades, and it is critical for American ag producers who depend on  exporting their products. It is unacceptable that the administration  has dropped the ball in pursuing increased market access for American  producers.   I am also less than impressed by the President's failure to put  forward a confirmable nominee for the post of Chief Agricultural  Negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.   And while the President has finally put forward a nominee for Under  Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs at the Department  of Agriculture, it has taken him far too long to fill this position,  which plays a critical role in advocating for American producers when  it comes to world trade.   I pressed the U.S. Trade Representative on the administration's  failure to prioritize a meaningful trade and agricultural agenda during  a recent Finance Committee hearing, and I will continue to maintain  pressure on the administration to expand export opportunities for our  Nation's workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses.   Our Nation depends on our farmers and ranchers, and I am profoundly  grateful for all the determined men and women who have chosen and  passed on this way of life. I am honored to represent South Dakota's  farmers and ranchers here in the Senate, and I will continue to do  everything I can to ensure that they have all the resources they need  to continue to feed our Nation and the world.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).
