 Madam President, before I get to the motion I am going to  make, I am going to take just a few minutes to discuss the importance  of why the Senate must pass the Coronavirus Relief Flexibility for  Students and Institutions Act, which is S. 3947.   This has to do with an action that we took as bipartisan colleagues-- a most important action--in March, passing the CARES Act. The CARES Act  included $13.9 billion for higher education emergency relief for  institutions to directly support students facing urgent needs related  to this pandemic and also to support the institutions as they cope with  the effects of COVID-19.   From this amount, about $12.5 billion was provided to all  institutions of higher ed, and they had to use half their dollars to  award emergency aid to students and half the funds to cover the  institutional expenses and needs.   Congress was very careful in crafting this bipartisan provision to  provide flexibility so that the institutions could make their own  decisions about how to use and reward those funds--both for students  and how to use them for institutions. Unfortunately, the Department of  Education is not following congressional intent and is including  additional restrictions and conditions that Congress did not include  that are making these funds more difficult to access by students and by  the institutions.   On the institution side, colleges had to quickly transition their  programs online, many doing so on a widespread scale for the first  time, without the technology capacity and staff training to conduct  those classes.   Colleges have also had to quickly send students living on campus  home, bring students home who were studying abroad, clean and sanitize  their facilities, and provide refunds to students for room and board  charges. They have had to meet greater financial needs and basic need  challenges from their students, including housing, food, and childcare  costs.   This has resulted in higher costs for colleges at the same time as  COVID-19 has led to a sharp reduction in normal revenue streams:  fundraising, housing, dining, event space, athletic, bookstore,  conferences, and much more--including State funding that has been hurt.  These revenue losses are likely to continue as students drop out and  tuition revenue decreases in the fall.   This would come as schools implement costly safety measures for  reopening, like testing and PPE distribution. Many institutions have  already cut pay and benefits, laid off full-time staff and student  employees, and slashed to reorganize academic and athletic programs.  This is all in addition to the potential cuts colleges will likely see  from State budgets.   I got a letter from the president of one of my community colleges,  Dr. John Downey, president of Blue Ridge Community College in fall.   This would come as schools implement costly safety measures for  reopening, like testing and PPE distribution. Many institutions have  already cut pay and benefits, laid off full-time staff and student  employees, and slashed to reorganize academic and athletic programs.  This is all in addition to the potential cuts colleges will likely see  from State budgets.   I got a letter from the president of one of my community  colleg Weyers Cave. Here is what he said: ``We anticipate devastating  lost revenue and state budget reductions, and we have no way, with the  possible exception of the CARES Act institutional funds, to offset  those losses. The current CARES Act restrictions mean that community  college will likely only be able to offset $100,000-$300,000 of  [additional PPE expenses while we] open up. . . . Without the ability  to offset revenue losses looming for FY21, we are concerned that we  will be forced to close vital programs and layoff hard-working  personnel.''    Moody's Investors Service has changed their outlook for higher ed to  negative, indicating that 5 to 10 percent of institutions--particularly  regional public schools and small private colleges--could face  significantly intensified financial challenges.   In Virginia, one such institution, Sweet Briar College, a small,  rural, private college, says the impact is likely to be $10 million.  VCU, a large, public university, said it is likely to be $50 million in  the next fiscal year.   This is why we acted together as Congress to provide CARES Act  funding that could be used for revenue losses experienced by colleges.  We didn't specifically exclude using these dollars for revenue losses,  as we did in the State and local government aid; we allowed such a use,  as we did with the PPP program and the aid to hospitals. But the  Department of Education is using a very narrow interpretation of the  law and refusing to allow colleges to use money for revenue losses.   On to the student side of the equation, 50 percent of the money was  to be used for student aid. This is even more concerning. The  unauthorized guidance that the DOE has issued outlines that the  financial aid for students can only be provided to students who qualify  for aid under title IV of the Higher Education Act, which would exclude  any student who hadn't filled out a FAFSA, who has a minor drug  conviction, or who is not meeting academic progress requirements.  Again, these were not conditions that Congress put on the aid to  students. Nowhere in the CARES Act are these restrictions mentioned.   The financial aid director at the University of Virginia wrote my  office as follows:         When the CARES Act was signed into law, we, along with many       others in the financial aid community, believed that the       funding source would be available to provide assistance to       our students using school discretion. Schools have long       operated in this manner. Because of COVID-19, the parents of       many students who suddenly lost their jobs or have reduced       employment realized that their income had changed       dramatically and wished to appeal.    In other words, students who never had to fill out a FAFSA or who  never did one because their parents were employed are now facing  parents who are not employed.         It is not right for the DOE to put new requirements on the       students and bar them from receiving aid.    Some students have written. Here is a third-year undergraduate  student from Fairfax: I was studying abroad this past semester but had  to return home in March. My study-abroad program is unsure whether they  are going to be able to refund any of the semester's worth that I paid  for fees, including housing, meals, tuition. Due to the travel ban, I  had to book a ticket home on 1-day's notice, initially costing me  $1,800, but I was able to receive a partial refund of $900. My father  has been the primary source of income for my family, but he loses his  job this month. Since we don't know when he will be reemployed, this  has resulted in significant financial challenge to my family.   There are similar stories from other students--graduate students in  engineering in Henrico, undergraduates from Halifax.   Again, Congress intended these dollars to be used flexibly. The DOE  is getting in our way.   What the act would do that I am about to call up--it would ensure  that the Secretary in the Department of Education just follow  congressional intent by providing institutions of higher ed and  students with the increased flexibility they need during this time. The  bill would allow colleges to use their revenue from the CARES Act for  lost revenue--the higher ed funds for lost revenue. The bill would  ensure that emergency financial aid to students is made available to  all students  [[Page S3291]]  in need, letting the institutions decide how to make that  determination. Finally, it would better target funds designated for  colleges hardest hit by COVID-19.   Colleges and universities are major economic drivers. Placing  arbitrary restrictions on them is a challenge at any time--especially  now. We should be working together to ensure that the institutions and  our students get the help that Congress wanted them to get.   Again, the bill I have before you doesn't create a new program, and  it doesn't cost a penny. All it does is ask the Secretary of Education  to simply follow what Congress intended   Madam President, with that, I would ask unanimous consent that the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 3947, a bill to amend the provisions  relating to the higher education emergency relief fund to clarify the  flexibility provided to institutions and for students under the fund,  and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.   I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I appreciate my Senate colleague's desire  to increase accountability and transparency of student outcomes. As  Governor, I was doing the same thing with Virginia institutions. I view  his request as a little bit of a non sequitur. It is not really  connected to mine.   He mentioned that we shouldn't be throwing more money at colleges.  Let me make plain again that my request does not cost a penny. It is  not about an additional penny for colleges. It is about implementing  the CARES Act, which was passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote by  this body on March 26.   Senator Scott's bill does not deal with something we have already  done. It does not deal with the COVID emergency. It does deal very  directly with something that we are in the process of doing. The HELP  Committee right now is considering the reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act. Senator Scott's proposal, dealing with transparency and  accountability, fits squarely within the discussion that the HELP  Committee is currently having about reauthorization of HEA, and it is  an appropriate and important topic for the committee to grapple with as  we work on the HEA reauthorization. But in that sense, I am a little  puzzled because there is a venue for his proposal right now in the HEA  reauthorization discussion as we go forward and look at what more  accountability we would ask of our colleges.   I don't think we should jump Senator Scott's bill ahead of that  reauthorization and impose new restrictions on universities in the  middle of this pandemic, as we are trying to help them get through  COVID. For that and other reasons, while I would certainly pledge to  work with the Senator on this matter in the committee on which we both  sit, during HEA reauthorization, I do not agree to modify the request  that I made regarding S. 3947.
