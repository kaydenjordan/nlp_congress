 I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) for  this opportunity to speak.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce myself and to re-introduce  the First District of Texas to this distinguished body, the people's  House.   For those of you that do not know, the First District of Texas is  made up of 17 counties in east and northeast Texas. The people there  are faith-based, they are family-loving, they are hardworking, they are  tough-minded, and they are service-oriented individuals.   They use their independent spirits, their patriotic hearts, and their  rugged hands to build a future centered around faith, family, and  freedom.   There are simply no better people in this world than those who reside  in Congressional District 1 in Texas, and there are none more dedicated  to seeing this world be a better place for our children and our  grandchildren than my constituents.   The First District of Texas boasts a landscape of pine trees,  dogwoods, roses, azaleas, pecan and peach orchards, lakes, and beauty  beyond imagination.   Its economy is as diverse and strong as its people. It is not just  home to some of the best oil and gas operations in the world, but it is  home to innovative manufacturing, world-class healthcare, top-notch  educational institutions, farming and ranching operations, food  processing plants, steel and pipe companies, and so much more. You name  it, our folks do it, and they do it with a spirit of  excellence, innovation, and service toward one another.    The people in east Texas know that liberty gives rise to prosperity,  but prosperity should always give rise to generosity.   In east Texas, the people love their God, their families, and their  Nation, and they are willing to sacrifice all for those things. That is  why we have so many veterans in our community.   East Texas is filled with individuals who, out of reverence and  respect for the most important things in life, still stand for the  national anthem and bow at their church altar. They know how to stand  firm for their principles and to ask for forgiveness when they make  mistakes.   To be sure, they know that strength and humility are not mutually  exclusive; rather, they are values that support and build on one  another.   I am so proud and humbled to represent Texas' First Congressional  District in the United States House of Representatives.   When I was just shy of 2 years old, my parents moved me and my three  older brothers from Arizona to east Texas in Southern Smith County, and  they worked with other families in that area to start a Bible college.  For almost a decade, I lived on that Bible college campus and spent  most of my time either going to church or exploring the woods and the  county roads that surrounded our little single-wide trailer.   From climbing trees, to shooting snakes, drinking the nectar of  honeysuckles along the roadside, playing football with the neighborhood  kids, or recovering from multiple broken bones from all the adventures  we had living in the country, several things became clear to me from my  upbringing.   Among them, I learned, first: that Almighty God has a call for each  of us in this life; that we were created for a divine purpose.   I learned that each of us have equal and eternal value.   I learned also that the great commandment in Matthew 22, of loving  God and loving others, should guide our every decision and action in  life.   I learned simply that we are all sinners in need of a savior; and I  learned that these United States form the greatest Nation that has ever  existed; and our Republic is great because of the breadth of the  freedoms offered here, which come only from heaven above.   I am proud to be the first graduate of Whitehouse High School to  serve as a Member of Congress, and I am deeply thankful that my calling  in life has led me to this place, to this floor, where I hope to fan  the flames of liberty, and to create more opportunities for my  children, my four children, and for the children of every family in  east Texas and beyond.   As a city councilmember in Tyler, I learned quickly that sound policy  is so much more important than soundbites. Those 4 years on the city  council solidified my desire to serve my community in whatever way  possible.   Whether as a Sunday school teacher, a church deacon, a trombone  player in the worship band, Cub Scout den leader, assistant Scoutmaster  for the Boy  [[Page H317]]  Scouts, or coach for my daughters' basketball teams, or simply just a  volunteer for nonprofits across the community, I discovered that giving  is so much better than receiving.   I am blessed with a loving wife and four children, two boys and two  girls, from high school down to kindergarten, and they are a primary  motivator for me to fix what is so wrong with this country.   I want my kids to grow and to know a country where freedom reigns  supreme; where government is limited; and where their good decisions  can lead to good consequences but, equally as important, where their  bad decisions can lead to bad consequences so they can learn from their  mistakes.   The road ahead for America will not be easy. As a country, we must  make tough decisions to reverse our current trajectory. If we make  these good decisions, we will see good consequences. But if we fail in  that task, in that mission, the consequences will get more dire and the  future will become more bleak.                                time  1715    In fulfilling our mission, we should never compromise our principles,  but we can be both principled conservatives and pragmatic policymakers.   As a county judge in one of the most conservative counties in the  State of Texas, I was proud to maintain one of the lowest tax rates in  the State while still addressing critical areas of county government  like improving roads and bridges, supporting law enforcement, working  to improve election integrity, and addressing longstanding facility  needs.   It is possible to do both, to keep the burden of taxes low while  still addressing the critical needs of this country, but it takes the  wisdom to see the right path forward and the courage to take it. In  short, it means channeling the greatness of the character of this  country, the type of bold and strong character evident in the people of  the First Congressional District in east Texas and in so many other  places in this great country.   I thank my constituents for this opportunity to serve; to be strong  and courageous for them and for this country; and to work with all my  might to preserve, protect, and defend this Constitution and the United  States of America. I pledge to do just that and to do all that I can to  make that happen.
