 Mr. President, it was 30 years ago to this very day that  I came here to give one of my first speeches on the Senate floor, and I  talked about a friend of mine back in Washington State. She was a mom.  She had just gotten heartbreaking news. Her son was dying of leukemia.  And then another gut punch: Her employer told her she had to choose  between being in the hospital with her son or being at her job, and if  she wasn't there, she was going to lose it.   To this day, that makes me so angry. No one should face such a cruel  decision. No one should ever be forced to choose between taking care of  themselves and their loved ones and being able to make ends meet.   So at the time, 30 years ago, I was on the floor to urge my  colleagues to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provided  job-protected, unpaid leave to workers across the country, because the  bottom line was that every worker should know that if they have a  family emergency, they can prioritize their family's health without  jeopardizing their family's economic security.   I was so thrilled when, just a few days later, we won, and that bill  became law. But even back then, it was clear that bill was just a first  step. It was clear we needed to keep fighting for the next one. And I  am still here, and I am still fighting because we are way behind where  we should be. We are way behind our peers in the world when it comes to  giving working families the support they need, and it is holding us  back.   For one thing, there are still too many loopholes that leave people  without the simple promise of unpaid leave. Too many workers today in  this country are denied the basic protections of the Family and Medical  Leave Act that we passed into law 30 years ago. I have been fighting to  close those loopholes and expand protections for decades so workers are  not left out in the cold during an emergency just because they work at  a small business or they work part time or just because their family  might look little different--for example, if they are a caregiver for a  niece or a nephew or a grandchild. No one should be punished for that.  So it is time that we pass legislation to guarantee that those workers  get the same protections as everybody else.   Let me be clear. Passing bills to do this, that is just updating our  laws to guarantee unpaid leave for all. That is just making good on the  promise we made to workers 30 years ago. In other words, that is just  the next step, but it is far from the last one. Our families need a lot  more. They deserve so much better. There is no excuse for our utter  lack of a national paid leave program. It is bad for families, as any  working mom or dad can tell you or anyone who cares for a family member  with a serious health condition. They know this all too well.   By the way, it is bad for our economy because the lack of paid leave  means that employees lose their wages and businesses lose their  workers. We are facing serious workforce shortages in key sectors of  our economy today. Let me tell you, the lack of a national paid leave  program is not helping; it is hurting. We are the only Nation among our  peers that has not figured that out yet. We are the only one that  hasn't gotten this done. The reality is, it makes our economy less  competitive on the world stage. But you don't have to look at other  countries to see how urgent this is; just listen to people right here.   I shared my friend's story all those years ago, but today, across the  country, there are still so many families facing unthinkable choices.  There are still so many people--working moms in particular--sharing  their own deeply personal stories about this, stories of the painful  recovery after giving birth and the incredibly special but, let's face  it, pretty tough first weeks of bonding with a newborn child; stories  of the grief and the pain of caring for a seriously ill child; sitting  at a hospital bedside of a seriously ill parent recovering from surgery  or coping with a cancer diagnosis; with the added stress, at that  hardest time of your life, about how you are going to make your next  month's rent if you have to take unpaid time off of work. Anyone who  has been in those situations knows it is hard. You have so much you are  worried about.   Here in Congress, we should be working to make that an easier time  for families. We should be taking that worry off of parents' shoulders.  We should be making sure that no worker has to choose between their  family and their job, between their family and their paycheck.   So as we mark the anniversary today of the Family and Medical Leave  Act, I want to urge my colleagues, let's celebrate the legacy of that  bill, of course, by building on it. Let it be this Congress that we  finally, at long last, take the much-needed next steps that families  have been waiting for, that they have been calling for. Let's ensure  that the Family and Medical Leave Act protects all working families.  Let's establish a national paid leave program.  [[Page S225]]  Let's tackle the childcare crisis with bold reforms. Let's build an  economy that actually works for our families here.   Now, I want to end today with the same words that I actually said 30  years ago right here on the Senate floor:         If one mother is able to sit with her seriously ill son       without fear of losing her life savings, if one son is able       to hold the hand of his dying mother, if one of us--you or       I--is able to care for someone we love when they need us the       most, then the time and the energy spent on [these issues has       been] worth it.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.                            ____________________
