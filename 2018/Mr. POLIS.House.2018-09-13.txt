 Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago this week, Colorado was struck by  devastating floods. From Fort Collins, to Estes Park, to Lyons, to  Boulder, dozens of communities were hit with unprecedented amounts of  rain that gave way to rivers and tributaries overflowing, with huge  amounts of damage, including the loss of eight lives.   When the floods came 5 years ago, we committed to one another to be  Colorado strong and to rebuild.   I am proud to say that, in the years since the flood, I have been  amazed by the resiliency of so many families. For my family, it meant a  flooded basement and the loss of some of our treasured family  photographs we stored there. For others, it upended their lives.   Stu and Sarah Jane were new parents to their 9-month-old daughter  when the flood waters demolished their house in Fourmile Canyon.  Shortly after receiving a reverse 911 call, the canyon gave way. The  family escaped to a firehouse, and, after 2 days, a National Guard  helicopter flew in, transporting them to safety.   There are so many stories of so many Colorado families, and the  smallest difference in circumstances would have meant that many  families wouldn't be alive today.   In the last 5 years, communities have come together to repair roads,  trails, homes, and businesses. This resiliency and grit that  Coloradoans showed the week of September 9 through September 16, 2013,  as rains fell, was matched only by the sense of community and tenacity  that took hold as the waters subsided.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for funding  appropriated to the Office of Compliance contained within the  Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5895. This important funding will  support efforts to the ongoing reform of the Congressional  Accountability Act to better enable legislative branch offices and  agencies to receive proper training regarding workplace conduct.   I strongly oppose slush fund settlements being paid out with taxpayer  dollars, and I am pleased that no funding contained in this bill will  go towards money for settlements. I appreciate the work of the  Conference Committee in getting this critical funding included in this  appropriations package.
