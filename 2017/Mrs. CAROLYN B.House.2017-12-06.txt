 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we have a gun  violence epidemic in this country.   It is glaringly obvious to anyone paying attention that our Federal  gun safety laws are pathetically weak and in major need of improvement.  [[Page H9700]]    So what is this House doing about it?   Working to pass a bill that completely undermines gun safety laws and  puts more guns on the street and more lives at risk.   Believe me, if more guns made this country safer, we would be the  safest country on Earth. We are far from it.   Under this bill, someone who couldn't get a concealed carry permit in  New York would now be able to carry concealed guns into New York State  or any State, as long as they have a permit from another State. This  completely eviscerates State-level gun safety laws and puts us all at  the mercy of the weakest gun safety laws in the country.   This bill is opposed by major law enforcement organizations across  this country. I urge this body to listen to their advice and vote  against this reckless assault on State and local gun safety laws.
