 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 299, the Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao) for  his incredible leadership introducing this important legislation.   This bill expands treatment coverage for those affected by Agent  Orange to not only those who served on the ground, but to those  servicemembers, who are known as blue water Navy vets, who were  affected while serving our Nation at sea.   In my home county of Suffolk, which has the highest concentration of  veterans in the State of New York, hundreds of Vietnam veterans and  their families will now be able to receive the benefits they have  earned. These brave servicemembers have put their lives on the line for  our great Nation, and they have earned nothing less than the highest  quality of care.   Additionally, this legislation includes my bill, the Flexible VA Loan  Guarantee Act, which expands a veteran's opportunity for homeownership  by eliminating the loan limit the VA can guarantee. This is especially  critical in districts like mine, where the median home prices are  higher.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe for bringing this bill to the  floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support our Nation's veterans  by voting in favor of this commonsense legislation.
