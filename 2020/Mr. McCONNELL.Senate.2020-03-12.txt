 Mr. President, this morning, the Senate and House  Sergeants at Arms announced the suspension of public tours and  nonofficial access to the Capitol Complex beginning at the close of  business today and running through the end of March. Their decision was  made in close consultation with the Attending Physician of the U.S.  Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan.   I support the decision of these nonpartisan officers. It follows new  guidance from the Washington, DC, Department of Health encouraging that  all nonessential mass gatherings of more than 1,000 people be  postponed. The Capitol Complex welcomes many times that many visitors  on a typical day, particularly at this time of year.   Congress will continue to do our work. Offices will be able to  welcome constituents and visitors for meetings and official business by  appointment, but in deference to the experts and to protect the health  of many Americans who travel to our Nation's Capital, tourism and  nonofficial access to the Capitol and the complex will be put on pause.   This virus is challenging our Nation in ways that feel unfamiliar to  us, but our great country is strong, we are equipped, and we have  overcome far greater challenges before. I know the entire Congress will  look forward to welcoming all Americans back to visit their beautiful  Capitol as soon as possible.   In the meantime, we continue to encourage everyone to follow the  facts, listen to the experts, and take smart and calm precautions as  appropriate. Every American can access up-to-date recommendations for  their own personal circumstances at www.coronavirus.gov.  Last night, President Trump addressed the Nation on the broader,  ongoing effort to slow and mitigate the spread of the virus here on  American soil. As I have noted before, the administration's early  proactive measures to repatriate U.S. citizens and restrict travel from  China bought more time for public health professionals to prepare our  response, and the funding measure that Congress passed last week is  sending an infusion of new funding into laboratory research, frontline  medical care, and everything in between.  [[Page S1714]]    With those critical steps already taken, this week brought a further  opportunity to help communities and families face the economic effects  of the virus spread. Unfortunately, it appears at this hour that the  Speaker and House Democrats instead chose to produce an ideological  wish list that was not tailored closely to the circumstances. One is  reminded of the famous comment from President Obama's first Chief of  Staff: ``You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' Instead of  focusing on immediate relief to affected individuals, families, and  businesses, the House Democrats chose to wander into various areas of  policy that are barely related, if at all, to the issue before us.   Instead of working within existing law and within existing systems to  deliver targeted relief as officially and effectively as possible, the  Speaker's proposal would stand up a needless thicket of new  bureaucracy. They would task offices like the Social Security  Administration with standing up brand-new bureaucracy that would delay  the delivery of aid to those who need it.   As currently drafted, the proposal appears to impose permanent  unfunded mandates on businesses that could cause massive job losses and  put thousands of small businesses at risk. The administration was ready  to collaborate. The Senate was ready to seriously consider a compromise  product, but it appears that over in the House, leftwing political  messaging may have taken priority over the needs of our country.  Certainly, this is disappointing.   I want to commend Secretary Mnuchin for his efforts and his continued  conversation. At a minimum, I hope that Senate Democrats will not block  potential requests from our colleagues today to pass smaller,  noncontroversial pieces of legislation right away that would bolster  particular aspects of the fight against coronavirus.   The good news is that our Nation's economy remains strong. The  President is continuing to take action himself. We just passed  billions--billions--in urgent funding just last week, and the Senate  will continue to stand ready and willing to work toward further  bicameral, bipartisan actions when the House Democrats decide to get  serious.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, yesterday the  House of Representatives did come together around a bipartisan  agreement to renew some critical national security tools. The USA  FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020 will reauthorize key authorities  granted to intelligence and national security professionals under the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   First and foremost, this means ensuring that the men and women tasked  with rooting out espionage and stopping terrorist activity on U.S. soil  are equipped with the powers they need to be successful.   Today, the threats these professionals confront are as serious and  diverse as ever. Terrorist groups continue to wish us harm. Major  hostile powers like Russia and China remain committed to undermining  the integrity of American institutions, from our infrastructure to our  elections.   The targeted powers reauthorized by this legislation are a vital part  of the efforts to protect American communities. That is a fact. It is a  fact that has been reaffirmed time and again by Attorneys General and  by the numerous reauthorizations granted by Congress.   This time is no different. We can't mistake the safety and security  that FISA authorities have helped preserve for evidence that they are  no longer needed. At the same time, we cannot mistake a vital process  for a perfect one. The 2016 election showed us perfectly clearly that  the authorities granted under FISA are in need of targeted reforms to  improve accountability. That was backed up by the findings of the  Department of Justice inspector general.   That is why this legislation contains a number of specific reforms to  address the kinds of failures that embarrassed the system in 2016: more  oversight over the practices of the FISA Court, more declassification  and more compliance practices, higher level approval for certain  sensitive applications, and more.   Our responsibility here is twofold. We have to continue equipping our  national security professionals and the intelligence community to  anticipate, confront, and eliminate the threats facing our country, and  we also have to respond to the failures of 2016 with real reforms that  ensure the public trust is handled appropriately.   This legislation, passed by a bipartisan majority in the House and  endorsed by the Attorney General, strikes the right balance. I am  confident that it will pass the Senate as well. It is not a question of  if this passes but when.   I hope that our colleagues who may not choose to vote for this  legislation will not deny this body the opportunity to renew these  authorities today to prevent any lapse. I hope none of our colleagues  choose to force these important national security tools to temporarily  lapse for the sake of making a political point, which will not change  the outcome. In fact, I hope we can renew these authorities today.   But if we cannot, if some of our colleagues choose to object, the  lapse will only be temporary, similar to past short lapses between  reauthorizations. These national security tools should not lapse. They  do not need to lapse, and I hope none of our colleagues choose to  unilaterally force them to lapse just for the sake of making a point.  But at least it would only be temporary because this bill is going to  pass, these authorities are getting renewed, and that is a great thing  for the security of our Nation and the safety of the American people. I  hope it can happen today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
