 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to report that optimism  among Montana small businesses is strong and on the rise. I recently  concluded a tour of Montana's Main Street businesses; and as I listened  to business owners, they described their growing confidence.   They talked about how progrowth reforms, which this Congress and our  President delivered, are providing them and their small businesses  greater certainty. They described how cutting taxes and cutting red  tape are leading them to invest, create Montana jobs, and grow.   Their confidence and optimism match the national trends. The U.S.  Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index, which gauges optimism, hit  new records in the second quarter. A survey from CNBC, which measures  small business confidence, remains near its record high for the first  quarter.  [[Page H3843]]    Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the optimism I saw from Montana small  businesses, and I will continue working to grow opportunities that  improve the lives of all Montanans.                            ____________________
