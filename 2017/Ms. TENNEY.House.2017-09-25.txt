 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove  Representative Carlos Curbelo as a cosponsor of H.R. 2299.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent  from the 22nd District of New York, Elliott Root.   Elliott was born with a single left ventricle and has prevailed over  tremendous odds in his short life. At the young age of 10 years old,  Elliott will undergo his fifth open-heart surgery this week.   Today, I wear the Red Balloon pin in honor of Elliott's courage and  strength. Throughout the Red Balloon Campaign, Elliott and his mother,  Amy, have worked tirelessly to raise awareness and create an atmosphere  of connectivity for all impacted by heart defects.   Congenital heart defects are the most prevalent birth defect,  affecting 1 in 100 newborns, leading to the death of more children each  year than all forms of pediatric cancer combined. Despite these  staggering statistics, congenital heart defects continue to be  underrecognized and underfunded.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Elliott and his entire family as he  undergoes his fifth open-heart surgery. Elliott's enduring spirit and  bravery are an inspiration to all of us. Please join me in celebrating  the life of this courageous young man.                            ____________________
