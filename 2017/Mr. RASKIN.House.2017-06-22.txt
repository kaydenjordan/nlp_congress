 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  participating in this Special Order hour with the Progressive Caucus  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order, which is  healthcare.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Maryland?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  participating in this Special Order hour with the Progressive Caucus  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order, which is  healthcare.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Maryland?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here tonight on behalf  of the Progressive Caucus to manage this Special Order hour along with  my colleagues, who I will be introducing. Several of them will be  joining me tonight to discuss what is going on in the Senate today with  the GOP finally unveiling their closely guarded secret plan to repeal  the Affordable Care Act, a plan they are unveiling that has had the  legislative benefit of no hearings, no witnesses, no expert testimony,  no testimony by the public, and, again, no Congressional Budget Office  score so far, which is the same way that the legislation passed out of  the House side.   So does all of this sound familiar? It should, because this is the  same clandestine, in-the-dark process that led to the plan which  emerged here in the House of Representatives on the barest of margins  with every manner of power play and power ploy engaged by leadership to  produce the final result.   That bill, by the way, now stands at a whopping 9 percent in the  polls, which means it is even more unpopular than Congress itself. And  even though my friends across the aisle rented buses and vans to take  them over to the White House to go and celebrate and exult in their  dubious victory and uncork the champagne and drink beer with the  President and his staff after they pushed the bill through the House,  today, President Trump now calls the bill that he celebrated and he  campaigned for mean. He says it is a mean bill today.   And there is no question he is right about that. We said that at the  time, mean as a rattlesnake, that bill, which would have thrown 24  million people off their health insurance plans and destroyed  preexisting health insurance coverage for people with preexisting  health conditions.   The Senate version, though, is just as mean. It is downright mean. It  may even be meaner than the House version. It not only strips health  insurance coverage from tens of millions of our fellow American  citizens; it not only forces American families to pay higher premiums  and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs, all to pay for a tax  cut for the wealthiest of our citizens; it forces Americans, ages 50 to  64, to pay premiums five times higher than everyone else, no matter how  healthy you are.   That is right. If you are in the age bracket of 50 to 64, your  premiums, under their bill, will be five times higher than everybody  else in the population, no matter how healthy you are. It reduces the  life of the Medicare trust fund and robs funds that seniors depend on  to get the long-term care that they need. It blocked grants, Medicaid  to the States, and then, astonishingly, for the first time ever, places  a per capita cap on Medicaid payments for all recipients, including  disabled Americans and senior citizens.   That is just unconscionable. Think about it. For the first time ever,  under Medicaid, the Federal Government would not commit to pay for all  of enrollees' health bills. So if your illness or your injuries are too  severe or too complicated, your treatment too long, tough luck for you,  buddy; you are on your own, Jack. That is the new proposal that is  coming out from the Senate today.   The people that railed about death panels before passage of the  Affordable Care Act, panels that never materialized and were proven to  be an absolute  [[Page H5102]]  fiction and fantasy, now seek to throw millions of people off of their  health insurance, roll back the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable  Care Act, which benefitted millions of our countrymen and -women, and  then cut the heart out of the Medicaid guarantee by placing a per  capita cap on payments to beneficiaries.                                time  1730    And this particular assault on the health and well-being of the  American people doesn't even claim to be a response to any alleged  problems with the Affordable Care Act, or with ObamaCare as they call  it. It is, instead, a sweeping change to Medicaid that so-called free  market conservatives have been trying to make for years.   This Senate legislation, cooked up in secret and seasoned with  slashing cuts to Medicaid, is one fine mess. It does nothing but make  our healthcare system more expensive, dangerously throws tens of  millions of people off of their insurance, and eviscerates the core  protections of Medicaid.   And why? What is the public policy being advanced here? All for a tax  cut for the wealthiest Americans. It takes a special kind of single- minded focus to turn a healthcare bill into a massive tax cut for the  people who need it the least in America.   Now, I heard some of my friends, my distinguished colleagues on the  other side, say that other colleagues should not have been talking  about how the bill was ``mean,'' or ``mean spirited,'' or ``mean''  because we have a renewed spirit of civility in this Chamber, which we  do; and I praise it, and I celebrate it. Ever since the terrible attack  on our colleague Steve Scalise and other colleagues and the Capitol  Police officers who rose valiantly to defend them, we have really tried  to put aside a lot of the partisan rancor. But my friends, we have got  to talk honestly about legislation which is threatening the well-being  of our own citizens.   The word ``mean'' comes not from my colleagues who were speaking  before. The word ``mean'' comes from the President of the United States  himself, who said that the legislation that passed out of the House,  looking back on it, was ``mean.'' Now, all of that was in order to say  he likes the Senate version instead, but we think that the Senate  version is even meaner than the bill that the President has already  described as ``mean'' that came of the House.   So to describe more of the specific terms of this legislation and why  it is a threat to our public health, why it is a threat to the basic  values of solidarity and justice and community that defines us as  Americans, we have invited a number of our colleagues to come up and  participate, beginning with the Congresswoman from Seattle, Washington,  Pramila Jayapal, who used to co-chair the Progressive Caucus hour with  me.   She has now been replaced by someone because she is moving on to an  even bigger assignment right now, but please welcome a great  Congresswoman, Pramila Jayapal, from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    I thank the gentlewoman, Ms. Jayapal.   We have next with us Congressman Ro Khanna who is from California. He  is an economist, and he is a lawyer. He has taught economics at  Stanford, and he has taught law at Santa Clara. He was a Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Commerce Department under President Obama.  He is a well-known author who has written a very good book about  manufacturing and economic competitiveness in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna)  who is going to be taking over for Congresswoman Jayapal as my co- convenor of this Special Order hour from here on in.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for his very wise  and insightful words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for his very wise  and insightful words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I want to pause from our analysis of the  specific terms of the bill that was unveiled today to ask the question:  What is the value that is really at stake in healthcare policy in the  United States?   When we were debating on the House side, I heard a colleague get up  on the floor and say something to the effect of: Under ObamaCare, under  the Affordable Care Act, healthy people are having to pay insurance to  take care of sick people.   It took a second for that to register with me. Then I turned to the  person I was sitting next to and said: Yes, that is what insurance is.  The whole point of insurance is that all of us pay money in, knowing  that people get sick in the course of life.   We hope that we are not going to be one of them. We hope we won't get  injured. We hope we won't get sick or ill or come down with a terrible  disease, God forbid, but we know it can happen, so we all pay in. When  it does happen to some people, that is what insurance is for. So the  value there is one of solidarity among everybody together.   In the richest country on Earth, at its richest moment in our  history, there is another value at stake here, which is the value of  justice.   Forgive me, but I want to speak personally for a moment here, because  I have what we call a preexisting condition. So this issue of  preexisting condition coverage is important to me and my family. I  understand it is important for tens of millions of families across the  country.   If you are having a great day, and you have got not one, but two jobs  you love--I have been a professor of constitutional law at American  University for 27 years now, and I was serving in the Maryland Senate.  But if you wake up and it is a beautiful day and you have got two jobs  you love, a family you love, great kids, and constituents you are  committed to, and a doctor tells you that you have got stage III colon  cancer, that is what I immediately took to be a misfortune.   It is a terrible misfortune, but we have to remember that it happens  to people across the country, all over the world, every single day,  where people get a diagnosis of colon cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimer's  disease, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis,  cystic fibrosis, you name it. It is a misfortune because it can happen  to anybody.   But if you are told that you have colon cancer, for example, and if  you can't get health insurance because, for example, before marriage  equality, if you loved the wrong person and you couldn't get health  insurance through your spouse, or if you can't get health insurance  because you lost your job and you are without health insurance, or if  you are too poor to afford it, that is not just a misfortune. That is  an injustice.   We can do something about that. Life is hard enough with all of the  illness, sickness, accidents, and injuries that people receive without  government compounding all of the misfortune with injustice. Life is  hard enough without government doing the wrong thing. So the Affordable  Care Act added more than 20 million Americans to the rolls of people  who have health insurance.   The bill that came out of the Senate today wants to strip health  insurance from tens of millions of Americans and jack up everybody's  premiums and make healthcare more inaccessible for people. They want to  compound the normal difficulties and misfortunes of life with the  injustice of distributing healthcare in a radically unequal and unjust  way.   We can't go back. It is too late for that. The great Tom Payne once  said that it is impossible to make people un-think their thoughts or  un-know their knowledge. We have come too far as a country to turn the  clock back.   I know there are people on the Senate side, like Rand Paul, who I saw  on TV speaking about this, who think we should get rid of all forms of  public attempts to get people health insurance. Rand Paul takes a  perfectly principled position. He says the government shouldn't be  involved at all. I don't know how he feels about Medicare or Medicaid.  He certainly hates the Affordable Care Act. He just wants to outright  repeal it, which is what the GOP said they would do.   So he is going to vote against that bill because it keeps the  remnants of the system that we voted in with the Affordable Care Act. I  understand that. I understand his position. I disagree with it  completely because I think, as Americans, we have got to have  solidarity with each other and we have got to take care of each other  through insurance because the misfortunes of life can happen to  anybody. So we have got to stand together.   He says that is not part of the social contract. Okay. That is fine.  I get it. But what I don't understand is people are saying: Well, we  said we would just get rid of it, but we will get rid of some parts of  it. We will throw millions of people off their health insurance. We  will make insurance more expensive for everybody. We will cut the heart  out of Medicaid.   Why? What is the public policy that is being advanced here?   It doesn't make any sense. Countries all over the world have arrived  at the point of universal single-payer plans, like in France, the  United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada. The countries that can afford it  overwhelmingly have said: healthcare for everyone.   That is why I am a proud cosponsor of a bill, which is proudly  cosponsored by a majority of the people in the Democratic Caucus. It is  Congressman Conyers' Medicare for All bill.   I think that is where we need to go. I am convinced we are going to  get there sooner rather than later. Winston Churchill once said: You  can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, once they have  tried everything else first.   We have tried some other stuff in between, but we are on the way to  taking public responsibility for the healthcare of our people. My  healthcare is connected to your healthcare because my health is  connected to your health. We want the families whose kids go to school  with our kids to be in a relationship with a primary care doctor. We  want them to get their shots. We don't want them coming to school sick.   Public health dictates that everybody be in the system. A lot of  young men, for example, think that they are too tough to go see  doctors. That becomes a danger for everybody else. We need everybody to  be in a relationship with a doctor. We owe that not just to ourselves  and our families, but we owe it to everybody.   Everybody in the system, everybody covered. That is where America  needs to go. But understand that what is coming out of the Senate has  nothing to do with that. The Senate plan is all about rolling back the  progress that we made under the Affordable Care Act, like the ban on  throwing people off of healthcare because they have a preexisting  condition or denying people insurance in the first place because they  have a preexisting condition.   The fact that someone has got a preexisting health condition is the  reason that they need health insurance. It is not a reason to deny them  health insurance. What they are doing is perfectly backwards.   The Affordable Care Act also said that young people could stay on  their family's plan until age 26. Thank God we have had that provision.  Even the GOP doesn't want to mess with that, at this point. We got  millions of people into relationships with doctors. We could show you  dozens of emails and letters and calls that we are getting from people  who say: The Affordable Care Act saved my life. I would have had no  access to healthcare without it.   The whole idea of turning the clock back and moving in the opposite  direction is completely antithetical to the direction of American  history. We are moving forward. We want universal coverage for  everybody.   By the way, we spend more on healthcare than most of those countries  that have single-payer healthcare. I think we may spend more than  anybody else on Earth on healthcare, but  [[Page H5106]]  we don't get the best results because we leave so many people out and  we are spending lots of money on insurance. The last I looked, it was  around 30 or 31 cents on the dollar we are spending on the insurance  companies, on bureaucracy and red tape, instead of getting people  healthcare.   That is the direction we need to be moving in, not dismantling and  savaging the healthcare protections that we have in place right now.   I want to close with some thoughts just about the process that is  going on. Back when the Affordable Care Act was being debated, my dear  friends across the aisle complained about how fast things were going  and how they thought the legislation was being rushed.   I don't want to embarrass anybody by calling out specific statements  made, but we have got voluminous statements made by people on the other  side of the aisle saying: This is too fast. You're trying to sneak it  through. You're trying to ram it down the throats of the American  people. All of this is happening too fast.   Well, Mr. Speaker, the debate over the Affordable Care Act spanned  more than 12 months. It took more than a year. The Senate bill was  unveiled today with no hearings, no witnesses, no professional  testimony, no opportunity for the public to testify for nurses or  doctors or patient advocates or any of the groups that are interested;  none of them.   In the Affordable Care Act, there were 79 hearings that I was able to  find in Congress. That is 79 hearings. Not zero hearings, which is what  they are proposing to do now. There were 79 hearings. There were 181  witnesses, both expert witnesses and ordinary citizens, who came to  testify before Congress, in public. So far, there has been zero  testimony on what the ramifications and consequences are of the bill  that was unveiled in the Senate today.   We had multiple Congressional Budget Office scores that analyzed the  costs and the impact of different proposals that were part of the ACA.  By contrast, the House was forced to vote on the GOP healthcare repeal  plan in this body with no CBO score at all, no estimate on how much the  bill would cost the taxpayers, no estimate on how many Americans  precisely would lose their health insurance. We have learned later the  CBO estimate of $23 million, but that was after we voted on it.   So the people who were saying that the debate moved too fast back  then--a year of debate, with dozens of hearings and witnesses, and so  on--now seem perfectly content with a process where a bill comes out on  Thursday, and then they are going to vote on it next Thursday with no  hearings, very little public debate, no opportunity for people to come  and testify, and no real opportunity for the public to process what is  going on.   What is the urgency?   If it is such a great bill, then we should be out trumpeting it and  advertising it. And everybody should have at least one townhall meeting  back in their congressional districts to explain how they feel about it  so that everybody's constituents can ask us about the bill.   Is it going to improve America's healthcare? Is it going to improve  the health and well-being of the people, or reduce the health and well- being of the American people? Is it going to drive our premiums,  copays, and deductibles even more?   Those are questions we should have to face with our constituents.   Regardless of what your political party or ideology is, everybody  should tell their Member of Congress: At the very least, let's have  some public discussion about it. Let's have the opportunity for  townhall meetings across the country before we completely rewrite the  healthcare plan for the American people.                                time  1815    I urge my colleagues to slow down, take a step back, and work across  the aisle for the best possible results. There are things we can do  together to help.   For example, I heard the President of the United States come to our  body and make a speech in which he said that prescription drug prices  were out of control and we needed to give government the authority to  negotiate lower drug prices. I agree 100 percent with the President of  the United States about that.   There has been no action on that by my friends across the aisle in  the House or in the Senate, and I beseech the President of the United  States, before you advance 1 centimeter further on this extremely  controversial bill, which I understand four Republican Senators have  already announced their opposition to today, before you go any further  on this, let's get to something we can agree on for once. Let's find  the common ground. And the common ground has got to be prescription  drug prices are out of control for Americans.   Let us give the government the authority to negotiate for lower drug  prices in Medicare the way that we have got it for VA benefits or for  Medicaid prescription drugs. We have got that authority, but there was  a special interest provision slipped into Medicare part D, and the  government doesn't have that authority. That is authority we should  have.   Mr. President, we agree with you about that. Why don't you put a  pause on trying to demolish the ACA and Medicaid, and let's see if we  can get some prescription drug legislation that will bring prices down  for all Americans. We are ready to work with you on that.   There are reports that there is some effort to come up with a phony  plan on prescription drug prices that wouldn't actually give the  government the authority to negotiate lower prices. I hope that is not  true, but let's have a real plan to bring people's prescription drug  prices down.   There are things we can do together across the aisle. In fact, the  President of the United States said repeatedly during the campaign that  his plan would be a magnificent plan that would cover everybody. He  said everybody would be part of it. And a lot of people, including me,  took him to be invoking the single-payer universal health plans that  work all over the world, that work in Canada and that work throughout  Europe and so on.   Mr. Speaker, let me ask, would it be possible for us to get together  with the President in order to come up with a single-payer plan, the  kind that he invoked over the course of the campaign? Let's seize upon  the new spirit of civility and community in this body and in Congress  to come up with plans that bring us together, that don't drive us  apart.   The plan that passed out of the House of Representatives is standing  at 9 percent in the public opinion polls. I can't imagine that the  Senate plan is going to be any more popular. If this was a mean plan,  as the President said, the Senate plan looks meaner, or at least as  mean as the House plan is.   But even if you doubled it and said 18 percent of the people would  support it, that is still a tiny fraction of the American people. The  overwhelming majority of Americans are not sold on this idea of turning  the clock back and throwing millions of people off their health  insurance plans.   Let us work together, and we can do it. In the societies that have  universal health coverage, it is accepted now by people across the  political spectrum. If you go to France or the United Kingdom or  Canada, the conservatives are not agitating to throw people off of  healthcare. The conservatives support a universal payer plan. And there  are lots of conservative arguments for it.   For example, let's liberate our businesses, especially our small  businesses, from the burden of having to figure out people's  healthcare. Let's take that completely off of the business sector, and  let's make that a public responsibility the way they have done in so  many countries around the world. Wouldn't that be good for business?  And doesn't it enhance feelings of community, solidarity, and  patriotism for everybody to be covered by the healthcare system of the  country that they live in?   We can do this as Americans. We are the wealthiest country that has  ever existed. This is the wealthiest moment in our history. Let's come  up with a real plan for health coverage that eliminates as much  insurance bureaucracy and waste as possible and gets people the  healthcare coverage that they need.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to have this  Special  [[Page H5107]]  Order hour on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, which has advanced the  Medicare for All plan, and I encourage everybody to check it out.   But in any event, we are not retreating 1 inch from defending the  Affordable Care Act and the progress that has been made under it, and I  hope that we will have maximum transparency and scrutiny of what came  out of the Senate today, because we think that the only possible  outcome is that bill will go down; then we can come together, find the  commonsense solutions, find the common ground, and make progress for  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 21 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, June 23, 2017, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
