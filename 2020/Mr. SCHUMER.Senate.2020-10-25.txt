 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I want to start today by talking about  some breaking news that may, at first glance, not seem relevant to  today's proceedings but, in fact, is a perfect illustration of how  broken this process is.   We find ourselves in the middle of a pandemic that the Republican  Party has never taken seriously enough, and it is a pandemic that is  worsening by the day.   According to Dr. Fauci, the nomination ceremony for Judge Barrett was  a superspreader event.   Today, the White House Chief of Staff conceded the White House is  ``not going to control the pandemic.'' Yet last night we learned that  several aides close to Vice President Pence have tested recently  positive for COVID.   We wish them and their families well. We wish the Vice President and  his family continued health. But a normal response after being close to  several people with COVID-19 would be to follow CDC guidelines and  quarantine for everyone's safety, but this is not the case. In the same  breath with which they announced that Vice President Pence was exposed,  the White House said that he would keep on campaigning, comparing  campaigning work to the work that doctors, nurses, firefighters, and  police officers do. It is a puzzling claim, especially since the Vice  President failed at the most important official duty in his portfolio-- the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Not only has the White House  Coronavirus Task Force failed to keep the American people safe; it has  even failed to keep the White House safe.   Even worse, the Vice President reportedly intends to come to this  Chamber tomorrow to preside over Judge Barrett's confirmation vote. The  Vice President, who has been exposed to five people with COVID-19, will  ignore CDC guidelines to be here tomorrow, putting the health of  everyone who works in this building at risk. It sets a terrible,  terrible example for the American people, and nothing could be a more  apt metaphor for what is going on here.   The Republican Party is willing to ignore the pandemic to rush this  Supreme Court nomination forward, and the Vice President, after being  potentially exposed to COVID, will preside.   The Senate Republicans are willing to ignore the need for economic  relief. They are willing to ignore the Nation's testing needs. They are  willing to ignore election interference--all so they can put someone on  the highest Court who could take healthcare away from millions of  Americans in the middle of a pandemic. God save us.   Now, only a few hours after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away,  Leader McConnell announced that the Republican majority would move  quickly to confirm her replacement. At the time, we didn't know exactly  when, but now we do. Republicans are rushing to hold a confirmation  vote tomorrow night, 8 days--8 days--before the election, after more  than 50 million Americans have voted for a President--quite possibly, a  different President--to pick Justices on their behalf; after more than  50 million Americans have voted for Senators--quite possibly, different  Senators than some who are here today--to advise and consent.   Confirming a lifetime appointment this late into a Presidential  election season is outrageous. It is even more galling, of course,  because nearly every Republican in this Chamber, led by the majority  leader 4 years ago, refused to even consider the Supreme Court  nomination of a Democratic President on the grounds of the principle-- the principle--that we should wait until after the Presidential  election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection  of their next Justice.   My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said  before, no tit for tat, convoluted, distorted version of history will  wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican  majority and with this Republican leader. No escaping the hypocrisy,  but, oh my, how the Republican leader has almost desperately tried.   Over the past few days and weeks, the majority leader has subjected  the Senate to a long and tortured defense of this cynical power grab.  The Republican leader claims the majority's position all along has been  that it is acceptable to deny Justices in Presidential election years  when there is divided government.   But here is what Leader McConnell said after Justice Scalia died:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new President.    He didn't say: The American people should have a voice, but only when  there's a divided government.   He didn't say: The American people deserve a voice, but only when it  serves the political interests of one party, otherwise, we don't mean  it.   No, Republicans all swore this was a ``principle''--their word--not a  mere incident of who controls the Senate  [[Page S6452]]  and the Presidency. And the transparency of this new excuse does not  cover up the hypocrisy. It does not change it one bit, and everyone  knows it--everyone.   And, by the way, if this were about divided government, the senior  Senator from Florida would not have said he would ``say the same thing  if a Republican President were in office.''   The junior Senator from Iowa would not have said:         Precedent set, precedent set. I'm sure come 2020, you'll       remind me of that.    Chairman Graham would not have said:         Hold the tape! Use my words against me! You can say Lindsey       Graham said the next president, whoever it might be--    Whoever it might be, not whatever party it is in--       should make the nomination.    So the flimsiness, the transparency, the dishonesty of the excuse  that they have come up with ex post facto doesn't work. It doesn't  work.   No, this has never been about the orientation of the Senate and the  Presidency. Republicans promised they would follow their own standard  if the situation were reversed--guess not.   Now, the Republican leader claims that the majority's actions today  are rooted in some convoluted precedent. The truth is, the precedent is  clear and similar. The Senate has never--never--confirmed a Supreme  Court Justice so close to a Presidential election. The Senate has never  even confirmed a Justice between July and election day in a  Presidential year. I asked the Presiding Officer to confirm these two  facts, and both were confirmed by the records of the Senate. There is  no precedent--none--for what is going on here.   The Republican leader has claimed that the majority's actions are  justified by all sorts of bad things Democrats did in the past and may  hypothetically do in the future. He said that every escalation of  significance in judicial debates was made by Democrats. Convenient, I  guess. I guess ``significance'' is in the eye of the beholder, because  the Republican leader's history conveniently, and mandatorily to make  his case--his false case--left out a whole lot of chapters--ignored.   He conveniently omitted that Republicans bottled up more than 60  judicial nominees from President Clinton, refusing to give them a  hearing in the 1990s. He made no reference to the decision by  Republican Senators to hold open 14 appellate court seats under  President Clinton so that a Republican President could fill them  instead--a tactic Republicans would revisit under President Obama, when  Republicans used partisan filibusters to block his nominees to the DC  Circuit.   At the time, the Republican leader and Senators from Iowa and Utah  said that President Obama was--get this--trying to ``pack the court.''  Amazing. Pack the court? They held up the nomination so President Obama  couldn't have his rightful appointees to the second highest court in  the land. And they kept a number of seats--I believe it was four-- vacant for such a long time.    Well, we have heard all of this before. It seems whenever the  Republicans need to scare up some votes, they accuse Democrats of  trying to pack the courts, even when it is a Democratic President  invoking his constitutional authority to appoint judges and the  Republicans are blocking it.   Republicans tried to nullify President Obama's authority to nominate  judges to the circuit court, and then, as soon as Republicans had a  majority, they succeeded in nullifying his prerogative to have a  Supreme Court nomination considered by the Senate. And what did Leader  McConnell say about it? This remark will go down in infamy. He called  it ``one of his proudest moments.''   Apparently, the blame game that Leader McConnell wants us to play  goes all the way back to 1987. That is the reason we are so  hypocritical--what happened back in 1987, says the Republican leader.  It all began with Robert Bork, he says, after Senator Kennedy gave a 3- minute speech that Republicans considered intemperate. Seriously, that  is, according to our Republican friends, the original sin, according to  the leader--a 3-minute speech.   While we are on the subject of Robert Bork, I would remind my  colleagues that Robert Bork received a hearing and a vote in the  Democratic Senate. His nomination was defeated by a bipartisan majority  of Republicans and Democrats. Republicans helped defeat Bork--left out  conveniently by the leader's recantation of history. His nomination was  defeated and President Reagan's eventual replacement, Anthony Kennedy,  was confirmed unanimously.   For those keeping score, Merrick Garland never even got a hearing.   But because one Democrat gave a speech Republicans didn't like, the  fight was on, according to the Republican leader. According to the  Republican leader, because of that 3-minute speech in 1987, Republicans  can steamroll the minority to confirm a Supreme Court Justice in the  middle of an election.   Imagine trying to explain to someone: Sorry, I have to burn down your  house because of something one of your friends said about one of my  friends 33 years ago. Yes, burn down the house because of a comment 33  years ago--that is what they are doing.   The leader's speech--the Republican leader's speech--was schoolyard  stuff. Here in the U.S. Senate, in order to justify an outrageous power  grab that even some Members of his party don't agree with, the leader's  argument boils down to ``But you started it.'' Any parent with young  children would recognize that argument. It is when you know you have  done something wrong but you don't want the blame. That is exactly what  the leader's speech sounded like to so many Americans.   Let's get serious here. This isn't about the long history of judicial  escalation or a 33-year-old speech. This is about raw political power.  This is about a Senate majority deciding to break faith with the  American people and make a mockery--a mockery--of its own principle to  secure a seat on the Supreme Court.   Let me dispense with one more fiction. The leader keeps claiming that  Supreme Court seats have nothing to do with power or ideology. Judges  and justices only apply the law, they claim. They only call balls and  strikes. My Republican friends have told us over and over again that if  someone is qualified--has good, topnotch qualifications--they should be  confirmed because judges merely apply the law.   Well, if that were true, if Leader McConnell truly believed the only  thing that matters about a judicial candidate is his qualifications,  then Merrick Garland would be sitting on the Court right now. His  qualifications were every bit as good as Amy Coney Barrett's--every bit  as good.   So, all of a sudden, we should only judge by qualifications. I get  it. I get it. If it were true--once again, I will repeat it. If any of  my Republican friends believe that the only thing that matters is the  qualifications of a judicial candidate, Merrick Garland would be  Justice Merrick Garland now.   No one--and I mean no one--said that Judge Garland wasn't qualified.  But Republicans subjected his nomination to an unprecedented partisan  blockade. If qualifications are the only thing that matter, why did  President Trump vow to pick only Justices who would terminate our  healthcare law? Why did he say that his judicial appointments would  ``do the right thing'' on healthcare, ``unlike Justice Roberts''? Why  did President Trump say that if he gets to appoint two or three  Justices to the Supreme Court, Roe v. Wade would be overturned  automatically? That is not qualifications.   President Trump doesn't have a problem talking about how judicial  appointments might rule when he is trying to win an election, but,  apparently, Democrats are, in the words of the leader, ``hysterical''  for even questioning how Judge Barrett looks at hugely consequential  issues.   I want the American people to know: The far right is lining up, right  now, to get the Supreme Court to review your fundamental rights because  they think Judge Barrett might provide a certain outcome. President  Trump and Republican attorneys general are suing to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act in a case that will be heard one week after the  election.   Three days ago, the President of the United States said on tape: ``I  hope that they will end it. It'll be so good if they'' did.   Republicans in Pennsylvania have just appealed a split decision by  the  [[Page S6453]]  current Supreme Court that prevented an early cutoff to counting  ballots. Just one vote on the Court could change the outcome.   The attorney general of Mississippi, this week, filed a brief asking  the Supreme Court to review a Mississippi law banning abortions after  15 weeks--an invitation for a new configuration on the Court to revisit  Roe v. Wade.   So don't tell me the issues don't matter, only qualifications. We are  talking about the lives and freedoms of the American people: the right  to affordable healthcare, to make their own private medical decisions,  to join a union, to vote without impediments, to marry whom they love.  And Judge Amy Coney Barrett will play a part in deciding whether those  rights will be sustained or curtailed for the next generation of  Americans.   I want to be very clear with the American people about what is going  on here. The Republican Senate majority, America, is breaking faith  with you--doing the exact opposite of what it promised just 4 years  ago--to cement a majority on the Supreme Court that threatens your  fundamental rights.   Don't forget it, America. Don't forget what is happening here because  it is a travesty--a travesty. It is a travesty for the Senate, a  travesty for the country, and it will be an unerasable stain on this  Republican majority forever more.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield 1 hour of my remaining  postcloture time to Senator Murphy.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as we speak, over 60 million Americans  have voted. The Republican majority is ignoring--even laughing--at  their wishes.   Despite what the American people want and whom they will vote for,  this Republican majority is ramming this nomination through only  because they can. Might makes right, in their view. That is so wrong.  That is so against the American principle of democracy and rule of law.   So I will move to adjourn so that we consider this nomination after  the election that is now ongoing--not before it, not 8 days before it.   Therefore, Mr. President, I move to adjourn and to then convene for  pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted, at 12 noon  on the following dates and that, following each pro forma session, the  Senate adjourn  [[Page S6578]]  until the next pro forma session: Tuesday, October 27; Friday, October  30; Tuesday, November 3; Friday, November 6; further, that if there is  an agreement on legislation in relation to the COVID pandemic, the  Senate may convene under the authority of S. Res. 296 of the 108th  Congress; finally, that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, November 6,  it next convene at 4:30 p.m., Monday, November 9, and that following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed.    I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. President, today, Monday, October 26, 2020, will go  down as one of the darkest days in the 231-year history of the U.S.  Senate.   Let the record show that tonight the Republican Senate majority  decided to thwart the will of the people and confirm a lifetime  appointment to the Supreme Court in the middle of a Presidential  election, after more than 60 million Americans have voted.   Let the record show that tonight the Republican majority will break  231 years of precedent and become the first majority to confirm a  Supreme Court Justice this close to election day.   Let the record show that tonight the Republican majority will make a  mockery of its own stated principle that the American people deserve a  voice in the selection of Supreme Court Justices, completing the  partisan theft of two seats on the Supreme Court using completely  contradictory rationales.   And let the record show that the American people--their lives and  rights and freedoms--will suffer the consequences of this nomination  for a generation.   This entire debate can be summed up in three lies propagated by the  Republican majority and one great terrible truth. The first lie is that  the Republican majority is being consistent in following its own  standard--what rubbish. After refusing a Democratic nominee to the  Supreme Court because an election was 8 months away, they will confirm  a Republican nominee before an election that is 8 days away.   What is Leader McConnell's excuse? He claims that the principle of  not confirming Justices in Presidential years only applies when there  is divided government. But this is what Leader McConnell said after  Justice Scalia died: ``The American people should have a voice in the  selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.''   That is all he said. He didn't say that the American people should  have a voice but only when there is divided government. No, the last  bit is ex post facto   If this were really about divided government all along, Republican  Senators would not have promised on the record to follow their own  standard if the situation was reversed. ``I want you to use my words  against me,'' said the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ``If there  is a Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year  of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, let the next  president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.''   So the claim by the leader that this is consistent with their own  principle--please. Rather than accept the consequences of its own words  and deeds, the Republican majority is lighting its credibility on fire.   This hypocritical, 180-degree turn, is spectacularly obvious to the  American people.   The second lie is that the Republican majority is justified because  of Democratic actions on judicial nominations in the past. The  Republican leader claims that his majority's actions are justified by  all the bad things Democrats did years ago. He claims that every  escalation of significance in judicial debates was made by Democrats.  But in his tortured, convoluted history lesson, Leader McConnell left  out a whole bunch of chapters. He omitted that Republicans bottled up  more than 60 judicial nominees by President Clinton, refusing them even  a hearing.   He made no reference to the decision by Republican Senators to hold  open 14 appellate court seats in the 1990s so that a Republican  President could fill them. Instead, a tactic Republicans would revisit  under President Obama, when Republicans used partisan filibusters to  block his nominees to the DC  [[Page S6585]]  Circuit, at the time, Republican Senators, including my colleague from  Kentucky, amazingly accused President Obama of trying to pack the court  by the mere act of nominating judges to vacancies of the Second  Circuit. What a hypocritical double standard, which appears to be  endemic in Leader McConnell's recounting of history.   And on top of it all, the leader has asked the Senate to play a blame  game that dates all the way back to 1987, pointing to a 3-minute speech  by Senator Kennedy about Robert Bork as the original sin in the  judicial wars. Seriously, that is what he said. Because one Democrat  give one 3-minute speech that Republicans didn't like, Leader McConnell  can steamroll the minority to confirm a Justice in the middle of an  election.   Imagine trying to explain to someone: Sorry, I have to burn down your  house because of something one of your friends said about one of my  friends 33 years ago. That is how absurd and obnoxious this game has  gotten. That is how unjustifiable the majority's actions are, how  flimsy their excuses have become.   The leader's final argument boils down to: But you started it--a  declaration you would sooner hear in the schoolyard than on the floor  of the U.S. Senate.   The third and perhaps the greatest lie is that the Republican  majority is confirming Judge Barrett solely on the basis of her  qualifications, not based on her views on the issues. My colleagues  insist that Judge Barrett should be confirmed on her credentials alone.  That is all they talk about. They don't talk about her views on the  issues, only qualifications. Well, this canard is about as apparent as  a glass door. Everyone can see right through it.   What is the real reason Republicans are so desperate to rush Judge  Barrett onto the Supreme Court? Of course, it is not because of her  qualifications. If my Republican friends truly believed that the only  thing that mattered about a judicial candidate is their qualifications,  then Merrick Garland would be sitting on the Supreme Court right now.   If the Republican leader truly believed that judicial appointments  were about qualifications, and qualifications alone, Judge Garland  would be Justice Garland right now.   Judge Garland was among the most qualified candidates ever--ever--to  be nominated to the Supreme Court. No Republican Senator has disputed  that. But they didn't want Judge Garland on the Bench. They do want  Judge Barrett. They subjected Judge Garland to an unprecedented  partisan blockade, but they are erecting a monument to hypocrisy to  rush Judge Barrett on the bench.   Why? It is not because she is more qualified than Judge Garland was.  What is the difference between Barrett and Garland? The difference is  not qualifications but views. We know that. We all know that.  Healthcare, a woman's rights, a woman's right to choose, gun safety-- you name it. It is not because the far right wants Judge Barrett's  views on the Court, but it is because the far right wants Judge  Barrett's views on the Court but not Judge Garland's.   The truth is, this nomination is part of a decades-long effort to  tilt the judiciary to the far right, to accomplish through the courts  what the radical right and their allies--Senate Republicans--could  never accomplish through Congress.   Senate Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, so  President Trump and Republican attorneys general are suing to eliminate  the law in court.   Republicans would never dare to attempt to repeal Roe v. Wade in  Congress. So they pass onerous laws in State legislatures that they  control to drive that right to the point of near extinction and then  provoke the Supreme Court to review Roe v. Wade.   The far right has never held the majority on the court to limit Roe  v. Wade or Griswold, but if Judge Barrett becomes Justice Barrett, it  very well might.   And if you are looking for some hard numbers to prove that the  political right considers ideology and not just qualifications,  consider this. Under Justice Roberts, there have been 80 cases--80-- decided by a 5-to-4 majority, in which the five Justices nominated by  Republican Presidents came down one side and the four Justices  nominated by Democratic Presidents came down on the other. Eighty  cases--exactly the same majority--calling balls and strikes. And in an  amazing coincidence, all the Republican-nominated Justices think it is  a strike and all the Democratic ones think it is a ball, or vice versa.  It would be the most remarkable coincidence in the history of  mathematics if nine Justices, simply calling balls and strikes,  exhibited the same split in the exact same configuration 80 times.   We all know what the game is here. So stop pretending. Stop  pretending there aren't entire organizations dedicated to advancing  far-right judges. Stop pretending that the political right doesn't  spend millions of dollars to prop up the far-right Federalist Society  and support certain judicial candidates because they only want  ``qualified'' judges. No, they want to systematically and permanently  tilt the courts to the far right.   So does Judge Barrett have views on legal issues? You bet she does.  That brings me to the one great and terrible truth about this  nomination. The American people will suffer the consequences of Judge  Barrett's far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.   Judge Barrett came before the Judiciary Committee and refused to  answer nearly any question of substance. That is the new game at the  hearings. She would not answer questions about healthcare. She would  not say whether voter intimidation is illegal. She would not say if she  thought Medicare and Social Security were unconstitutional. She could  not even offer platitudes in responses to questions about the peaceful  transfer of power, and refused to say if climate change was real.   It is not because Judge Barrett isn't allowed to answer these  questions. It is because she knows how unfavorable her views on the  issues might sound to the American people.   But the thing is, we do know how Judge Barrett thinks. She views  certain rights, like the right to privacy, through a pinhole. She was  closely affiliated with organizations who advocated the outright repeal  of Roe v. Wade.   But she views other rights, like the right to keep and bear arms, as  almost infinitely expansive. She once authored a dissent arguing the  Federal Government does not have the authority to ban all felons-- felons--from owning guns.   Only a few hours ago, the Republican Senator from Missouri proudly  declared from the Senate floor that Judge Barrett is the most openly  pro-life judicial nominee to the Supreme Court in his lifetime: ``This  is an individual,'' he said of Judge Barrett, ``who has been open in  her criticism of that illegitimate decision, Roe v. Wade.'' He was  being more honest than most of the talk around here, which says it is  only about qualifications.   Judge Barrett has proudly fashioned herself in the mold of her  mentor, Justice Scalia, who, before his death, appeared set to declare  union fees to be unconstitutional, driving a stake into the heart of  the American labor movement. While American workers break their backs  to make ends meet and earn ever less of ever growing corporate profits,  what might Justice Scalia's former clerk portend for the future of  labor rights?   What about voting rights? Judge Barrett has suggested that certain  rights are civic rights, including voting rights, and can be restrained  by the government, but other rights, like the right to keep and bear  arms, are individual rights that cannot be subject to even the most  commonsense restrictions.   And, of course, what about healthcare? Judge Barrett has argued that  Justice Roberts got it wrong when he upheld the Affordable Care Act.  She said that, if Justice Roberts read the statute properly, the  Supreme Court would have had to invalidate--her words--the law.   That is the same thing, by the way, that Donald Trump said about  Justice Roberts and the ACA. That is the great and terrible truth about  this nomination.   Judge Barrett holds far-right views, well outside the American  mainstream, and those views matter to the vast majority of Americans.  They matter to  [[Page S6586]]  women facing the hardest decision of their lives. They matter to LGBTQ  Americans like my daughter, who only 5 years ago won the legal right to  marry who she loves and could lose it just as fast. They matter to  little girls like 7-year-old Penny Fyman from West Hempstead, Long  Island, born with a neurological disorder, bound to a wheelchair,  attached to a feeding tube, who is alive today--alive today--because of  the Affordable Care Act.   We are talking about the rights and freedoms of the American people:  their right to affordable healthcare, to make private medical decisions  with their doctors, to join a union, to vote without impediment, to  marry whom they love and not be fired because of who they are.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett will decide whether all of those rights will  be sustained or be curtailed for generations. And, based on her views  on the issues--not on her qualifications but her views on the issues-- Judge Barrett puts every single one of those fundamental rights-- American rights--at risk.   So I want to be clear with the American people. The Senate majority,  this Republican Senate majority, is breaking faith with you, doing the  exact opposite of what it promised 4 years ago, because they wish to  cement a majority on the Supreme Court that threatens your fundamental  rights.   And I want to be very clear with my Republican colleagues. You may  win this vote, and Amy Coney Barrett may become the next Associate  Justice of the Supreme Court, but you will never, never get your  credibility back. And the next time the American people give Democrats  a majority in this Chamber, you will have forfeited the right to tell  us how to run that majority.   You may win this vote, but in the process you will speed the  precipitous decline of faith in our institution, our politics, the  Senate, and the Supreme Court. You will give an already divided and  angry Nation a fresh outrage, an open wound in this Chamber that will  take a very long time to heal. You walk a perilous road.   I know you think that this will eventually blow over, but you are  wrong. The American people will never forget this blatant act of bad  faith. They will never forget your complete disregard for their voices,  for the people standing in line right now and voting their choice, not  your choice. They will never forget the lack of consistency, honor,  decency, fairness, and principle.   They will never forget the rights that are limited, constrained, or  taken away by a far-right majority on the Supreme Court, and history  will record that, by brute political force, in contradiction to its  stated principles, this Republican majority confirmed a lifetime  appointment on the eve of an election, a Justice who will alter the  lives and freedoms of the American people, while they stood in line to  vote.   Leader McConnell has lectured the Senate before on the consequences  of a majority's action. ``You'll regret this,'' he told Democrats once,  ``and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.'' Listen to those  words: ``You'll regret this, and you may regret it a lot sooner than  you think.''   I would change just one word. My colleagues may regret this for a lot  longer than they think.   Here, at this late hour, at the end of this sordid chapter in the  history of the Senate, the history of the Supreme Court, my deepest and  greatest sadness is for the American people. Generations yet unborn  will suffer the consequences of this nomination. As the globe gets  warmer, as workers continue to fall behind, as unlimited dark money  floods our politics, as reactionary State legislatures curtail a  woman's right to choose, gerrymander districts, and limit the rights of  minorities to vote, my deepest, greatest, and most abiding sadness  tonight is for the American people and what this nomination will mean  for their lives, their freedoms, their fundamental rights.   Monday, October 26, 2020--it will go down as one of the darkest days  in the 231-year history of the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A quorum is present.   All postcloture time has expired.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination  of Amy Coney Barrett, of Indiana, to be Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States?
