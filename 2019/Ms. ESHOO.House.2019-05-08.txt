 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1520) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the  publication of a list of licensed biological products, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1520         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Purple Book Continuity Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PUBLIC LISTING.         Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       262(k)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(9) Public listing.--        ``(A) In general.--        ``(i) Initial publication.--Not later than 180 days after       the date of enactment of the Purple Book Continuity Act of       2019, the Secretary shall publish and make available to the       public in a searchable, electronic format--         ``(I) a list in alphabetical order of the nonproprietary or       proper name of each biological product for which a biologics       license under subsection (a) or this subsection is in effect,       or that has been deemed to be licensed under this section       pursuant to section 7002(e)(4) of the Biologics Price       Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, as of such date of       enactment;        ``(II) the date of approval of the marketing application       and the application number; and        ``(III) the marketing or licensure status of the biological       product for which a biologics license under subsection (a) or       this subsection is in effect or that has been deemed to be       licensed under this section pursuant to section 7002(e)(4) of       the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.         ``(ii) Revisions.--Every 30 days after the publication of       the first list under clause (i), the Secretary shall revise       the list to include each biological product which has been       licensed under subsection (a) or this subsection during the       30-day period.        ``(iii) Patent information.--Not later than 30 days after a       list of patents under subsection (l)(3)(A), or a supplement       to such list under subsection (l)(7), has been provided by       the reference product sponsor to the subsection (k) applicant       respecting a biological product included on the list       published under this subparagraph, the reference product       sponsor shall provide such list of patents (or supplement       thereto) and their corresponding expiry dates to the       Secretary, and the Secretary shall, in revisions made under       clause (ii), include such information for such biological       product. Within 30 days of providing any subsequent or       supplemental list of patents to any subsequent subsection (k)       applicant under subsection (l)(3)(A) or (l)(7), the reference       product sponsor shall update the information provided to the       Secretary under this clause with any additional patents from       such subsequent or supplemental list and their corresponding       expiry dates.        ``(iv) Listing of exclusivities.--For each biological       product included on the list published under this       subparagraph, the Secretary shall specify each exclusivity       period that is applicable and has not concluded under       paragraph (6) or paragraph (7).        ``(B) Withdrawal or suspension of licensure.--If the       licensing of a biological product was withdrawn or suspended       for safety, purity, or potency reasons, it may not be       published in the list under subparagraph (A). If the       withdrawal or suspension occurred after its publication in       such list, the reference product sponsor shall notify the       Secretary that--        ``(i) the biological product shall be immediately removed       from such list--         ``(I) for the same period as the withdrawal or suspension;       or        ``(II) if the biological product has been withdrawn from       sale, for the period of withdrawal from sale or, if earlier,       the period ending on the date the Secretary determines that       the withdrawal from sale is not for safety, purity, or       potency reasons; and         ``(ii) a notice of the removal shall be published in the       Federal Register.''.       SEC. 3. REVIEW AND REPORT ON TYPES OF INFORMATION TO BE                     LISTED.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--        (1) solicit public comment regarding the type of       information, if any, that should be added to or removed from       the list required by paragraph (9) of section 351(k) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as added by       section 2; and  [[Page H3486]]         (2) transmit to Congress an evaluation of such comments,       including any recommendations about the types of information       that should be added to or removed from the list.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1520.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1520, the Purple Book  Continuity Act of 2019. I am proud that my bipartisan legislation is  being considered because it makes important updates and improvements to  the Food and Drug Administration's Purple Book.   I am also pleased that it is the first drug pricing bill to be  considered by the full House this Congress. The legislation makes it  easier for manufacturers to research and develop biosimilars, which are  essentially generic biological products, and drive down prescription  drug prices for the American people.   The so-called ``Purple Book'' lists biological products, including  biosimilars, that are licensed by the FDA. The Purple Book is a  resource published by the FDA that includes very important information  about existing products, about including designations that extend the  product's exclusivity, and what active patents each product has.   Today, the FDA is not statutorily required to publish this  information, nor is the agency required to update the resource in a  timely manner. The Purple Book also is not currently user-friendly and  is burdensome for companies to access and use. Companies rely on the  Purple Book to inform their research and development activities, and it  is imperative that the resource is up-to-date and easily accessible, so  they can move quickly to produce cost-saving biosimilar drugs which  are, essentially, as I said previously, generic versions of the most  complex, high-cost biological products.   The Purple Book Continuity Act builds on previous work to promote the  development of biosimilars and other alternatives to the highest-priced  biologic products by putting necessary patent information into an  easily accessible resource so companies can more efficiently and  effectively direct their work to develop biosimilars.   The Purple Book Continuity Act takes an important step to make it  easier for the manufacturers to access patent and exclusivity  information they need to invest in biosimilar development so that drug  prices--the whole point is so that drug prices can be lowered for the  American people.   So the Purple Book Continuity Act passed the Energy and Commerce  Committee by voice vote last month and, today, I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1503) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding  the list under section 505(j)(7) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1503         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Orange Book Transparency Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. ORANGE BOOK.         (a) Submission of Patent Information for Brand Name       Drugs.--Paragraph (1) of section 505(b) of the Federal Food,       Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)) is amended to read       as follows:        ``(b)(1) Any person may file with the Secretary an       application with respect to any drug subject to the       provisions of subsection (a). Such persons shall submit to       the Secretary as part of the application--        ``(A) full reports of investigations which have been made       to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether       such drug is effective in use;        ``(B) a full list of the articles used as components of       such drug;        ``(C) a full statement of the composition of such drug;        ``(D) a full description of the methods used in, and the       facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,       processing, and packing of such drug;        ``(E) such samples of such drug and of the articles used as       components thereof as the Secretary may require;        ``(F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for       such drug;        ``(G) any assessments required under section 505B; and        ``(H) patent information, with respect to each patent for       which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be       asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the       manufacture, use, or sale of the drug, and consistent with       the following requirements:        ``(i) The applicant shall file with the application the       patent number and the expiration date of--        ``(I) any patent which claims the drug for which the       applicant submitted the application and is a drug substance       (including active ingredient) patent or a drug product       (including formulation and composition) patent; and  [[Page H3487]]         ``(II) any patent which claims the method of using such       drug.        ``(ii) If an application is filed under this subsection for       a drug and a patent of the type described in clause (i) which       claims such drug or a method of using such drug is issued       after the filing date but before approval of the application,       the applicant shall amend the application to include such       patent information.       Upon approval of the application, the Secretary shall publish       the information submitted under subparagraph (H). The       Secretary shall, in consultation with the Director of the       National Institutes of Health and with representatives of the       drug manufacturing industry, review and develop guidance, as       appropriate, on the inclusion of women and minorities in       clinical trials required by subparagraph (A).''.        (b) Conforming Changes to Requirements for Subsequent       Submission of Patent Information.--Section 505(c)(2) of the       Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(7)) is       amended--        (1) by inserting after ``the patent number and the       expiration date of any patent which'' the following:       ``fulfills the criteria in subsection (b) and'';        (2) by inserting after the first sentence the following:       ``Patent information that is not the type of patent       information required by subsection (b) shall not be       submitted.''; and        (3) by inserting after ``could not file patent information       under subsection (b) because no patent'' the following: ``of       the type required to be submitted in subsection (b)''.        (c) Listing of Exclusivities.--Subparagraph (A) of section       505(j)(7) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21       U.S.C. 355(j)(7)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(iv) For each drug included on the list, the Secretary       shall specify each exclusivity period that is applicable and       has not concluded under--        ``(I) clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subsection (c)(3)(E)       of this section;        ``(II) clause (iv) or (v) of paragraph (5)(B) of this       subsection;        ``(III) clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of paragraph (5)(F) of       this subsection;        ``(IV) section 505A;        ``(V) section 505E; or        ``(VI) section 527(a).''.

(2) Applicability.--Subparagraph (D) of section 505(j)(7)       of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.       355(j)(7)), as added by paragraph (1), applies only with       respect to a decision described in such subparagraph that is       issued on or after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 3. GAO REPORT TO CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United       States (referred to in this section as the ``Comptroller       General'') shall submit to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the       patents included in the list published under section       505(j)(7) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21       U.S.C. 355(j)(7)), including an analysis and evaluation of       the types of patents included in such list and the claims       such patents make about the products they claim.        (b) Contents.--The Comptroller General shall include in the       report under subsection (a)--        (1) data on the number of--        (A) patents included in the list published under paragraph       (7) of section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic       Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)), that claim the active ingredient or       formulation of a drug in combination with a device that is       used for delivery of the drug, together comprising the       finished dosage form of the drug; and        (B) claims in each patent that claim a device that is used       for the delivery of the drug, but do not claim such device in       combination with an active ingredient or formulation of a       drug;        (2) data on the date of inclusion in the list under       paragraph (7) of such section 505(j) for all patents under       such list, as compared to patents that claim a method of       using the drug in combination with a device;        (3) an analysis regarding the impact of including on the       list under paragraph (7) of such section 505(j) certain types       of patent information for drug product applicants and       approved application holders, including an analysis of       whether--        (A) the listing of the patents described in paragraph       (1)(A) delayed the market entry of one or more drugs approved       under such section 505(j); and        (B) not listing the patents described in paragraph (1)(A)       would delay the market entry of one or more such drugs; and        (4) recommendations about which kinds of patents relating       to devices described in paragraph (1)(A) should be submitted       to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for inclusion       on the list under paragraph (7) of such section 505(j) and       which patents should not be required to be so submitted.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1503.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1503. This is a different  color book. It is the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2019, sponsored  by the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. Her  bipartisan legislation makes important updates to the Food and Drug  Administration's Orange Book to ensure that this resource is accurate  and up-to-date to promote the development of generic drugs that save so  many Americans so much money.   When it passed in 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term  Restoration Act, also referred to as Hatch-Waxman, created the Orange  Book as a resource for drug manufacturers to reference when deciding  when and how to seek approval for new drug products. The so-called  ``Orange Book'' contains valuable information, is regularly referenced  by manufacturers, and is published in a user-friendly way on FDA's  website.   But this resource has not been updated since it was created in 1994.  That is a long time ago. It is over 3 decades ago. And the Orange Book  Transparency Act of 2019 makes important updates to the resource to  adapt to the changes in drug development since Hatch-Waxman became law.   Generic drug manufacturers rely heavily on the Orange Book, and it is  imperative that this resource is accurate and up-to-date so drug  manufacturers can invest in products that promote competition and lower  drug prices for the American people.   The Orange Book Transparency Act of 2019 passed the Energy and  Commerce Committee by voice vote last month, and I was proud to support  it. I urge my colleagues to support the Orange Book Transparency Act of  2019 today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly), the author of H.R. 1503 and a wonderful member of  the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to support  this bipartisan legislation that is going to move us closer to our  overall goal of lowering the cost of prescription drugs for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
