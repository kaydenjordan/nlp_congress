 Mr. President, in April, Border Patrol agents  encountered an unaccompanied 2-year-old boy at the southern border of  Texas. Let me read you part of what the Customs and Border Protection  released:         The boy, a Honduran national, who had lost his shoe in the       mud while crossing, was traveling within a group of 38       individuals. Agents questioned the group to obtain any       information on the boy--however, no one claimed to know the       child.    In 2022, CBP arrested at least six dozen convicted violent sex  offenders--many of them child sex abusers--according to media releases.  Vulnerable, unaccompanied children, as well as young women traveling  alone, draw criminals like these to our country. They want to take  advantage of the chaos overwhelming our border.   Our border has become a hotbed of criminal activity, especially of  trafficking helpless women and children.   Last month, I came before you to address the deadly effects of drug  trafficking across our border on American citizens. But the out-of- control situation at our border puts migrants in danger too. The effect  of these numbers on children is just heartbreaking.   And 2022 beat the record for the number of unaccompanied migrant  children encountered by Border Patrol, an overwhelming 152,057. The  State Department reported this year that child sex tourism is expanding  in the border cities of Mexico.   The Biden administration claims that its laissez-faire border  policies stem from valuing immigrants, but the choices it has made have  worsened conditions for those trying to migrate to the United States.   On his first day in office, President Biden ended the national  emergency declaration at the border, halted construction on the border  wall, and scaled back ICE enforcement. The very next month, the  President canceled the Trump administration's asylum procedures, a move  that aggravated the rush at the border. President Biden reinstated  wide-scale catch-and-release practices, requiring border officials to  release unprocessed migrants into our country while they await court  hearings.   Since President Biden's inauguration, 4.5 million people have arrived  at our border. Last week, the President of the National Border Patrol  Council told me he estimates that 7 million more migrants will arrive  by the time Biden's term ends.   Folks, that would mean a total of 11 million migrant encounters  during the Biden administration. That number is larger than the  population of 43 of the States in our Union.   Despite the damage that the President has done at the border, he  dedicated a total of 1 minute out of last week's 75-minute State of the  Union Address to discussing immigration--1 minute. President Biden  didn't even present any substantive solutions to our border problems.    This administration is unable to manage the surges of immigrants it  has welcomed to our border, so the President has cut corners left and  right. Biden officials have weakened vital safety measures, including  waiving certain background check requirements for the adult sponsors of  unaccompanied migrant children. People entrusted with the care of  unaccompanied children no longer have to undergo public record and sex  offender registry checks, all in the interest of moving migrants into  our country and out of Federal custody more quickly. The Department of  Health and Human Services also has no way to track these children or  ensure their well-being after they are placed with sponsors. The  President's indifference to border safety and security means that  abusers and traffickers have easy access to helpless kids.   From the very beginning, President Biden's campaign promises to  loosen border security rallied waves of migrants to make that  treacherous trip north. Biden promised hope, but let's be clear--the  reality is that this journey is one of suffering, whether it is forced  labor, sex trafficking, or death. It has encouraged more criminals to  take advantage of that frenzy.   The Biden administration has yet to resecure the border, and it has  yet to form a serious plan to remedy the problems it has created. It  has taken 2 full years for the administration to produce what I think  is a silly smartphone app, funded by your taxpayer dollars, to  [[Page S442]]  help migrants schedule their crossing times--schedule their crossing  times. That is barely a bandaid for the massive gash that is our  southern border.   But while the President ignores this humanitarian crisis, my  colleagues and I want to fix it. We can address the disaster at the  border by providing our dedicated Border Patrol agents with more  resources and more time to process migrants, equipping them to do their  jobs thoroughly. We need to put up barriers against sex trafficking and  drug trafficking by ending catch-and-release and imposing penalties on  those who skip out on their immigration hearings.   President Biden called on us as a nation last week to embrace  civility over chaos. He should take his own advice and help us to  stabilize the chaos at the border. The administration must finally open  its eyes to this border crisis, and the Senate must implement real,  lasting solutions for the sake of migrants, for the sake of legal  immigrants, and for the sake of American citizens.   As I have said before, we are a nation of immigrants, but we are also  a nation of laws. Failure to enforce them doesn't help anyone. Well, it  doesn't help anyone except predators looking for a chance to manipulate  the chaos. Security will benefit those on both sides of our border.   I yield the floor.
