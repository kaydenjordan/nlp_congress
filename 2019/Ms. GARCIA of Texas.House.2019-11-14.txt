 Mr. Chair, first, I thank the gentlewoman from  California, and my chairwoman, for her leadership in bringing this  incredibly important bill to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of the Ex-Im Bank.   Mr. Chair, the Bank provides targeted credit and export support to  our small businesses that need it most to stay competitive. We know  that the Bank's programs work, and we should not abandon them.   I fully support the reauthorization. The Ex-Im Bank plays an  irreplaceable role in promoting American exports and keeping small  businesses competitive on the international market and helps in  creating jobs for America, some 352,000 jobs.   Since 2014, the Bank has provided over $450 million worth of export  support value in my district alone in the Houston area. Among the 53  total exporters supported in my district, 39--well over half--are small  businesses. In Texas, the Bank has supported $12 billion in exports and  815 exporters, including 470 small businesses.   Along with the reauthorization of this bill, it also includes an  Office of Women and Minority Inclusion. This is important because, in  my district alone, seven out of the 53 businesses are minority-owned  and four are female-owned.   Additionally, this bill includes commonsense environmental and  community engagement standards that seek to make sure the Bank is  helping meet our Paris climate accord commitments.   While these improvements to the Bank contained in the bill are  important, I don't want to take away from the bottom-line fact, and  that is it creates jobs.   This bill supports American manufacturers. This bill supports our  exporting sector. This bill helps reduce our trade deficit. That is why  I am calling on all of my colleagues to join me in passing this  critical legislation.
