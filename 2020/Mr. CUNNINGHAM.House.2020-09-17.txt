 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk  be authorized to produce a duplicate engrossment of H.R. 1812.    Mr. Speaker, good local journalism builds the  foundation of a strong community. In the Lowcountry, we are blessed  with some fantastic journalists, and I would like to highlight one of  them today: Quintin Washington.   Through his independent web series, called Quintin's Close Ups,  Quintin has kept his finger on the pulse of our community by doing  literally thousands of interviews with the Lowcountry's most  influential people. From Presidential candidates to Members of Congress  to business officials, you would be hard pressed to find an elected  official in South Carolina who has not sat down with Quintin on camera.   Mr. Speaker, Quintin doesn't do this for money or notoriety, but a  genuine love for our community and a desire to make sure that everyone  is informed. His interviews are invaluable to the Lowcountry, and we  are incredibly grateful for his service.   I know that I speak for everyone in the Lowcountry when I wish  Quintin Washington many more years of first-class journalism.                            ____________________
