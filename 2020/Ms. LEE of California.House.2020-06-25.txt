 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Bass for  yielding and for her visionary and tremendous leadership.   Let me say a couple of things about this bill.   First of all, finally, this bill, after generations, will begin to  end systemic racism in policing. Young people from all backgrounds are  demanding action and have said to the world that enough is enough.   As the mother and grandmother of Black men and boys, I had too many  painful conversations, as do all Black families, about what to do to  make sure their encounters with the police are not deadly.   The trauma around these fears are lifelong. This is not normal, but  for African American parents, sadly, it is.   The tragic murder of George Floyd and so many African Americans  around the country, including in my own district with Oscar Grant,  demand action. These tragic murders demand justice that this bill  provides, for example, by ending qualified immunity. No one is above  the law.   The world is watching today, Mr. Speaker. The United Nations passed a  resolution condemning the violent practices perpetrated by law  enforcement against people of African descent in the United States of  America. Let us show the rest of the world that we truly intend to live  up to our creed of liberty and justice for all and, yes, that means  also Black lives do matter.   I urge an ``aye'' vote.
