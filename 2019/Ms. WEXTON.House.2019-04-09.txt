 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which  would require the FCC to submit to Congress a plan for how the  Commission will evaluate and address problems with the collection on  form 477 of data regarding the deployment of broadband internet access  service.   Form 477 is used by the FCC to determine which providers are--if  any--providing services in various areas, and it is the government's  main source of data used for identifying underserved areas of  opportunity.   This amendment is needed because it has been more than 20 months--or  almost 2 years--since the FCC originally sought comment on ways to  improve the value of the data they collect through form 477.   Having better data and the creation of improved maps is essential to  ensuring that service providers and government have the tools that we  need to truly make universal broadband internet access a reality.   Too many residents of my district, and many other districts as well,  lack affordable or any broadband internet access. This untenable  situation is only made worse by maps and data charts that don't  accurately reflect this experience of our constituents on the ground.   Consumers should not bear the responsibility or burden of reporting  on an issue that the FCC and service providers should actively be  working to address.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, the American people deserve an internet and FCC that  works for them. By supporting this amendment and requesting an update  regarding form 477 and the data collected thereby from the FCC,  Congress can hold the FCC accountable in their mission to promote  competition, innovation, and most importantly, investment in broadband  services and facilities.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
