 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight National Recovery  Month.   The opioid crisis is deeply prevalent in upstate New York, and my  district is home to some of the highest overdose rates in the State.  Overdose deaths have increased by 83 percent from 2016 in my home  county, Dutchess.   Combating this crisis must include addressing the prevalence of  opioids, holding Big Pharma accountable, and treating addiction like  the disease that it is.   Earlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan Mainstreaming  Addiction Treatment Act.   This act does away with seeking special waivers as a requirement for  providers to prescribe buprenorphine, a proven treatment for addiction.  Making this medication more accessible will save lives and destigmatize  addiction so folks will see it for what it is: a disease that requires  treatment.   As we recognize National Recovery Month, let us honor those we have  lost with action on bipartisan legislation to help those suffering with  this disease.   Inaction costs us lives every day. Let's pass H.R. 2482.                            ____________________
