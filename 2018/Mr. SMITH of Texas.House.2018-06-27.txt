 Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman of the  Space Subcommittee for yielding me time, and I appreciate all that Mr.  Brooks, the gentleman from Alabama, has done for space exploration and  for spaceflight.   The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee has demonstrated  time and again that U.S. leadership in space is a bipartisan priority.  The scientists, engineers, and technicians at the Marshall Space Flight  Center in Huntsville, Alabama, have, for more than half a century, led  the world in the development of rocket propulsion.   H.R. 5345, the American Leadership in Space Technology and Advanced  Rocketry Act, recognizes the impressive accomplishments of Marshall as  well as vital, ongoing work they continue to do to ensure continued  American leadership in space technology and rocketry capabilities.   As our future in space looks bolder, bigger, and brighter, I am  confident that Marshall will continue to be a reliable, powerful, and  dependable team player in moving this Nation forward.   Mr. Speaker, Vice Chairman Brooks has always been a strong and  effective advocate for space initiatives and Marshall Space Flight  Center. I appreciate all he has done on the subject, and I very much  appreciate his being such a leader on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the longtime efforts of  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) to advance space initiatives.  His efforts are reflected in H.R. 5346, the Commercial Space Support  Vehicle Act, which he authored and brings to the floor today.   Maintaining and expanding America's leadership in human space  activity, especially in the commercial space sector, is a priority of  mine and of paramount importance to Mr. Posey and the members on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   The Commercial Space Support Vehicle Act was developed with input  from the Department of Transportation as a new and better approach to  streamline the licensing and permitting process of hybrid launch  vehicles.   Private companies would like to use space support vehicles to train  crews and spaceflight participants by exposing them to the  physiological effects and reduced gravity environment encountered in  spaceflight, and many spaceports would like to encourage those  companies to operate out of their facilities.   H.R. 5346 provides the fairest, most appropriate regulatory approach  by authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to develop regulations,  according to the requirements of the bill, by March 1, 2019, thereby  enabling licensed space support flights.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Posey who is always a leader  on space issues for taking the initiative on this bill.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, Mr. Weber, the gentleman from  Texas, for yielding.   I strongly support this bill, H.R. 5905, the Department of Energy  Science and Innovation Act of 2018. This bipartisan legislation,  sponsored by 12 members of the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee authorizes the basic research programs within the DOE Office  of Science for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The programs include  research in basic energy sciences, advanced scientific computing, high- energy physics, biological and environmental research, fusion energy  science, and nuclear physics.   These basic research programs are the core mission of the Department  of Energy and will produce the scientific discoveries that will help  maintain U.S. leadership in technology.   This bill also prioritizes basic research funding for solar fuels,  electricity storage, bioenergy research, exascale computing, and low- dose radiation research. It provides the Office of Science funding for  upgrades and construction of seven high-priority user facilities at DOE  national labs.   This legislation is the product of more than 4 years of bipartisan  work by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to advance basic  research and set clear science priorities for the Department of Energy.   H.R. 5905 builds on the initiatives included in the House-passed  bill, H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act,  and also incorporates four bipartisan Science, Space, and Technology  Committee infrastructure bills that passed the House in February.   One example of the central missions authorized in the DOE Science and  Innovation Act is the exascale computing program. Developing an  exascale system is critical to enabling scientific discovery,  strengthening national security, and promoting U.S. competitiveness.  Exascale computing will have real-world benefits for American industry  and entice the best researchers in the world to conduct groundbreaking  science at the DOE labs.   To strengthen U.S. energy independence, this legislation also  supports fusion energy sciences. When commercial fusion becomes  available, it will revolutionize the energy market and could  significantly reduce global carbon emissions.   H.R. 5905 also authorizes funds for U.S. contributions to the  International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, a critical  step to achieving commercial fusion energy.   Again, I want to thank Representative Weber, as well as  Representative Lofgren, for their longstanding support of basic  research and investments in our world-class science facilities at the  DOE national labs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma,  the vice chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology  (Mr. Lucas), for yielding me time on his bill.   The energy bill we are considering is H.R. 5906, the ARPA-E Act of  2018. It establishes clear DOE policy in a new direction and new  requirements for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, called  ARPA-E, program.   This legislation updates the mission of ARPA-E to focus on developing  technological solutions to energy, economic, environmental, and  national security challenges. This includes allowing ARPA-E to develop  technologies to address the management, cleanup, and disposal of  nuclear waste and to enhance the security and resilience of the  electric grid.   H.R. 5906 also maximizes the Department's resources. It requires  ARPA-E to coordinate with other DOE programs, avoid duplication, and  ensures that ARPA-E grants go to innovative technologies that would not  otherwise be funded by the private sector.   The bill reforms ARPA-E but does not authorize any funding for ARPA- E. Instead, H.R. 5906 provides much-needed reform to the ARPA-E  program. It also leaves the door open for Congress to readdress ARPA-E  funding in the future and determine if the Agency is meeting its  intended purpose.   Unfortunately, there have been some mischaracterizations of this  legislation, so let the Record be clear: Supporting H.R. 5906 will not  prevent Congress from cutting--as we did in the House-passed Energy and  Water Appropriations bill earlier this month--or even eliminating  funding to ARPA-E in the future. Instead, it allows us to enact reforms  today that refocus ARPA-E on technology within the DOE mission.   In addition, one organization that opposes this legislation  apparently didn't read the bill and confused it with another bill that  reauthorizes ARPA-E.   Mr. Speaker, thanks go to Vice Chairman Lucas and Ranking Member  Johnson for their work on this reform bill and for their support of  advanced research around the country.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to mention one more thing, and it might be  of interest to all Members, even those who are not on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee. After this bill passes, of the 27  bills that the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has brought to  the House floor, 24 of the 27 have, in fact, been bipartisan pieces of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hultgren for yielding me  time on his bill, H.R. 5907, the National Innovation Modernization by  Laboratory Empowerment Act, or NIMBLE Act.   This legislation authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide  signature authority to the directors of the national laboratories,  allowing these lab directors to make funding decisions on cooperative  agreements with industry where the total cost is less than $1 million.   This commonsense reform provides the labs with more flexibility and  eliminates the red tape and bureaucratic process that makes it  difficult for businesses to partner with the labs.    DOE national labs can provide the private sector with access to  critical research infrastructure as they develop new technologies. But  a burdensome approval process can smother an industry's interest and  constrict the pace of technology development. This bill gives the labs  freedom to pursue agreements that will increase U.S. competitiveness  and maintain our innovation and productivity leadership.   I thank Representative Randy Hultgren again and this bill's 10  Science, Space, and Technology Committee's cosponsors, including  Representative Ed Perlmutter, Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, and Energy Subcommittee Vice  Chairman Steve Knight for their ongoing support of DOE's world-leading  national laboratories.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say about Mr. Hultgren that his leadership on  the committee has been appreciated for years. He has never failed to be  an effective advocate and leader for the national labs. This is a good  example of his interests being put into legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
