 Mr. Speaker, for centuries, Black Americans  have been denied the right to define our own existence. How we live,  how we work, and how we raise our children have been judged, appraised,  scorned, and dismissed. To this day, we must fight back against harmful  stereotypes and brutal discrimination.   There are forces that seek to maintain the status quo that  discriminates against Black Americans, and these forces don't just wear  white hoods. Racism can be subtle. It persists because too many people  fail to notice or don't want to notice how bias and discrimination  infect the systems in which we live our lives.   They claim color blindness and deride wokeness when, in actuality,  they fail to look out and see the world around them for what it is.   This is the failure that leads a Member of Congress to utter such an  offensive phrase on the floor of this body, to insult me and my  colleagues on the floor of this sacred Chamber.   This is why we refuse to back down when Republicans propose cutting  programs that promote diversity and educate us on our history because  it is not just about history. Black women are three times more likely  to die in childbirth. Black Americans are more likely to be victims of  gun violence. Black Americans are more likely to be denied the right to  vote. Black Americans are more likely to be saddled with crushing  student debt.   We face these disparities because of systems that were built to  exclude us. When Republicans oppose diversity and inclusion, they are  not just denying our history; they seek to resurrect the worst impulses  of our history. We cannot and will not let them. Nothing less than the  fate of our democracy is on the line.
