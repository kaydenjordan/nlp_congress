 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. Today, I am delighted to recognize a small  business that provides healthy prepackaged meals and fosters community  development. This week, it is my privilege to honor Fresco Foods, Inc.,  of Tampa, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2014, Rob and Tracy Povolny founded Fresco Foods in Tampa, FL.  When Rob was laid off by a corporate food seller, he chose to pursue  his goal of establishing a high-quality packaged food company. Using  their savings, retirement, and some loans from friends and family, they  rented space in an industrial kitchen to create their recipes. That  December, they began selling their ``Eat Fresco'' meals at local mom- and-pop grocery stores. Their healthy, satisfying meals were an instant  hit.   Six years later, Fresco Foods has grown into a thriving company with  more than 120 employees. In 2017, a U.S. Small Business Administration  7(a) loan enabled Rob and Tracy to establish their own 12,000 square  foot production facility, creating more than 100 jobs. Their  ingredients are sourced from a local distributor, and their product  packaging is eco-friendly. In 2018, Fresco Foods reached a major  milestone when they began selling their products in a handful of Publix  stores. Today, Fresco Foods stock their ``Eat Fresco'' prepared meals  in all 1,252 Publix locations across seven States. Additionally, they  are working to launch a prepackaged breakfast line later this year.   Together, Rob and Tracy have prioritized business mentorship and  ensures Fresco Foods supports the community. Through podcasts and by  conducting workshops, Rob and Tracy have shared their experiences,  teaching entrepreneurship to future small business owners. Fresco Foods  regularly donates to local organizations like Feeding Tampa Bay. They  also work with Metropolitan Ministries to employ graduates of its  culinary technical training program. For its success and innovation,  Fresco Foods has been recognized by local media and business outlets,  including the Tampa Bay Business Journal.   Like many Floridian small business, Fresco Foods jumped in to help  their community during the coronavirus pandemic. As Florida went into  lockdown, philanthropic organizations experienced a drop in donations  as demand for their resources surged. Rob and Tracy donated hundreds of  ``Eat Fresco'' meals to homeless shelters and domestic violence  shelters in the Tampa area.   In April 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the  Paycheck Protection Program, a small business relief program that I was  proud to author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small  businesses and  [[Page S5604]]  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rob  and Tracy used their PPP loan, which Fresco Foods received in April, to  keep all of their employees on payroll until Florida reopened.   Fresco Foods, Inc., is a notable example of how small businesses can  achieve commercial success, and remain committed to investing in their  communities. Congratulations to Rob, Tracy, and the entire team at  Fresco Foods. I look forward to watching your continued growth in  Florida and beyond.                            ____________________
