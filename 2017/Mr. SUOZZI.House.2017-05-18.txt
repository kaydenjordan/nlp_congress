 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 265.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the dedication of the  Washington Spy Ring along Route 25A of Long Island's North Shore, in my  and Congressman Zeldin's district.   This group of American heroes is often overlooked because knowledge  [[Page H4346]]  that George Washington's Culper Spy Ring existed was not disclosed  until 1930.   Nathan Hale of the often noted ``I only regret that I have but one  life to lose for my country'' is claimed by Huntington to have been  captured there and gave rise to the spy ring.   One of Culper's top spies was Robert Townsend of Raynham Hall, Oyster  Bay, also known as Culper, Jr.   Townsend posed as a Tory merchant in New York City. He relayed  intelligence concerning troop movements, supplies, and British plots,  using an expensive spy ring, coded messages, invisible ink, and  elaborate signal system using everything from drying laundry to buttons  on clothing.   Their efforts turned the tide of the war by assisting Washington to  outfox the British, even saving him from capture.   As Washington said, and as is recounted to members of today's CIA:   ``There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate  a designing enemy, and nothing requires greater pains to obtain.''   I would like to thank the North Shore Promotional Alliance, Raynham  Hall, the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, and the producers of the  AMC television show ``Turn'' for promoting the legacy of these unsung  American patriots.                            ____________________
