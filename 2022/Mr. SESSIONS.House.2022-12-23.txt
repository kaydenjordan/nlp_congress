 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, today America faces the Congress as we debate--yes,  debate--just days before Christmas, this spending that will take place  next year.   In the 20 years I spent on the Rules Committee, I do know that the  staff and the members do hard work, and I respect them for that. But  the differences between our parties appear at the Rules Committee.   For 8 years, Republicans--6 of those years with me as chairman of the  Rules Committee--held government spending completely flat,  discretionary spending. And yet we see what is happening now is a good  bit of that discretionary spending they are moving to mandatory  spending--mandatory spending that will put a burden on the taxpayer of  this country--not just 4,100 pages, not just $1.7 trillion, but  actually empowering government to intrude into the lives of American  citizens.   Over $20 billion will be given to the IRS over this next year.                                time  1115    The Federal Government under President Biden does not even have  government employees reporting to work. They stay at home. Yet, we add  87,000 new IRS employees.   Mr. Speaker, what we have today is the difference on the priorities,  I think, of the American people, people who want to have jobs and  careers, people who want to be safe in their own homes. An open border  with this President and the Democratic Party is openly assisting  illegal immigration into this country with literally an unlimited  amount of money.   Detaining people at the border is important for national security.  This next year, the Texas delegation will engage in this issue on the  floor.   I thank the Speaker for this time but will let them know that the  American people will hear from the Republican Party next year.
