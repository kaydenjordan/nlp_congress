 Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject that many  Senators are aware of and should be deeply concerned about.   As we remember, in the early morning hours of March 3, 2016, Honduras  lost one of its most courageous and charismatic indigenous leaders,  Berta Caceres. Ms. Caceres was the general coordinator of the National  Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, COPINH.  She was gunned down by assassins in her home in the village of La  Esperanza, Intibuca.   Berta Caceres spent her life defending indigenous rights,  particularly to land and natural resources. In 2015, she won the  prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her outstanding activism  and leadership. She and COPINH had been supporting land struggles  throughout western Honduras, and because of that--because she was  exercising rights guaranteed by Honduran law and international law--she  and the communities that she and COPINH supported were the frequent  targets of death threats.   In Rio Blanco, her organization and the community of Rio Blanco were  threatened repeatedly as they engaged in peaceful protests to protect  the river and their way of life from the construction of the Agua Zarca  hydroelectric dam by DESA, a Honduran company supported by  international banks.   It was as a result of the threats she received for supporting the Rio  Blanco struggle that Ms. Caceres was granted precautionary measures by  the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. However, the Honduran  authorities not only failed to protect her, they vilified her and other  social activists like her.   Berta Caceres was an inspiration to people around the world, and her  death was a terrible loss for people everywhere. As I said in this  Chamber the day after her death:         The immediate question is what President Hernandez, and his       government which has too often ignored or passively condoned       attacks against Honduran social activists, will do to support       an independent investigation, prosecution, and punishment of       those responsible for this despicable crime. And beyond that,       what steps will the government take to protect the many       others, including members of COPINH, who are in need of       protection, and to stand up for the rights of people like       Berta who risk their lives peacefully defending the       environment and their livelihoods.    Not surprisingly to those who are familiar with Honduran law  enforcement, the investigation of the murder got off to a bad start.  Not only was the crime scene at Ms. Caceres's home tampered with, the  government's first response to the killing was to attempt to falsely  pin the attack on her COPINH associates. When that went nowhere, they  sought to intimidate the one eyewitness to the shooting, Gustavo  Castro, a Mexican citizen who had been wounded. That also failed.   Thanks to intense international pressure including from the U.S.  Embassy, eight people were eventually arrested, including one active  duty army officer and low-ranking employees of DESA, the hydroelectric  company. This is notable, because the assassination of Berta Caceres  was only the latest of more than 100 reported killings of environmental  activists in Honduras since 2010. Since her death, there have been  others. Investigators for Global Witness, a widely respected human  rights organization that documented those crimes, were subjected to  threats and spurious accusations by Honduran officials who sought to  discredit their report. As far as I am aware, no one has been brought  to justice for any of those crimes, and had it not been for the  international outcry, there is no reason to think that Ms. Caceres's  murder would have been treated any differently.   Shortly after the murder, due to the long history of impunity for  killings of journalists and social activists, Ms. Caceres's family  urged the Honduran Government to permit the Inter-American Commission  on Human Rights, IACHR, to send an independent team of legal experts to  conduct their own investigation. Not only did the Honduran Government  refuse, the Public Ministry has refused to share the bulk of the  evidence with the Caceres family's legal representatives, as required  by Honduran law.   The family also asked that independent forensic experts be allowed to  analyze the ballistics and other evidence. The Honduran Government  similarly rejected that request.   Like Ms. Caceres's family, I also called for an independent  investigation and urged that the concession granted to DESA for the  Agua Zarca project be abandoned. It clearly cannot coexist with the  indigenous people of Rio Blanco who see it as a threat to their safety  and way of life; yet while some of the international banks have  withdrawn, it is 20 months since the murder of Ms. Caceres, and not  only does DESA deny any responsibility, it refuses to cancel the  project.   After the arrests of the eight suspects, there was hope that those  who conceived of and paid for the assassination of Ms. Caceres would  also be tracked down and captured, but that did not happen. For more  than a year, there has been no further word from the Public Ministry  about the case, except that the investigation is ongoing--a familiar  refrain in Honduras where criminal investigations have a way of either  never beginning, or never ending.   The U.S. Embassy also repeatedly assured me and others who inquired  that the investigation was being handled professionally in accordance  with the highest standards. It now appears that was uninformed, wishful  thinking.   After the Honduran Government refused to permit the IACHR to  investigate, Berta Caceres's family arranged for an independent team of  international human rights lawyers to conduct their own review of the  evidence. Over a period of a year, the group, consisting of five  experienced lawyers from the United States, Colombia, and Guatemala,  known as the International Advisory Group of Experts, GAIPE,  interviewed witnesses and analyzed what cell phone data and other  evidence they could obtain from the Public Ministry. While the data  they analyzed represented only a small fraction of what is known to  exist, it included thousands of text messages that revealed a great  deal.   There is now little doubt about the identities of at least some of  the intellectual authors who conceived of and paid for the  assassination of Berta Caceres; yet the Public Ministry has failed to  act on this evidence, perhaps because it implicates DESA executives  with ties to officials in the Honduran Government.   As I said on October 31, 2017, when GAIPE released the report of its  investigation:         [t]his damning report corroborates what many have       suspected--that the investigation of Berta Caceres' murder       has been plagued by incompetence, attempts to stonewall and       deflect blame to protect those who conceived of and paid for       this plot, and a glaring lack of political will. The Public       Ministry needs to fully disclose, without further delay, all       testimony and electronic and ballistics evidence to the       Caceres family's legal representatives and defendants'       lawyers, as required by law. The Ministry also needs to       ensure that every piece of evidence is properly safeguarded,       and to follow the evidence wherever it leads to arrest those       responsible. It is shameful that despite intense domestic and       international pressure, this horrific case has languished,       while those responsible have sought to derail it. And there       are hundreds of other Honduran social activists and       journalists who have been similarly threatened and killed,       whose cases have not even prompted investigations.    It is important to note that the GAIPE report indicates that the  evidence not only implicates DESA executives and employees, as well as  Honduran state agents, in the surveillance, spreading of false  information, and plot to assassinate of Berta Caceres; the evidence  also reveals other crimes such as obstruction of justice, abuse of  authority, and unlawful association. The report documents the shocking  extremes to which the company was willing to go, including murder for  hire, in pursuit of its financial goals.   In addition to immediately disclosing the evidence to the Caceres  family and others who are entitled to it under Honduran law, the Public  Ministry should act on the petition of the Caceres family's legal  representatives to arrest the intellectual authors.   The Public Ministry should immediately ensure that all electronics  and other evidence is adequately safeguarded to eliminate any risk of  tampering. For whatever reason, much of the evidence is reportedly in  the possession of the National Directorate of Investigations and  Intelligence, and given the history in Honduras of evidence  disappearing or being destroyed  [[Page S7153]]  or stolen, and witnesses being intimidated and killed, securing the  evidence in this case is imperative.   The Honduran Government should take whatever steps are necessary to  protect the leaders of COPINH, whose lives remain in jeopardy. The  government's past responses to requests for protection have ranged from  inaction to ineffective.   The Agua Zarca concession and other hydro or extractive concessions  that were obtained without the consent of local people whose lives or  territory would be adversely affected should be cancelled. The Honduran  Government needs to substantially reform the way it reviews and grants  such concessions, which have too often been the product of corrupt  dealings that resulted in environmental degradation, social unrest, and  violence.   The assassination of Berta Caceres, as outrageous and tragic as it  was, presented the Honduran Government with an opportunity to show that  justice is possible in such cases and that even people who hold  positions of economic or political privilege and power can be held  accountable. Instead, we have witnessed more of the same--important  evidence being mishandled and possibly even ignored and withheld from  those entitled to it. A partial investigation that resulted in the  arrest of those who reportedly carried out the crime, followed by  months of silence without identifying those who were behind it. This is  not acceptable.   Over the past 2 years, President Hernandez and other top Honduran  officials have traveled to Washington to lobby for Honduras's share of  U.S. funding for the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity of the  Northern Triangle of Central America. Among other things, they have  earnestly voiced their commitment to human rights and respect for civil  society. They are going to find out that action, not words, are what  matter.   Over the past 2 years, the U.S. Congress has provided a total of $1.4  billion to support the plan, of which a significant portion is for  Honduras. I supported those funds because I recognize the immense  challenges that widespread poverty, corruption, drug trafficking, gang  violence, and impunity pose for those countries. These problems will  not be solved by building a wall along our southern border or deporting  tens of thousands of Central Americans currently living in the United  States.   I mention this because the assassination of Berta Caceres brings U.S.  support for the plan sharply into focus. Today that support is in  jeopardy.   It is why those responsible for her death and the killers of other  Honduran social activists and journalists must be brought to justice.   It is why Agua Zarca and other such projects that do not have the  support of the local population must be abandoned and replaced with an  inclusive, transparent process that complies with international  environmental and social safeguards.   It is why the Honduran Government must cease its attempts to  undermine the work of the Mission to Support the Fight against  Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, MACCIH, which has begun to  investigate the link between the assassination of Berta Caceres and  corrupt dealings between DESA and Honduran state agents.   It is why the Honduran Government must finally take seriously its  responsibility to protect the rights of journalists, human rights  defenders, other social activists, COPINH, and civil society  organizations that peacefully advocate for equitable economic  development and access to justice.   Only then should we have confidence that the Honduran Government is a  partner the United States can work with in addressing the needs and  protecting the rights of the Honduran people, particularly those who  have borne the brunt of official neglect, corruption, and violence for  so many years.   Today any hope that the Honduran Government may have of continued  U.S. assistance under the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity will  hinge in part on the outcome of the Caceres case, concrete actions that  demonstrate support for the legitimate role of civil society and the  independent media, and real reform of the justice system.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, as Republicans consider tax proposals to  disproportionately benefit corporations and the wealthy, they  simultaneously fail to address revenue-draining loopholes that compel  hardworking taxpayers to subsidize corporate misconduct. Today, I am  introducing commonsense legislation--the ``No Tax Write-Offs for  Corporate Wrongdoers Act''--to prevent the worst corporate actors from  writing off their wrongdoing as simply the cost of doing business. This  idea is commonsense. This idea is straightforward. This idea should be  bipartisan.   Today's tax code allows corporations to deduct the cost of court- ordered punitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business expense. Courts  reserve punitive damages for only the most egregious and reckless  misconduct--misconduct that usually causes great harm to peoples'  lives. For victims who have suffered at the hands of the worst  corporate bad actors, there is nothing ``ordinary'' about this  loophole. Punitive damage awards are designed to punish wrongdoers for  the reprehensible harm they cause--to provide a deterrence to  misconduct. By giving corporations a deduction specifically for their  wrongdoing, our tax code winks and nods at future wrongdoers who know  that they can simply write off the damages they owe for the damage they  cause.   This is not a theoretical problem. In 1994, when the Exxon Valdez  spilled 11 million gallons of oil in the Prince William Sound,  devastating Alaska's southern coast, it was eventually slapped with  punitive damages of $500 million. Exxon turned around and exploited  this tax loophole to write off those punitive damages as an  ``ordinary'' business expense--saving the company millions of dollars  that could have--and should have--added to government revenues. In  2011, two Montana teenagers died in a car crash caused by a steering  wheel defect in the Hyundai model they were driving--a defect that  Hyundai knew about and recklessly ignored for over a decade. Although a  judge eventually ordered Hyundai to pay $73 million in punitive  damages, Hyundai can lawfully write those damages off as a business  expense. This is just wrong.   The No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoing Act is simple and  straightforward, and would end this offensive loophole once and for  all. My bill would amend the tax code to prevent the deduction of any  amount ``paid or incurred for punitive damages in connection with any  judgment in, or settlement, any action between private parties.'' Aside  from bringing our tax code in line with our most basic notions of  justice and fair play, my bill would save American taxpayers a  significant amount of money. In 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation  estimated that ending this punitive damages loophole would increase our  government revenues by nearly $415 million over 10 years.   The Senate will be talking a lot about tax reform in the coming  weeks. The Senate majority will bend over backwards--they already are-- to argue how important it is that we dramatically lower tax rates to  make our tax system more favorable to large corporations. Should we not  also hold these same corporations accountable when they poison our  environment and harm Americans? Legislation that leaves such an  egregious loophole in place while giving companies massive tax cuts is  not tax reform. It is a corporate tax giveaway.   It should shock the conscience to know that our law effectively  compels hardworking taxpayers to subsidize the recklessness and bad  behavior of the worst corporate actors. This bill would change this  unacceptable status-quo. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Reed, Gillibrand,  and Hassan for cosponsoring this legislation. I urge all Senators--of  all political ideologies--to support the No Tax Write-Offs for  Corporate Wrongdoing Act. Protecting our constituents from corporate  misconduct is not a political or partisan issue. It is our job.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as Republicans consider tax proposals to  disproportionately benefit corporations and the wealthy, they  simultaneously fail to address revenue-draining loopholes that compel  hardworking taxpayers to subsidize corporate misconduct.
