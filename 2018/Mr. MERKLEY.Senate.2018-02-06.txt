 Mr. President, I appreciate that Senator Cantwell  organized this time for a group of us to come to the floor to speak  about this disastrous, insane plan to drill throughout 90 percent of  our coastal shelf. This, the Interior Secretary tells us, is part of  President Trump's directive to rebuild the offshore oil and gas  program, but he also conveyed it was the President's directive to  ``take into consideration the local and State voices.''   Well, certainly the draft plan--if you can call it a draft--didn't  take into account local or State voices. Had the Interior Secretary  bothered to actually consult, this is what he would have heard from  people in Oregon. Our Governor, Kate Brown, denounced the plan, saying:  ``In what universe would this be okay?''   Noah Oppenheim, the executive director of the Pacific Coast  Federation of Fishermen's Associations, stated:         The Trump administration wants to put fish and fisheries at       significant risk while lining the pockets of their oil       industry co-conspirators. Meanwhile, more frequent oil spills       and more intense ocean acidification and ocean warming are       guaranteed to ensue.    Charlie Plybon, the Oregon policy manager at Surfrider Foundation, an  organization made up of everyday people passionate about protecting our  oceans and our beaches, shared this opinion:         We are united in an understanding of the threats which       offshore oil drilling poses to our coastal economy, jobs and       culture we have today. We will not gamble our ocean resources       with dangerous oil exploration and polluting drilling       activities that put our future and that of generations to       come at risk.    Charlie went on to convey the enormous disparity between the economy  that is driven by fishing and ocean recreation and by tourism as  compared to the economy driven by oil drilling and how the former  completely outweighs the latter.   The Association of Northwest Steelheaders is one of the oldest and  most cherished conservation and sport fishing advocacy organizations in  the Pacific Northwest. Their statement is the following:         This proposal stands to go against everything we believe       in. Drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Oregon       compromises our fisheries, our coastal economies, and our       values.    These folks know what they are talking about.   The Tribes weighed in through the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish  Commission. Their resolution conveys opposition to ``any proposal to  open Pacific offshore waters from California to and including Alaska to  offshore drilling.''   Scott McMullen, the chairman of the Oregon Fishermen's Cable  Committee--a group of troll fishermen who have been very involved in  negotiations involving the fiber optic cable lines that are laid in the  ocean--said:         The Oregon fishing industry has had a long history of good       stewardship of the fishing grounds which are open for       multiple uses. Oil platforms in our fishing grounds would       deny access to the resources that fishermen, fish processors       and thriving coastal communities depend on. To take away the       right to use our historical shared fishing grounds by       awarding drilling rights for this single industrial use would       be wrong.    Dale Beasley had this opinion:         As president of the Columbia River Crab Fisherman's       Association and Coalition of Coastal Fisheries, our position       on any fixed structures in the ocean and particularly oil       platforms is simple--NO NO AND NO again.        Our members rely 100% on clean sustainable marine waters       for 100% of our families income.    Terry Thompson, Lincoln County commissioner, stated:         The state of Oregon has been a leader in the nation in       terms of protecting our environment while responsibly       utilizing our natural resources.        We banned oil and gas development years ago because of the       potential risk to our ocean, which is one of the most       productive places in the world.        The President's proposal to allow oil and gas development       is an attempt to override the will of the people and shows a       complete disconnect between the Administration and the people       of the West.    I think these voices--the voices of the crabbing industry and the  salmon industry, the fishing industry and the tourism industry--these  voices of the coastal economy, reverberate in absolute parallel and  passionate opposition to drilling off our coast for oil.   Before the drilling takes place, there are massive amounts of  explosions that are conducted in order to create the maps of what is  under the surface for potential drilling. That alone--just the  preparation for drilling--is deeply disturbing, but imagine what an  oilspill looks like.   This is a map of the Washington and Oregon coast, with the outline  overlaid with the gulf oilspill. It covers a section that is the entire  length of the State of Oregon and the State of Washington. Imagine  those hundreds of miles of soiled beaches, the oil's impact on the  ecosystem of the fisheries. There is no way this risk is justified for  pumping a few more barrels of oil--which, I might point out, should be  left in the ground anyway because burning oil that we are extracting  from the ground is steadily raising the temperature of the planet and  the temperature of our oceans, which absorb the vast majority of the  heat from burning fossil fuels, and that is creating changes, from  ocean acidification to the bleaching of the coral reefs, and all kinds  of impacts on the surface of the continents.   So I say to the Interior Secretary, you have been given a mission by  the President of the United States, which, as you have stated, is to  take into consideration local and State voices, so simply hear those  voices, and then take Oregon out of the equation, take Washington out  of the equation, take California out of the equation, take every State  that objects out of this equation, and, by the way, it would be wise to  take the rest out as well.   Thank you.
