 Madam President, the Constitution of the United States  makes three references to religion. The First Amendment to the Bill of  Rights says that we have the right to believe or not believe as a  matter of personal conscience and, secondly, that there will be no  established government religion in the United States. The only other  provision is in article VI, where it expressly says there will be no  religious test for public office--three simple assertions which for  over 200 years have guided this Nation in dealing with religion.   The statement just made by the Senator from South Dakota really tells  me that he didn't tune in to the hearings that were held just a week or  two ago when it came to Amy Coney Barrett. I did. I was there for all 4  days, start to finish, with maybe 10 minutes that I stepped aside. So I  know what was said and who said it, and I know what the Democrats said,  and I didn't believe there was one instance--not one--where any  Democrat raised the issue of this nominee's religion. We took seriously  what article VI says in the Constitution: There is no religious test  for office.   I will state that on the other side of the aisle, there were frequent  references to her religion--express references to her religion. That is  their right as Senators to decide how they want to handle this issue.  But the suggestion that I heard from the Senator from South Dakota  tells me he did not follow the hearing and he didn't listen to it. Had  he done so, he wouldn't have made the statements that he just did on  the floor.   As a lifelong Catholic, I want to state that I have voted for  Catholics to serve  [[Page S6388]]  on every court, both the Supreme Court and other courts in the land,  and I have voted against some as well. I take the admonition of the  Constitution seriously. I don't take a person's religion into account  when I cast a vote when it comes to a judge, nor should anyone if they  follow this Constitution.   One last point I would like to make that was clearly wrong: When it  came to the scurrilous and disgusting attacks on the adopted children  of this nominee, the Senator from Louisiana spoke up against them, and  so did I on the Democratic side. They are unacceptable on either side  of the aisle, and for any Senators to suggest otherwise tells me he did  not listen to the hearing itself.   I condemn the attack on her family, and I repeat that condemnation on  the floor of the Senate today. For that Senator to ignore that fact  troubles me greatly. I count him as a friend. I hope when he reads the  record of the actual proceedings before the Senate Judiciary Committee,  he will come and clarify and correct his remarks.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Jones), and the Senator from Arizona (Ms.  Sinema) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, Winston Churchill famously said: ``If  you're going through hell, keep going.'' Persevere, don't give up. It  is good advice.   Here is another bit of good advice for weathering hard times: Look to  a brighter future, but also study the past. Look at how others before  you have triumphed over similar difficulties, and learn from their  example.   During these hard, pandemic times, leaders and communities--and  anyone,  [[Page S6398]]  really--would do well to study the life and accomplishments of an  exceptional leader, the former mayor of Rockford, IL, John McNamara.   John died on September 30 at the age of 81. As Rockford's mayor from  1981 to 1989, he helped guide Rockford through a national recession,  which crippled the manufacturing industry in his city. When he took  office, Rockford's jobless rate stood at 11.5 percent. Eighteen months  later, it had ballooned to nearly 25 percent, the highest unemployment  in the Nation. For the first time since the Great Depression, the  city's population declined. The New York Times reported that Rockford  was ``bleeding away its jobs and its people.''   Speaking with a Rockford Register Star reporter in 2006, John  McNamara recalled those times. He said: ``People would come into my  office to tell me about their situation. It was very heart-wrenching  and emotional. It hit you in the gut.''   John McNamara steered Rockford through those dark years with a strong  leadership style and an irrepressible, infectious sense of optimism. He  believed in Rockford's people and possibilities, and he inspired others  to believe in them, too.   By the start of his second and final term in 1985, the city's economy  was on an upswing. While part of the improvement was due to a broader,  national economic recovery, much of Rockford's rebound was the result  of bold decisions by McNamara to overhaul the city's government.   He professionalized the mayor's office and realigned the city's  finances. He worked to create opportunities for economic growth and  prosperity. He made smart investments in infrastructure to create new  jobs and attract new industries to Rockford and to diversify and  strengthen the city's economic base. He spearheaded the resurrection of  downtown Rockford.   He helped to establish a local tourism bureau and an arts council. He  committed public funds to turn an old Sears Roebuck building into the  Rockford Museum Park, home to the Rockford Art Museum, the Discovery  Center, and the Rockford Dance Company.   He worked for social justice for all of his city's residents. In a  city where the school district had twice faced lawsuits for racial  discrimination, he made racial healing a priority. He told his children  that his favorite day of the year was Martin Luther King Day; he loved  the inspiration he drew from visits to African-American churches. He  established a Mayors Task Force on Homelessness.   He was famous for his blunt speaking style and his booming voice,  which echoed throughout city hall. He was funny, with a loud laugh. In  his days as mayor, he stood 6-foot-4 and weighed about 180 pounds,  tops. People used to marvel that such a big laugh could come from such  a thin frame. He greeted people with a big hug and a big smile. He  listened.   He was a Democrat who didn't believe that any political party has a  monopoly on good ideas. He was elected by Democrats and Republicans,  and he appointed people from both parties to serve in city committees.  One of his favorite sayings was: ``If you can't make a friend, don't  make an enemy.''   A Republican who served during his years as mayor, current Rockford  Alderman Frank Beach said: ``John was a strong man [who] loved our  community--a man of integrity, a man that put shoe leather to his  convictions.''   He motivated and inspired people, and he was energetic and tireless.   Rockford was John's adopted hometown. He grew up in Whiting, IN,  where his folks ran a small mom-and-pop grocery. He had two sisters. In  his school, he was class president. He also played football,  basketball, and baseball, and he was on the bowling team. He earned a  bachelor's degree from Notre Dame University and a law degree from the  University of Michigan.   In 1965, on a blind date, he met Barbara Runkle, a young woman from  the northern suburbs of Chicago. They ate at a diner and walked around  Chicago. The next day, he drove 60 miles to see her again. He made that  same 60-mile drive to see Barbara every day for months until they  married on June 26, 1965.   John and Barbara were married for 55 years and raised six children,  three daughters and three sons, including Rockford's current mayor, Tom  McNamara.   Shortly after their wedding, John did a tour of duty in Vietnam as a  captain in U.S. Army intelligence and earned a Bronze Star. After his  military service, he passed up a chance to practice law in downtown  Chicago and moved to Rockford to work as an assistant public defender  in Winnebago County. He said his work in steel mills and factories  during college and law school pushed him toward a practice in which he  could help people.   He had public service in his blood. His father had served on the city  council and school board in Whiting, and two of his uncles were mayors.  John's own career in public office started in 1974, when he was  appointed by Rockford's mayor to fill a vacancy in the city's Third  Ward. He ran for reelection the following year, winning a 4-year term.  He took a year off after his term ended and, a year later, announced  that he would run for mayor.   If you asked him what accomplishment he was most proud of as mayor,  John didn't mention new buildings or economic development deals. He was  proudest that he had helped the people of Rockford believe in a better  future during a dark time. He was proud that he chose not to seek a  third term, instead endorsing his protege, then-city administrator  Charles Box, who would go on to become Rockford's first Black mayor,  serving for three terms.   John remained active in Rockford's civic life. He joined William  Charles Investments Ltd. He also worked part-time for Rockford  University; as the liberal arts college's first vice president for  development, he helped save it from going under during tough times. In  2009, I was honored to nominate John to serve on a Federal Advisory  Committee on Student Financial Assistance, an independent, bipartisan  panel formed to advise Congress and the U.S. Secretary of Education on  making college more affordable. He just never stopped trying to help  people.   I will close with this story. On a chilly spring day in 1978, when  John was serving on the city council, he helped save the life of a man  who jumped off the State Street Bridge. John was in the Rockford  Register Star building when he saw the man teetering on the bridge's  railing. He took off running, but by the time he reached the bridge,  the man had already jumped into the frigid Rock River. With the help of  another man and a 16-year-old boy who happened to be passing by, John  pulled the man out of the river. The only casualty was the new suit he  was wearing, a bit of a luxury for a defense lawyer with six young  children.   John McNamara later told a columnist: ``I was shaking all the rest of  that afternoon--not because I was cold. You just hate to see a guy get  that despondent.''   That was John McNamara in a nutshell, willing to act boldly yet  humbly to give someone else hope. He was a class act who led by  example, and he was my friend. Loretta and I offer our condolences to  John's wife Barbara, their six children--John, Kate, Dan, Mary, Nell,  and Tom and their spouses--and to John and Barbara's 16 grandchildren.  He loved them all deeply. He will be missed.                            ____________________
