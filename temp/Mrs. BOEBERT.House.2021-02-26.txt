 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for  yielding. I thank Mr. Stauber for working with me on several amendments  that protect Colorado's Third Congressional District. All 11 of my  amendments to give voice to the people in my district were denied.   Mr. Speaker, this bill targets my district and would lock up more  than 550,000 acres of it with new wilderness designations. The Mesa  County Commissioners, Montezuma County Commissioners, Dolores County  Commissioners, the Archuleta County Commissioners, White River and  Douglas Creek Conservation Districts, the Colorado Farm Bureau, and  numerous other constituencies in Colorado strongly oppose this bill  because of the damage they know that it will cause and activities it  will prevent.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record several of those letters of  opposition.                                    Colorado Snowmobile Association,                            COHVCO, Trails Preservation Alliance,                                                  February 23, 2021.      Re 2021 Omnibus Wilderness & Amendments.       Congresswoman Lauren Boebert,      Att: Jeff Smalls & Ashley Higgins,      Washington DC.        Dear Jeff and Ashley: Please accept this correspondence as       the comments of the above referenced Organizations vigorously       opposing the CORE Wilderness Proposal (HR 803) and the       Colorado Wilderness Act (HR577) hereinafter referred to as       ``the Proposal''. After a detailed review of the Proposal,       the Organizations have concluded that every area expanded or       created in the Proposal would result in significant lost       recreational opportunities for the overwhelming portion of       visitors to the Proposal area, both currently and in the       future. While there are significant lost opportunities, there       is also no additional protections for multiple use routes       that might remain outside the Wilderness areas and no new       areas are designated or released for multiple use       recreational opportunities.        The Organizations have spent many years trying to hammer       out something that works for everyone around these proposals,       and have simply been stonewalled at every turn by the       sponsors of this legislation in both Houses of Congress. This       is despite the fact our groups were thanked by outgoing       Senator Mark Udall for our collaboration and efforts around       the development of the Hermosa Creek Watershed Management       legislation signed into law on December 19, 2014 as Section       3062 in the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (PL 113-291).       This legislation released a WSA and specifically protected       motorized usage in the area moving forward, designated a       large special management area where multiple uses were       protected and designated Wilderness in areas where that       management was appropriate. We had hoped this collaboration       was a roadmap for resolving many of the ongoing challenges we       encounter around Wilderness designation and releases.       Unfortunately, we were incorrect as exemplified by the       efforts around HR 577 and HR 803 as phone calls are not       returned, meetings are continued and ideological trench       warfare has returned around these Proposals.        It is worth noting, the Colorado Wilderness Act would       heavily impact many recently developed trail networks that       have enjoyed strong bi-partisan and community support or       historical trail networks that serve a wide range of       interests. Examples of these types of losses would include:        1. Bangs Canyon area, which developed an extensive multiple       use trail network after a complete NEPA review and analysis       and almost a million dollars in direct funding from users for       the project. The Bangs Canyon SMA area is now to be       designated as Wilderness.        2. Delores Canyon--this area has a large network of trails       serving a wide range of interests that has existed for an       extended period of time without controversy.        While the list above is far from exhaustive, these are       examples of impacts we are seeing all too frequently.                    a. Our position on Specific Amendments         Please note that while we do not specifically address every       Amendment, several of these are unrelated to recreational       usages and outside our expertise to discuss in a meaningful       manner. While we are not opposed to any of the Amendments on       the list, we are not taking a position.        1. Rep. Boebert 30x30 Program Nullification Amendment #18:        Vigorously support. This Executive Order is a direct       conflict with multiple mandates that have managed public       lands successfully for decades. Not only does this EO       conflict with these mandates, the application of these       concepts to private property rights and interests is even       more troubling.        2. Rep. Boebert--BLM headquarters--Amendment #16:        Vigorously support. Moving BLM national headquarters closer       to lands owned and managed by BLM has greatly increased the       responsiveness of the BLM to a wide range of issues. This       amendment has garnered strong bipartisan support.        3. Rep. Boebert Native Americans, Other Minorities and       Women Jobs Protection Act-- Amendment #60:        No position.        4. Rep. Boebert CO, AZ, CA, WA Wilderness Study Act       Amendment #56:        Vigorously support. The lingering designations around the       Wilderness process create significant management challenges       moving forward in areas that have never been suitable for       designation as Wilderness. The loss of historical       recreational opportunities due to the lingering designation       of the West Needles WSA was a major issue driving the Hermosa       Creek legislation.                                   ____                                      Board of County Commissioners,                                      Archuleta County, Colorado,                              Pagosa Springs, CO, February 24, 2021.        To Whom It May Concern: The Archuleta County Board of       County Commissioners is opposed to H.R. 803, the ``Protecting       America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act''. This bill would       lock-up nearly 1.5 million acres with new wilderness       designations. We agree with Congressman Doug Lamborn's       statements that the American people deserve to access our       nation's public lands--not to be locked out of them and that       a wilderness designation does not guarantee the protection of       these lands.        We support Congresswoman Lauren Boebert's amendments to the       bill and ask that the House allow local governments to make       the right decisions for their communities, especially when it       comes to managing our beautiful outdoors.        Please feel free to contact us if you want to discuss this       matter further. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely yours,                                                      Alvin Schaaf,      Chairman, Board of County Commissioners.                                   ____                                                 Grand Junction Area                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                                  February 24, 2021.      Congresswoman Lauren Boebert,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Boebert: On behalf of the 900 small       businesses employing 37,000 people that the Grand Junction       Area Chamber of Commerce represents, I am writing to       encourage you to oppose H.R. 803, a bill that would lock up       public lands in Mesa County and negatively impact our local       economy. Our community's economy is still reliant in part on       the business activity generated by our legacy industries of       agriculture and energy. This bill if passed will negatively       impact our already fragile economy and jeopardize our       economic recovery.        These are lands that are literally in our backyard in Mesa       County yet Congresswoman DeGette continues to ignore us, does       not meet with us, and does not even consider the consequences       of her bill on the hardworking families of our areas.        In addition to opposing H.R. 803 our organization supports       the various amendments you are proposing be added to the bill       that include keeping the BLM Headquarters in Grand Junction,       Colorado, requiring that affected counties must approve the       Wilderness Designation and protects grazing and water rights.        We appreciate your efforts to help retain jobs and the       diversity of our local economy by opposing H.R. 803 and       offering amendments to help preserve the livelihood of our       families and our way of life.            Sincerely,                                                    Diane Schwenke,      President/CEO.                                   ____                                            San Juan Trail Riders,                                                        Durango, CO,      Congresswoman Lauren Boebert,      Attn: Jeff Smalls & Ashley Higgins,      Washington, DC.      Re 2021 Omnibus Wilderness & Amendments.         Dear Jeff and Ashley: Please accept this correspondence as       support of comments submitted by Trails Preservation Alliance       (``TPA''), Colorado Off Highway Vehicle Coalition       (``COHVCO''), and Colorado Snowmobile Association (``CSA'')       in their vigorously opposing the CORE Wilderness Proposal       (H.R. 803) and the Colorado Wilderness Act (H.R. 577).        San Juan Trail Riders (``SJTR'') is a single-track       motorized trail user group that has a membership of nearly       400 members within the Four Corners Area, California and       Texas. These members provide significant positive economic       impacts to a broad range of businesses and communities in       cities and towns throughout the region. The organization has       for over 30 years provided significant support to agencies       like the BLM and USFS for recreational single-track motorized       trail construction, maintenance and repair. Additionally,       this agency is responsible for helping to  [[Page H754]]       establish special grant applications from existing state OHV       Funds. SJTR has headquarters in Durango, CO.            Submitted by,                                                        Deric Hook,      Board Member, San Juan Trail Riders.                                   ____                                                        Mesa County,                                          Board of Commissioners,                              Grand Junction, CO, February 25, 2021.      Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021, H.R. 803.       Hon. Diana DeGette,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative DeGette: As the Board of County       Commissioners (``Board'') for Mesa County, Colorado, we are       again writing in strong opposition to the Colorado Wilderness       Act of 2021, H.R. 803 (``the Act''). Mesa County's opposition       to additional Wilderness designation within Mesa County is       clearly documented in ``A Resolution of the Board Of County       Commissioners of Mesa County, Colorado Opposing the Colorado       Wilderness Act of 2015 (H.R. 3336) and Calling on Congress to       Release All Wilderness Study Areas in Colorado'' (attached)       passed and adopted on September 21, 2015, and the letter of       opposition to the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019, dated June       24, 2019 (attached).        Wilderness designations are the most restrictive land       management tool available and are in direct conflict with the       multiple use mandate of our federally managed lands. As       federally managed lands, these areas are subject to       customized protections through various designations       identified in area resource management plans, including       prohibition of grazing, seasonal travel limitations and       closures, and oil and gas lease stipulations.        Mesa County supports less restrictive federal designations       that involve appropriate, special management protections       determined through responsible land use planning that allow       stakeholders to work together to identify and address issues       with local solutions for each unique area, rather than a       broad-brush approach that ends multiple use of these lands in       perpetuity.        The Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021 egregiously fails to       take into account several important considerations concerning       necessary access, such as:        1. Three of the five proposed Wilderness areas in Mesa       County have experienced wildfires over the past two decades.       Lack of access for wildfire mitigation, proper       extinguishment, and post-fire restoration increases the       probability and severity of devastating wildfires. Lack of       access also compounds the potential for life-safety       emergencies as responding personnel will be obstructed when       answering time-sensitive calls.        2. Based on the mapping provided by the Colorado Oil and       Gas Commission, the proposed Little Book Cliffs Wilderness       polygon includes the Laramie Energy, LLC Winter Flats well       and the Maralex Resources, Inc. USA-610S98W well. These wells       will need ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Should access       be denied for these wells and the leases within the proposed       Wilderness areas, the lessee should be fairly compensated.        3. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as the agency       responsible for the health and well being of the wild horses       of the Little Book Cliffs Wild Horse Area and their habitat,       must access to this area to ``sustain a healthy viable wild       horse population while maintaining a thriving natural       ecological balance of resources and uses.'' The BLM utilizes       vehicles, and at times helicopters, for set-up and take down       of traps and transportation of gathered horses, and to       perform fertility control measures. Loss of access for these       events could lead to serious consequences for the wild       horses, area habitat, and surrounding property owners.        4. More than 850 acres of Gunnison Sage-Grouse Habitat are       included in the proposed South Bangs Canyon Proposed       Wilderness area and The Palisade Proposed Wilderness area       which could limit management activities, lek counting, and       habitat restoration activities by the US Fish and Wildlife       Service.        5. Non-motorized trail based recreation is critical for our       region's quality of life and economy. The potential for       exclusion of mechanized travel, e.g. bicycles, from thousands       of acres of public lands in western Colorado is not supported       by the Board. Of particular concern is the North and South       Bangs Canyon Proposed Wilderness areas. Given the proximity       to and importance of the Tabeguache Trail, the region is of       interest to local trail groups for future trail based       recreation growth.        6. The Act eliminates ``development for any new irrigation       and pumping facility, reservoir, water conservation work,       aqueduct, canal, ditch, pipeline, well, hydropower project,       transmission, other ancillary facility or other water,       diversion, storage, or carriage structure'' in the Wilderness       designation. As Colorado's water resources require more       astute management, eliminating the option to create and       expand necessary water storage and delivery systems and the       ability to improve critical drainages and watersheds       indefinitely is imprudent.        In addition to ending critical access and multiple use of       public lands, the Board believes Wilderness designations       also:        1. unfairly discriminates against those that are unable to       walk or ride horseback, including those with disabilities and       the elderly;        2. creates additional hardships on adjacent property       owners, lessees, and other nonrecreation users who face       restricted travel; and,        3. abolishes future productive uses of all resources within       the designated area, including those that enrich residents       and visitors' lives, in perpetuity.        Mesa County is comprised of more than 72% public lands. Our       economy and way of life are deeply reliant on these lands,       and ensuring the proper management of them is of the highest       concern for all who live here. To suggest that anyone in Mesa       County would wish these lands destroyed is false and       offensive. However, with more than 100,000 acres of       designated Wilderness and more than 80,000 acres held in       perpetual Wilderness Study Area limbo, residents of Mesa       County do not want to see more of their public lands made       inaccessible. Further, with the possible passage of the       Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act (``CORE Act''),       Colorado will see varying levels of conservation in counties       that desire such protections.        We invite you to visit Mesa County and speak with those       directly affected by the proposed legislation. Our door is       always open, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss       further this critical matter that can drastically change our       residents' lives.            Sincerely,      Janet Rowland,        Chair, Board of County Commissioners.      Cody Davis,        Commissioner.      Scott McInnis,        Commissioner.                                   ____                                                  February 25, 2021.      The Honorable,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the nearly six million       Farm Bureau member families across the United States, we       write in strong opposition to H.R. 803, the Protecting       America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. Collectively this       package of bills impacts lands in California, Colorado,       Arizona and Washington by creating nearly 1.5 million acres       of new wilderness, the most restrictive federal land use       classification. Additionally, it would designate 1,200 miles       of wild and scenic rivers and create 110,000 acres of       National Monument expansion. Further, many of the wilderness       and wild and scenic river designations contained in this bill       are not suitable for these restrictive designations. To       declare areas that do not possess these characteristics       undermines the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild       and Scenic Rivers Act as well as the lands that possess those       features.        Farmers and ranchers rely on federal forests and rangelands       for economic and recreational opportunities. Livestock       grazing on federal lands forms an integral part of ranching       operations across the United States, especially in the West.       But farmers also use national forests and rangelands       throughout the United States in a variety of other ways.       Federal lands throughout the country are important components       of our nation's watersheds that provide water to a large       number of Americans. Active land management practices such as       timber production and livestock grazing are critical to       protect against wildland fires which devastate range       resources, damage watersheds, threaten wildlife and put rural       communities at great risk.        American farmers and ranchers have a genuine interest in       healthy and productive federal forest and rangelands. At the       same time, we have a genuine interest in seeing lands managed       in an environmentally sound manner. Farmers and ranchers       understand and appreciate that active management of our       federal lands is critical to the long-term viability of the       ecosystem, the resource, and the communities they support.       Designations included in H.R. 803 threaten multiple use areas       by prohibiting the employment of motorized tools and       mechanized vehicles in watershed management, trail       maintenance, soil treatment, noxious weed control, waste       management and fire protection.        Our nation's federal forests are facing serious threats       from fires, insects and disease due to a lack of active       forest management. The poor health of our federal forests       also threatens wildlife populations and neighboring non-      federal lands, as well as the vitality of rural, forested       communities across the country. A vibrant livestock and       forest products industry helps diversify rural economies in       ways that compliment ranching and agricultural operations.       Wilderness and National Monument designations eliminate       federal land management agencies ability to effectively       protect against the threat of catastrophic wildland fire.        Farmers, landowners, and grazing permitees should be fully       involved as affected partners in any process to execute       federal land use designations which restrict public use and       access. Federal land use designations that lack local       stakeholder input from agricultural and resource management       professionals often generates significant controversy and       economic hardship at the local level. The detrimental effects       of a federal land use designation frequently causes       residents, elected state and county officials, and local       stakeholders significant reductions in economic activity and       the loss of jobs in rural communities. Past designations have       also affected water rights, public lands grazing and access       to State and private lands.        Farm Bureau supports the multiple-use concept of federal       lands, recognizing that definable land areas have dominant-      use capability, which should be recognized with the  [[Page H755]]       concept of multiple uses without the total exclusion of other       uses. The Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands       Act stands in clear violation of AFBF policy. Additionally,       the California, Colorado, Arizona and Washington Farm       Bureau's oppose passage of this legislation.        Farm Bureau urges you to oppose passage of H.R. 803, the       Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.            Sincerely,        American Farm Bureau Federation, Arizona Farm Bureau,       California Farm Bureau, Colorado Farm Bureau, Washington Farm       Bureau.     Mr. Speaker, Democrats have ignored our local  communities and their needs with this land grab.   In their letter of opposition, Mesa County points out three of the  five wilderness areas in Mesa County in this bill that have had large  fires in recent years, and that wilderness designations harm active  management and wildfire activities.   I hope that when Members visit my district on horseback, they are  telling people that this land will soon burn, because if we do not  actively manage our forest, Mother Nature will continue to manage it  for us.   Mr. Speaker, the amendments that are offered today would protect  energy production, local grazing rights, water rights, access to our  public lands, and allow wildfire mitigation. Perhaps, and most  importantly, these amendments give the people of my district a voice,  ensuring local officials have a seat at the table when land use is  changed in their respective counties.                                time  1015    The victory in my election showed the will of the people in  Colorado's Third District. They want to keep their land open for public  use.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Member for his thoughtful amendments, and I  strongly encourage support on these amendments today.
