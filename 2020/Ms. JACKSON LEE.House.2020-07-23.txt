 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  Jackson Lee Amendments to H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign Operations,  Agriculture, Rural Development, Interior, Environment, Military  Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.''   I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for making these  Jackson Lee amendments in order for House consideration of H.R. 7608.   These Jackson Lee Amendments are straightforward and make the bill  even better. I believe they would command the support of a majority of  the House and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of them.   The amendments are to the following divisions:   Division A--Department of State, Foreign Operations;   Division B--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration; and   Division C--Department of the Interior, Environment.             Division A--Department of State, Foreign Operations    Jackson Lee Amendment No. 11 will designate $1,000,000 to combat the  trafficking of endangered species.   My amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million focus  to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered species, to  confront the transport of the remains of killed endangered species.   The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being lured off a  protected preserve was an indication that we needed to do more to  protect endangered species at risk of being killed.  [[Page H3805]]    At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as  original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endangered and  Threatened Species Act of 2015.   This bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in  countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife  countries for protection.   The amendment offered is in the same spirit: to prohibit the taking  and transportation of any endangered and threatened species as a trophy  to the United States.   Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect most wildlife  animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise decisions  that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the warning  signs.   I believe this amendment is one that Members can support because it  would bring greater awareness and protection to these beautiful and  vital populations that are too often taken for granted, by allowing  this amendment to address the senseless trafficking in trophy killings  of all endangered and threatened species.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 provides funds to be allocate funds  provided for Global Health Programs to the fight against the practice  of Female Genital Mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, even working with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York to  introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia,  or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.   For example, consider that:   Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated/ cut every hour.   More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk of FGM/C,  annually.   The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   The United Nations adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals  for 2030 that includes a target to eliminate FGM/C and recognizing the  abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved because of a  comprehensive movement that involves all public and private  stakeholders in society.   With these provisions in place and my amendment increasing the  funding for foreign assistance we can ensure Female Genital Mutilation/ Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally recognized violation of the human  rights of girls and women comes to an end.   Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a report in 2016  estimating that 513,000 women and girls in the United States were at  risk or may have been subjected to FGM/C.   The presence of FGM/C in the United States brings a sobering truth to  light, that we still have much work to do here at home to stop our  young women and girls from suffering at the hands of this archaic and  utterly unnecessary practice.   I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu Jalloh, a 7-year-old from  Sierra Leone, who with her mother fled to Houston to seek a life saving  operation to rectify complications from the practice of FGM/C from  which she suffered for more than a year.   Due to complications from the FGM procedure, little Hadiatu could not  stop bleeding, she then underwent two additional nonmedical procedures  to repair the damage she suffered.   However, the bleeding continued and after the second procedure to  stop the bleeding, Hadiatu could not properly urinate and suffered  terrible pain.   In her desperate quest for help, Hadiatu's mother Umu took her  daughter across the border to Sierra Leone, but still could not find a  doctor to treat Hadiatu.   Dr. Hardwick-Smith a world-renowned board certified OBGYN--along with  a team led by Houston pediatric urologist Dr. Eric Jones--solved  Hadiatu's problem by removing scar tissue during the successful  surgery.   Stories such like this remind me of the importance of this work, and  how can we cannot afford to ignore any instance of FGM/C.   And that is why earlier we celebrated the International Day of Zero  Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, a multinational effort to  bring this practice to an end.   That is why my amendment reprograms funding that will be used by the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for elimination of  FGM/C.   The Jackson Lee Amendment increases funding to expedite the complete  and total elimination of FGM/C.   I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.          Division B--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug                               Administration    Jackson Lee Amendment No. 45 clarifies that nothing in the bill  restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any federal  agency head from providing assistance and benefits to victims of  trafficking as permitted by 22 U.S.C. 7105(b) of the Victims of  Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub.  Law 106-386).   Perpetrators of crime know that they are more likely to evade  detection and punishment when their victims refuse to assist or  cooperate with law enforcement. That is why they make it a point to  instill fear in their victims--for their own safety or that of family  and loved ones.   Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to  obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act.   Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked  worldwide--including right here in the United States.   It can happen in any community and victims can be any age, race,  gender, or nationality.   Traffickers might use violence, manipulation, or false promises of  well-paying jobs or romantic relationships to lure victims into  trafficking situations.   Language barriers, fear of their traffickers, and/ or fear of law  enforcement frequently keep victims from seeking help, making human  trafficking a hidden crime.   They look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons,  including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship,  lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political  instability.   The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may  not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly  public settings.   Recognizing key indicators of human trafficking and providing support  to victims so that traffickers are prosecuted is the first step in  ending this crime.   Victims are often alone and without resources to survive outside of a  trafficker's control.   Access to food programs is essential to escaping this terrible  existence.   I introduced this Jackson Lee amendment to provide food assistance to  victims of human trafficking no matter who they are or where they may  have come from.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 46 increases funding by $2,000,000 for the  USDA agency that provides grant research funding for ``1890s Land Grant  Universities,'' which are 28 Historically Black Colleges and  Universities.   The USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) works to  improve our nation's food production through agricultural research,  economic analysis, extension, and higher education.   The NIFA was created at the time of the industrial revolution to  ensure that the nation would have enough working farms to provide a  reliable supply of domestically produced food.   One of the ways NIFA achieves its mission is by providing research  grants to education institutions, which include 1890s institutions  created by the Morrill Act of 1890.   Today, land-grant colleges and universities can be found in 18  states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list  includes:   Alabama A&M University, Alcorn State University, Delaware State  University, Florida A&M University, Fort Valley State University,  Kentucky State University, Langston University, Lincoln University,  North Carolina A&T State University, Prairie View A&M University in  Texas, South Carolina State University, Southern University System,  Tennessee State University, Tuskegee University, University of Arkansas  Pine Bluff, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, University of the  District of Columbia, University of the Virgin Islands, Virginia State  University, West Virginia State University.   HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all African American students in  4-year colleges and universities.   HBCUs are prominent among research institutions in fields such as:  animal sciences, sustainable agriculture and agriculture economics,  toxicology and waste management, conservation and environmental  management, business and industrial development, biomedical  [[Page H3806]]  science, food and nutrition, plant and social sciences, international  development.   Research is essential to meeting the food needs of people not only in  the United States but around the world.   In the U.S. the demand for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as  concerns for the distance food travels before, it reaches tables in  urban areas has led to more research on how to improve urban farming.   Another aspect of research is improving the shelf life of fresh  fruits and vegetables to slow the process of spoilage, which has proven  to be one of the problems experienced during COVID-19 due to some  disruptions caused by food supply chain difficulties.   Extending shelf life of fresh fruits, and vegetables would also  reduce food waste and improve diets for people on limited incomes by  making fresh items will be as economical as canned or frozen.   HBCU agriculture research institutions are playing a role in bringing  urban farming to communities of color.   HCBU's agricultural research programs also assist people living in  densely populated areas to learn ways to eliminate food deserts,  increase public education regarding farming, develop a greater  appreciation for our nation's farmers, and provide new avenues for  careers for those graduating with agriculture degrees seeking to enter  into cutting edge agricultural research.   The funds provided by the Jackson Lee amendment would support  research and education into means for helping urban and suburban  communities maximize their green space by turning it into productive  farming resources to support access to affordable foods.   The funding can also help to develop new research efforts directed at  reducing food insecurity during a Pandemic or other crises that impact  the availability or affordability of food.   I ask for your support for these Jackson Lee Amendments.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentlewoman  for her generosity and for recognizing the importance of the work that  we are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to my amendments and thank the Rules  Committee for these amendments. I guess I have to speak very quickly.   We have been committed over the years to stopping the trafficking of  endangered species, and I am glad that I have established a focus on  protecting the endangered species like Cecil the lion.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee for that amendment, as well  as the amendment that I have been working on for many years to stop  female genital mutilation, to highlight the extensive amount of  mutilation in developing nations across the world.   I was also very pleased to have an amendment that provided for the  authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any Federal agency, to  stop them from eliminating assistance and benefits to victims of  trafficking as permitted by 22 U.S.C. 7105.   We know that victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable,  and my city of Houston has been the epicenter of human trafficking.    Mr. Speaker, I want to also applaud the fact that I  was able to get an amendment in that increases the funding by $2  million, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for the 1890s  land-grant colleges, which are 28 historically Black colleges. It helps  those who are in food deserts.   And, Mr. Speaker, my district has now some percentage of COVID-19 who  are, in essence, underwater, suffering, and food distribution, or the  lack of food, is very evident.   We have suffered in my region with toxic poisoning from chemicals,  and we now have $5 million that has been in the Department of the  Interior to highlight the need to support culturally competent Federal,  State, and local public health and environmental protection efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Fifth Ward Texas that they have been  heard in the Halls of the United States Congress; they will not any  longer be contaminated by creosote and having the numbers of cancers  that they have experienced, as I have knocked on doors and had people  telling me about their families dying because the railroad's creosote  contaminated their backyards and the trees that they grew and the fruit  that they grew.   How horrendous that we would have that.   I am very glad that our amendments were included in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, the chairwoman has been enormously  gracious for me to be able to conclude my remarks by indicating again  the importance of the historically Black colleges getting an extra $2  million; emphasizing that Fifth Ward Texas, the home of Barbara Jordan  and Mickey Leland, older neighborhoods in the historically minority  communities, won't suffer any longer by toxic poisoning because of  chemicals that have been placed without care; and to be able to thank  them, as well, for taking care of the endangered species and those who  are trafficked and those, as well, with female genital mutilation.   Mr. Speaker, I close my remarks by simply saying the COVID-19 dollars  are needed. I thank the chairwoman for that. We are suffering in  Houston, and we are going to fight to stop community spread by more  testing, more testing, more testing.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 84 to H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign  Operations, Agriculture, Rural Development, Interior, Environment,  Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.   I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for making this  Jackson Lee amendment in order for House consideration of H.R. 7608.   This Jackson Lee Amendment is straightforward and makes the bill even  better. I believe they would command the support of a majority of the  House and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of them.   The amendment is to Division C--Department of the Interior,  Environment.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 84 provides $5 million to highlight the  need to support culturally competent federal, state, and local public  health and environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters  impacting overburdened communities in the gulf coast region, which is  home to a refinery row that runs from Mobile to Houston Texas.   In the 18th Congressional District Creosote contamination in my  district has had long term consequences for the residents of the 5th  Ward.   I have worked for years to address Environmental Justice issues in  and around my District, by bringing agencies and communities together  for meaningful dialogues.   In April of 2019, I held a meeting between residents, local public  health and Union Pacific Railroad regarding contamination in the 5th  Ward area of Houston. Predecessor R.R. was South Pacific   The meeting was to discuss letters that Union Pacific sent to  residents informing them that they could not dig water wells in their  yards due to creosote contamination.   During this meeting residents expressed frustration at not getting  questions answered regarding their concerns about the safety of water  and soil due to the contamination and the alarming number of cancers  occurring among residents.   After hearing the discussion, I asked about a study to investigate  the situation and provide answers to residents.   A cancer cluster study was performed by the Texas Department of State  Health Services and found that there is a higher incidence of certain  types of cancers and cancer deaths among residents of Kashmere Gardens  and the Fifth Ward.   Southern Pacific operated the open pit of creosote in the residential  area that treated railroad ties and light post for decades.   Southern Pacific was acquired by Union Pacific, which continued to  operate a wood treatment facility, dipping railroad ties in the  preservative creosote.   The creosote emitted fumes, leached into the soil and ran through  ditches when it rained or flooded.   Union Pacific closed their creosote treatment capacity, but the  damage remained, because creosote is comprised of chemicals that in  combination are listed as a hazardous substance by the Environmental  Protection Agency.   To address the contamination Union Pacific requested and approved  largely to leave the contamination in the ground without pursuing more  extensive cleanup efforts, which has left residents battling to get  regulators to force the company to take more responsibility for the  thick mass of creosote that lurks beneath their properties.   These residents are right--the soil and water are killing them with  cancer and Union Pacific has got to take strong action to remove this  clear health threat that is causing cancers of the:   Lung and Bronchus;   Esophagus;   Larynx (throat);   Liver; and   Acute Myeloid Leukemia.   Rare is the case that a community meeting results in such a profound  finding that and exposed an urgent need that should be addressed given  the science behind the causes of cancer and the steps that much be  taken to limit risks.   There are other communities throughout the Gulf Coast that may have  creosote contamination linked to old railroad lines that may not be  given the level of attention needed to address health risks.   Funding provided by this amendment will provide resources for those  communities with cancer clusters.  [[Page H3818]]    I ask for your support for this Jackson Lee Amendment, which is  needed to save lives.    Mr. Speaker, sometimes it is very difficult to  respond to something that is so much out of the ordinary, but I rise  today to refer to my colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and to make  mention of the incident that occurred where she was described in  unflattering words.   Those words were denigrating to a woman. They were equally  denigrating to women of color.   One's views in this place are protected by the Constitution and  protected by the First Amendment, but it is particularly sad when one's  particular gender is called out and degraded, for women have been the  backbone of this Nation. They have helped  [[Page H3830]]  build this country. They serve in the United States military.   Our Member of Congress from The Bronx, New York, has equally been  elected by her constituents, and deserves the kind of respect and  understanding that all of those who take the oath deserve. I am  appalled by the words that were used against her.   I stand with her remarks of expression of the right to have different  views, and I also stand with her as a woman who would respect that  service and that unique service that we who have come to this place  where we could not be for many, many years to serve, she should be  allowed to serve, and serve in dignity.                            ____________________
