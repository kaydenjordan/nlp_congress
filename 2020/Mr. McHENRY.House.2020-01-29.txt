 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill before us. This is a  Democrat bill under the guise of consumer protection that will destroy  the accuracy and completeness of consumer credit files. This will lead  to a weaker financial system, undermining a great deal of safety and  soundness that we have built up over decades. This will, in essence,  socialize credit scoring and, therefore, credit allocation.   Mr. Chairman, this is an election year. I see that, and I see that  not just in the rhetoric here in the House but in the legislation that  is before us today.   This bill will weaken underwriting standards. It will make extending  credit a riskier and more expensive activity, ultimately impacting both  the cost and accessibility of credit for all Americans.   Let me be clear. For more than 1 year now, I have made the same  statement on the House floor when the House Financial Services  Committee has a bill here on the floor. Committee Republicans stand  ready to work with the Democrats on issues that are important to the  American people, and this bill is a prime example of this. We support  policies that create jobs, grow our economy, and make our Nation more  secure.   Today is no different. Republicans want to work with Democrats to  help all consumers, especially consumers who may be struggling to  access the necessary credit to apply for a home loan or replace a  broken washing machine or perhaps even start a small business.   We want to reach a bipartisan compromise to reform the Fair Credit  Reporting Act, or FCRA. We want to find a compromise that meaningfully  helps consumers and, at the same time, stands a chance of being signed  into law.   This bill is not that. I fear my colleagues have thrown out  bipartisanship in favor of satisfying political allies in an election  year.   This bill socializes credit modeling giving, the CFPB, an  unaccountable bureau within the government, the ability to develop,  maintain, and regulate credit modeling and factors used in analysis.   You will have politicians making the decisions on how credit is  scored, Mr. Chairman. That is a dangerous thing and something in the  United States we should not stand for.   This bill prevents employers from knowing the creditworthiness of  employees. This creates a situation in which employees who are in  significant debt could be targets of bribes or extortion or perhaps  take money that is owed to other people.   This bill creates a boon for the trial lawyers, creating new  reinvestigation and appeals processes to be exploited by the trial bar.   This bill diminishes the value of a credit score as a determining  factor in extending credit--I don't think that is a secondary fact; I  think that is the primary goal of this bill--by removing past credit  scores after 2 years from a report and prohibiting those scores within  the 2-year period from being used as a factor.   This bill also arbitrarily changes the time period negative  information, such as a missed payment, remain on a consumer's credit  report.  [[Page H655]]    This bill makes it more difficult for private lenders to compete in  the student loan industry by allowing delinquent borrowers or a  borrower who has defaulted on a loan to rehabilitate their credit  outside of the contractual terms.   This bill imposes unfunded mandates on the private sector to really  an unprecedented degree.   These provisions make clear what Democrats want to accomplish in this  bill. They want to socialize credit and the models underlying credit  allocation. This bill takes credit reporting out of the hands of the  private sector and gives it to the government.   Let me be clear. I am no fan of the large credit reporting agencies,  also known as CRAs. In fact, during our one hearing on this topic last  February, nearly 1 year ago at this point--I use the term loosely--that  we discussed this bill, because it was just a discussion draft and much  different from what we have before us. But in that hearing, we didn't  discuss the implications of this bill or the FCRA. I made it clear at  that hearing that I share the chairwoman's concerns with the credit  reporting agencies, their lack of competition, and their oligopoly. In  fact, there were aspects of the original discussion draft of this bill  that are not part of what we have today that I thought had merit and  should be explored in greater detail.   For example, I have concerns that CRAs' operations are not as  consumer-friendly as they could be or should be. Moreover, not once  after that hearing did the committee consult with additional subject  matter experts on the inefficiencies, ineffectiveness, or improvements  needed to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Not once after that February  hearing did we discuss how to make CRAs work better for the consumer.  Not once did we have real bipartisan discussions about what we could  achieve and get signed into law.   This is something that both Republicans and Democrats actually agree  on, the need to reform this process. I agree that we should be  disclosing public record data sources. I agree we should exclude paid  medically necessary medical debt from consumer credit reports. I agree  we should prohibit certain adverse information resulting from financial  abuse or predatory lending from being included in consumer credit  reports.    In fact, the substitute amendment I filed with the Rules Committee  that was not made in order this day includes the bipartisan reform I  described and more.   Committee Republicans support reforms such as prohibiting the use of  Social Security numbers to verify consumers. Now, this is a primary  source and a primary ingredient for identity fraud. We should take  action there, and I think we can.   Committee Republicans also support facilitating online credit freezes  and the removal of credit files for minors and children. We also  support studying the use of nontraditional data in credit scoring as  well as codifying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's, or the  CFPB's, credit reporting registry.   I think there are things that we can do. Bipartisanship is within our  grasp. All my colleagues have to do is reach out and grab it.   As I said, Republicans stand ready to work with Democrats to help  consumers. But this bill is about socializing credit and credit  allocation, and this bill is not the answer to the consumers'  challenge. In fact, the Democrats' bill will only hurt the very  consumers we are trying to help.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this socialization of  credit reporting and vote ``no'' on this bill. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is the ranking member of the Consumer  Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the Republican ranking member of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), my colleague from Weatherford.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I submit for the Record page 114 of the bill, and I  would highlight these sections, line 4, ``Maintenance of Credit  Scores.''   ``Subsection A: In General. All consumer credit reporting agencies  shall maintain the consumer's file credit scores relating to the  consumer for a period of 2 years from the date on which such  information is generated.   ``Subsection B: Disclosure Only to Consumers. A past credit score  maintained in a consumer's file pursuant to subparagraph A may only be  provided to the consumer to which the credit score relates and may not  be included in a consumer report or used as a factor in generating a  credit score or educational credit score.   ``Subsection C: Removal of the Past Credit Scores. A past credit  score maintained in a consumer's file pursuant to subparagraph A shall  be removed from the consumer's file after the end of the 2-year period  described under subparagraph A.''   This is the section of the bill that says that your consumer credit  report can only be 2 years old--your score. Now, the data can be  longer, but your score can only use 2 years of past data.   That is deeply problematic because, as we know, these things are more  long-run occurrences. Creditworthiness doesn't happen overnight, nor do  somebody's riskier habits happen overnight.   So for a 2-year period, we have not seen any testimony why 2 years is  sufficient. The current industry standard is much longer than that, but  each different user of this credit information can determine for  themselves what that appropriate time is, and that is not mandated by  current law.                                time  1400    So I find this troublesome, and problematic, and riskier than what we  currently have in the law; and that is one of the components of this  bill that I oppose. There are numerous other examples, but I know we  will have more debate and I will be able to bring up those exact  details as those on the other side tout the so-called benefits.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record three documents in opposition to this bill.  The first is a letter to Chairwoman Waters and to me from the Consumer  Data Industry Association expressing their opposition to this bill.                             Consumer Data Industry Association,                                   Washington, DC, January 23, 2020.      Hon. Maxine Waters, Chairwoman,      Hon. Patrick McHenry, Ranking Member,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On       behalf of the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), I       want to share our opposition to H.R. 3621, the       ``Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020.'' This approximately 200-      page bill would impose new costs to consumers and the economy       and negatively impact credit underwriting standards. We       request that House Members vote no when the bill is       considered.        As the trade association representing companies who provide       consumer reporting services, we and our members strive to       ensure that consumer credit reports are accurate, the       information within them is protected and consumers are       empowered to correct inaccurate information in a timely and       straightforward fashion. Our member companies work constantly       to improve the consumer reporting system by making technology       and process improvements to enhance accuracy and improve the       consumer experience.                                   Overview         The negative outcomes of H.R. 3621 would strike consumers,       community banks, credit unions, automobile dealers, mortgage       lenders, other non-bank lenders, data furnishers, employees       and employers, insurers, property owners and consumer       reporting agencies (CRAs). This legislation makes extensive       and complicated changes to the consumer reporting industry       and the rights and obligations established under the Fair       Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and will affect the entire       credit allocation and risk management ecosystem; the bill is       not solely targeted at CRAs.        In previous instances when Congress considered major FCRA       changes, extensive hearings were held in the House and       Senate, featuring consumers, regulators, the consumer       reporting industry, data contributors and end users of credit       reports, such as banks and retailers. In the past, this has       resulted in legislation that was supported by most       stakeholders and bi-partisan Congressional majorities. The       legislation in this Congress was taken up by Committee after       only a single hearing last February, which was not focused on       specific legislative issues. We believe proceeding without       additional scrutiny is a mistake, given the bill's complexity       and its impact.        Consumer reports are a critical driver of economic growth       and opportunity. Our economy relies on the ability of CRAs to       interact with lenders, employers, insurers and others to       enable consumers to access low-cost credit, employment       opportunities and housing. The Federal Reserve noted, for       example, that ``[a]vailable evidence indicates that [credit       report] data and the credit-scoring models derived from them       have substantially improved the overall quality of credit       decisions and have reduced the costs of such decision-making.       Almost certainly, consumers would receive less credit and the       price of the credit they received would be higher, if not for       the information provided by credit reporting companies.''       Current law provides consumers with a robust set of       protections and rights. Ongoing debates regarding consumer       privacy have shown that many, including consumer advocates,       identify the FCRA as an example of effective consumer       protection legislation and a model for other segments of the       economy.        In 2010, Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which established       the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). That law       gave CFPB authority over much of the consumer reporting       system, and since then, oversight by the Bureau has resulted       in significant improvements within the consumer reporting       system; CRAs, furnishers and users of credit reports have       adopted multiple changes increasing consumer report accuracy       and improving the consumer dispute process.        If H.R. 3621 were to become law, consumers who pay their       bills on time and manage their debts responsibly will pay       more for credit than they do today. Consumers who have faced       challenges with their credit will be worse off as well, as       banks will lose the ability to accurately judge their credit       history because key information will no longer appear on       reports. The economy will suffer, as credit decisions will be       based on fewer facts, and lenders will be forced to increase       prices or reduce the amount of consumer credit available.        The legislation to be considered was passed by the       Committee on Financial Services as six bills, now embodied in       H.R. 3621. We communicated our concerns in a letter on July       6, 2019. Those concerns continue to be valid; the following       highlights some of the concerns we raised then.     The second document is a letter to Members of the House  of Representatives expressing opposition to each of the bills that was  included in this overarching bill, including opposition to: H.R. 3621,  H.R. 3614, H.R. 3618, H.R. 3622, H.R. 3642, from the United States  Chamber of Commerce.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                                   January 27, 2020.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly opposes H.R. 3621, the       ``Comprehensive Credit Act of 2020,'' which is composed of a       number of bills regarding credit reporting that were reported       out of the House Financial Services Committee in 2019.        The Chamber has previously expressed opposition to each of       the bills below which are now included as part of this       comprehensive package:        H.R. 3621, the ``Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act,''       would arbitrarily remove repayment information regarding       student loans issued by private lenders. Reducing the quality       of information in credit reports would in the aggregate       reduce their utility, making it more difficult for consumers       to access credit or other services.        H.R. 3614, the ``Restricting Use of Credit Checks for       Employment Decisions Act,'' would restrict an employer from       initiating a credit check of an employee despite the fact       that the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires an employee to       first provide consent. This legislation would make it more       difficult for employers to review the backgrounds of       prospective employees, which would make it more difficult to       hire for sensitive positions or would otherwise delay the       hiring process.        H.R. 3618, the ``Free Credit Scores for Consumers Act,''       would require credit bureaus to pay for and disclose for free       a credit scoring model that is owned by a third party. Credit       bureaus already provide ample information to consumers at no       charge to assist them with understanding their credit       standing. The legislation would make it more difficult for       credit bureaus to provide for the accurate flow of useful       information between consumers, furnishers, and entities that       need to make informed decisions.        H.R. 3622, the ``Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit and       Protecting Consumers Act,'' would reduce the quality of       credit reports by arbitrarily reducing the term of adverse       information and instituting redundant remediation mechanisms.       Disrupting the utility of information in credit reports would       make it more difficult for credit providers, and nonfinancial       entities such as telecommunications companies and utilities       to efficiently provide their services to consumers.        H.R. 3642, the ``Improving Credit Reporting for All       Consumers Act,'' would create dispute resolution requirements       that are redundant to services voluntarily provided by credit       bureaus and existing requirements under both the Fair Credit       Reporting Act and a recent agreement among 38 State Attorneys       General. Additionally, the legislation would frustrate the       ability of credit bureaus to provide information to consumers       by imposing new restrictions on the marketing of products       intended to improve credit standing.        H.R. 3629, the ``Clarity in Credit Score Formation Act of       2019,'' would make the CFPB, not lenders, the de facto       underwriter of consumer loans and is redundant to existing       supervisory and regulatory authority. The CFPB currently       supervises larger participants in consumer reporting under       its authority in the Dodd-Frank Act and has broad regulatory       authority via enforcement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.       Interference in the proprietary models developed by credit       bureaus and used by lenders would increase lenders' risk and       decrease their ability to provide objective information.        The Chamber urges you to oppose the Comprehensive Credit       Act.            Sincerely,                                                   Neil L. Bradley.     And finally, I include in the Record Statement of  Administration Policy that says that the President would veto this  bill.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 3621--Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020--Rep. Pressley, D-MA, and                          Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY         The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 3621, the       Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020. The Administration supports       measures to increase access to affordable consumer credit,       but H.R. 3621 would do the opposite by reducing the       efficiency of consumer lending markets and raising the cost       of consumer credit.        H.R. 3621 would preclude credit reporting agencies from       incorporating a range of relevant data into consumer reports,       which would reduce their predictive value and raise borrowing       costs for responsible borrowers. This legislation would also       prevent the Federal Government from reporting information       regarding debts arising out of criminal monetary penalties.       Additionally, H.R. 3621  [[Page H660]]       would empower the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to       control the development of credit-scoring models, which would       hinder market competition that drives innovation and improves       modeling. Finally, this legislation would interfere with the       ability of employers, including executive branch agencies, to       make reasonable background investigation determinations with       respect to candidates for sensitive positions.        If H.R. 3621 were presented to the President, his senior       advisors would recommend that he veto it.     Mr. Chairman, I might offer to the chair of the  committee at some point to frame the Statement of Administration Policy  on vetoes of some of her bills this Congress. That may be a badge of  honor. I say that in a lighthearted manner, not in an aggressive way,  for sure.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, this is a partisan bill under the guise of  consumer protection that will destroy the accuracy and completeness of  consumer credit files.   Moreover, this bill continues the Democrats' trend of failing to  address the underlying causes of the student loan crisis; the  underlying causes of medical debt; the underlying causes of  homelessness.   Instead, this bill will jeopardize credit for low and middle-income  Americans disproportionately; Americans who fight to pay their bills  each month; make good on their obligations; and have taken the time to  improve their financial situations over time and become eligible for  credit.   What my colleagues fail to understand is this: This bill will weaken  underwriting standards. That strikes at safety and soundness. It will  make extending credit riskier and more expensive for consumers,  ultimately impacting both the costs and accessibility of credit for all  Americans.   This bill alters the very foundation for extending credit in our  financial system which is the ability to assess risk.   This bill will drive us to a riskier financial situation and  financial system. It is a bad bill.   This bill that we are considering today will fundamentally alter the  way credit is extended in this country, and not for the better.   So let's be clear on what this bill does. It socializes credit  modeling and reporting.   This bill gives the CFPB the ability to develop, maintain, and  regulate credit modeling and factors used in analysis.   This bill prevents employers from knowing the creditworthiness of  employees.   This bill is a giveaway to trial attorneys, creating four new re- investigation and appeals processes to be exploited by the trial bar.   This bill will make it more difficult for private lenders to compete  in the student loan industry dominated by the Federal Government by  allowing delinquent borrowers or borrowers who have defaulted on a loan  to make changes to their credit outside of the contractual obligations  and contractual terms they have agreed to.   As I said earlier, bipartisan compromise was within reach. All my  colleagues had to do was reach out and grab it. Instead, they chose to  push through another partisan bill that is going nowhere in the Senate  and will be vetoed--if it were to even make it through the United  States Senate--vetoed by the President.   And this has been a tremendous waste of time for the American people,  a tremendous waste of time, when we have very important issues to  wrestle with as a Congress and as a country.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on socializing credit  reporting.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, let me first say I oppose any disparate  treatment of any person or population. That has no place in our society  or our communities.   To that end, the data derived from this study would have been helpful  to have had before we drafted a bill or we brought it to the House  floor. I think it is important data for us to consider here as we make  law.   The underlying bill removes important predictive information from  consumer credit reports that helps lenders in assessing a borrower's  ability to repay. Undermining this responsibility makes it riskier and  more expensive for lenders to extend credit, which, ultimately,  increases the cost for consumers. Now, that is problematic; but that is  the bill, and the bill is problematic.   Buying a home is the biggest purchase that most Americans will make  in their lifetime. And while the study is fine and will give us more  data, it does nothing to make mortgages more affordable or available  for those consumers who desire homeownership. The fact is the  underlying bill will make mortgages even more expensive for consumers  and consumer credit more expensive for those who seek it.   As I said, I am not opposed to this amendment, but more data is  obviously always useful.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as I said in the previous statement, this  study would have been helpful to have informed our analysis prior to  drafting and debating this bill.   But there is a broader theme fundamental to this amendment and many  of the amendments that will be offered later in this debate: My  Democrat colleagues are not fully satisfied with their effort back in  2010 that nationalized the student loan program. They are coming back  for the final 8 percent.   It was the Democrat Congress and Democrat President that nationalized  the student loan marketplace, and now they want to do away with this  small portion, the 8 percent of the marketplace, that is private  student lending.   In fact, the private educational loans, while only 8 percent of the  market, if you look at how they perform, they have a 98 percent  repayment rate, which is far better than the nationalized 92 percent of  the student loan marketplace. Meanwhile, Federal student loan default  rates are in the double digits.   This is simply an attempt to gather data to be used to make it more  difficult for private lenders to compete in the student loan market.   The fact is the underlying bill still removes important predictive  information from consumer credit reports that helps lenders assess a  borrower's ability to repay.                                time  1430    The underlying bill will weaken underwriting standards and make  credit more expensive, especially for those who are on the margins,  ultimately harming the very consumers we want to help.   As I said, I am not opposed to the amendment. More data is useful and  good, and the GAO provides a wonderful resource for Congress in this  data collection. So with that, as I said, more data is useful.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from South Carolina, the  second newest member of the Financial Services Committee, for offering  this good, thoughtful amendment.   This amendment will give us a better picture of the consent orders  that impact credit reporting agencies, including the CFPB's consent  orders related to marketing and sale of services.   This is a good amendment in what is otherwise a bad bill.   Often in legislating, we try to make bad bills less bad or not-so- good bills good, but I am grateful that Mr. Timmons offered this  amendment and grateful for his participation representing upstate South  Carolina and being a sound policymaker.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment epitomizes what is wrong with  the approach taken by the majority in this bill.   This amendment is about socializing credit score models and putting  that power within the government, and clearance from the government in  order to use different models.   In short, this amendment says, if you don't like the outcome of  something, we will just have the CFPB lean in and deem it  inappropriate.   That is what it is about.   This amendment directs the CFPB to review the reasons a class of  consumers may have been negatively impacted by a newly introduced  credit scoring model and determine whether the model is inappropriate.   I would say to my colleague, this amendment appears to be duplicative  of the authority already given, already vested in the CFPB's  organizational statute and in the underlying bill for the CFPB to  intervene in private-sector decisions.   I would also further ask the House: Do we really want to give a  government agency veto power over new credit models?                                time  1500    As I raised in our committee markup, as I raised in our hearing back  in February, and as I have raised on this day here on the House floor  and many times before, I have concerns about the consumer credit  reporting agencies and their structure. I think there is a way for us  to have a bipartisan consensus.   While I respect my colleague on the other side of the aisle, and  there are times when we can work together, this is not one of those  times. I see this is as further vesting governmental power in something  that the private sector should be deciding in the private-sector  allocation of risk, rather than socializing credit models.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, this amendment is about  socializing credit modeling. My colleague raised this issue that a few  people in a room are making a decision that will affect millions of  Americans.   I think the consumer credit reporting agencies are deeply  problematic. There is not real competition. When you have three  controlling this marketplace with very little competition, the varied  [[Page H687]]  entries being massive because it is heavily regulated by government, a  set of laws that act on them and regulations that act on them, that is  problematic. It is an oligopoly.   I have said that I think there are reasonable reforms that we could  achieve in a bipartisan way through this House that could make it into  law. This bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, and the President said  he is going to veto it.   This is not a bipartisan undertaking. In fact, instead of having that  private-sector, behind-closed-doors group making this decision, you  vest one government bureau with somebody under statute who is  appointed, who cannot be fired, who can show up drunk at work  basically, and the President doesn't have the authority to fire them  under the statute, and you are going to give the CFPB this power and  have a single director make this decision on the allocation of credit  for all Americans?   So private sector, a small group making a decision and you have three  choices for your credit scores. Or do you want to have one government  bureaucrat make all the decisions for the American people?   So this is a fundamental debate, not just here on the House floor but  on wider politics about how you allocate capital in the United States:  Is it the government that should do this? Or should it be individual  action and individual citizens who have that control?   I fundamentally believe it is the individual citizens not government  bureaucrats behind closed doors who are making those decisions. We need  real innovation for consumer credit scores and consumer credit  modeling. We need big data involved, we need machine learning, and we  need to make sure that we root out inherent bias within the data  sources. I think there are enormous things we can do. But investing in  a government bureau that is unaccountable and a single director that is  making these decisions is a worse outcome than what is already not that  great.   So I appreciate my colleague raising this issue because we both agree  this is a problem. We just haven't been able to come to terms with how  to do it.   So while I oppose this amendment, I certainly respect my colleague  from New Jersey as a serious policy maker, but on this we just don't  agree.    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, my colleague is a serious  policy maker. At times we can come together, at other times we see  things differently, and I think that is okay.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  [[Page H688]]     Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my colleague, Mr.  Kildee, for representing his constituents' interests. The people in  this Chamber know of his commitment to his neighbors in Flint, and he  has been quite vocal and passionate about their plight. He has brought  that debate here to the House floor in a very proper and good way, so  he should be commended for that, I believe.   We know that when you have a local concern like this you want to fix  it. So many times when you have something that is applicable at the  national level you learn from local circumstances.   So let's look at the underlying bill first in order to describe this.  What this bill says to the 8 percent of the student loan marketplace--8  percent--this has nothing to do with the 92 percent that is controlled  by the Federal Government. That is an Education and Labor Committee of  jurisdiction and is not a part of this bill.   Eight percent of the student loan marketplace is private. Private  lenders are engaged, and those terms are already a part of a set of  Federal laws and State laws. The underlying bill ignores the  contractual terms of that, ignores the fact that you have in that 8  percent of the student loan marketplace only 2 percent who are not  paying or in default. Ninety-eight percent are paying. So my friend is  trying to fix a problem on 2 percent. The Federal student loan  portfolio has double-digit default rates and folks not paying.   So we have a big issue here. It is a big societal issue. It is  impacting two generations of Americans, and it is because Congress has  passed bad law that is saddling and enabling a generation of students  to saddle themselves with debt that they cannot repay. It is  unconscionable what we have done.   So what that bill does is say to that 8 percent of the marketplace:  If you are behind--8 percent of the marketplace, 2 percent not paying  or in default. So let's go to that 2 percent.   We are saying: If you have been in default for months, perhaps years,  and you make payments, and over 10 months you make nine of 10--why?  Well, I couldn't determine during committee debate why it was nine. Why  not 11 of 12? Why not 5 of 6? Why not three of seven? Nine of ten,  because that was the determination we have gotten. And now we have an  amendment that says, nine of ten? Well, maybe a little different.   So I get the expression of resolve for fixing people's problems, but  this bill is really bad. It is a really fundamentally flawed bill when  you have these arbitrary timelines like this and it says you sort of  pay and you sort of pay for a period of time and then all that fact  that you didn't pay is just waved away.   So that is the absurdity of the underlying bill.   I say to Mr. Kildee, I am sorry to take up the debate to talk about  how flawed that is. The gentleman's expression, though, about natural  disasters is a reasonable one. If we can do a standalone bill on that  then I think we would have not a dissenting vote on the House floor. So  I would love to work with the gentleman on that, but I cannot support  this amendment, and I have to oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains.    Mr. Chair, I would say to the gentleman from Michigan  that I commend him for offering this amendment; I commend him for the  respect for this institution and how he interacts legislatively. He can  be passionate about representing his constituents, his point of view,  his legislation, his amendments, but, at the same time, where we can  come to terms, we do that on a regular basis.   So it is not all dysfunction here; it is not all dismay; it is not  all disaster; it is not all acrimony. There are those of us who can  still talk amidst a broken and divided government that we have.   So I commend him for offering this amendment, and, again, as I said,  I am opposed to the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment introduces to the Fair  Credit Reporting Act a definition for Active Duty uniformed consumer  and establishes a special regime for the treatment of such consumers.   It is understandable and commendable that we want to help the men and  women who serve our country. They are involved in unique circumstances,  not just here domestically but globally.   While I support the need for our servicemen and women broadly, this  amendment does not remedy the overarching issues in the underlying  bill. There are some deeply problematic pieces to this bill, as I have  said in this overall debate. Because of that, I would offer to work  with the gentlewoman on this as a standalone measure that I believe we  could pass with a wide majority through the House. Who knows in the  Senate, given these days. But I believe that it would even have the  opportunity for the President's signature, which is important for our  process here in lawmaking.   Unfortunately, the overall bill, even if this is added, won't see the  light of day because the Senate is not going to take it up, and the  President has already said he is going to veto it.   Mr. Chair, I would offer to the gentlewoman to work with her on a  standalone measure to achieve the very thing of her amendment. I am  happy to yield if she has a response or if she is interested in working  in a bipartisan way for a standalone measure to achieve this.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the offer  and would be happy to work with the gentlewoman on that standalone  measure.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, it sounds like a bit of a broken record, but  this amendment does two things.   First, it continues to undermine the ability of private lenders to  negotiate terms of their loans with student borrowers. Second, it  continues the bill's theme of removing negative information, even if  accurate, from credit scores and credit reports.   Now, it was the decision by a Democratic House, Democratic Senate,  Democratic President that has saddled a generation--in fact, two  generations--of students with this massive, federally administered  student loan program.   This bill only deals with the 8 percent that is in the private  marketplace. It is trying to put bad rules there to take that final 8  percent, when in reality we should be focused on the 92 percent that  the Federal Government has saddled, the 92 percent that is the Federal  student loan program.   They want to remove predictive information, which will lead to  students taking on even more debt. We should be addressing the  underlying factors that are causing the crisis, like the rising costs  of higher education, the lack of underwriting standards in the Federal  program.   Instead, we are going to weaken the standards in the private market,  the part of the marketplace that is actually working really, really  well, where you only have default rates or folks who are not paying at  2 percent or less. In the Federal program, we have double digits that  are in the same sort of category.   The underlying bill requires consumer reporting agencies to develop  and use reporting codes to reflect a borrower's participation in the  credit rehabilitation program. The amendment would require these codes  to be removed no later than 5 days after the consumer makes nine  payments in 10 months.   Why nine payments in 10 months? As I said the last time I spoke about  this, because that kind of feels right, apparently. That is kind of  what we determined in the committee debate. Not that people have paid  every month but, you know, they have paid 9 out of 10 months.   What we are talking about here is not science in the underlying bill.  In fact, the 5-day period, I am not sure how the sponsor came up with  that. But this amendment expedites the requirement of a flawed program  within the bill, so not making a titanic change, a major change to the  bill. But it is a bad program that he is basically speeding up, in my  view--a bad program, in my view--that he is obviously trying to enact  more quickly.    Under this amendment, there will be no record of the borrower ever  being delinquent or having been in default.   Let's go back to the private loan market statistics. Again, 2 percent  in the private student loan marketplace is in default of their loans,  compared to the Federal student loan program, which has a default rate  of 18 percent.   Fannie and Freddie didn't have a default rate that high, and they got  nationalized as a result of the financial crisis and sparked a  financial crisis. We have 18 percent that is in default in the student  loan program.   Why are we messing with this small program when we should be taking  on this bigger issue that is one that is a major struggle? There are a  lot of ideas on both sides of the aisle for how we deal with that.   We shouldn't be weakening underwriting standards, either in the  Federal program or in the private program. We should have strong  underwriting standards. We should not lead to more financial  instability but a fairly structured and smart marketplace.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and, again, reiterate that this  amendment is about speeding up a bad program that is deeply flawed in  the underlying bill, and that is why I oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H692]]         Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining on  both sides.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, this is more aggressive than the bad Federal student loan  program. If you are a delinquent borrower, you cannot access this like- kind program. What this amendment is saying is, if you are a delinquent  borrower, you can get in the front of the line and get that waived away  as if you had been paying the whole time. This is a bad idea.   If you want to address the problem, let's address the cost of  college, not doing this gamesmanship of trying to socialize on the back  end through credit scores and credit reporting agencies.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. I am opposed  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is more of the same. It  prevents employers from identifying and fulfilling the needs of their  companies.   Now, use of a credit score, you would argue, is not perfect for every  job, but there are certain cases where that would, in fact, be a  reasonable thing and a reasonable limitation on employment; and I would  ask the amendment sponsor if that is the case.   Are there reasonable limitations that we could find here for the  types of employment where a credit report may be helpful to an  employer?   I would ask the bill's sponsor, Mr. Cohen of Tennessee, who is here  in the room, so your amendment says you cannot use the credit report  for anything related to hiring; is that correct?   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.    I understand that correctly. Is there any reasonable  limitation--as an employer, is there any reasonable expectation for  using a credit report in a hiring process, in your view?    Reclaiming my time. If the amendment sponsor doesn't  wish to engage in debate, then don't come to the House floor, Mr.  Chair, unless you want to engage in a debate. I am offering a  reasonable question. The gentleman may be so far in left field he can't  hear me in this Chamber.   But I would say this: As an employer, if you are handling cash, as an  example, every day, is it a reasonable thing to check somebody's credit  report to see if somebody has perhaps--I don't know--had problems with  cash, or is  [[Page H693]]  massively in debt, or has not paid their bills. Is that a reasonable  thing?   Is it a reasonable thing if you get hired by the FBI to know that you  have massive debt and, therefore, could fall victim to extortion?   I think there is a reasonable limitation. And what the gentleman has  already exposed with his unwillingness to even engage in a simple  colloquy--the gentleman has been around this House long enough to know  this general process, but he doesn't want to answer the question.   The reason he doesn't want to answer the question is he doesn't  believe any employer should be able to look at a consumer credit report  for any hiring procedure, and I think that is patently absurd, Mr.  Chair.    So if employers have a real fear that hiring or retaining an  individual can jeopardize the integrity of an institution, I think they  should be able to check a credit report; just like in certain  circumstances, somebody's criminal background could be harmful.   I will give you an example. Elder abuse. I think it is reasonable to  know if somebody has committed a violent crime or has extorted money  from people. I think that is a reasonable circumstance, is it not?   So I would say this: I offered a reasonable opportunity for a debate  on this. This is an absurd amendment that should be rejected.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I will inquire of the Chair; how much time remains on  both sides.    I have the right to close and I intend to do so.    Mr. Chair, for the express purpose of this amendment, in  legislative text it says that you cannot use a consumer credit report  or the information therein to deny employment. And the gentleman in the  very debate, Mr. Chair, said that he thinks some different standard.  But that is not what this amendment does.   This is a deeply-flawed amendment that has not been--I think it has  been thought through, because the gentleman wants to ban every  potential limitation on employment, even in a sensitive industry, even  dealing with the elderly, even dealing with children; and I think that  is way too far to the left and out of the mainstream.   And this amendment is not conforming with the rhetoric that he used  on the floor. In fact, it is much more far-reaching.   But it is also quite fitting with the overall bill, because the  overall bill is about socializing credit; and if you socialize credit,  you can't use any form or factor, and so I think this is really  problematic.   If employers have a real fear that hiring an individual can  jeopardize the integrity of an institution, for instance, a financial  institution, or cause harm to the very people they are trying to care  for, or share sensitive information on their customers, then they  should have the opportunity to not hire those people that will cause  harm or wreck our financial system.   So this is a way-out-left amendment, and it is a way-out-left bill.   So while I oppose it, I wish the gentleman well. And I wish that we  could actually engage in some reasonable debate like I had with other  Members. But I realize not all Members are the same.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the  inclusion of any arrest records on a consumer report if the arrest did  not result in a conviction, but looking at the intention here, I would  say to my colleague, I see the intention here.   In my view, this needs a little more work. And I say this to a Member  who is not on the Financial Services Committee. So it is a very  thoughtful amendment. I appreciate the gentleman's approach.   The difficulty here, and I am happy to yield, but the difficulty here  is at what level? Is it multiple arrests that would be--I mean, I see  this as the right intent.   You don't want somebody who makes a mistake, and their court date-- because State courts are backed up, and you have a court date 6 months  or a year in advance. You did something dumb. You are going to pay the  price. You are a law-abiding citizen otherwise, but you broke the law,  and you are accused of something very serious. In that period of time,  you can't buy a house, potentially, you can't buy a car. I see that as  the intention.   Now, you also have the circumstance where you have somebody who has a  traumatic life event and has a serious break from their previous  reality, and over a short period of time, over that same 6 months,  let's say, they have multiple arrests in increasing severity. We talk  about the opioid crisis, but we have a larger societal crisis around  mental illness and around abuse of illicit and otherwise heavily  regulated drugs. So we have these periods of time that we have got to  wrestle with in Federal law, but I see the gentleman's intent.   So, while I am opposed to this amendment because I think it is too  broad because I think there are severe penalties for that period of  time, I think it is probably right and just to have a pause, and if  something changes, then they need to remove the fact that you are even  accused of a crime. That shouldn't be pertinent to somebody's long-term  credit.   So that is how I see it. If I am off base in some way, I am happy to  engage on that.   I yield to the gentleman from California for a response.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, on that subject  matter, it is the period of time between the arrest and the court date  is my concern.    Yes.    Mr. Chairman, I would say I think the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano) has offered a thoughtful amendment. We don't  want any unjust actions taken against somebody because they are accused  of something at one period of time or made a mistake and the courts  found that that was not, in fact, something illegal.   So I think he has the right intent. I think the gentleman's  inclination is right. I would be happy to work with him on a standalone  measure to achieve something similar, but I appreciate that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I still have concerns, but in the  interest of due process, the direction of this amendment I think is a  thoughtful one, and the gentleman's explanation is a strong explanation  of his amendment.   I would say in language such as no conviction, perhaps acquittal may  be some better form of this, but this is something I am happy to work  on if this ever gets to a conference committee, which I don't believe  the bill will. But I am happy to engage with my colleague from  California on the contents of this, and, as a separate measure,  potentially, to work with him on that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am happy to see my friends on the other side of the aisle take the  same interest that we have on this side of the aisle in protecting  cybersecurity and protecting consumer data. I think it is great that  this is a bipartisan concern that we share.   This amendment reaffirms the data security concerns that Republicans  have highlighted in the past with respect to credit reporting agencies,  including back in February of last year, the only time we had a hearing  in the House Financial Services Committee on the credit reporting  agencies. We want to ensure that these credit reporting agencies  protect our data.   The collection and maintenance of our personal information and  exposing that to risk is deeply problematic. All we need to do is look  back a few years ago to the Equifax breach to understand how vital  cybersecurity standards are, not only at the consumer credit reporting  agencies, but across the financial sector.   I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland using the language from my  substitute amendment that I offered before the Rules Committee and  before the House Financial Services Committee and incorporating it into  this amendment. I am disappointed that the rest of the bill was not as  bipartisan as this amendment text.   Since this bill is not going anywhere, I would ask whether or not the  author of the amendment would be interested in drafting a separate  suspensionable--I think it has wide bipartisan support--a suspension- worthy version of this as a stand-alone bill.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank my new  colleague, but bipartisanship is kind of rare to happen around here, so  when it is offered, let's just go try to get it, try to work on it.  That would be my suggestion, Mr. Chairman. Since this is the language,  verbatim, from my substitute, I am trying to be charitable.   But with that, like I said, I am not opposed to the amendment. In  fact, I am proud to really have written the contents of what is being  offered. I am grateful that the gentleman offered it and the Rules  Committee approved it, because they didn't approve my stand-alone  amendment in the nature of a substitute.   Mr. Chairman, we are not going to resolve those broader issues, but I  am happy to work with the gentleman if he is ever interested in a  bipartisan bill on this measure. I am happy to do that.   I am fine with the passage of this. I think the underlying bill is  still deeply flawed. This doesn't tip the balance for me to make an  awful bill really good, but it does make an awful bill just slightly  less awful.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, as we all know, homelessness is an issue that  has plagued the lives of many Americans across this country, and we  know the particular crisis that is in Los Angeles.   I know that the gentleman is trying to deal with the particular  issues of his home State, and so I commend him for that. But he is also  highlighting something that has been a big debate--not debate, but a  big point of discussion, I would say, and shared concern about  homelessness that we have in the Financial Services Committee.   I know every committee of jurisdiction has homelessness as a part of  their agenda, but we are the committee that does housing, and we are  trying to draw some consensus on how we deal with this homelessness  crisis.   We have a crisis of affordability across the country, but in  particular, in high growth areas. It is a blessing that it is a high- growth area, but there is an enormous number of challenges that come  along the way.   It means that commutes get longer for people who are working-class  folks. It means that you have folks who are making serious life  decisions with a great limitation, right? So that impairs, I think,  economic growth.   It is not just in New York or Los Angeles or San Francisco where  there is a homelessness crisis. I say this not using it as words of  attack to the sponsor of this. It is not. We have a homelessness crisis  in every community in America because we have homeless. We have a  veterans homelessness crisis because if we have a single veteran who is  homeless, that is not in keeping with who we are as America.   So I think it is important to raise this issue of homelessness in  every way we can. I think a number of the policies that have been  offered this Congress will make things worse, not better.   For the affordability challenge, I feel like national rent control  policies and things of that sort will move us in the wrong direction  for ensuring that we have enough housing stock for those who seek it.  With the changing nature of how people want to live, we have to make  sure that housing stock fits with that so you are able to grow housing  stock to meet that need, not just for young people, but for old people  and everybody in between, as I find out I am getting old, right?   But with this, I appreciate my colleague for offering this amendment.  I think it is a thoughtful approach. It gives us the opportunity to  have a wider discussion about homelessness and the challenges therein  to those experiencing it, to the communities that are struggling with  it, and to all of us to come to terms with the best way to approach it.   Look, this doesn't tip the balance in my view of the underlying bill.  For those of you who have been paying attention to this debate, I won't  repeat myself on this, but this is the final amendment.   I think the bill's sponsor is of goodwill in trying to address this.  The underlying bill is still deeply problematic to me, but I commend my  colleague for raising that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, for the overall bill, to put a bow on  this, if you will, this bill is about socializing credit scores. If you  socialize credit scores, you can socialize credit. If you can socialize  credit, then you can have government make the decision about the  allocation of credit in the private sector.   This is a larger narrative from the far left in this country, which  has now taken the opportunity to attempt to make legislative gains.   The President has said he will not sign this bill, thankfully, which  is good for the American consumer. Furthermore, I don't see this seeing  the light of day in the Senate.   Having said that, we still need to have a serious bipartisan  conversation about how to reform the credit reporting agencies and the  law that underlies their regulatory framework.   Mr. Chair, I am grateful for the opportunity to debate here on the  House floor. While I am not opposed to this amendment, I remain opposed  to the overall bill and will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on that.  But, again, I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta) for  his offering of a thoughtful amendment dealing with homelessness and  raising this issue, not as a local issue, but as one of national import  and one worthy of debate here on the House floor.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H697]]         Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
