 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Todd Zobrist, a  paramedic with Highland EMS in Highland, Illinois.   Yesterday afternoon, Todd was the first to arrive on the scene after  receiving a call of a vehicle in Silver Lake with a person possibly  inside. When he saw the vehicle partially submerged, he swam out in the  cold water to search for anyone inside. He found an unresponsive baby  boy, rescued him from the vehicle, and immediately began CPR on the  roof of the vehicle. Todd was able to revive the 3-month-old at the  scene and the baby was transported to a St. Louis hospital where he is  expected to make a full recovery.   I would like to commend Todd for his heroic and lifesaving actions.  It is a great tribute to a southern Illinoisan.                            ____________________
