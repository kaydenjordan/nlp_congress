 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 83 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4  minutes of debate, equally divided.    Mr. President, every job in America is important, but  there is something special, sacred, even noble about a job that entails  putting your life on the line to keep your fellow citizens safe, and  that is the job of our firefighters.   In Alaska, firefighting season will be upon us soon. It can be  brutal. In 2005, roughly 6 million acres of the State burned. That is  about the size of Vermont. Think about the dedication and courage it  takes to fight those fires, many of which are in rural parts of our  States. It is only right that when firefighters come to Congress asking  for assistance, that we give them the flexibility they truly need.   So why is my amendment necessary? Currently, the Assistance to  Firefighters Grants Program only allows modification to existing fire  stations rather than new facilities.   Many old firefighting facilities can't be modified. A 2021 report by  the U.S. Fire Service found that 44 percent of fire stations are over  40 years old. The issue is even more acute in rural parts of our  country where facilities have problems which cannot be fixed through  maintenance and repair alone. For example, roughly 61 percent of fire  stations over 40 years old exist in communities serving less than  10,000 people.   So, Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It costs zero dollars. It  gives discretion to the firefighters in rural communities to allow  Federal grants to small communities of less than 10,000 people to use  the Federal funds to build new stations. That is it: a simple,  commonsense amendment backed by data to help firefighters in small  communities in America who often don't have the tax base to build new  facilities.   We should help them. We all have rural communities that need this  help. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.    I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to respond.    Mr. President, again, I want to work with Senator  Stabenow on this issue, but we have an opportunity right now.   Every Senator knows that our firefighters in small communities come  to the Senate and ask for help because they don't have the tax base to  actually build new facilities. And the facilities, as I mentioned, are  very, very old.   All this amendment does is add a new category to request for  assistance only from communities of 10,000 people or less. It is common  sense. We all know it is needed. Again, I encourage my colleagues to  support it.   I respect all the firefighter groups who are saying they oppose it,  but the only reason they are opposing it is because they say they want  a clean bill. You know what, sorry, but that is not a very good  argument.   I urge the support of this amendment No. 83.                           Vote on Amendment No. 83     I ask for the yeas and nays.
