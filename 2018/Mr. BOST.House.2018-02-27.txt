 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for putting this on.  Let me say that as many of the people who have spoken here tonight have  talked about how Billy Graham spread the gospel of Jesus Christ, at a  young age, Billy Graham, if you read his history, took a walk through  the woods and devoted his life to Christ.   He understood what was written in Matthew 22 when Christ was asked,  Which is the greatest commandment? He said that the greatest  commandment is to love the Lord your God with  [[Page H1324]]  all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. The  second is like unto it, to love your neighbor as yourself.   He understood those commandments. But most of all, he understood the  commission that was given at the end of Matthew: Go therefore and make  disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and  of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.   Billy Graham understood this. He understood it, and he was also very,  very humble. I want to take, if I can, just a moment to go over  something that was written by the author Max Lucado about a meeting  that Michael W. Smith and his pastor had. I will just read it:   ``A few hours before the event,'' where Michael W. Smith and Max  Lucado were going to go on stage together, ``Michael and I met to go  over the weekend's schedule. But Michael was so moved by what he had  just experienced, he could hardly discuss the retreat. He had just met  with Billy Graham for the purpose of planning Reverend Graham's  funeral. The famous evangelist was, at the time, 94 years old. He was  confined to a wheelchair, on oxygen. His mind was sharp and spirits  were high. But his body was seeing its final days. So he called  Michael. And he called for his pastor. He wanted to discuss his  funeral. He told them that he had a request.''   They both said: Of course, anything. What is it?   He said: It is to do with the funeral.   They said: Yes?   He said: Would you not mention my name?   They said: What?   He said: Could you not mention my name? Just mention the name of  Jesus.   Mr. Speaker, you see, Billy Graham has preached to over 1 billion  people. He has filled stadiums on every continent.                                time  1845    He has advised every President of the last half century. He has  consistently been the top of every ``most admired'' list, yet he wants  to be anonymous at his funeral and only call on Jesus' name.   1 Peter 55 said:         God resists the crowd, but gives grace to the humble.    For a man like this to hold and be humbled when the world knew him.   John 15:8 says:         By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit       and so prove to be my disciples.    There is no question whose disciple Billy Graham was.   On February 21, I don't doubt that he heard these words: ``Well done,  my good and faithful servant.''   We just pray that God sends us more like him.
