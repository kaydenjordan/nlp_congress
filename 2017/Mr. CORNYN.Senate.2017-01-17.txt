 Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island for  his courtesy.   Last week, the Senate took the first step in providing needed relief  for the American people from a health care plan, the Affordable Care  Act, that overpromised and underdelivered. Many people are hurting now  as a result of the failed promises of ObamaCare. They were told their  premiums would go down, that they would be able to keep the policy they  had if they liked it, and that if they liked their doctor, they could  keep their doctor, none of which has proved to be true. So it is  important that we keep our commitment to the American people. I believe  we have gotten a mandate as a result of the election on November 8 that  we keep our promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to deliver  health care that is affordable and is a matter of individual choice and  freedom of choice.   The basic problem with ObamaCare is that it was command and control  right out of Washington, DC, where people didn't have sufficient  humility when it comes to rearranging one-sixth of our national economy  and believed that they could, in the process of writing a 2,700-page  bill--that I doubt many of them read--take over and improve our health  care delivery system.   It was sold on the basis of providing people access to affordable  care, and in many instances, according to my constituents, they have  seen their premiums skyrocket and deductibles skyrocket, effectively  being insured but giving them no benefit of insurance coverage at all.   I realize there were some things that people liked to talk about when  they talk about ObamaCare that were positive; for example, dealing with  people with preexisting conditions. I agree that people should not lose  their health insurance coverage when they change employers and be  caught in a trap where your insurance company doesn't cover your  preexisting condition, but you don't need ObamaCare in order to deal  with that problem. People also like the idea that single adults living  at home can continue to be listed on their parents' health insurance up  to age 26. That is enormously popular on a bipartisan basis. Again, we  don't need a 2,700-page takeover of the health care system in order to  deliver some of these consensus items of reform.   I believe, and we believe, that there are certain principles that  ought to govern the replacement of ObamaCare that we will see unfold in  the coming weeks; first and foremost, moving the health care decisions  outside of Washington and back to where they belong--to patients,  families, and their doctor.   We also believe patients ought to have more tools, such as health  savings accounts which they can use to pay for their regular health  care along with perhaps a catastrophic coverage which would help them  in the event of an unexpected health care condition that would require  hospitalization. If you are young and healthy and don't need all the  money you set aside in health savings accounts, you can keep that money  and use it for your eventual retirement.   We also believe we ought to break down barriers that restrict choice  and permit Americans to pick an insurance plan that is best for them  and their family. One of the worst aspects of ObamaCare is that  Washington, DC, said: Here is your health care coverage, and we are  going to punish you with a penalty if you don't buy it, forcing people  to buy coverage that they didn't want and didn't need--for example, a  single male being forced, in essence, to buy maternity coverage. That  is just 1 of the 10 essential health benefits that was mandated in  ObamaCare that drove the cost of insurance through the roof, not to  mention the fact that the pools of people who were insured tended to be  older and less well, thus driving premiums again through the roof.   Another principle that is really important to our health care reform  replacement is empowering small businesses to provide employees with  the kind of health care coverage that meets their needs through  association health plans so they can pool their risks together to bring  costs down and to increase their choices. We believe there ought to be  flexibility on the part of the States when it comes to Medicaid  spending. We ought to, in my book, give the States the money and the  block grant and say: Come up with a health care delivery system for  Medicaid's low-income citizens that best suits their needs. We haven't  done that under ObamaCare. We have had a mandate and tied the hands of  the States when it comes to coming up with alternatives to health care  delivery.   Finally, when it comes to employers that provide 61 percent of the  health care coverage for Americans, rather than tying their hands and  driving up costs, what we ought to do is allow for increased  flexibility for employer-sponsored plans that will help bring down the  costs. We hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking  about ObamaCare like it was the gold  [[Page S331]]  standard: There is nothing wrong with it. It is just perfect as it is.   Well, I don't have to tell our Democratic friends about the  unintended consequences of this partisan exercise. ObamaCare was passed  without a single Republican vote so the problems that have developed  from it are problems that were created by our Democratic colleagues.  Having said that, we hope they will work with us to come up with an  alternative which we believe would be an improvement on the status quo,  to make health care more available, at a price people can afford, with  choices that would be theirs, not a mandate out of Washington, DC.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me talk just a minute about the  nominations process. In 2009, when President Obama was sworn into  office, there were seven Cabinet members sworn in on his first day in  office. That is a demonstration of the good faith and civility that  ordinarily extends in the peaceful transition of power from one  President to another. That doesn't mean we were excited on this side of  the aisle about the fact that President Obama won as opposed to our  preferred candidate, but we believed it was our responsibility to carry  on this tradition of peaceful transition of power. The President,  having won the election, was entitled to surround himself with his  team, subject to the vetting and the confirmation process and the  process known as advise and consent.   I believe we need to see some cooperation from our colleagues across  the aisle, including the confirmation of the next Attorney General of  the United States, Senator Jeff Sessions. Our Senate colleagues know  Jeff Sessions. They have worked alongside him. They don't need to read  his resume, they don't need to know more about his record because they  know his heart. They know Jeff to be an honorable and decent man who  believes fervently in the rule of law and who will drain that swamp  known as the Department of Justice, which has become an outpost of the  political operation in the White House, and restore it to its rightful  reputation as a Department of Justice that believes in equal justice  under the law and doesn't play politics.   I would also state that our colleagues across the aisle ought to work  with us to confirm the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Mr.  Tillerson, I believe, is an inspired choice for Secretary of State.  Some have wanted to say that the relationships he has developed around  the world working on behalf of the shareholders of ExxonMobil are a  liability. I actually view it as a spring. When you are talking to  somebody, you are less likely to get involved in a fight or get  involved in a misunderstanding that might lead to some unnecessary  conflict. I don't have any doubts about his willingness and commitment  to work on behalf of the United States and all of our people, just like  he has worked on behalf of the shareholders of the business he has run  for all these years.   Finally, let me just say a word about the Secretary of Defense  nominee, Gen. James Mattis. We overwhelmingly passed a waiver that  would reduce the number of years a uniformed military officer had to be  out of the military before they would be eligible for Secretary of  Defense. I think the reason it passed by such a wide bipartisan  majority is people realize there aren't many men or women in the world  like Gen. James Mattis with the qualities that he brings to this  important job. He is a real warrior statesman. Someone who has walked  the walk and seen live combat during a 40-year career in the U.S.  Marine Corps.   During his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee last  week, all of us had a chance, along with our colleagues on the Armed  Services Committee, to ask him how he would handle a host of foreign  policy and national security issues. During the question-and-answer  period, he mentioned the importance of preserving our country's  military power, but he also noted that our Nation has historically held  the power of inspiration by our example, inspiring others around the  world with our democracy. That extends well beyond our uniformed  military and the threat of military might. That is something that  should be cultivated well beyond our military preparedness. The point  is, with General Mattis, we have a strategic thinker who sees the big  picture, and I am confident he will lead our military in a way that  advances our interests around the world, and what I am particularly  looking for are leaders in the Trump administration who will restore  America's leadership role around the world wherever we go and wherever  we look because I believe, in my heart of hearts, that one reason the  world has become more dangerous and less stable is because many people  around the world who are adversaries have viewed the Obama  administration as retreating from America's traditional leadership role  in the world, and believe me, there are plenty of countries--plenty of  bad actors--that are willing to take advantage of that void when  America retreats and doesn't demonstrate its historic leadership role.   I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting not only  General Mattis's confirmation but Secretary of State Tillerson's and  all of the others, including the Attorney General nominee, Jeff  Sessions, and all of the other nominees of President-Elect Trump. They  have every right to a thorough vetting. They have every right to ask  hard questions to get information to help them vet these nominees. That  is our job. In the end, they should not delay for just delay's sake,  which unfortunately some of them have threatened to do. That will not  help anybody. It will not help this new administration, it will not  make America a safer place, and it will make us more vulnerable to  those around the world who want to disrupt the peaceful transition of  power from one Presidency to the next.
