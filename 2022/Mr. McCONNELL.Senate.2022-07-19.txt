 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a year ago today, with prices already  rising, President Biden said that high inflation was ``expected to be  temporary.'' One year later, after 9 straight months of inflation over  6 percent, the prices are now rising at their fastest rate in over 40  years.   Last week's inflation report confirmed on paper what working families  have been feeling for a year: President Biden's prediction was dead  wrong. Instead, prices are skyrocketing, and paychecks aren't keeping  up. Real hourly wages are declining at breakneck speeds, dropping a  full 1 percent last month alone. The average American worker got a full  1-percent pay cut just last month alone due to inflation.   The Biden administration has tried to claim that we are ``stronger  economically than we have been in history.'' That is what the White  House Press Secretary told reporters earlier this month. Kentuckians  know that is utterly absurd. They know the opposite is true. In my home  State, the average household now spends over $600 more--$600 more-- every month compared to the day President Biden took his oath of  office. That comes out to more than $7,300 a year.   Inflation is pushing Kentucky families to the brink. As a result,  food bank  [[Page S3345]]  demand is rising, and shelves are running low. A soup kitchen in  Campbell County put out an urgent call for volunteers as surging  visitors threaten to overwhelm its limited staff. As the executive  director said in an interview, with ``inflation and milk [at] $4 a  gallon,'' they see people who have ``never needed help before.''   I have received messages from constituents all over the Commonwealth  facing the same crisis: Prices are rising while real wages fall.   A 59-year-old from Louisville tells me she has worked two jobs since  she graduated from college in 1987 to save for retirement. Now she is  afraid she will ``lose [her] hard-earned money . . . due to this  inflation.''   Another constituent in Hopkins County tells me he worked 60 hours a  week for years to afford the home he bought recently. Now, with rising  prices, he ``can't even support [his] family anymore'' and might lose  his new house as well.   A couple in Lexington in their late seventies spends almost all of  their fixed income on rent, utilities, and medical bills. They are  struggling to find enough left over for food. ``What are we suppose[d]  to do?'' they ask.   Families across Kentucky are asking themselves the same question  every day. The answer from Washington Democrats is alarming but not  surprising. After spending us into inflation, they now want to tax us  into recession. I can't think of a more reckless response for  struggling Kentuckians.
