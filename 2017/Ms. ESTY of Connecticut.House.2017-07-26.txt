 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $20,000,000)''.        Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $40,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my  amendment to increase funding for the Advanced Manufacturing Office by  $20 million.   I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Tom Reed, John Katko,  and Jacky Rosen for their partnership in this bipartisan amendment.   Our amendment is about protecting and creating millions of good- paying  [[Page H6439]]  jobs in Connecticut and across the country. Our amendment will help us  ensure that the technologically advanced products of the future will be  manufactured, not in China, not in India, but right here in the United  States of America.   The Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office is the only  technology development office within the Federal Government that is  dedicated to enhancing American manufacturing competitiveness. The  Advanced Manufacturing Office works to help manufacturers improve  energy and material efficiency, technology, and productivity.   Unfortunately, the appropriations bill before us today cuts funding  to the Advanced Manufacturing Office by $155.5 million from fiscal year  2017 enacted levels, and that is a mistake.   Manufacturing is one of the most important sectors of the U.S.  economy. In 2016, manufacturing contributed $2.18 trillion to our  economy and employed 12.3 million workers. In my home State of  Connecticut, manufacturing has long been our economic backbone.   Connecticut is home to nearly 5,000 manufacturing companies that  provide good-paying jobs for 76,000 Connecticut residents. This  amendment helps American manufacturers all across the country to be  more competitive by reducing energy costs.   Manufacturing is very energy intensive. In fact, according to the  National Association of Manufacturers, manufacturers consume more than  30 percent of our Nation's energy. That translates to $130 billion in  costs to U.S. manufacturers every year.   Adequately funding the Advanced Manufacturing Office, will help  reduce energy costs to manufacturers, freeing up their budgets to  invest in research and development, expand their facilities, and, most  importantly, hire more people.   Our amendment also helps American manufacturers become more  competitive by addressing critical workforce needs in energy  efficiency.   Last year, I visited Forum Plastics, a plastic molding company based  in Waterbury, Connecticut. I met with employees to discuss the  expectations and challenges facing manufacturers in America today, and  one of the topics that came up was how businesses struggle to hire  workers with the right skills. Yet, that same year, Forum Plastics  partnered with the Advanced Manufacturing Office to carry out an  industrial assessment project.   The Industrial Assessment Centers program is a tool for employers to  recruit individuals with hands-on experience in energy efficiency.   Mr. Chairman, now is not the time to roll back investments in  American manufacturing. It is the time to increase our support for U.S.  manufacturing. I know all of us in this Chamber are committed to  promoting good-paying jobs in the communities we represent, but it is  not enough to say we are committed.   We need to make job creation a priority, and that means making  American manufacturing a priority. I urge my colleagues to support our  amendment which increases funding to the Department of Energy's  Advanced Manufacturing Office by $20 million, fully paid for by a  reduction in the more than $350 million plus-up to funding for the  Office of Fossil Energy Research & Development.   This bipartisan amendment is a win for American manufacturing and a  win for our economy. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 30 seconds remaining.    Mr. Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to  support this. If we can help our manufacturers be more efficient in  their use of energy, we can help them be more competitive, hire more  people, and develop that clean energy technology for coal.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from  Connecticut will be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment No. 46 will not be offered.                 Amendment No. 49 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 49  printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 296, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, in these difficult times, I want to thank  the chairman and ranking member, Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur of the subcommittee, for shepherding this legislation to the  floor, and for their efforts, and the commitment that we all have to  preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment increases funding for the DOE departmental  administration by $1 million, which should be used to enhance the  Department's Environmental Justice program activities.   The Environmental Justice program is an essential tool in the effort  to improve the lives of low-income and minority communities, as well as  the environment at large. Twenty years ago, this particular program was  established directing Federal agencies to identify and address the  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects of their actions on minority and low-income populations.   So we have engaged with Historically Black Colleges, minority-serving  institutions, Tribal colleges, and other organizations to improve and  develop the sustainability through developing  [[Page H6440]]  young people and faculty to work on these important issues.   The crisis in Flint, Michigan, teaches us how important it is that  minority groups and low-income communities are not placed at a  disadvantage when it comes to environmental threats and hazards like  lead in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika  virus. I particularly remember convening a Zika task force in Houston  to ensure that areas in my community, because of the sitting water and  a lot of heat, did not breed these mosquitos to create a devastating  condition in some of our communities.   This Environmental Justice program is extremely important, involving  community education and advisory projects, community capacity building  through technology, the Community Leaders Institute, but, more  importantly, it works on important research.   Mr. Chair, might I find out how much time I have remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I want to make note of the fact that in  some of the universities that participate in this program, the chairs-- meaning the faculty chairs--are a team of world-class scholars,  researchers, and educators from 14 Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, one Hispanic-serving institution, who advance research,  enhance academics, promote partnerships, and effect outreach in the  environmental sciences.   Finally, the Minority Serving Institutions Program that includes a  wide array of institutions provides funding to minority-serving  institutions to advance scientific research, student internships,  faculty fellowships, and curriculum development.   Mr. Chair, the more we can invest in science and research, helping to  improve our environment--and let me make it very clear, in urban and  rural areas. This is not an urban program only. It is urban and rural  areas. The more we can help our communities be clean and  environmentally safe and secure, the more we create a better quality of  life for all people, no matter what their economic station in life or  where they live.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment increases funding for DOE departmental administration by  $1,000,000 which should be used to enhance the Department's  Environmental Justice program activities.   Mr. Chair, the Environmental Justice Program is an essential tool in  the effort to improve the lives of low income and minority communities  as well as the environment at large.   Twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued  Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   A healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community  which fosters personal and economic growth.   Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, Tribal  Colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting  sustainability and growth of the community and environment.   The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority  groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the  environment and the continued preservation of their homes.   The crisis in Flint, Michigan teaches us how important it that  minority groups and low-income communities are not placed at a  disadvantage when it comes to environment threats and hazards like lead  in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika  virus.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Funds that would be awarded to this important cause would increase  youth involvement in STEM fields and also promote clean energy,  weatherization, clean-up, and asset revitalization. These improvements  would provide protection to our most vulnerable groups.   This program provides better access to technology for underserved  communities. Together, the Department of Energy and Department of  Agriculture have distributed over 5,000 computers to low income  populations.   The Community Leaders Institute is another vital component of the  Environmental Justice Program. It ensures that those in leadership  positions understand what is happening in their communities and can  therefore make informed decisions in regards to their communities.   In addition to promoting environmental sustainability, CLI also  brings important factors including public health and economic  development into the discussion for community leaders.   The CLI program has been expanded to better serve Native Americans  and Alaska Natives, which is a prime example of how various other  minority groups can be assisted as well.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The  DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   Since 2002, the Tribal Energy Program has also funded 175 energy  projects amounting to over $41.8 million in order to help tribes invest  in renewable sources of energy.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can provide clean  energy options to our most underserved communities and help improve  their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater  public awareness.   We must help our low income and minority communities and ensure  equality for those who are most vulnerable in our country.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment  for the Environmental Justice Program.   Mr. Chair, I ask my friends and my colleagues to support the Jackson  Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The amendment was agreed to.     Amendment No. 50 Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50  printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $98,000,000) (increased by $98,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) and a Member opposed each  will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, my amendment  ensures that NNSA has adequate work space to fulfil its national  security mission. In my home State of New Mexico, over 1,000 Federal  and contract employees at NNSA currently work in a network of old and  rapidly deteriorating facilities on Kirtland Air Force Base in New  Mexico.   A portion of the existing facility includes a 60-year-old former  military barracks, which creates a number of health, safety, and  quality-of-life issues for its employees. These employees are involved  in some of our Nation's most important national security work,  including managing our Nation's nuclear deterrent and reducing global  nuclear and radiological threats.   The NNSA administrator, Lieutenant General Klotz, said that:         The highly talented employees in Albuquerque are frankly       forced to work in facilities that are inadequate to NNSA's       current mission.    Furthermore, because of the age of the buildings, NNSA is forced to  spend approximately $6 million every year on maintenance and repairs  just to keep them habitable.   In fact, the $40 million worth of deferred maintenance alone on the  old buildings is approximately one-fifth of what it would cost to build  a new, modern, and reliable facility. So this is a perfect opportunity  to save money in the long run.   I strongly support NNSA's efforts to replace the existing complex  with a single new building that will provide  [[Page H6441]]  safe, reliable, and sustainable infrastructure that improves the safety  and working environment for approximately 1,200 employees.   The new state-of-the-art facility will meet enhanced environmental  standards and consolidate staff for a more efficient delivery and  support of the important national security work at NNSA.                                time  2130    The current total project cost is $202 million, and I agree with  Chairman Simpson that we have an obligation to ensure that every single  taxpayer dollar for this project is used efficiently and effectively.   I know that the chairman shares my concerns to ensure that NNSA has  the infrastructure and resources it needs to fulfill its national  security mission now and in the future. That is why I am pleased that  he has agreed to work with me on this issue to ensure that we are  fulfilling our oversight responsibilities while moving the construction  of the Albuquerque complex project forward.   With that, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
