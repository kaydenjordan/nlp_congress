 Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   I take a back seat to no one when it comes to standing up to China.  Lindsey Graham and I have been fighting to close the trade deficit for  decades.   I went to junior high at Johnny Appleseed Junior High in Mansfield,  OH, with the sons and daughters of machinists and IUE members and  steelworkers and auto workers and carpenters and millwrights and  plumbers and pipefitters and operating engineers. Ten years later, most  of these jobs were gone, and so much of industrial America all over the  country has been lost because of bad trade policy with China.   But do you know? The People's Republic of China would love for us to  pass this amendment because, if it passes, the United States of America  will default, and they will be rejoicing in Beijing.   Stand up to China. Vote no on this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 93    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question occurs on agreeing to  amendment No. 93.
