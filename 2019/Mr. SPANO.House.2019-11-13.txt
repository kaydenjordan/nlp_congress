 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for yielding.   I rise today in support of the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act  of 2019, a bill that I was proud to introduce with Representative  Schneider.   This bill authorizes the Boots to Business Program for 5 years, which  provides educational opportunities to veterans and their families on  how to start and manage their own small businesses.   Veterans often have the natural temperament and experience to be  successful entrepreneurs. They are trained to be confident leaders and  they know how to make tough decisions in very, very difficult  environments. However, many veterans often retire from the service with  all the right tools but lack the knowledge on how to apply them in the  business world. The Boots to Business Program fills this gap.   As a pilot program, it provides a number of opportunities to educate  veterans in entrepreneurship. The flagship offering of the program is  the Introduction to Entrepreneurship course, a 2-day, in-person  training on the fundamental principles of business ownership.   Specifically, the course teaches participants how to recognize  business opportunities, create a business plan, and consider the legal  and financial aspects of how to operate a business. This allows  veterans to come to the course with the beginnings of a business idea  and leave with the tools to turn it into a viable business model.   Boots to Business also follows up this introductory course with more  in-depth educational opportunities on specific topics, such as  conducting market research and revenue readiness.   Beyond these educational opportunities, Boots to Business provides  veteran entrepreneurs access to free consultants for follow-up  questions and to help them navigate loan programs offered by the Small  Business Administration.   I have personally seen the positive impacts of the Boots to Business  Program in my district. Introduction to Entrepreneurship classes are  regularly offered at MacDill Air Force Base, and so far, 100 courses  have been given throughout Florida.   The program has been a great benefit to the veterans in my community,  and I am confident that it will continue to benefit veterans across the  country.   Mr. Speaker, the bill passed unanimously from the Small Business  Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to National  Adoption Month.   On any given day in our country, there are 440,000 children in the  foster care system, most for 2 to 5 years. This holiday season, I  encourage you to open your heart to the possibility of adopting a  child. As an adoption attorney, I can personally testify that you can  give no greater gift to a child without a home than the security of a  parent.   Alternatively, foster care may be a better option for you. My family  had the joy of fostering four beautiful children over a 2-year period  and simultaneously gave their birth parents the chance to receive help  to overcome problems that led to their children's removal from their  home.   Tampa Bay is blessed to have the Gladney Center for Adoption,  Catholic Charities Adoption Services, Florida Baptist Children's Homes,  Heart of Adoptions Alliance, and others on the front lines of this  issue.   This National Adoption Month, think of these kids as you sit at your  Thanksgiving table, when you shop for Christmas, and, above all, when  you consider growing your family. They need us.                            ____________________
