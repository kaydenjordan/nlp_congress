 Madam Speaker, when I was commissioned a  second lieutenant in the United States Army, I swore an oath to support  and defend the Constitution, and I have done so 13 times in my 35 years  of public service. That oath means everything: to serve and fight for  our country and to protect and promote our values.   Yet, President Trump betrayed his oath. He abused his power, the  immense power of the Presidency. He threatened our elections by  inviting foreign interference. He chose investigating a political rival  over defending our national security.   So, today, we must use our power, the extraordinary power endowed by  our Constitution and entrusted by the people: the power to impeach. We  must hold President Trump accountable or else we will be complicit in  undermining our democracy, our security, and our dignity.   His conduct demonstrates his unfitness to serve as Commander in Chief  and warrants removal from office. The oath I took as a Member of  Congress is the same I took as a soldier, an oath that reminds me  values matter, that duty, honor, and the rule of law matter.   To keep my oath to the people I serve, the country I love, today I  will vote to impeach the President of the United States.
