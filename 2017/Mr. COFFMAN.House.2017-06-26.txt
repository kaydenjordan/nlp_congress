 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in welcoming President Moon  Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the United States of America.   Next week will mark his first official visit to Washington, D.C.,  since he assumed the Presidency of his country. This represents a  continuation of the friendship between our two nations.   This October will mark the 64th anniversary of the mutual defense  treaty between our two countries. This landmark legislation continues  to be a vital component to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific  region.   Once again, I look forward to welcoming President Moon Jae-in to the  United States, and I look forward to continuing our partnership with  the Republic of Korea.                            ____________________
