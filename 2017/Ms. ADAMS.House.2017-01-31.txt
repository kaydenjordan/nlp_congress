 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on women like the 77- year-old held at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport as she tried  to see her son and his family for the first time in years.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
