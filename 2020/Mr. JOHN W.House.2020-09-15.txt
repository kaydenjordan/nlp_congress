 ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight deeply  saddened by the tragedy that took place this past weekend in Coffee  County, Tennessee, where two innocent lives were taken and others  injured in a heinous kidnapping and carjacking.   Our prayers are with the victims and their families, including  Tennessean Philip Jordan Stevens, who are now reeling from this  tragedy.   As Tennesseans, we have not and will not accept this kind of  disgusting violence in our communities.   I would like to thank our State and local law enforcement for swiftly  and dutifully responding to this appalling attack. At a time when  police forces around the Nation are themselves under attack, I want our  law enforcement officers to know that I will continue to support the  thin blue line.   As our community pushes forward, I believe now more than ever that we  must stand together as Americans unified in prayer for our State and  Nation.                            ____________________
