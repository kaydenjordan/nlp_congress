 Madam Chair, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  436, as the designee of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), I  offer amendments en bloc, which are at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, the amendments included in the en bloc were made in  order by the rule, and they have been agreed to by both sides. They  improve the bill. I support the amendment and urge its adoption.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's persistence  to provide robust funding for the Navy's electromagnetic railgun and  recognize that he has offered a similar amendment on the fiscal year  2019 appropriations bill.   I would point out to my colleagues that the bill currently fully  funds the budget request of the administration at $15 million for the  railgun program.   While I do not think the additional $10 million investment will  accelerate the development of a demonstrator mount and continued  testing, I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I simply want to take the time to thank  my colleague for the work he is doing to advocate and advance knowledge  of our Nation's youth on the rights and duties of citizenship. Again, I  thank him for his work.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and  I certainly do support his amendment.   The amendment expands the Hacking for Defense program, designed to  provide students the opportunity to learn how to work with the  Department and intelligence community to better address the Nation's  emerging threats. It is an important activity, and he is absolutely  correct.   Madam Chair, I would point out for my colleagues that, in the current  fiscal year, this program was funded at $15 million. In the current  budget--and I appreciate his advocacy on behalf of this program--that  has now been increased to $40 million. Money is not everything, but it  is important to this program to make sure it is adequately funded.   I, again, thank the gentleman very much for his work.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I would point out that the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force  and the Commandant of the Marine Corps testified that the inclusive  policy adopted under the Obama administration has caused no readiness  issues. A panel of retired military Surgeons General released a report  finding the ban's rationale for inclusion is contradicted by ample  evidence and that the ban ``harms readiness through forced dishonesty,  wasted talent, double standards, and barriers to adequate care.''   Madam Chair, this is the right thing to do, and I would simply close  by saying, with so much anger and so much hate in this world today, it  is time to be kind to people.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, the proposed change inserts a new test  for the certification of acquisition and is likely meant to make it  more difficult for the NSA to target foreign nationals if the intended  target is in communication with someone in the United States.   I would point out, however, to the gentleman that this is an  appropriations bill. This is not an authorization bill. The amendment  is a serious change in policy and deserves more than 10 minutes of  debate in this Chamber on our bill.   The issue belongs in the authorizing committees. I do not believe  that this amendment has benefited from the work of the authorization  process, and I do believe it would potentially put American lives at  greater risk.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Conaway).    Madam Chairwoman, I understand I have the right to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield the remainder of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the ranking member of the  committee.    Madam Chair, I am opposed to the amendment, and yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Chair, just to address the issue for a moment, I  really appreciate the gentlewoman for bringing this to all Members'  attention. She is absolutely correct that this is a very important  program.   I will point out that I think the most important point she made is  that the Navy and the government have to be very efficient in the  expenditure of these funds. It is an important program, but I would  point out that the Navy has awarded contracts late for the last few  years, causing the program to remain perpetually behind.   Again, though, I understand that what the gentlewoman and the  committee want is to let us get this back on track and make sure it is  properly funded. I absolutely would be happy to work with the  gentlewoman on this.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding me  time and simply would suggest that the committee has no opposition to  the amendment.   I would point out that, again, she struck a chord with me when she  talked about the supply chain problems we have in the United States of  America across the industrial sector.   Again, I appreciate her raising this and offering the amendment.    Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  Texas, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment provides an additional $9  million to address one of the Army's top unfunded priorities, future  vertical lift.   The funding would allow the Army to speed up the acquisition timeline  for the replacement of the Black Hawk helicopter, which first entered  service in 1979. The additional range and payload that will be  available via the Black Hawk replacement will ensure that our troops  are provided with the most technologically advanced equipment.   The Army currently enjoys a competitive advantage over our  adversaries, and investment into future vertical lift will ensure that  we continue to have that advantage.   Madam Chair, I ask for support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries) and have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairman, this amendment deals with additional  funds for reporting on climate change impacts on our national security.   I would point out that, in 2014, the Department of Defense issued a  climate change adaptation roadmap that  [[Page H4722]]  described the very serious and significant ways that climate change  threatens the national security of the United States of America.                                time  1615    It found that rising global temperatures, changing precipitation  patterns, climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will  intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty, and  conflict.   It will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease,  disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural  disasters in regions across the globe.   Earlier this year, the department released another report that found  that more than two-thirds of the military's operationally critical  installations are threatened by climate change.   It noted that the effects of a changing climate are a national  security issue, with potential impacts to the Department of Defense's  missions, operational plans, and installations.   As an example, the Air Force currently oversees 15 radar sites in  Alaska. Since the Cold War, they have monitored the airspace above much  of the Bering Sea and the Arctic. When the radar sites were selected in  the 1950s, along Alaska's coastlines and deep in its interior, melting  permafrost and coastal erosion were not yet long-term strategic  concerns for the department.   However, the melting of permafrost is happening more rapidly than  Pentagon officials predicted, and it is causing the ground beneath the  sites to crumble. Three radar sites in Alaska were forced to close in  2007 due in part to soil erosion.   A 2014 Government Accountability Office report found that the  installations are seeing erosion that the Pentagon did not expect to  occur until 2040.   This amendment ensures that the Department of Defense continues to  provide scientifically based information about the effects of climate  change on national security.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would simply state that the department  must be transparent in reporting the strategic, operational, and  financial costs of climate change.   I would ask support for the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding,  and I appreciate the gentleman for offering the amendment.   The operative word here is ``bypass.'' The administration has used an  obscure, rarely used provision to skirt congressional review of arms  sales with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.   The administration's lack of justification for using this emergency  authority with respect to these sales is troubling, especially when you  consider much of the equipment contained in these cases would not be  delivered for months, as the gentleman from California rightfully  pointed out.   Congress is a coequal branch of government and has oversight  responsibilities to review such cases before we sell major weapons  systems to other countries. These review requirements are on the books  for a reason, and this amendment helps to ensure that the law is  adhered to and that Congress is respected and can meet its  constitutional requirement.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, the Russians are cheating on the INF  Treaty. That does not mean we should compound the first problem by  creating a second problem. Don't make a bad situation worse.   Our energy and focus should remain on diplomacy and multilateral  efforts to bring Russia back into compliance with the INF Treaty.   The INF Treaty, which was signed by President Reagan in 1987,  established an agreement between the United States, Russia, and a  number of other countries to not field ground-launched cruise and  ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. This  treaty was instrumental in arresting the arms race, defusing tensions,  and ultimately, bringing an end to the Cold War.   I find it very concerning that, due to the President's suspension of  compliance in February, the INF Treaty will be officially null and void  on August 2. This was all done without exhausting all diplomatic  efforts and with limited congressional input.   The conditions established in the treaty are crucial to European  security.   I find it disingenuous that the statement of administration policy on  this bill implies NATO endorses the U.S. developing an intermediate- range cruise missile capability. The Brussels summit declaration by  NATO heads of state and government in July 2018 stated that the INF  Treaty has been crucial to Euro-Atlantic security and that we remain  fully committed to the preservation of this landmark arms control  treaty.    The December 2018 statement by the NATO Foreign Ministers reinforced  this by stating that the treaty had been crucial in upholding NATO's  security for over 30 years.   The February 2019 statement by the North Atlantic Council continued  to call on Russia to return to compliance with the treaty. It did not  endorse the development of INF-violating weapons by the U.S. or any  other member of the alliance.   NATO's official position on the treaty remains that NATO's focus is  to preserve the INF treaty.   There is no question Russia has not upheld its promises as a  signatory to the treaty. However, I believe the irresponsible actions  of the Russian Government do not require the U.S. to jump headlong into  a costly and unnecessary arms race that will promote greater  instability, which hearkens back to the policies and actions that  defined the most perilous phases of the Cold War.   This amendment would negate previous U.S. nonproliferation and arms  control efforts. It is neither prudent nor wise.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I believe that it is necessary to maintain a credible  and effective nuclear deterrence.   I also strongly believe that multilateral diplomatic efforts,  including the INF Treaty and other international agreements, that  encourage all countries to restrain potentially bad behavior are key  elements of U.S. national security.   Beyond this particular amendment, it is my hope that the  administration will reconsider its efforts to unilaterally abrogate  from our national responsibility to uphold the INF Treaty, and instead,  to work with Congress and our allies abroad to address and rectify  long-standing arms control concerns with Russia and other global  actors.   I will continue to be a strong advocate for diplomacy and remain a  willing and available partner to the administration and our colleagues  in regard to this treaty and other important issues.   Madam Chair, I do oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I, again, strongly oppose the gentleman's  amendment. This amendment would provide funding for the deployment of  the ill-conceived low-yield nuclear warhead on Ohio-class ballistic  missile submarines.   I believe that deploying this warhead would amplify the risk of a  devastating nuclear conflict with Russia by reducing the threshold of  nuclear use and increasing the risk of miscalculation.   Deploying the W76-2 warhead on ballistic missile submarines carries  especially great risk.   I would ask the Members of this body to consider, if we deploy a low- yield warhead aboard our nuclear submarines, would Russia regard such  weapons as less of a threat than our existing submarine-launched  nuclear missiles?   If we were to use such a weapon, even in response to a Russian first  use of low-yield weapons, would Russia be likely to act with restraint,  or would Russian leaders instead assume that we have initiated a  strategic nuclear attack, and respond in kind?   Do we really believe that any nuclear exchange can avoid escalation  by using low-yield weapons?   The significant danger of miscalculation is greater than any marginal  benefit we might gain from having another low-yield capability in our  nuclear arsenal.   I would point out that suggesting that barring the deployment of this  is akin to unilateral disarmament is simply not true.   This bill includes robust funding for maintaining and modernizing our  nuclear arsenal. The bill includes more than $712 million for the  development of the Long-Range Standoff Weapon. It provides $1.6 billion  for the Columbia-class Submarine and over $3 billion for the continued  development of the B-21 bomber.   This bill does cut excessive, unproven nuclear programs that generate  significant risks without appreciably enhancing our security or that of  our allies, but those looking for unilateral disarmament in this bill  will not find it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in closing, I wish to emphasize that we  should not use the most survivable leg of our triad as a tactical  warfighting platform.   It is imperative for the House to reaffirm Ronald Reagan's clear-eyed  admonition that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I commend the gentlewoman for her work with the committee to make all  of us aware of the lack of support that our veterans are facing on the  space-available flights. I am happy to report that, because of  congressional actions such as hers and her adamant action on this  behalf, the Department is updating their air transportation eligibility  requirements to expand space-available privileges in no little reason  because of the gentlewoman's actions, and I do support her amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I appreciate the perspective of the gentlewoman as well, and I would  point out that, during the day today, I have risen in opposition to two  different nuclear policy issues that would increase spending in our  bill. I would like to point out I am opposed, however, to the  gentlewoman's amendment, and her bill does take several actions related  to the oversight of the administration's multiple, ongoing nuclear  weapon efforts.   First, in the bill, we do reduce the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent  program by $108.7 million.   Second, the bill denies $19.6 million requested by the administration  to deploy a low-yield nuclear warhead on submarine-launched ballistic  missiles.   Third, it denies nearly $100 million requested by the administration  to develop two new missile systems that would not be compliant with the  INF Treaty.   Fourth, it requires the Navy to submit a report on the cost,  requirements, and other matters related to a nuclear submarine-launched  cruise missile, which is still in the planning stage.   I would emphasize to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  this bill does not take a reflexive or ideological position. This bill  is the result of thorough oversight, and the committee has striven for  a balanced policy. I simply believe this amendment goes too far, and I  am opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding  again. I think the gentleman is doing good work here. The gentleman is  correct that there was an increase of $2 million from $85 million from  last year's fiscal year in our bill; however, it was a $12 million  increase from the administration's request, so I do applaud him for his  work.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman in this  regard, and I share his concerns.   I would simply point out for the Record that, in the committee's  markup, we have increased funding for this, before the gentleman's  amendment, by 24 percent over last year's level.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.    Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  raising this important issue.   The committee recognizes the urgent need to invest in trusted  foundries, advanced microelectronics cybersecurity, and manufacturing  capabilities that will translate our domestic research into fielded  capabilities for the warfighter.                                time  1730    I look forward to working with the gentleman as we move forward on  this bill.   I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's concern. The  committee has been following the implication of the Department's  medical reform efforts closely and certainly  [[Page H4731]]  shares many of the gentleman's concerns.   The committee has requested the Department provide details of the  analysis used to determine changes to medical services at the medical  treatment facilities. This analysis would include details on the  capacity of the local community, cost impacts on providers, and the  risk to the served populations.   I assure the gentleman from South Carolina that the committee will  continue to monitor these issues closely.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Cunningham).    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    We are moving very close to the conclusion of debate  on this portion of H.R. 2740, and my good friend ranking member Mr.  Calvert and I would not be here without our staff.   They have been exceptional, and I do want to thank them: Ariana  Sarar, Jackie Ripke, Jennifer Chartrand, Johnnie Kaberle, Kiya  Batmanglidj, Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, David Bortnick, Matt Bower,  Bill Adkins, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, Shannon Richter, Sherry  Young, Kyle McFarland, and Jamie McCormick.   I also thank Joe DeVooght, Preston Rackauskas, Rebecca Keightley, and  Christopher Romero, and finally, our two clerks, Becky Leggieri and  Leslie Albright.   Again, sincerely, I thank Mr. Calvert, just a tremendous partner, and  all the members of our committee, as well as all the associate staff.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.
