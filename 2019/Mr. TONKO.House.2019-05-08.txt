DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1328, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1328, the Advancing Critical  Connectivity Expands Service, Small Business Resources, Opportunities,  Access, and Data Based on Assessed Need and Demand Act, or the ACCESS  BROADBAND Act.   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank my good friend, Representative  Brooks, for partnering with me on this legislation. I also thank the  bipartisan group of Members who have cosponsored and supported this  legislation, including the many members of the Energy and Commerce  Committee who agree that these simple steps can make a big difference  for the local communities that our Federal broadband programs are meant  for.   Let me be clear: This bill is about serving the people. While a  number of valuable Federal broadband initiatives exist, they are siloed  in different agencies and are not often coordinated with one another.  As a result, the process for local community and business leaders can  be confusing.   H.R. 1328, the ACCESS BROADBAND Act, would establish a coordinating  office for Federal broadband resources by creating an Office of  Internet Connectivity and Growth within the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration at the Department of Commerce.   Helping these constituents gain access to broadband internet in the  capital region is one of the reasons I sought to join the Energy and  Commerce Committee and why I have worked to advance this legislation.   Access to high-speed broadband internet service is increasingly  essential. Today, people rely on baseline internet access for banking,  to find a job, to do their homework, to communicate with their doctor  or other healthcare provider, to communicate with their loved ones, to  petition their government, and so much more. Yet, many Americans still  do not have reliable high-speed internet service at home.   While a number of valuable Federal broadband initiatives exist, they  are siloed in different agencies and are not often coordinated with one  another. As a result, the process for local community and business  leaders can be confusing.   H.R. 1328, the Advancing Critical Connectivity Expands Service, Small  Business Resources, Opportunities, Access, and Data Based on Assessed  Need and Demand Act, or ACCESS BROADBAND Act, would establish a  coordinating office.   This new office would hold regional workshops to share best practices  and strategies for supporting local business and community leaders  interested in expanding broadband access and its adoption.   Our bill would also direct the Office of Internet Connectivity and  Growth to consult with any agency offering Federal broadband support to  streamline the application process and, to the greatest extent  practicable, to create one universal application regardless of which  Federal agency or office is involved.   Most importantly, this new office, Mr. Speaker, will be charged with  coordinating broadband support provided by all of our Federal agencies  that are working to solve this problem, including support offered at  the Federal Communications Commission and the Rural  [[Page H3490]]  Utility Service at the Department of Agriculture.   Furthermore, the bill clarifies that nothing in this act would alter  or amend any provision of the section of law that authorizes the FCC's  Universal Service Fund.   H.R. 1328 is an important bill that would indeed help speed up  broadband deployment to unserved and underserved areas and promote  broadband adoption.   There is still much more work to be done on this issue, and I do hope  that this can serve as a starting place for us to open doors of  opportunity and access to millions of Americans by investing in  broadband expansion.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members and staff working together on  ACCESS BROADBAND to help ensure that our communities can access the  broadband resources that they need to grow and prosper.   The ACCESS BROADBAND Act is a bipartisan, commonsense bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1328. It underscores the very relevance and importance of broadband in  today's society. It speaks to fairness for all communities, certainly  for all households, businesses, and the like. It is a way for us to  offer a greater partnership with government, more effective governance,  with this given phenomenon of technology. I encourage my colleagues to  support that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
