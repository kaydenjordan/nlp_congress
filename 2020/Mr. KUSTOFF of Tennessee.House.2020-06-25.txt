 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  really fine man, Richard Barber from Jackson, Tennessee.   Richard runs the Aspell Recovery Center in Jackson, and he was  recently honored as the Jackson Exchange Club's Man of the Year, a  title very much deserved.   I first met Richard through a really good friend of mine, Dr. Ron  Kirkland. Ron is a board member of Aspell and wanted me to see the  great work that Aspell does in Jackson and the west Tennessee  community, treating, mentoring, and loving those who need it the most.  Most of the staff members working at Aspell have also traveled the path  to recovery.   Richard Barber has been a strong leader in the community, and he has  a true commitment to helping those in need.   I have seen firsthand how hard Richard has worked to make changes in  the drug and rehabilitation field for those suffering from addiction.   Richard has literally changed lives through Aspell, where he was  instrumental in the development of two new expansions: A Mother's Love  in Humboldt and the Savannah/Hardin County intensive outpatient care  unit.   There is no doubt that without Aspell, so many folks in west  Tennessee wouldn't get the care and the wherewithal that they need to  survive. Without Richard Barber, there would be no Aspell as we know it  today.   Congratulations, Richard. Through your hard work and your incredible  humility, you are the right pick for the Exchange Club's Man of the  Year. There is no doubt that west Tennessee and the city of Jackson are  better because of you.                            ____________________
