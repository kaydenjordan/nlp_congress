 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, the poisoning of Russian opposition  leader Alexei Navalny, which happened last month, was a very disgusting  thing to hear about. Such action in Russia or by Russia is not  unprecedented. In 2015, the leading democracy advocate in Russia, Boris  Nemtsov, was gunned down within the sight of the Kremlin. The square in  front of the Russian Embassy in Washington is now named in his honor,  echoing the effort that I led to name the street in front of the old  Russian Embassy after the dissident Andrei Sakharov.   Nemtsov's protege in the Russian opposition, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was  then poisoned--poisoned twice but miraculously survived and continues  to work for Russian democracy. The good news is that Mr. Navalny is  reportedly conscious.   Now, a silver lining may also be that Putin's latest attempted  assassination is bringing our allies toward a consensus to treat Putin  as a pariah.   There are reports of senior German politicians reconsidering their  support for Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which divides our European allies.  This pipeline is opposed by countries like Poland and the Baltics that  truly understand that Putin will use it as a strategic influence tool,  as well as by the Trump administration and bipartisan majorities in  Congress.   I hope all of these happenings are a start of a new era of  cooperation with our Russian allies to counter Russian influence.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
