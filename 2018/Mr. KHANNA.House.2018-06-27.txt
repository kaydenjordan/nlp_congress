 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to introduce my friend and  constituent, Dr. Jack Trieber, pastor of North Valley Baptist Church in  Santa Clara, California in my district. I thank him for his words of  wisdom and comfort, and for joining us to deliver the opening prayer in  the House today.   Pastor Trieber has been a source of strength and guidance for my  constituents for more than four decades. He is a personal friend and  counselor and source of strength to me. He and his wife, Cindie, have  been friends since I entered public service, and I appreciate that  Pastor Trieber accompanied me to last year's annual National Prayer  Breakfast to join leaders from across the country in discussing the  importance of faith to the strength of our Nation.   Under the pastor's leadership, North Valley Baptist Church has grown  from an assembly of 22 people in 1976, the year I was born, to a  current average of 3,000 in attendance each Sunday. He is a true  patriot.   He believes in this country, and it is a real honor to have had him  open our House with his prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be  removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 2069.
