 Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for America.  This partisan impeachment sham seeks to disenfranchise 63 million  American voters.   I want to use my time to call on this Chamber, for Members to rise  and observe a moment of silent reflection, to give every Member here  the chance to pause for a moment and remember the voices of the 63  million American voters the Democrats today are wanting to silence.   Madam Speaker, disenfranchising 63 million voters gives me 63 million  reasons to vote ``no'', and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
