 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 27, a  continuing resolution providing funding through February 1.   I support the goal of reopening the government. There are many  critical programs that are on pause which are important to my  constituents and all of us, programs like TSA, Border Patrol, Coast  Guard, and air traffic controllers.   Unfortunately, the bill we are considering today will not restart  those programs or help our districts. That is because it is not a  comprehensive solution to resolve the government shutdown and fully  address the security and humanitarian crisis we face on our southern  border.   Criminals, terrorists, and drugs are flooding our shores. Tens of  thousands of children, many of them without their parents, make the  dangerous trip to the United States every year. I have been to the  border and to Central America, and I have heard the heartbreaking  stories. This situation is unacceptable and it must be addressed. We  can and we must do better.   Madam Speaker, again, I share the concern that parts of the  government  [[Page H557]]  remain closed and employees are not yet being paid, but moving this  bill across the floor will not fix the problem. To put it simply, there  is not a bipartisan consensus on this plan.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this continuing  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
