 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, later today, the House is poised to  send us a 2-week continuing resolution, which will give us time to hash  out the remainder of the appropriations process this year. I expect it  will pass this Chamber later this afternoon. President Trump and my  Republican colleagues now have to decide what they want to do after  those 2 weeks are up and, hopefully, even sooner.   As everybody knows, Democrats have offered to pass the bipartisan DHS  appropriations bill agreed to 6 months ago, which includes $1.6 billion  for border security. There has been some confusion about that figure.   Let me be clear. The $1.6 billion cannot be used to construct any  part of President Trump's 30-foot-tall, concrete border wall. It can be  used only for fencing, using technology currently deployed at the  border, only where the experts say fencing is appropriate and makes  sense as a security feature.   This is something Democrats have always been for: smart, effective,  appropriate border security. This is so good that every Republican  appropriator signed off on that bill a few months ago, including  Senator McConnell, Senator Shelby, Senator Rubio, and Senator Graham.  They were all for it.   This is a bipartisan compromise proposal. If they can't go for the  proposal that they signed off on and negotiated because President Trump  is pounding the table in an irrational way, there is a second option.  Democrats have also offered to pass the six bipartisan appropriations  bills and a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland  Security. This continuing resolution doesn't resolve this issue but  continues to fund the Homeland Security Department. We think that  continuing resolution should be for a year.   Both options would receive 60 votes in the Senate, would pass in the  House, and would get us home in time for the Christmas holiday, which I  know many people want to do. I have heard that from many of my  Republican friends.   As I said, either option would keep the government funded over  Christmas. We don't want to see the government shut down over  Christmas, even though President Trump seems to brag that he wants one.  The one and only way we approach a shutdown is if President Trump  refuses both of our proposals and demands $5 billion or more for a  border wall.   The wall request is a nonstarter for many reasons. Here are three:   First, when President Trump proposed this as a candidate, he said:  ``I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.'' The idea that  the American taxpayer now has to foot the bill doesn't make sense.   Second, there is no plan for the wall. They haven't said where they  want to build it or how high it is. Let me make clear that I don't like  any wall, but how can you spend $5 billion when there is no plan? It  shows that this is sort of political fodder for President Trump. It  appeals to his base, but he doesn't even care that much that his whole  government, his whole administration has not submitted any specific  plans.   Third, last year we put $1.345 billion into Homeland Security for  border security. Not a nickel of that has been spent on a wall. It  couldn't be. The language didn't allow it. But virtually none of it has  been spent at all. They still have that $1.34 billion they haven't even  spent the vast majority of, and already they are demanding $5 billion  more.   Some would say demanding $1.6 billion more is too much, but the idea  that they haven't spent last year's money and they are demanding such a  huge amount this year makes no sense at all. To ask the American  taxpayer to foot the bill for an unplanned, unnecessary, ineffective  border wall is just preposterous.   We know why President Trump is doing this, as he does so many things.  It is a throwaway idea to fire up his base. I am ashamed that my  Republican colleagues, who know better, are going along.   If President Trump wants to throw a temper tantrum and shut down the  government over Christmas over the wall, that is his decision, but  there are two sensible options on the table to avoid one. We do not  want to let a Trump temper tantrum govern our policies or cause the  shutdown of the government, which everyone on both sides of the aisle  knows is the wrong idea.   One final point: By letting the President's demands get in the way,  my Republican colleagues are, in effect, ceding Congress's authority  over the appropriations process to the President. Leader McConnell has  repeatedly said that he wants regular order on appropriations in the  Senate. In fact, that has been one of the few bipartisan high moments  that this Senate has had.    Last year, we passed a good appropriations process and came together  on an omnibus. This year, we have funded close to three-quarters of the  government already--bipartisan, passed by a large majority. That is how  it should work. It should work the same way for the Department of  Homeland Security. Regular order would dictate that the Senate consider  the bipartisan DHS appropriations bill that has been passed out of  committee and been agreed to by both parties here on the floor. In the  meantime, the six other bipartisan appropriations bills that have also  been agreed to by both parties are being held hostage over this  unnecessarily, to any objective observer.   If my friend Leader McConnell is so concerned about regular order, he  would bring up the remaining appropriations bills, as agreed to, for a  vote. He would tell President Trump that the bipartisan conference  bill, the bipartisan compromise--or a CR--is the way to go to avoid a  shutdown.                       NOMINATION OF BERNARD L. MCNAMEE    Madam President, on another matter, yesterday, all 49 Democrats voted  against considering the nomination of Bernard McNamee to the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, and that was for good reason. McNamee has  spent the bulk of his career boosting fossil fuels and slandering  renewable energy. His views are so anachronistic, regressive, and  counterfactual that I am sure most of my Republican colleagues would  not agree with him. He has lied about how renewable energies impact the  electric grid. He has called support for clean energy ``organized  propaganda'' and has pitched the debate between fossil fuels and  renewables, in his words, as a ``clash between liberty and tyranny.''  My Republican friends, these words sound absurd. You would think I was  making them up because it would so vilify Mr. McNamee, but my  Republican friends can see on video every one of these statements that  he made.   At a time when our country is plagued by wildfires and flooding, at a  time when more powerful storms and hurricanes buffet our coasts, at a  time when average Americans are feeling the devastating effects of  climate change right now, we should not elevate someone so biased in  favor of the fossil fuels that caused these problems in the first  place.   We have a final vote today. Every Democrat has voted no. We need one  Republican to switch to defeat this awful nomination. I hope my  colleagues will think about it.   Please, look up the record. Don't just listen to my speech. Just look  at what this man has said, and I think a good number of you might want  to vote no.   On the front page of the New York Times this morning, there was a  report about how the emission of greenhouse gases has actually  accelerated in the past few years. Climate change is going to be a  defining issue of our generation and a defining issue in future  elections.   The vote on McNamee clearly shows the difference between the two  parties on the issue of climate change right now. The Democrats believe  we need to address climate change with bold and substantial action. We  cannot wait until a later day. We cannot keep approving folks like  McNamee to influence energy policy. We need to act. Meanwhile, too many  of our Republican colleagues pretend the issue doesn't even exist, and  that is sad.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
