 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize March 2017 as  National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.   This month offers us an opportunity to raise awareness about  colorectal cancer and to recommit to taking action against this  disease. Colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable forms of  cancer, yet it remains the second leading cause of cancer death among  men and women, combined, in the United States.   This year, more than 130,000 individuals in the United States will be  diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Approximately 50,000 more will die  from it. Too often, individuals are forced to forego screening because  of high insurance costs. In order to get more people screened and save  lives, we need to break down the financial barriers to treatment.   Last month, I joined the Congressman Charlie Dent and Leonard Lance  to introduce the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act.  Our bill eliminates colonoscopy cost-sharing for Medicare patients so  that every patient has access to this lifesaving treatment.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot let cost stand in the way of care. I urge  Congress to quickly advance this legislation. Patients are counting on  it.                            ____________________
