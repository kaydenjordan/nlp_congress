 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight outraged over the systemic  slaughter of Ukrainian children by Russian murderer Vladimir Putin.   Countless Ukrainian children are being murdered and orphaned. An  entire generation is watching as everything around them is destroyed by  Russia's war machine.   Fathers and mothers are being ripped from sons and daughters. The  littlest are being left to fend for themselves, as Russia lays waste to  everything Ukrainians have ever known.   No little child should be left to weep next to the unmarked grave of  their parent that they will never see again.   No child should have to ponder how they will eat or where they will  sleep due to the actions of a tyrant who derives satisfaction from  their despair.   We have a global responsibility to end this bloodshed. Fully arm  Ukraine now. Isolate Russia from the community of responsible nations.  Starve Putin and his oligarchs. Make sure that we help Ukraine  withstand all that they must in order to win this war against Russia's  killing machine. Let all democratic nations do everything they can to  assure liberty in Ukraine is victorious.  [[Page H4384]]                                ____________________
