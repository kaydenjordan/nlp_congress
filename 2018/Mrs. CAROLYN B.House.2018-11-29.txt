 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, improving government interactions with the public must  be a constant goal of Federal agencies and Members of Congress. I  support this bill because it moves us toward that objective.   The House bill before us is the companion measure to a bill  introduced by Senator Claire McCaskill which passed the Senate  unanimously last year.   H.R. 2846 would require Federal agencies to collect voluntary  feedback from the public, a common practice in the private sector.  Agencies would have to report the results of this feedback to the  Office of Management and Budget and post it on agency websites.   Importantly, agencies would be required to ensure that this  information is anonymous and protect their privacy.   However, using customer satisfaction sources to demonize certain  agencies or agency personnel is not an appropriate use of this  information. This feedback should be used for constructive purposes.   Measuring the public's satisfaction with the service agencies provide  is a good step toward improving services overall and will hopefully  provide insight into how agencies can improve their operations. The aim  is to create a virtuous cycle, not a vicious one.   Congress must also recognize its role in improving agency performance  and customer satisfaction. Agencies will inevitably receive low  satisfaction scores from the public if they are woefully underfunded  and are not able to hire and adequately train employees, as this has,  unfortunately, been the case at some agencies over the past few years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers on this bill on this side, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the All-American Flag Act is a commonsense bill that all  Members should support. It would simply require all Federal agencies to  purchase American flags that are manufactured in the United States,  using materials grown or produced in the United States.   Under current law, this requirement applies only to the Departments  of Defense and Veterans Affairs. It should be extended to all Federal  agencies.   As under current law, the bill would provide certain limited  exceptions and allow agencies to purchase American flags made elsewhere  if they are not available in sufficient quantity or quality from  American manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to reserve my time eventually, but first, I  yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my  distinguished colleague.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to  congratulate my friend and colleague on this excellent, patriotic bill,  of which I am a cosponsor.   I have no further speakers on this side of the aisle, so I yield back  the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3154, the Inspector  General Access Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Richmond, Hice, and Lynch for  the bipartisan manner in which they worked on this very important bill.   The Inspector General Access Act would allow the IG of the Department  of Justice to investigate allegations of misconduct by Department  attorneys. The IG is statutorily independent and currently has the  authority to investigate other DOJ personnel, but is barred from  pursuing appropriate investigations into the attorneys at the  Department.   Under current law, the authority to investigate attorneys is  restricted to the Office of Professional Responsibility within DOJ. OPR  is not statutorily independent; its head is not Senate confirmed like  the IG; and treating attorneys differently from other personnel is  unfair.   One year ago, Michael Horowitz, the inspector general at the  Department of Justice, testified before the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform: ``This bifurcated jurisdiction creates a system  where misconduct by FBI agents and other DOJ law enforcement officers  is conducted by a statutorily independent IG appointed by the President  and confirmed by the Senate, while misconduct by DOJ prosecutors is  investigated by a component head who is appointed by the Department's  leadership and who lacks statutory independence. There is no principled  reason for treating misconduct by Federal prosecutors differently than  misconduct by DOJ law enforcement agents.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from Mr. Horowitz  expressing his strong support for this bill before us today.                                        U.S. Department of Justice,                                 Office of the Inspector General,                                                  November 29, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cummings: I write to       express my strong support for H.R. 3154, the ``Inspector       General Access Act of 2017'' (Access Act), which your       Committee approved unanimously on September 27, 2018. The       Access Act would amend the Inspector General Act (IG Act) to       provide the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the       Inspector General (OIG) with authority to investigate       allegations of misconduct against DOJ attorneys for their       actions as lawyers, just as the OIG has authority under the       IG Act to investigate allegations of misconduct made against       any non-lawyer in the Department, including law enforcement       agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug       Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Marshals       Service (USMS). Currently, under Section 8E of the Inspector       General Act, the OIG does not have the authority to       investigate allegations of misconduct made against DOJ       attorneys acting in their capacity as lawyers; this role is       reserved exclusively for the Department's Office of       Professional Responsibility (OPR).        The Access Act has received broad, bipartisan support over       successive Congresses because it promotes independent       oversight, transparency, and accountability within DOJ and       for all of its employees. For these same reasons, in 1994,       the then-General Accounting Office, now the Government       Accountability Office (GAO), issued a report that found that       preventing the OIG from investigating attorney misconduct was       inconsistent with the independence and accountability that       Congress envisioned under the IG Act.        The OIG has long questioned this carve-out because OPR       lacks statutory independence and does not regularly release       its reports and conclusions to the public. Moreover, to our       knowledge, the DOJ Inspector General is the only Inspector       General in the entire federal government that does not have       the authority to investigate alleged professional misconduct       by attorneys who work in the agency it oversees. Providing       the OIG with authority to exercise jurisdiction in attorney       professional misconduct cases would enhance the public's       confidence in the outcomes of these investigations and       provide the OIG with the same authority as every other       Inspector General.      Alleged professional misconduct by DOJ prosecutors, like any           alleged misconduct by DOJ agents, should be subject to           statutorily independent oversight.        Over fifteen years ago, the Department and Congress       recognized the importance of statutorily independent OIG       oversight over all DOJ law enforcement components (FBI, DEA,       USMS, and ATF) when Attorney General Ashcroft authorized the       OIG to conduct additional law enforcement oversight in 2001       and Congress legislated it in 2002. Yet, allegations against       Department prosecutors for professional misconduct continue       to be handled exclusively by OPR. As a result, presently, if       an allegation of misconduct is made against the FBI Director,       it is reviewed by the OIG; by contrast, if an allegation of       professional misconduct is made against the Attorney General,       it is handled by OPR, a Departmental component that the       Attorney General supervises.  [[Page H9719]]         The rationale supporting independent oversight for alleged       misconduct by law enforcement applies with equal force to       alleged wrongdoing by federal prosecutors, regardless of the       nature of the alleged misconduct. There is no principled       reason to have two standards of oversight at DOJ--one for       federal agents, who are subject to statutorily independent       and transparent oversight by the OIG, and one for federal       prosecutors, who are not for allegations of professional       misconduct. This is particularly true given the extraordinary       power that Department lawyers have to charge individuals with       crimes, to seek incarceration, and to pursue the seizure of       assets and property.        The OIG's independence, established by statutory       authorities and protections, facilitates objective and       credible investigations of misconduct allegations, as well as       unbiased reports that identify and make useful       recommendations for improving the Department. The OIG is       headed by a Senate-confirmed Inspector General who can only       be removed by the President, with prior notice to Congress.       The OIG's statutory independence is bolstered by the OIG's       dual obligation to report findings and concerns both to the       Attorney General and to Congress. The independent OIG is able       to make critical investigative and audit findings without       fear of reprisal.        Conversely, OPR has no statutory independence or       protections. The OPR Counsel is appointed by and answers to       the Attorney General, and can be removed or disciplined by       the Attorney General. Although a November 27, 2018 letter       from DOJ's Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) on H.R. 3154       states that ``OPR has always acted independently,'' it does       not point to any protections, statutory or otherwise, that       exist to ensure OPR's independence from the Attorney General,       nor has DOJ proposed strengthening OPR's independence by       adding such protections. Indeed, the letter fails to explain       or even address why DOJ believes it is better to have a non-      statutorily independent entity handle attorney professional       misconduct cases rather than a statutorily independent       organization, as is the case for law enforcement professional       misconduct allegations.      The OIG's independent and transparent oversight enhances the           public's confidence in the DOJ's programs and improves           its operations.        In addition to independence, the OIG considers transparency       a crucial component of its oversight mission. With limited       exceptions, the OIG ensures that the public is aware of the       results of our work. The majority of our reports are posted       on our public website at the time of release to ensure that       Congress and the public are informed of our findings, in a       comprehensive and timely manner. The OIG, consistent with the       IG Act, publishes on our website summaries of investigations       resulting in findings of administrative misconduct by senior       government employees and in matters of public interest even       when the subject is not prosecuted. We post such summaries       without identifying the investigative subject consistent with       the legal requirements under the Privacy Act. Because of this       commitment to transparency, there are currently hundreds of       OIG reports, audits, and reviews posted on our web site.       There are also summaries of dozens of OIG investigative       reports posted, including recent reports involving       significant misconduct by senior DOJ officials.        In contrast, there are currently only a total of five       reports (other than annual reports) posted on OPR's website.       Four of those five reports are from 2008 and were the result       of OPR's joint work with the OIG, and which the OIG posted on       our website consistent with the IG Act and our practice. The       fifth report was completed by OPR in 2013 and only released       in 2015 in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)       request. Moreover, although the OLA letter states that ``OPR       discloses a substantial amount of information about its work       and findings in its annual report,'' this information is not       reported in a timely or comprehensive manner. Congress and       the public only find out about some, but not necessarily all,       of OPR's work when it issues an annual report.        An example of this dichotomy can be found in a case       involving an Oregon lawyer who was arrested by the FBI and       wrongly imprisoned after mismatched fingerprints linked him       to the 2004 bombing at a Madrid train station. The OIG       investigated the allegations of FBI agent misconduct, while       the Department's OPR investigated the allegations of attorney       misconduct. This bifurcation led to inconsistent treatment.       The OIG report on the actions of the FBI agents was published       on the OIG's website, but OPR did not publish the report on       the conduct of the DOJ attorneys who were involved in the       same case.        Transparency ensures greater accountability, and sends an       important deterrent message to other Department employees.       The credibility of the Department's disciplinary process is       inevitably reduced when the responsible component operates       under the direction of the Department's senior leadership and       is not subject to public scrutiny because of limited       transparency.      The OIG has demonstrated its excellence in reviewing complex           legal and factual issues, including employee ethics and           misconduct matters.        Over the past 30 years, the OIG has shown that it is       capable of fair and independent oversight of the DOJ. The       jurisdictional limitation of Section 8E(b)(3) is an       unnecessary historical vestige of the fact that OPR was in       existence prior to the statutory creation of the OIG in 1988.       Those who unsuccessfully tried in 2002 to forestall Congress       from providing the OIG with oversight of alleged misconduct       by FBI and DEA agents contended that those cases required       specialized expertise--just like the Department argues       currently that prosecutorial oversight requires specialized       expertise--and that argument was roundly rejected and has       proven to be entirely without merit. The decision by Congress       to extend OIG jurisdiction in 2002 to encompass misconduct by       FBI and DEA agents has allowed for significant and important       oversight of DOJ's law enforcement operations, and has had       significant positive impact on the integrity of those       agencies' operations.        The OIG has consistently demonstrated our ability to handle       complex legal and factual issues related to our misconduct       reviews, including those involving FBI and DEA agents as well       as, on occasion, ethics issues involving DOJ lawyers. In       addition to our recent investigation of the FBI's actions       prior to the 2016 presidential election, which involved       evaluating the professional conduct by FBI agents, FBI       lawyers, and FBI senior officials, we have investigated the       FBI's actions involving its former agent Robert Hanssen, the       FBI's activities related to James ``Whitey'' Bulger, the       DEA's oversight of its confidential informant program, the       DEA and other components' handling of sexual misconduct and       harassment cases, the operation of the FBI laboratory, ATF's       actions involving Operation Fast and Furious, and the FBI's       use of its national security authorities (National Security       Letters, Patriot Act Section 215, FISA Amendment Act Section       702).        Each of those and many other reviews resulted in       independent and transparent findings by the OIG, and resulted       in changes to Department operations that enhanced their       effectiveness and thereby increased the public's confidence       in those programs. Moreover, OIGs throughout the government,       including at the Department of Homeland Security and the       Securities and Exchange Commission, have authority to       investigate misconduct allegations made against attorneys at       those agencies and they have demonstrated that they are fully       capable of dealing with such matters covering a wide range of       complex legal issues. The DOJ OIG is the only OIG, to our       knowledge, that is barred by the IG Act from reviewing       misconduct by lawyers within the agency it oversees.      The Access Act would provide the OIG with oversight over           Department lawyers in a manner that is entirely           consistent with its oversight authority over Department           non-attorneys.        The present oversight system that applies to allegations       made against any DOJ non-lawyer, as provided for in the IG       Act and Department regulations, is precisely the oversight       mechanism that the Access Act seeks to apply to Department       lawyers. Specifically, under the current system for DOJ non-      lawyers, all non-frivolous misconduct allegations must be       provided to the OIG for the OIG's review and determination as       to whether it is of the type and nature that warrants and       necessitates independent OIG investigation. Given the OIG's       limited resources, the OIG handles only those allegations       that warrant an independent OIG investigation, and therefore       the OIG returns routine and less serious misconduct       allegations to Department components, such as the FBI's       Inspections Division and the DEA's OPR, for their handling       and investigation. For those matters that the OIG retains,       when the OIG completes its investigation, it sends its report       to the component so that it can adjudicate the OIG's findings       and take disciplinary action, as appropriate. The Access Act       creates a similar practice, by maintaining the Department's       OPR to handle misconduct allegations that do not require       independent outside review as determined by the OIG, much as       the internal affairs offices at the FBI, DEA, ATF, and USMS       remain in place today.        We are unaware of any claims by Department leaders that       this approach has resulted in ``different investigative       standards,'' ``decrease[d] efficiency,'' or ``inconsistent       application'' of legal standards. There is no evidence that       it has impacted the components ``ability to successfully       defend any significant discipline decision before the Merit       Systems Protection Board.'' Yet this parade of horribles is       precisely what the OLA letter claims will occur if attorneys       are treated in the same manner as Special Agents and non-      attorneys at the Department, rather than continuing to       receive the special oversight treatment granted to them under       the current carve-out provision under the IG Act. This       argument it meritless. Indeed, the disciplinary processes at       the FBI and the DEA have substantially improved since the OIG       obtained statutory oversight authority over those components       in 2002, in significant part due to the greater transparency       and accountability that has resulted from the OIG's       oversight.        I very much appreciate your strong support for my Office       and for Inspectors General throughout the federal government.            Sincerely,                                               Michael E. Horowitz,                                                 Inspector General.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3154 would not  prohibit OPR from investigating attorneys. It would simply add the  ability to investigate attorneys when appropriate  [[Page H9720]]  in the IG's authority, an additional layer of accountability.   Empowering IGs has been, and should continue to be, a nonpartisan  issue.   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform relies on the work  of IGs, and we strongly support ensuring they can do their jobs  effectively.   This bill was ordered reported by the Oversight Committee  unanimously. I urge my colleagues to continue their support for IGs by  supporting the Inspector General Access Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 21st Century Integrated  Digital Experience Act, and I thank my friend and colleague,  Representative Ro Khanna, for his bipartisan work on this important  bill.   This bill will require agencies to modernize their public-facing  websites and increase the types of services and forms available to the  public in a digital format.   Improving the capabilities of agency websites available to the public  is essential to ensuring that the Federal Government continues to meet  the demands of today's citizens. This bill would help to achieve that  goal by requiring agencies to make long overdue improvements to the  websites and digital services they provide for the public's benefit.   For example, the bill would require that any new or redesigned  website be accessible to people with disabilities, offer search  functions to allow users to more easily find specific content, and use  data-driven analysis to ensure that users' needs are being adequately  addressed.   This bill also would mandate that within 2 years of enactment,  agencies provide the public with the option of completing any  transactions by means of an online, mobile-friendly, digital format. In  other words, on their phones.   Finally, the bill would require agencies to submit to both the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform a report on the progress being made in  implementing the bill's requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of California (Mr. Khanna).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my  colleagues and Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this commonsense bill. The Settlement  Agreement Information Database Act would create a database of  settlement agreements entered into by Federal agencies that relate to  alleged violations of Federal, civil, or criminal law.   The Office of Management and Budget would manage this database and  set deadlines for submission. The heads of executive agencies would be  required to submit details about the types of settlement agreements,  parties involved in the settlements, specific violations, and the dates  on which the settlement agreements were entered into.   The information about the settlement agreements would remain public  until 5 years after the termination of the agreements. The information  within the agreements would remain subject to FOIA regulations. But if  the head of the agencies decided to keep an entire agreement  confidential, he or she would be required to submit an explanation of  that action to the database.   This bill would improve the transparency surrounding settlement  agreements, which in the past have been difficult for the public to  access.   Mr. Speaker, I do not have any further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal CIO Authorization Act would make several  commonsense changes to existing law.   First, it would update the name of the Administrator for E-Government  to the Federal Chief Information Officer and require that individual to  report directly to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   Second, it would establish the position of Federal Chief Information  Security Officer, who would report to the Federal CIO and assist OMB in  its cybersecurity efforts.   Finally, the bill would require the Federal CIO to submit a proposal  on consolidating IT across Federal agencies, especially smaller  agencies, through the use of shared services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member in this Congress to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
