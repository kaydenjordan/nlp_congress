 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the teaching  brewery at Morrisville State College, which, despite opening just last  fall, has won the title as Grand National Champion brewing school in  North America at the 2018 U.S. Open College Beer Championship. The  contest, open to any college or university offering brewing courses, is  held to determine the best future brewers in North America.   Morrisville State College currently offers the courses as electives  but hopes to have a full curriculum for the fall of 2019, making  Morrisville the first State university of New York with a 4-year  brewing program. Morrisville's program fits right in with upstate New  York, which has several well-known breweries that bring jobs,  creativity, and originality to the region, including the F.X. Matt  Brewing Company, the fourth oldest family brewery in the United States;  the Empire Brewing Factory in Cazenovia; and also the Cortland Farm  Distillery and Brewery in Cortland, New York.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Morrisville State  College on becoming the number one brewing school in North America  their first time out. It took a lot of dedication from the students  from Morrisville. I look forward to tasting some of their products as  we move into the next semester.                            ____________________
