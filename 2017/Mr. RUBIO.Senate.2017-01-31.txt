 Mr. President, we are here in the Senate debating what I  believe is the most important Cabinet position that the President has  to nominate, the Secretary of State. It comes at an important point in  American foreign policy history. There is so much uncertainty and  debate about our role in the world these days. A lot of our allies have  questions. Our adversaries are obviously watching very closely.   I hope that all of us--and I mean the Executive Branch to the  Congress--recognize that as people around the world are watching what  is happening on television, they see an America that is deeply divided  and fractured right now. I think this needs to be a moment of  restraint, both in action and in words. As we work through our  differences, these vibrant debates are important to our system of  government.   It is one of the reasons that led me to ultimately support the  nomination of Mr. Tillerson. I believe that despite some of the  concerns that I had and have about his answers to some of my questions,  it is vitally important for this country to have a Secretary of State  in place at this moment.   I have never had any doubts about Mr. Tillerson's qualifications, his  intellect, his background. I have had some concerns about his answers  to some very important questions, at least important questions to me,  and what I hope will be important questions for a lot of Americans.  That is what I wanted to come to the floor and speak about in  conjunction with this nomination, and that is the issue of human  rights.   To me, human rights is critical both to our national identity, but it  is also important to our national Security. In America today, we have,  as we have done now for the past few centuries, contentious debates all  the time about policies and about what kind of country we want to be.  If you have watched the proceedings on the Senate floor or in committee  over the last few days, you have seen a lot of that.   Even as we debate these things among ourselves, and even as the  American political rhetoric has become so incredibly heated--and we  will have more to say about that in the weeks to come--I don't know of  any other time where we have gotten to the point that when we disagree  with people, we don't just disagree with them, we question their  motives and their character.   In fact, it is almost automatic today in American political  discourse. You don't just disagree with someone; you immediately jump  to why they are a bad person. In the months and weeks to come, I will  have examples about why that is a bad idea. But as we are having those  contentious debates, I hope that we never take for granted, sometimes  as I think we do, that we live in a place where losing an election,  losing a vote, losing on an issue, does not mean you end up in jail or  disappear or are executed because that is the kind of stuff that  happens in other places all over the world, even now, in the 17th year  of the 21st century.   As we have seen in recent weeks, this political dissent is part of  our way of life. It has come to define our country. We protect it in  our Constitution. It has made us an example to the rest of the world. I  was reminded of this just a couple of months ago, right here in  Washington, DC. After our most recent election, I had to a chance to  visit with my opponent, Congressman Patrick Murphy of Florida.   When I was finished with that meeting, I walked into another meeting.  That other meeting was with a Cuban dissident. He is an opponent of the  Castro regime, an individual who risks his life in the pursuit of  freedom, an individual who does not just get bad blog posts or a bad  article or a bad editorial or a nasty campaign ad run against him. No,  this is an individual who routinely gets thrown into jail, and he has  the scars to prove the beatings he has taken from the Cuban state  police over the last few years.   I was a little bit late to this meeting. I apologized to him. I  explained that I had just been in a meeting with my opposing candidate,  the man I had just ran against in the election. I could see the look on  his face. It kind of struck him. He immediately, I believe, appreciated  what that represented. He said--and I am paraphrasing: That is what we  want for our country too.   This is the essence of what has been America's example to the world,  the essence of how our principles and our values have inspired others  to seek their own God-given rights and how we have a moral duty to  support--in our words, in our foreign policy, and in our actions--those  aspirations of people all over the world.   In a way, dictators and tyrants have never had it worse than they do  today because we live in this high-tech information age. We often get  to see the images of repression within minutes of it happening, if not  in real time. We can monitor it; we can catalog the status of human  rights in every city, in every country, on every continent.   But as Americans, we are called to do much more than observe and  record these atrocities for history. With this knowledge, it is our  duty to act and to do what we can to support the people demanding their  rights. We must hold those who are violating their rights accountable.  I believe this is more important than ever because of the totalitarian  resurgence underway in many parts of the world as democracy in every  continent is under attack.  [[Page S535]]    Even as I stand here now before you, there are political prisoners on  this planet. They languish in Chinese prisons. Political dissidents and  journalists are being silenced and targeted for murder in Russia. Those  who seek democracy in Syria are being massacred. The United States has  a unique responsibility to highlight, to expose, and to combat these  grave human rights abuses around the world.   Historically, we have been a compassionate country that has welcomed  people seeking refuge from repression and atrocities. That is why I  understand. I understand the concerns about refugees from certain  failed states or governments who sponsor terror, places where very  often it is difficult if not impossible to verify the identities of  people seeking to come to the United States.   I say this to people all the time. When you talk about changes in  policies, there is a legitimate argument and a credible argument to be  made that there are people we cannot allow into the United States, not  because we don't have compassion for their plight but because we have  no way of knowing who they are. You can't just call 1-800-Syria and get  background information about the individuals who are trying to enter  the United States. We know for a fact that there are terrorist groups  around the world that have commandeered passport-making machinery and  are producing passports that are real in every way, except for the  identity of the person in the picture.   So I do believe that we need to have very careful and rigorous  screening, more than ever before, of all people entering the United  States but especially those who are coming from areas that we know do  not have reliable background information available to us.   But at the same time, I cannot help, and I think we should not help,  but to be worried about the impact of a 120-day moratorium on every  single refugee from anywhere on the planet, refugees from places like  the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ukraine, Colombia, El Salvador,  Vietnam, Burma, and, of course, Cuba, just to name a few places. These  are among the most vulnerable people on the planet, living often in the  most difficult and dangerous circumstances imaginable.   I remind everyone: This is a moratorium; it is not a permanent  policy. I understand that there are provisions available for waivers,  and I find that to be promising.   But I also want to everyone to understand that 120 days, for someone  who is trying to get out of a place where they might be killed, may be  1 day too many for some of them. I hope that that does not turn out to  be the case. That is why I urge the administration, that is why I urge  soon-to-be Secretary Tillerson, to exercise great caution in making  sure that dissidents and others are not being turned away.   By the way, I am pleased to see that the administration is heeding  some of these calls already, early this week. We must understand that  when tyrants and dictators oppress their people, we are all paying a  price. It is happening all over the world. Vladimir Putin continues to  institute Draconian laws targeting the freedom of expression and  assembly.   Earlier this year, my office and I highlighted the case of human  rights activist Ildar Dadin, who was the first person imprisoned under  Russia's new criminal provision that bars any form of public dissent.   In China, rights lawyers are tortured. Labor activists are arrested.  Tibetan Buddhist nuns are expelled from their homes, and churches are  being demolished. Just earlier today, I met the wives of two Chinese  rights advocates, who both pleaded for the United States to champion  their husbands' cases in the hope that they can see their husbands  again.   In Iran, dissent, freedom of expression, and freedom of press is  nonexistent, heavily restricted. Many continue to be jailed for simply  exercising their fundamental human rights. The Government of Iran  targets religious minorities, often jailing Christian pastors and those  who gather to worship together in private homes. In Syria, one of the  worst humanitarian catastrophes in modern history, the Assad regime,  with the assistance of Vladimir Putin and the Iranian Government and  military, is committing war crimes against innocent women, children,  men, and civilians in Aleppo and beyond.   In Iraq, we have seen ancient Christian and Yezidi communities on the  verge of extinction, all because of ISIS.   In Venezuela, the Maduro regime continues to imprison political  opponents while the country descends further and further into economic  chaos and has now become on the verge of a total humanitarian  catastrophe in the Western Hemisphere. In one of the richest countries  on the planet, we are at the point of people literally starving to  death.   Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United States on many key geopolitical  issues, and we will have to continue working with them on those shared  causes. But they also remain one of the most censored countries in the  world. The government has intensified its repression of activists and  journalists. In Saudi Arabia, women remain under the male guardianship  system. They are banned from even driving.   Globally, assaults against press freedom around the world are a major  problem because, ultimately, the cause and champions of human rights  need information to expose abuses and call for reforms. Without  independent journalists, without information, tyrants and dictatorships  can get away with so much more.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2016, 48  journalists were killed and 259 journalists were jailed worldwide. In  2016, Turkey, a NATO member, again, an important geopolitical alliance  of the United States, but, sadly, they became the leading jailer of  journalists on the planet, following a widespread crackdown on the  press.   The abuses and threats to human rights around the world are many. We  could be here all night trying to break Senator Strom Thurmond's  filibuster record, going country by country, case by case, and it still  would not be enough time to do justice to all of the heroic figures  around the world. But it is my hope that more of my colleagues will  join me in doing so over time because it is important. Our voices here  in the Senate give people all over the world confidence and motivation  to stay the course.   As famed Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky has said of himself and  fellow prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union: ``We never could  survive even one day in the Soviet Union if our struggle was not the  struggle of the free world.''   In essence, what he is saying is that these tyrants and these  dictators, when they jail these people, the first thing they tell them  is that no one even remembers you anymore. No one talks about you  anymore. You have been abandoned.   Today, I want to highlight one particular human rights case as part  of the weekly social media campaign my office has been doing for the  last couple of years called Expression NOT Oppression.   Here you see a picture of a gentleman named Dr. Eduardo Cardet of  Cuba. He is a medical doctor and the national coordinator of the  Christian Liberation Movement, a group which advocates for democracy  and freedom.   Cardet assumed the role of national coordinator after the suspicious  death of Castro critic Oswaldo Paya Sardinas. After allegedly stating  in an interview that Fidel Castro was hated by the Cuban people--that  is what he said--he was savagely beaten in front of his two young  children and wife by Cuban state security on November 30 of last year.  He has been in jail ever since.   He has been charged--get this. He has been charged with challenging  authority. He faces a 3- to 5-year prison sentence. Let me repeat that.  He is officially charged with challenging authority. That is a crime in  Cuba. His father has written to Pope Francis begging for his  intervention. By the way, this is a reminder that even though Fidel  Castro is dead, his authoritarian system still lives on.   Dr. Cardet's persecution and the overall increase in repression in  Cuba over the past 2 years is a reminder that the policy of rewarding  the Castro regime, under the guise of engagement, with cash and  concessions has not worked and must be strategically reversed here in  the coming months.   So I come here today in the hope that our President and our State  Department and especially Mr. Tillerson,  [[Page S536]]  in whom I am entrusting my vote for confirmation, and all Members of  Congress, for that matter, will add their voices in solidarity with Dr.  Cardet, with all the Cuban people yearning to be free, and with those  around the world who look to our Nation--to America--for leadership and  often for nothing more than for us to lend our voice to their cause.   As we move forward here with our Nation's work, we must continue to  highlight these cases and to raise awareness of them. We must never  forget that there are people all over the world who are challenging  authority because they want a better life for themselves and their  families. They should be able to challenge authority peacefully and  then go home to their families, not be thrown in jail, tortured, or  killed.   Today I ask all to pray for those who are victims of their own  government. I pray for the release of prisoners of conscience and their  families, and I pray that our own country at this moment of  extraordinary division on so many key issues can reaffirm its founding  principles in calling for the sacred right of every man, woman, and  child to be free.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time  during recess or adjournment of the Senate count post-cloture on the  Tillerson nomination; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the remaining post-cloture time be equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    The Senate is about to adjourn.   Under the standing order, we will convene at 12 noon tomorrow.  Following the prayer and pledge, we will resume consideration of the  Tillerson nomination post-cloture.   For the information of all Senators, the post-cloture time on the  Tillerson nomination will expire at approximately 2:30 p.m. Eastern  Time tomorrow, and the Senate will vote on confirmation at that time.                            ____________________     I move to adjourn.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________
