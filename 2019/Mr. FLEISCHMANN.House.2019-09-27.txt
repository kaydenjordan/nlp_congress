 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the positive  impact international automakers' investments have made in the United  States and, specifically, in my home State of Tennessee.   Today, international automakers operate 30 manufacturing facilities  across 12 States and build more than 60 different vehicle models in  America. Volkswagen is a huge part of that presence in the Third  District of Tennessee.   Tennessee is also home to the Infiniti Decherd Powertrain Plant; the  Nissan Decherd Powertrain Plant; the Nissan Smyrna Vehicle Assembly  Plant; the Nissan Smyrna Battery Plant; Toyota-Bodine Aluminum, Inc.;  and the headquarters of both INFINITI Americas and Nissan North  America.   In January, Volkswagen announced an additional investment of $800  million for its Chattanooga facility to build two electric vehicles,  with the groundbreaking taking place in November.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  important role of international automakers in the United States.                            ____________________
