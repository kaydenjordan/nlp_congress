 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Holocaust Days of  Remembrance to recognize a constituent from my district and a Holocaust  survivor, Mr. Fred Hilsenrath, of Fairfield Bay, Arkansas.   I was introduced to Fred by the outstanding mayor of Fairfield Bay,  Paul Wellenberger. My staff and I had the opportunity to host Fred and  his wife, Eleanor, for dinner and listen to their incredible story.   Fred was only 4 years old when Adolph Hitler took over as chancellor  of Germany and the Nazi regime initiated his systematic extermination  of the Jewish people of Central Europe. In 1940, after Poland had been  raided, the Hilsenrath family found themselves stuck between Nazi  Germany and Russia. Soon they were assembled in the town square, along  with other Jewish families, to be shipped to concentration camps in  Romania. After spending years in the camps throughout Romania, facing  death and witnessing some of the most heinous and grotesque atrocities  the world has seen, the Hilsenrath family was finally rescued by a  Jewish Russian soldier.                                time  1030    Fred and his family then walked from Romania to France to reunite  with their long-separated father. While in France, Mr. Hilsenrath  finished high school.   In April of 1949, Fred moved to the United States. He had $40 to his  name and knew no English. He studied electrical engineering at the City  College of New York and obtained long careers with well-known companies  such as Lockheed Martin, IBM, and Ampex.   After meeting his wife, Fred moved from San Francisco to Fairfield  Bay, Arkansas. Here he retired to enjoy the slower pace of life in the  Ozarks in The Natural State.   As a man currently in his late eighties, Mr. Hilsenrath has turned  his horribly painful childhood memories of the trials he faced and that  so many other Jews faced and experienced during the Holocaust into an  educational moment.   In a letter he wrote to me, Fred mentioned a lesson that he wants to  give to our Arkansas students. He says:         Not only can we use education as a way to rationally think       of our Nation's involvement in the future of our country as       well as the world, but also to recognize the seed in their       own heart; each of the students has a dream, they must find       it now, not later, so that they can focus their lives on       their future.    Mr. Hilsenrath understands the deep need for education and how it  plays a part in our moments of history.   It is an honor for me and my staff not only to have met such an  inspirational person, but to also represent him in the people's House.    Congratulating DuShun Scarbrough on Martin Luther King Remembrance Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend DuShun  Scarbrough, director of the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr.  Commission, for being awarded the Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major  Innovation Service Award.   The MLK, Jr. Drum Major Innovation Service award, given to only 20  individuals nationwide, is awarded to volunteers who perform  extraordinary everyday acts of service.   DuShun's leadership at the commission has proved to be invaluable  toward its mission to promote understanding and acceptance of  nonviolence, human equality, and community building among all  Arkansans.   Last week, my office was honored to welcome members of the  commission, including Arkansas treasure and civil rights icon, Annie  Abrams, along with former Wrightsville, Arkansas, Mayor Pat Ward while  we commemorated and  [[Page H3155]]  mourned the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's assassination. However, we  continue to honor Dr. King's vision for our great Nation.   DuShun and the commission continue to remind us of how far we have  come and how we need to continue to uphold the legacy of the civil  rights movement and embrace Dr. King's teaching of compassion,  nonviolence, and democracy.   I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr. Scarbrough and the  Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission for representing Arkansas  on the national stage and for his receiving this important recognition.   He, along with Reverend Jesse Turner, a site coordinator for the  National Alliance of Faith and Justice in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, who  also received this award, have represented our State with honor and  dignity.   I encourage our citizens in Arkansas and across the country to  remember the inspiring words of Dr. King and spend time in service to  their neighbors and all of our communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and I thank the chairman  of the Judiciary Committee for bringing this measure to the floor  today.   I stand in support of H.J. Res. 2, a straightforward, long overdue  effort to have a new tool to balance the budget, something my  constituents in Arkansas have long talked about.   When Arkansans sent me to Washington, they demanded leadership and  accountability and for me to be part of the solution to Washington's  top-down one-size-fits-all approach to spending. With just over $8  trillion, Mr. Speaker, added in debt over the past 8 years, my  constituents continue to argue that same point they did when I was  elected 3 years ago, that the government is too big, it tries to do too  much, and there has been no serious effort, bipartisan or otherwise, to  rein that spending in.   Today's vote is something that--like my friend from Maine--is a  measure I cosponsored upon arriving at the House. It is a significant  step to getting our fiscal House in order and delivering the kind of  accountability and transparency that my constituents demand of their  Federal Government.   Why? Why now? Why today? And I approach this, Mr. Speaker, without  the cynicism of the other side or the condemnation of this effort,  because when our debt was only $5 trillion in 1995, the Senate and the  House had a balanced budget amendment before them, and it failed to  pass by a single vote in the Senate. So it was a bipartisan effort to  get spending under control using a balanced budget amendment, and that  maybe led, Mr. Speaker, to the constructive comments that some have  argued today about reining in spending on a bipartisan basis, as was  the case in the 1990s, combined with economic growth.   Now, with our tax cuts, we have economic growth--economic growth we  haven't seen since 2005, according to the CBO, but the national debt is  now, because of that $8 trillion increase, at $21 trillion, 76 percent  of GDP.   I am convinced this amendment is now the tool necessary, because we  have tried budget caps, sequester, rescissions, Gramm-Rudman caps, and  we are now left with a tactic, a strategy  [[Page H3181]]  that all of our States, all but one of our States used, which is some  form of a balanced budget amendment, which is why I come here, Mr.  Speaker, to support this effort.   It starts that conversation that was as constructive as I hope in the  1990s, that we have a national discussion about spending priorities in  this government and how we can return our budget to long-term fiscal  health, how we can prioritize the only 30 percent of the budget that we  debate on this House floor, discretionary spending, and have long-term  strategies for two-thirds of our spending, our mandatory spending.   We want a bright future for our children and grandchildren, and I  urge a ``yes'' vote.
