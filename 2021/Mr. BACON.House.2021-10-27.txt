 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues from Indiana and  Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5661, the Continued  State Flexibility To Assist Older Foster Youth Act.   We can all agree that our children and youth have suffered  tremendously during this pandemic. Foster youth  [[Page H5939]]  that aged out of the system are hurting and feel forgotten. We can come  together to support these youth through continuing States' flexibility  with the Chafee funds to assist older foster youth.   The act will allow the emergency Chafee funds flexibilities that we  implemented during the pandemic to continue through fiscal year 2022.  It will give youth the option to reenter foster care that aged out  during the pandemic, remove the living expenses cap, and expand the  educational training funds to assist them.   We hear more and more from youth that need our help. As a foster-to- adopt parent, I know that our foster youth need our help, and we need  to make sure that we hold to our responsibility to fully support them  during this crisis. Young adults who have aged out of foster care are  the number one risk for homelessness in that age group.   Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity here to make a difference.
