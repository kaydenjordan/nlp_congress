 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 2630, to extend the temporary emergency scheduling of  fentanyl analogues.   In the rural Pennsylvania communities that I represent, the fentanyl  crisis is anything but temporary. Every day, we experience the  ramifications of the opioid epidemic, which has only been exacerbated  by the COVID-19 pandemic.   As the Franklin County coroner, Jeff Connor, told me just this week,  ``Fentanyl is easy to get and fast to kill.''   This is true across our entire Commonwealth. In my home of Blair  County, we suffered an 80 percent increase in overdose deaths in 2020.  As I have heard directly from our county coroner, Patty Ross, there is  no question that the widespread availability of illicit fentanyl is a  substantial factor in our region's drug epidemic.   Fentanyl already poses a deadly threat to our communities. If we  don't act to extend the fentanyl import ban before it expires next  month, we will invite massive vulnerabilities in our shared fight  against the opioid crisis. In Pennsylvania and around the country, we  need more accountability for those who bring illicit fentanyl into our  communities.   H.R. 2630 is lifesaving legislation that will give law enforcement  and the justice system the tools that they need to keep this dangerous  illicit drug off of our streets. This temporary fix needs to be the  bridge to a permanent solution to protect the American people. We do  not have time to waste. By passing this bipartisan legislation, we can  protect families, equip those on the front line, and prevent tragedy.   For the health and safety of our communities, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
