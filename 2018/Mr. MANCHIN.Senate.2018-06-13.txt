 Mr. President, I have always said our Nation's current  healthcare system is in need of repair. That is why we keep coming back  to try to fix it and make it better. Every West Virginian deserves  access to quality, affordable healthcare, and I am very concerned our  country is at risk of moving backward instead of forward.   When people ask why I voted against repealing the healthcare law, I  always say it is because we need to make sure those with preexisting  conditions don't go bankrupt paying for basic healthcare. Most people  today, if they don't have insurance, and especially those who have had  preexisting insurance, are one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.  What is happening today is an unfortunate political move. The only  reason this lawsuit is moving forward is because my friends on the  other side have failed more than 50 times trying to repeal it. On top  of that, the tax cut bill that just went through had this in it,  repealing basically the mandate on healthcare, which throws it into  turmoil and is why we are in a lawsuit right now.   Right now, 20 State attorneys general, including the attorney general  of West Virginia, are suing to allow insurance companies to once again  deny coverage to West Virginians with preexisting conditions. Every  single time they voted for repeal, this is exactly what they were  trying to achieve.   What makes this worse is we have a bipartisan compromise, led by  Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, with 12 Republicans and 12  Democrats. This bill includes important steps that will  [[Page S3892]]  help reduce healthcare costs for West Virginia families, and this  agreement shows what is possible when we put people before politics.  What we did is, after the last repeal on the floor failed, we got  together and put a fix in. We have a reinsurance program. We have a way  to maintain and try to educate people on how they would use their  healthcare, their newfound wealth in healthcare, in a more effective  and efficient way.   This is what we should be doing, but, no, there is a political  promise to repeal so we keep fighting every angle there is that is  being thrown at us. Now there is this last one going through the court  system--and having also the judicial system being involved to stop this  horrible scourge on the people of my State and all across the country.   Let me tell you how many West Virginians are impacted. In a State  with a little over 1,800,000, this one move right here affects 800,000  West Virginians. We are talking with people who have all types of  things that could exist. They could have a child with a heart defect,  asthma, you name it. They are going to be able to say: I am sorry,  preexisting. We are not going to insure you or the cost will be so high  you can't afford it.   We are impacting too many West Virginians. On Monday, I asked them to  share their stories with me and my office--people, real people with  whom you can put a face, a name, a story, and also have some empathy  for. I am going to read a few letters, if I may. I have one from Kim  Kramer from Parkersburg. She said:         Dear Senator Manchin,        Again, I find myself writing to plea for a sane policy       related to healthcare for my family, my friends, my       community, my country and myself. When healthcare policy is       centered around quick profits at the cost of the long term       health of citizens, a medical tsunami is sure to follow.        I live with my adult son who was born with Down Syndrome.       He is 33 and I am 60. He is healthy for now but does have a       couple of pre-existing conditions and risk factors which       could very possibly need attention as he grows older. The       mere thought that I would have to pay out of pocket for his       healthcare due to policy changes in the years to come is mind       boggling. Perhaps today his care is not directly on the       table, but it has been this past year and will most likely be       again.        I am at pre-retirement age. I work full time and am in good       health. But I take medication to maintain a healthy blood       pressure. That is already a pre-existing condition. Medicare       is still down the road for me. As a nurse, I know the       importance of screening for certain conditions.        But removing coverage of pre-existing conditions puts me in       a very real catch 22 situation.        If I go for recommended health screenings and a condition       is found, I would be covered by my current insurance. If my       employment situation should change, as is possible for any of       us, then I would have a pre-existing condition that would       either not be covered or would make my premium so high that I       would have to wonder if I will be able to provide for other       basic needs like appropriate housing.        Many in my family, my circle of friends, my community and       state would be in this terrible predicament.        Any diagnosis would be a barrier to treatment in essence.       No insurance company apparently wants to cover sick people!       Makes me wonder why we would call it insurance at all!        Perhaps in Washington, too many of you have lost touch with       the very real stress and anxiety that is created when       healthcare accessibility is unobtainable.        Do any of you understand what is it is like to live       wondering when the medical tsunami will come? Because not       having healthcare coverage is like that. You hope that the       wave won't strike but it's just beyond the horizon and you       have no idea if or when it is coming, or how to survive it.        The current mandate for coverage of pre-existing conditions       assures better health and prevention treatments; better       outcomes and decreased expenses. It gives us all some peace       of mind if we become ill and allows us to focus on getting       healthy.        Please care about our people.        Please keep mandated coverage of pre-existing conditions.        Thank you.    I have Katelyn from Elkview.         Dear Senator Manchin,        I am a 22 year old West Virginian who grew up in northern       Kanawha County near Clendenin. I was diagnosed with anorexia       when I was 13, and have struggled with it for years. I am       thankful that the ACA created provisions that will allow me       to remain on my parents' health insurance until I am 26, but       worry that my pre-existing condition could prevent me from       getting insured in the future.        Losing health insurance would mean me losing access to my       mental health medication as well as making it really       difficult to access further treatment should I have a       relapse.        I also worry about how lack of coverage for my preexisting       condition could prevent me from affording care in the future.       I hope to devote my life to public service, which is very       fulfilling but does not pay well enough for me to afford to       pay high medical bills. This is something that particularly       worries me as I get older and am thinking about whether I       will be able to afford to start a family.        I hope that you will continue to defend the Affordable Care       Act, particularly its provisions that protect people with       preexisting conditions and women's health generally.    Larry from Lewisburg writes:         Shortly after being diagnosed with cancer in my mid-      forties, the health insurance company I paid for coverage       went bankrupt. Faced with a preexisting condition, I was       uninsured until I began receiving Medicare, about 20 years       later, even though I had been therapeutically treated and had       no symptoms or return of tumors for most of that time.        An adult stepdaughter has MS, epilepsy, and multiple other       health challenges. She works full time, and the end of       preexisting condition insurance protection would be life-      threatening.    My final letter is from Marie-Claire from Bruceton Mills, who writes:         Dear Senator Manchin, my daughter was diagnosed with lupus       shortly after ObamaCare became reality. I was able to secure       affordable health insurance for her from that day forward       [because of the Affordable Care Act].        Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can--and eventually       will--affect any part of the body at any time.        An insurance company faced with underwriting my daughter       simply will not insure her--ever--unless mandated by our       government to cover preexisting conditions. Simple as that.        She has had multiple late night trips to the emergency room       that would have bankrupted her had she not been covered.        Please do not forget her when you tell stories on the       Senate floor.    This is not about Democrats or Republicans; this is about all of us.  We all face this in our States, that of moving down this pathway  because of not enforcing this part of the Affordable Care Act, when we  have a fix--truly, a Democratic-Republican fix, bipartisan--led by  Lamar Alexander, our Senator from Tennessee, and Patty Murray, our  Senator from the State of Washington.   This is a shame. This is a tough place, especially when you have  solutions to fix the problems that challenge all of us. That is all we  are asking for. Please be considerate of these people. Please do not  throw caution to the wind or throw the baby out with the bath water and  800,000 West Virginians who would lose their insurance.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Tracy Warren Hylton, a proud West Virginian, World War II  Veteran, a legendary businessman, a fierce advocate for our proud coal  heritage, and one of the dearest friends I have ever known.   I have known Tracy my whole adult life. Tracy was doing business with  my father-in-law, Carl Conelly, when I met him in 1966. Ever since  then, I have always considered Tracy to be a very dear friend. He had a  different sense humor that kept us all laughing, which will be sorely  missed. Throughout his long life, he did a great deal for Raleigh  County and Beckley, was a good legislator, and was always extremely  kind.   Our little State has mined the coal that forged the steel that built  the tanks and ships that keep our country the strongest in the world.  Coal miners themselves are some the bravest and most patriotic men and  women I have ever met, and it is an honor to fight for our coal  heritage and our way of life that sinks deep into the roots of West  Virginia's rich culture. I am so deeply proud of what our citizens have  accomplished and what they will continue to accomplish. So it is with a  heavy, but grateful heart that I join my fellow West Virginians in  honoring Tracy, a ``king'' of coal in southern West Virginia.   There is no better position to find yourself in than being able to  give back to the community you love. I can attest that my small  hometown of Farmington helped make me who I am, and it brings so much  joy to my life to be able to give back to the place that shaped me.  Tracy and I shared that mentality.   Born on the Fourth of July in Crab Orchard and having grown up in the  coalfields, Tracy was a true patriot and was passionate about our State  and its heritage. His father, Arthur, was a coal miner and a carpenter,  and his mother, Grace, ran a boarding house at Stotesbury. They were  hard-working people, and they passed their knowledge and work ethic to  each of their six children.   Tracy attended Mark Twain High School with our dear Senator Robert C.  Byrd before attending Concord College and West Virginia University. He  enlisted in the Army in 1943 and served in the Pacific Theatre in the  267th Anti-Aircraft Ordnance Company during World War II. When he came  home,  [[Page S3904]]  he met the love of his life, Betty Jo Foster. They had three sons:  Tracy ``Warren'' Hylton II, Robert ``Bobby'' Hylton, and Harry ``Mac''  Hylton.   It was a troubling time for the coal market and for business in  general during that time. He started a few different businesses, and  though he had some failures, he never gave up hope. At one point, he  was running a conveyor mining business out of the front seat of his  pickup truck. He did what he had to do to succeed, and eventually, he  founded Perry and Hylton, Inc., which expanded to become one of the  largest mine companies in West Virginia.   Tracy was well known as a pioneer of modern surface mining  techniques. His reclamation sites had a profound impact on the local  communities, as they became home to high schools, housing developments,  farms, and greenhouses.   He was an extraordinary leader. No detail could be slipped passed  him, and he wasn't one to mince words. He was a man of his word, and as  an employer, he was beloved. This carried over into his role as a State  senator for the ninth district for Raleigh and Wyoming Counties from  1964 to 1972 and when he was reelected to serve an additional term from  1987 to 1990.   Tracy and my uncle, A. James Manchin, would have the most interesting  and entertaining debates. When they weren't debating though, they were  good friends. That relationship taught me a lot about working with  someone with an opposing viewpoint.   He was truly one of the most humble, generous, and hard-working  people I know. His generous spirit and compassion extended throughout  the State, touching the lives of countless West Virginians with his  anonymous donations to various charities.   What is most important is that Tracy lived a full life, surrounded by  his wife, Betty; his sons Warren, Bobby, and Mac; and his beloved  grandchildren Traci Jo Hylton, Kirsten S. Hylton, Morgan Tate Hylton,  and Lance M. Hylton.   He was a true West Virginian, always willing to help a neighbor in  need. I am honored to recognize his memory, as well as the unwavering  love he had for his family, friends, our home State, and our great  Nation.                            ____________________
