 Madam Speaker, the time for bold and decisive action is  now. This American Rescue Plan Act will crush the virus, return  children safely to school, support vaccinations, put dollars in  families' pockets, and put people back to work. The plan will mount a  national vaccination program that sets up community vaccination sites  nationwide.   In the Virgin Islands, the loss of cruise ships, along with air  travel tourists, have cut the heart of our economy, causing loss of  jobs, closure of businesses, and lost revenues for government  operations.   Additionally, we have yet to understand the long-term impact the  pandemic will have on our children. In the Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico, our children are already overwhelmed and severely compromised due  to facilities and the school year loss that they had from the 2017  hurricanes.   Lastly, I am proud to note provisions in this bill for the U.S.  territories that I have been fighting for. This plan creates equality  in the child tax credit and earned income tax credit.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this bill.    And for my colleagues on the other side who have to  give divisive platitudes and nonsupport, you are welcome.
