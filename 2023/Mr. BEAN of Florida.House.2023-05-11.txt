 Mr. Speaker, you know every birthday with a zero  in it is special, but what about a birthday with double zeros? That  makes it double special.   Such is the case for the 100th anniversary of the Theodore H.  Hernandez American Legion Auxiliary Unit 54 in my hometown of  Fernandina Beach, Florida. This auxiliary holds a special place in my  heart, as my mother was a member for many, many years.   The auxiliary has supported and continues to support community  organizations on the first coast such as the Nassau County Council on  Aging, and Adopt-a-Soldier, and so many others.   On May 29, 2023, members will celebrate 100 years of serving our  veterans, military, and their families in northeast Florida.   Hopefully, Mr. Speaker, they will celebrate with a very big cake.   I congratulate the Theodore H. Hernandez American Legion Auxiliary  Unit Number 54 on 100 years of amazing service, and I can't wait to see  what they do with the next 100.                            ____________________
