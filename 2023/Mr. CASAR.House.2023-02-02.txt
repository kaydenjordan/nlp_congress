 Mr. Speaker, I am  Greg Casar, and I represent the heart  of Texas.   Today, thousands of my constituents are freezing without electricity.  As Texans try to survive the cold weather and the climate crisis is  being ignored in our State, they are also worried about paying for  housing. They are worried because they have had their workers' rights  stripped away, reproductive rights stripped away, and voting rights  stripped away. They are worried that their kid could be shot in school.   These are the concerns of the people. But Republican leadership here  is working on none of these issues. Instead, they are trying to  redistribute wealth from working-class families to their biggest  corporate donors.   But even though Texans may be without electricity today, we are far  from powerless. We have a history of organizing for change in Texas.   The same electricians who are getting the lights back on, the same  medics caring for our sick, are sick and tired of right-wing extremism.  These working families will be the ones to organize and create a true  democracy  [[Page H634]]  where the people lead and the politicians follow.   Mark these words as my first here in this Chamber.                            ____________________
