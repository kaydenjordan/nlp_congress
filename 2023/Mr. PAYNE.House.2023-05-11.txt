 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Secure the Border  Act.   A few years ago, Americans were horrified to see pictures and videos  of immigrant children in cages. But the MAGA Republicans thought this  policy was a great idea.   Thankfully, the Biden administration ended this cruel and inhumane  practice, but these same MAGA Republicans want to bring it back. They  want to punish children because their parents want to become U.S.  citizens.   This bill would remove all the protections for immigrant children at  the border, and it allows them to be detained in cages in Federal  facilities indefinitely.   The Statue of Liberty, the symbol of America, tells the world that  our country is open to all people. It invites them to come here and  fulfill their dreams.   However, this anti-American bill represents the opposite, and it is  an embarrassment and shameful that it was introduced at all.                            ____________________
