 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for leading this  floor debate today.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R.  1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017.   Regardless of the chatter that I believe simply confuses what we want  to do in good government, this bill, H.R. 1004, is a good government  transparency bill that is simple in nature and seeks to preserve the  integrity of the regulatory process; specifically, the public comment  period.   Whether it is EPA or the Department of Labor or any other agencies or  departments, they have their purpose, but they have to follow the law.  The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our  democratic values because it ensures that Americans will have their  voices heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.   Agencies must take the comment period seriously. Unfortunately, we  have seen instances where agencies seem to believe that the regulatory  process is simply a perfunctory act that the agency must undertake in  order to reach a prearranged outcome.   This became abundantly clear during the EPA's Waters of the U.S., or  WOTUS, rulemaking process. During that process, Mr. Chairman, the EPA  undertook a campaign to solicit support and artificially inflate the  positive reaction to the WOTUS rule. The EPA used the skewed results as  evidence of public support.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters coming from the  National Association of Home Builders and the Michigan Farm Bureau to  attest to this problem.                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                  Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.      Hon. Timothy Walberg,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walberg: On behalf of the 140,000       members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),       I am writing to express NAHB's strong support for H.R. 1004,       the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017. This legislation would       force agencies to follow an open and transparent federal       regulatory rulemaking process by making all aspects of a       rulemaking publicly available and preventing federal agencies       from illegally influencing the public in order to generate       support for a rulemaking.        Federal agencies are prohibited, by law, from engaging in       lobbying, grassroots, and propaganda activities designed to       advance a policy agenda. However, in recent rulemakings, the       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ignored these       restrictions and used social media platforms to perpetuate       propaganda campaigns that advance their rulemakings. These       actions only support the notion that the agency is not       interested in a transparent and fair rulemaking process.        An excellent example of this is when the EPA created a       social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to       counter opposition to its ``Waters of the US'' rulemaking.       The agency concealed the fact that its social media messages       were coming from within the EPA and deceptively engaged in       lobbying efforts designed to kill legislation that was not       favorable to their proposed rulemaking. In December 2015, the       Government Accountability Office released a report outlining       how the EPA participated in covert propaganda and grassroots       lobbying and condemned the agency for violating federal law.       Federal agencies must respect and uphold the law, and the       passage of H.R. 1004 will help to ensure that federal       agencies are not lobbying against America's small businesses.        For these reasons, NAHB urges the House Oversight and       Government Reform Committee to support H.R. 1004, the       Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, in order to bring       transparency and neutrality to the regulatory process.        Thank you for giving consideration to our views.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III.                                   ____                                             Michigan Farm Bureau,                               Lansing, Michigan, February 13, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings:       Michigan Farm Bureau strongly supports the Regulatory       Integrity Act of 2017. The bill is a step in the right       direction to hold government agencies accountable and for       citizens to maintain trust in the government that serves       them. Introduced by Rep. Tim Walberg, the bill is scheduled       to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform       Committee later this week.        Last year, we heard about an EPA grant being used to fund       whatsupstream.com in the state of Washington. This initiative       used the following billboard message: ``Unregulated       agriculture is putting our waterways at risk'' to urge the       public to contact state elected officials. In a similar       campaign, GAO issued a legal opinion that EPA violated       federal lobbying laws by funding advocacy efforts on the       Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. Michigan farmers       are frustrated when they read about federal agencies trying       to sway the public in a way that promotes their own proposed       rule before all stakeholders have had a chance to weigh in       the rule's merits. These examples only undermine the trust       our members place in the agencies meant to serve and protect       our citizens.        We believe it is critical that Congress pass the Regulatory       Integrity Act of 2017. We urge all members of the Committee       to support this bill.            Sincerely,                                                         John Kran,                            Associate National Legislative Counsel.     The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office  concluded the EPA overstepped and issued a report saying the EPA  violated the law and undertook ``covert propaganda'' and grassroots  lobbying during the process.   My bill simply seeks to preserve the spirit and purpose of the  regulatory process by simply telling agencies that they need to keep to  the facts and not solicit support when they ought to be soliciting  constructive comments.   H.R. 1004 simply requires an agency to; one, identify itself as the  source of information; two, clearly state whether the agency is  accepting public comments or considering alternatives; and, three, and  most importantly, speak about the regulations in a neutral, unbiased  tone.   People need to have the confidence that the Federal agencies,  regardless of whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration,  are open to their insights an constructive criticism.   H.R. 1004 will restore the integrity to our regulatory process by  ensuring agencies are honestly asking for feedback, constructive  criticism, and dialogue about how to improve upon the agency's existing  thoughts, not advocating for a predetermined outcome.   Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan issue. This bill passed the House  last Congress with bipartisan support. In fact, a similar version was  offered by my colleague, Representative Peterson from Minnesota, as an  amendment to H.R. 5 earlier this year. That amendment was approved with  strong bipartisan support.   So, once again, I urge my colleagues to support the Regulatory  Integrity Act.
