 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 362.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, with Veterans Day approaching this  weekend, I would like to recognize and express my gratitude for the  patriotism, selfless service, and community spirit of a small community  in southern Montana. The town of Roberts, in Carbon County, is honoring  military veterans by lining Highway 212 with crosses and dogtags to  represent servicemembers who have lived in Roberts. The crosses signify  veterans who have passed away, while the dogtags symbolize living  veterans.   The breadth of service in this scenic town north of Yellowstone Park  is evident in the 133 dogtags on display this year. The depth of  service to our great county is rooted in the 308 crosses, some of which  date back to service in the Civil War. A total of 441 individuals, with  service spanning over a century and a half, is an impressive display of  patriotism for any small community. The record of service among the  people of Roberts is even more awe-inspiring when you consider that,  during the last census, the town had just 361 residents.   As we gather to celebrate Veterans Day, let us be encouraged by the  example of the folks in Roberts and take time to remember the  accumulated sacrifices and ongoing commitment that allow so many to  live in freedom. To the people of Roberts, thank you for punching above  your weight class for our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 220, S. 1088.
