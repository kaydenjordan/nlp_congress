SEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``May 18, 2032''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 3848, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3848, as amended,  offered by my friend and colleague, Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer, from the great  State of Oregon.   The HOME Act is a data-driven solution to build on efforts across  multiple Congresses to bring veterans out of homelessness and to get  them back on track.   Just last week, the VA announced that they housed more than 38,000  homeless veterans in 2023--and that is a great improvement--due to the  incredible private organizations that work with the VA to find veterans  homes.                                time  1615    However, our efforts must continue.   No veteran should be without a warm place to call home. Mrs. Chavez- DeRemer's bill would rightfully increase the grant and per diem rate  for homelessness providers around the country to keep rates in line  with inflation.   This bill would also authorize the VA to fund rides through ride- share partnerships to transport homeless veterans to their VA  healthcare appointments, search for and find permanent housing, a key  Democratic request to move this bill forward on the House floor.   Additionally, this bill funds communication devices, including  smartphones and tablets, so our veterans can pursue employment  opportunities, make appointments, and stay in contact with their  families, to help prevent the self-isolation that often precedes  veteran suicide.   It is critical to get these programs running again so veterans can  continue to be housed and get to their appointments, whether it is for  physical or mental health care. We need to get our veterans back on  track. This is a hand up not a handout.   We have seen firsthand the success of the Grant and Per Diem Program  in housing veterans. This VA grant program shows that public and  private partnerships between the government and private sector can  work.   I thank Speaker Emeritus McCarthy, for originally proposing the  increase in the GPD rate during the COVID-19 era. The original rate was  sufficient, but due to inflationary pressures that have been exerted by  Bidenomics, it is now unfortunately not. Bidenomics has caused a  tremendous amount of hardship for Americans, particularly homeless  veterans.   Representative Chavez-DeRemer's bill will combat the impact of the  Biden administration's rising inflation head-on by increasing  homelessness providers' grants to account for the out-of-control  inflation. The grant rate increase is especially important now with the  news that homelessness is up 11 percent nationwide.   Just 2 weeks ago, the VA's annual Suicide Prevention Report revealed  that the suicide rate for VHA users with indications of homelessness  increased by over 38 percent from 2020 to 2021. In 2021, the suicide  rate for homeless veterans using VHA was 186.5 percent higher than  veterans who are housed.   That is a staggering number and underscores how important it is to  continue our work to get veteran homelessness and suicide to functional  zero. We, as a country, must utilize innovative thinking and approaches  to confront these disturbing trends as we work to find an upstream  solution to prevent veterans from becoming homeless in the first place.  The HOME Act is a fiscally responsible way to start.   I appreciate all the homelessness stakeholders, such as the National  Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the National Alliance to End  Homelessness, and the New England Center and Home for Veterans who have  worked with the committee to ensure we brought a great bill to the  floor today. Without their input, the important changes we made at my  subcommittee would not have been possible.   I also thank my friends, the full committee ranking member, Mr.  Takano, and my ranking member, Mr. Levin, for working across the aisle  and getting to a ``yes'' back in July at our last full committee  markup.   Passing this bill with strong bipartisan support will show our Senate  colleagues that we have a united front on this issue. I look forward to  working with my Senate colleagues to continue to provide for homeless  veterans by including this bill in a larger bicameral, bipartisan  package.   Chairman Bost made a commitment to our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle that he would ensure we would get this fixed.   We, as members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, gave our word  that we would do everything in our power to help those who have  defended this Nation and given us the ability to live in freedom.  Today, we take great strides to keep it.   Once again, under Chairman Bost's leadership, Congress will come  together with a practical solution to do the right thing for the men  and women who have served.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3848, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer).   Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER. Mr. Speaker, on any given night, there are  around 1,400 Oregon veterans who go to sleep without a roof over their  heads. This is heartbreaking and unacceptable. We owe it to our  veterans to do better. They stepped up to serve our country, and it is  our responsibility to ensure they are cared for in return.   That is why I introduced the HOME Act, which would lift veterans out  of homelessness. To account for recent inflation, this legislation  increases financial assistance for nonprofit organizations that provide  transitional housing to veterans in need.   The financial assistance offered would be higher in areas with  elevated rates of suicide among veterans. It also creates a new stipend  for homeless veterans. This could be used to buy food, clothing, and  even cell phones to help them communicate with family members and  healthcare providers.   I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his  support and the chairman of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden) for his leadership on this  issue.  [[Page H6097]]    I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this much- needed legislation. Together, we can empower our Nation's heroes and  ensure they all have a place to call home.   I have been on this job for 10 months, and I do have hope that we  will continue to move forward for our veterans and do everything that  we can every day we are in this job to support them.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to remind my great friend  and colleague from the State of California, as the previous ranking  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee where the House of  Representatives, the Senate, and the White House were held by his  party, that this could have been passed in this period of time.   In that period of time under Democratic control, the per diem rate  was set at 125 percent by Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy and was  agreed to by the now ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.   As many Members of this body have been sitting for a decade or  multiple decades, I was serving in the United States Navy, freezing  outside in combat, and now a veteran. There is a difference between the  life experiences.   The time for talk and political sharpshooting each other is over. The  time to act is now. In fact, I do agree with my colleague that we  cannot allow another veteran to go homeless as winter is upon us here.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask Mr. Takano and the other Democrats on that  side of the aisle to join me, as I will join them, in working  collectively as Members of this body to ensure that everything that is  done here is for a higher purpose. The higher purpose is making sure  that those who have protected our lives, as we live in freedom, are  able to live in peace and prosperity. If they need a hand up, they get  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
