 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rules package.   The United States has long been recognized as a global leader in  aviation safety, and each day, thousands of men and women work  tirelessly to ensure smooth operations at our Nation's airports.  However, in recent months, we have witnessed a concerning increase in  fatalities of our ground crews, especially in rural airports like those  in my district.  [[Page H3655]]    First and foremost, it is crucial to understand and acknowledge that,  historically, the United States has been a leader in aviation safety.  For decades, we have set the standard for the rest of the world with  safety protocols that have undoubtedly saved countless lives.   Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the disturbing trend that has emerged  in recent months. Close calls in our airspace and tragedies in our  airports have become alarmingly frequent. These incidents remind us  that we cannot be complacent on issues that threaten the safety of my  constituents who work in rural airports and who spend their days  helping Americans get from point A to point B.   I am proud to be the first cosponsor to this amendment that was  introduced by the gentlewoman from the great State of Oregon (Ms.  Hoyle), my Democrat colleague, because it just makes sense. It requires  the FAA to develop and publish safety training materials for airport  ground crew workers, including supervisory employees.   This amendment will help incidents involving aircraft engine  ingestion and jet blast hazards decrease, and it is critical to keeping  the airport workers in Wisconsin's Third Congressional District safe.   The 2023 FAA reauthorization is bold and necessary, and it takes  steps toward protecting the men and women who make it possible for most  of us to travel to this Chamber so we can serve our constituents.
