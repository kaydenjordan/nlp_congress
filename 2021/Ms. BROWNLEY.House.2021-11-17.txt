 Madam Speaker, since day one, Democrats have diligently  worked with the Biden administration to bolster our economy and rebuild  our Nation's crumbling infrastructure.   Earlier this month Democrats delivered on their promise to the  American people by passing the bipartisan Infrastructure Investments  and Jobs Act. The need for this historic investment in our roads and  bridges and public transit and rail systems is clear in every State and  every community throughout our country.   Democrats not only delivered one of the largest Federal investments  in our Nation's infrastructure, but we are delivering access to  broadband and high-speed internet, and we are delivering clean and  reliable drinking water to America's families.   The bipartisanship infrastructure deal makes bold investments in our  future by creating good-paying American jobs, fighting back against the  climate crisis, and rebuilding our economy from the middle out.   We must continue to build on this success--ensuring our democracy  delivers for the people--by passing President Biden's transformative  Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
