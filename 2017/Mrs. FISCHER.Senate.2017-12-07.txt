 Mr. President, I rise today to thank Father Steven Boes  from Boys Town for delivering our opening prayer this morning. The work  he does to help at-risk youth across America is awe-inspiring, and I am  proud to say that he is a Nebraskan.   Boys Town is a special place, and it is located in the heart of our  country. In the late 1910s, while ministering to the homeless of Omaha,  Father Edward Joseph Flanagan became interested in young people and  their struggles to grow into responsible, productive adults. He wanted  to help them improve their lives, and he soon founded Boys Town on  December 12, 1917, as an orphanage for boys.   A few years later, Father Flanagan purchased Overlook Farm on the  outskirts of Omaha, which soon became known as the Village of Boys  Town. He knew that children would thrive if given love, a home, and a  purpose. His message that every child deserves a loving home and a  chance to create a positive future for themselves is one that resonates  across social boundaries.   Today, Boys Town is one of the largest nonprofits in the country,  serving underprivileged and at-risk children. Father Boes's leadership  at Boys Town is a tribute to Father Flanagan's mission to build better  communities by promoting stronger families. For nearly 100 years, Boys  Town has worked tirelessly to nurture troubled children and heal broken  families. Every year, the organization helps more than 2 million  children and families across the United States.   Boys Town also has a renowned school, which offers a year-round  traditional academic curriculum that focuses on helping students,  especially those who are behind in their school work. It helps children  in difficult circumstances find success in the classroom, as well as  get back on track toward graduation.   The school's motto echoes that of the organization as a whole: ``He  ain't heavy, Father, he's my brother.'' I believe that motto is a great  explanation of why we are celebrating Boys Town's 100th anniversary  next week. For a century, through terrible depressions, horrible world  wars, droughts, and snowstorms, Boys Town has served as a glimmer of  hope for many who are looking for help.   I don't think Father Flanagan would be surprised to learn that Boys  Town has grown to include 12 regional headquarters across our great  Nation or that his charity really has become a jewel of the nonprofits.  His outlook created a firm foundation for helping our communities, and  it is one that Father Boes continues to build on.   That deserves to be celebrated. I am happy that on July 6, 2015, the  Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act was signed into law. This  bill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to mint five-dollar gold  coins, one-dollar silver coins, and half-dollar coins in honor of Boys  Town's 100th anniversary. Adorned with designs and sayings that capture  the spirit and mission of  [[Page S7898]]  Boys Town, these coins can act as good reminders of those who once  helped us. I hope they also serve as encouragement to improve our  communities and think about those who are less fortunate.   I wish Father Boes continued success going forward. We in the Senate  are all rooting for him. Boys Town exemplifies the spirit of America,  and it is the prize of the State of Nebraska. I am honored to be its  Senator.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to talk about my support  for the Senate tax reform bill and to encourage Congress to help  American families.  [[Page S7912]]    Our economy and our workforce have changed over the last few decades,  and our Tax Code must catch up. If we want to build a better future for  our children, we must tackle problems for families juggling  responsibilities between their homes and their workplaces.   We have a chance to make history. The Senate-passed bill included my  Strong Families Act, which would be the first nationwide paid family  leave policy passed by this body. This proposal has the potential to  make life easier for working families across our country by providing a  tax credit as large as 25 percent for employers who offer up to 12  weeks of paid family leave. Employees would be able to take this time  without needing to choose between potentially falling behind on their  bills or spending time caring for their loved ones. Caring for families  today does not just mean taking care of children. My proposal helps to  ease burdens on family caregivers taking care of aging parents as well.    The Senate Special Committee on Aging recently released a report  focused on America's aging workforce and the opportunities and  challenges associated with it. One of its findings is that a growing  group of aging workers are also caregivers. In fact, one out of every  four employees over the age of 50 serves as a family caregiver.   Some employers are implementing strategies to support them, but I  believe that this credit will go a long way in encouraging additional  employers to take proactive steps to help these workers. This proposal  also gives businesses the flexibility to set up these plans in ways  that make sense for their companies and does so without mandates that  some simply cannot afford.   I also want to take this opportunity to briefly address some of the  criticisms of my proposal. It has been said that a provision in this  bill was designed to punish States and localities that have laws  mandating paid leave already in place. If employers in States and  localities that already require some paid leave go beyond what is  mandated at the local level, they will be able to take advantage of  this credit.   We designed this credit to be targeted toward lower and middle-income  workers who do not currently have access to paid family leave. We want  to expand that access.   Moreover, I was happy to see an addition that was included in the  Senate tax bill regarding State and local taxes. Most Nebraskans will  tell you that our property taxes are too high. I agree. I supported the  proposal to allow for a State and local property tax deduction of up to  $10,000 on Federal taxes.   As this bill moves toward a conference committee, I urge our  conferees to keep this proposal and my Strong Families Act in the final  bill. These provisions would help our families and they would help  America's middle class.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
