 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Gun Violence  Awareness Month and the 33,000 American lives lost each year to gun  violence.   These tragedies are preventable, Mr. Speaker, and it is truly  shameful that Congress has yet to take meaningful action to address  this epidemic. Even more appalling is the fact that 1,300 of these  deaths are children, young lives cut short by meaningless and avoidable  violence.   Last month I introduced the Child Gun Access Prevention Act, which  would prevent children from accessing guns by holding gun owners  responsible when they leave their firearms unlocked.   Millions of children live in homes with unsecured guns, Mr. Speaker,  and they are at an increased risk of unintentional shootings and youth  suicides. We have also seen the devastation caused when a child takes a  parent's gun to school with the intention of causing harm. A child  should never access a gun unsupervised.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation. We absolutely must do more to protect our children from  gun violence.                            ____________________
