 Madam Speaker, standing here today, 4 weeks after the  Supreme Court's disastrous decision to overturn Roe, I fear for the  future of my children.   I fear for a future where Republican leaders agree with Clarence  Thomas that the right for same-sex marriage should be revisited, that  the right to birth control should be reexamined. Let me be clear:  Neither of those rights should be up for debate.   We voted this week to protect marriage equality. We will vote today  to protect contraception. For those who believe this issue isn't on the  minds of millions of Americans, open your eyes. Republicans in Idaho  and Louisiana are pushing to ban forms of birth control. The Governor  of Mississippi refused to rule out a contraception ban. Even the  Republican Study Committee, which represents most House Republicans,  has proposed eliminating contraception access programs for low-income  Americans. That is not pro-life. It is antiwoman.   Wake up already and join us in passing this critical legislation.
