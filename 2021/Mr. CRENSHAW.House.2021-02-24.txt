 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  express my deep disappointment on the bloated, partisan bill that my  colleagues are calling a COVID relief package.   That is the name on the bill, but the reality is far from it. The  reality is that we just passed a $900 billion package in December. The  package wasn't perfect, but it was bipartisan. This one is not.   The reality is that hundreds of billions of dollars remain unspent.  As of last week, there were unofficial estimates of unspent or non- disbursed relief that included $183 billion for another round of PPP;  $199 billion for healthcare; $136 billion for expanded unemployment  insurance; and $46 billion for direct stimulus payments. That is money  we still have, unspent.   The reality is that this administration can't or won't even give  Congress an honest estimate of where that money is and what they will  do with trillions more.   The reality is that this bill is not for emergency relief, but for  leftwing spending programs years from now. Nearly half of the funds  under this bill won't be spent until 2022.  [[Page H597]]    There are billions of dollars for State and local governments, mostly  to blue States that impose costly lockdowns, even though California is  reporting a $10 billion surplus; billions to bail out multiemployer  pension plans; billions for subsidies to cover the cost of rising  ObamaCare premiums; and a massive expansion of Medicaid with no reforms  to address waste, fraud, and abuse within the program.   Meanwhile, a mere 1 percent of this is for vaccine distribution.  Really? Maybe that is, perhaps, because the Trump administration,  indeed, did have a plan for vaccine distribution. I don't know.   Of the billions they provide for schools, less than 5 percent will be  spent this fiscal year with zero requirements to get kids back in the  classroom.   The reality is that some provisions, like a $15 minimum wage will  only hurt the small businesses that Democrats claim they want to help.  Many in my district have already told me they are going to lay off  workers or shut down.   So I say this to my colleagues who seem to believe that the size of  their heart is correlated to how much taxpayer money they are willing  to spend: This is not how you help. This is not how you govern  responsibly. This is not a contest to see how much debt we can rack up  for whatever constituency or special interest you favor at the moment.   Americans don't want handouts. They want a vaccine. They want their  businesses open. They want their kids back in school because they know  it is safe, despite what the teachers' unions are saying. And they  don't want to be told to wear three masks after they get a vaccine.   If you want to work with Republicans, assess what has been spent and  what hasn't and focus on small business relief that increases jobs  instead of killing them, then Republicans will be right there with you.  Until then, expect some serious opposition.         Recognizing the Tremendous Strength of the People in Houston     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to recognize the  tremendous the strength of the people in Houston, who I am honored to  represent in Congress.   As we all know, last week, an historic arctic blast hit most of the  South, including the great State of Texas, plunging millions of Texans  into darkness. In the middle of freezing cold temperatures, people  weren't able to heat their homes or access water. I personally had to  gather water from a swimming pool in our apartment complex after our  water was shut off.   I know that many had it much, much worse than I did. But through it  all, the community came together. My friend Jim McIngvale, known as  Mattress Mack, in Houston opened up his furniture store as a shelter  last week to give people in need a warm place to sleep, eat or just get  out of the cold for a few hours.   There are countless others who stepped up. Plumbers helped their  neighbors repair their pipes free of charge; food and water  distribution centers opened up across the city, including in my  district office; and people who had power used it minimally so  electricity could flow back to their neighbors faster. This is what we  call Houston strong.   It got us through Harvey and Imelda, and it is what will get us  through this difficult time as well.               Happy Anniversary to Federal Protective Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish a happy 50th  anniversary to the Federal Protective Service.   I thank the 1,400 members of FPS, the men and women who protect the  more than 9,500 Federal facilities, and the 1.4 million employees who  work in those buildings on a daily basis.   All too often, you only gain attention when tragedy strikes, whether  it is the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing or, just last year, bravely  defending the Federal courthouse in Portland.   I wish to remind Americans that it is every day that they are there  holding the line.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell you we are thankful and we are  appreciative of their service, and their commitment to keeping our  Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the FPS and I wish them a happy  50th anniversary.                            ____________________
