 Madam Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Caribbean  American Heritage Month. This June, we acknowledge and celebrate our  diverse Caribbean-American contributions to this Nation's history for  the 17th year.   Personally, I am so proud of my Caribbean lineage and want to honor  the universal pride that all Caribbean people share across the United  States.   Historically, Caribbean Americans have been key players in the  development, growth, and richness of this country.   Originally entering the United States in bondage, Caribbean people  endured the brutalities of chattel slavery for centuries but fought for  and attained liberation.   My home, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and Haiti are the  only two places to organize a slave revolt that led to successful  freedom from that revolt in the history of the Western Hemisphere.   Caribbean-American history is one of struggle and of triumph.  Descendants of these heroes and heroines would later search for greater  opportunities here on the mainland, as well as elsewhere.   Wherever we have gone, we have led to become pioneers and  revolutionaries of our times. Some of the most influential Caribbean- American figures have indisputably driven change and progress in this  Nation and continuously aid in its endeavors to achieve freedom and  prosperity.   Our unique and colorful cultures, traditions, and stories have  enriched and helped transform U.S. history such as the invaluable  contributions in government, academia, athletics, business, the arts  and sciences, and so many more which have shaped the fabric of this  Nation.   Members of our leadership, such as Colin Powell, a descendant of  Jamaican parents, who shattered racial barriers as the first Black  National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  Secretary of State. The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was a  dedicated Army general, awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  twice, following in the footsteps of the first notable Caribbean  American, Alexander Hamilton.   Susan Rice, Shirley Chisholm, and, of course, our present Vice  President, Kamala Harris, all share Caribbean heritage and have served  this country as political figures. We honor them and the legacy they  have left.   Journalists like Karine Jean-Pierre, who is the first Black and  Caribbean American ever to become a press secretary for a U.S.  President, and others such as Joy Reid, Yamiche Alcindor, and Abby  Phillip are Caribbean-American women who continue to disrupt the media  by uplifting and amplifying Black voices.   Our contributions are not limited to those within the rule of law.  Caribbean Americans have a long history of social activists, free  thinkers, and revolutionaries.   Everyone recalls Denmark Vesey who led the slave revolt in South  Carolina, a free man who died to free others.   Hubert Harrison, a fellow Virgin Islander and New Yorker who was  often left in the shadows, was considered the father of Harlem  radicalism.   Men like Malcolm X, whose mother was from Grenada; Marcus Garvey of  Jamaica; Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, founder of  the Black Panthers, was from Trinidad; and James Wendell Johnson, who  wrote ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' whose family was from the Bahamas,  all played crucial roles in the civil rights movement, and they left  lasting impacts on this country.   The Caribbean-American experience has inspired countless works of  art. A people rich in imagination, they are continuously at the  forefront of exceptional and innovative artistic expression.   Jean-Michel Basquiat, a Haitian of Puerto Rican descent, was a  leading figure in the neo-expressionism movement.   Musicians and actors such as Harry Belafonte, Cicely Tyson, and Hazel  Scott are visionaries in their field.   We continue to credit much of our scientific advancements to  individuals  [[Page H2746]]  such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, who everybody looks to and applauds, the  son of a beautiful Puerto Rican sister, a renowned astrophysicist,  author, and science communicator, recognized for his ``extraordinary  role in exciting the public about the wonders of science.''   In athletics, an abundance of individuals have had monumental success  and shown grace and leadership, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a son of  Caribbean immigrants.   Two other athletes, in particular, that I cannot stop mentioning from  the Virgin Islands are: Tim Duncan and Aliyah Boston.   This month provides an opportunity to reflect on the past, act in the  present, and envision the future. We applaud Caribbean American  Heritage Month.                            ____________________
