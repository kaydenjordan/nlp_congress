 DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  Brother Hubert Leroy Reynolds, an Air Force veteran who spent 35 years  working for the Federal Aviation Administration after he got out of the  military.   Hubert was a stellar member of our community, a mentor of young  people, an active member of the Carey Tercentenary AME Church, and a  proud member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.   Although I sometimes wore different colors, black and gold, I am  still proud to call him my brother.   Brother Hubert, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all,  thank Representative Rush for his leadership, his vision, his  diligence, and how well he has reminded us of those glory years during  the 1960s and 1970s that we call movement years.   As I looked at the photograph of Mayor Hatcher, I couldn't help but  smile thinking that, in 1967, that is the way we looked. We obviously  had more hair. It was a different color.   And it is a great reminder of what it was like during that period of  time. There was so much momentum in the air in terms of hope for change  in America from what America had been to some to what America was to  become.   I was thinking that, with just a little different twist, I might have  ended up in Gary, Indiana, rather than in Chicago, Illinois; because,  as we were leaving the South, coming to other places  [[Page H58]]  to live and work, I didn't know that I had a bunch of relatives who  lived in Gary who were also involved in politics: the Allen family who  grew up, some of them, with Mayor Hatcher at the same time. My cousin  Dozier Allen, and then his son, who is now on the county board, and his  cousin, who was on the county board before that, Roosevelt Allen. If I  had known that the Allens were there and were my cousins, I might have  gone to Gary instead of coming to Chicago.   But I remember 1967. I remember 1972. I can remember those huge  crowds of people who converged on Roosevelt High School where the  National Black Political Convention was taking place and all of the  eloquent speakers who were there: poets, Baraka, Ron Dellums, and  Charlie Diggs from Detroit. It was the most exciting thing I had ever  done, I mean, just to be in the presence of all this action.   It seemed as though each speaker would be more eloquent and more  compelling than whoever spoke before them. And, of course, Mayor  Hatcher, as the host and the person who had brought everybody together,  was just off the charts.   You have pointed out how much his presence, not only on an individual  basis, means as a motivator, stimulater, and activator for so many  others throughout the country who decided they wanted to do this. They  could do this because Richard Hatcher had shown the way.   And the individual cities that looked at Gary.   Of course, Gary was a different Gary: steel mills, steel jobs,  opportunities, people were flocking. So a lot of folks who don't look  at history in terms of understanding and knowing how things became and  have become the way that they were, I mean, it is good to see Gary on  the way back.   It has been good to work with Mayor Rudy Clay, with Mayor Karen  Wilson, and with others who are using what Mayor Hatcher did.   It is good to know his daughter. It is good to have come in contact  with the individuals who are there who have refused to give up.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Visclosky for being a real part of  the rebirth and redevelopment and reconstitution and reinstitution of  Gary, Indiana, to become one of our cities that we knew in the past and  so we can think of what is yet to come.   I thank Congressman Rush again for his vision. I thank him for his  foresight, for his insight, and for giving us to share, along with  Representative Carson and Representative Visclosky and himself, so that  people who really didn't know the history of Mayor Richard Gordon  Hatcher might have a better understanding of what his presence has  meant, not just to Gary, but to America.
