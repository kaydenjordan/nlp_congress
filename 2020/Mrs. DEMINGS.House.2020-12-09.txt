 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the  chairman and the ranking member for their support on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that media plays a critical role in  how we see the world and how we see each other. When a child sees  someone on the screen who looks like them, it can change their life.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, we continue to struggle with ongoing  disparities in housing, education, social justice, and even this  ongoing pandemic. Whether in news, movies, TV, or music, who tells the  story matters because diverse perspectives are critical to us  understanding the entire story.   I am grateful for our cosponsors and for my colleagues who will vote  for this resolution today, and for the media representatives who  partnered with us to move this legislation forward. As we continue to  work together to unite our country, break down barriers, and strengthen  our future, let's continue to utilize the powerful diverse voices who  truly are our strength.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support on this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Mr. Ronald Rogers. Ron dedicated his life to public service  and to creating opportunities for young people.   Ron was a proud member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and a  graduate of Florida A&M University. But above all, he was a proud  graduate of Jones High School, and he loved the students with all of  his heart and soul.   As founder and president of the Orlando chapter of 100 Black Men of  America, he worked hard to mentor students and provide scholarships and  other resources to help them during their college years.   Ron also served in numerous leadership roles, including as city  administrator for the historic town of Eatonville, where his vision for  Eatonville helped pave the way for the town's success today.   Ron never stopped, paused, or exhaled. He had an unwavering sense of  urgency about serving his community, about making his community better.   Ron Rogers truly made a difference in the lives of others, and we are  so grateful for a life well-lived.                            ____________________
