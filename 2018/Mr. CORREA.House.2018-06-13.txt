 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject matter of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address this body on a very  important issue that we need to bring to the attention of the people of  this country.   I am proud to have so many of my colleagues here today to stand up  against the President's policy of systematically tearing immigrant  children away from their families. These innocent children are being  held under inhumane conditions at detention facilities, alone and apart  from their parents.   President Trump's chief of staff, General Kelly, recently, when asked  about this, said:         The children will be taken care of, put into foster care,       or whatever.    This is an unacceptable answer.   The administration is tearing children away from their parents,  including infants and toddlers, and in some cases, holding these  children in cages.   The United Nations has noted that children arriving at the U.S.  border who plead for asylum with their parents is a legal form of  entry, and separating children away from their parents is illegal and a  violation of human rights.   These immoral practices are being executed by the Department of  Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, to instill fear and  deter families, who are already fleeing extreme fear and violence in  their native homes. They are trying to, again, deter them from seeking  legal protection in America.   For example, from October 2017 to April 2018, 700 children were  separated. But in just the first 13 days of May of this year, 2018, 658  children were separated, which almost equals the previous 6 months.  Children are literally being ripped from their mothers' arms, who are  simply seeking safety for their families. And immorally, the  administration is breaking up families, plain and simple. Asylum  seekers should not be held hostage and penalized for wanting to be  protected from harm.   This new policy is clearly unprecedented, cruel, and altogether dead  wrong. It is imperative that we stand up against the administration's  un-American policies towards families.   Today, my colleagues and I are standing up against this barbaric  action and demand the administration stop punishing children and stop  punishing families who are fearing for their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lofgren), my good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  California for those remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), my  good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  California for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  Wisconsin, and I completely agree with her. We cannot be silent in  these very challenging times. The whole world is upside down, and  people are counting on us to make sure that we remind people of what is  going on in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), my  good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Texas, and I have to say, when we talk about ``it's not our fault,''  let's remember Central American violence, gang violence, drugs, gangs.  What fuels it? Our insatiable appetite in the United States for drugs.  Our dollars that go into Central America, this is what fuels the  violence.   These children, these families, when they come of age, MS-13, whom  the President talks about very often, tells these families: ``Either  your children join the gang or they die.'' These parents make a third  choice, which is to flee, to escape violence, and to seek asylum in  America.   It is not our fault? Those are our dollars that are fueling that  violence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters),  my good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), and I also want to thank him  for citing President Reagan's name in his comments, President Reagan  from the good State of California, my home.   Governor Reagan of the State of California, he understood family; he  protected families; and President Reagan passed immigration reform in  the United States. Thank you, President Reagan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), my good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  New York for her comments.   I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my good  friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  O'Rourke), my good friend and distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his  comments, and I think he is absolutely correct. History is going to  judge us, and we are going to look back years from now and say: What  did we do?   We have to make sure we are not silent in this very special moment in  our history. I thank the gentleman for coming.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Adam Smith, very  much for coming over and sharing his thoughts. It is very important.  Again, we cannot forget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  my good friend and distinguished colleague from the good State of Texas    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Congresswoman Jackson  Lee, for her comments.   I agree with her. This is a call to action. At this moment in  history, we cannot be silent. At this moment in history, we cannot look  away. And in this moment of history, we cannot ignore what we know is  clearly going on around us. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Mr. Joaquin Castro, my good friend and  distinguished colleague from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Castro  from the good State of Texas, for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to address this most  important issue of asylum and this most important issue of children  seeking asylum in this great country of ours.   We have to remember who this country is. We have to remember who we  are as a people. We are all immigrants in this country. Except if you  are native-born, Native American, you are not. But 99.9 percent of us  were all immigrants. We all came to this country, our forefathers came  to this country seeking a better life, seeking better opportunities,  and seeking to run away from tyranny that was provided to them by other  countries.   Today, I hope that the people who are watching and the people who are  listening understand what is at stake today. We cannot look away. We  cannot ignore what is going on.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
