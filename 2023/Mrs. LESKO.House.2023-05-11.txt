 Mr. Speaker, I am from a border State, and I have been to  the border multiple times. There is absolutely an invasion at our  southern border.   Even worse, title 42 ends today. Without title 42, the number of  illegal immigrants at our southern border is expected to skyrocket.   The Biden administration has no plan. In fact, I heard multiple times  from my Democratic colleagues today how we should work together on a  comprehensive plan. May I remind my Democratic colleagues that they  were in total control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency for  the last 2 years, and they did absolutely nothing.   The Secure the Border Act is the solution. This bill disincentivizes  illegal immigration, ends catch and release, builds the wall, and  reinstates President Trump's successful remain in Mexico policy.   Republicans want secure borders. Republicans want to protect our  communities from deadly fentanyl. Republicans want to protect the  innocent immigrant children from being sold into sex slavery, like is  happening today.   It is time to pass this legislation and secure the border now because  President Biden won't.  [[Page H2271]]
