 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in a jubilant manner, because  every American deserves to be treated equally under the law.   I rise today in support of the basic and common principles enshrined  in our Constitution, of liberty and justice for all, that no person  shall be denied or be discriminated by their sexual orientation.   I rise today in support of the Equality Act that we must proudly pass  today led by my friend,   David Cicilline.   For in this country, in this year, 2019, we must choose acceptance to  grow our economy and to promote the general welfare.   I rise because it is time to pass the Equality Act for full civil  rights protections for all LGBTQ Americans. So many sacrificed so I  could stand here today and speak these words. Passing this bill will  send a powerful, bipartisan message to members of the LGBTQ community  that they are not second-class citizens.   Today we must vote to pass the Equality Act.
