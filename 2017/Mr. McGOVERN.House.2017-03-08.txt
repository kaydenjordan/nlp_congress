 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney) for the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to Defense  Subcommittee Chairmen Granger and Frelinghuysen, and Ranking Member  Visclosky, for their hard work in bringing this bill to the House floor  today. The Defense Subcommittee is known for its ability to work in a  bipartisan manner, and this bill demonstrates that this tradition  continues.    Last year, the House approved its version of the FY 2017 Defense  Appropriations bill. It was a deeply flawed bill filled with funding  gimmicks, including a funding cliff that cut off funding for the war  budget in order to boost base defense spending by $18 billion. The  Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill did not contain such  gimmicks and was marked up by the Senate Defense Subcommittee, the full  committee, and reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee, but  it never went to the Senate floor for consideration.   The FY 2017 Defense Appropriations bill that the House will consider  later today is not, therefore, a conference report. It is being treated  as if it were a conference report, namely by having a closed rule, but  let us be perfectly clear that this is not a conference report.   Let me also be clear, Mr. Speaker, that we could have had this type  of final bill come before us last December, just as we could have  brought up all of the pending FY 2017 appropriations bills before the  House last December for final action. Instead, Republican leadership  chose to keep nearly the entire Federal Government, including the  Pentagon, operating at FY 2016 levels without any clarity about what  their annual budgets might be.   So when we hear talk about problems with military readiness or  shortfalls in defense budgets, I suggest the Republican leadership hold  a mirror up to their faces and take some responsibility.   This bill is 5 months late. It could also have been taken care of 3  months ago in December, and, in fact, it should have been taken care of  in December. It is now making its way through another convoluted  process today. But we still have no idea about the fate of the other  pending ten appropriations bills that the Republican leadership failed  to complete last December.   And I say convoluted, Mr. Speaker, because when the House votes on  H.R. 1301 today, it still needs to go back to the Senate, and we really  have no idea what they are going to do with it. Are they going to pass  it without any changes and send it to the President for signature? Or  are they going to use it as a vehicle to attach the other ten  appropriations bills and send it back to us as the FY 2017 omnibus that  we should have completed in December? Perhaps they might consider  holding on to it until the President gets around to sending Congress  his request for the FY 2017 supplemental so that we finally know how  much Congress is actually being asked to approve for Pentagon spending  in FY 2017?   So hold on to your hats because we are not done today with the  defense spending bills for fiscal year 2017, one way or the other.   Mr. Speaker, I know that everyone in this House wants to make sure  that our men and women in uniform are well staffed, trained, and  equipped to carry out the missions and duties that we have asked them  to carry out. In these areas, in particular, there is much to recommend  in this latest version of the FY 2017 defense bill. The same is true  for the funding included in H.R. 1301 for suicide prevention, sexual  assault, and medical research.   I would also like to point out that H.R. 1301 totals $577.9 billion.  This includes $516.1 billion in the base bill and $61.8 billion in the  overseas contingency operations account to fund the many wars in which  we are engaged. Coupled with the $5.8 billion FY 2017 supplemental  Congress approved last year, total defense spending for FY 2017  currently stands at $583.7 billion; and that is before we receive still  another FY 2017 supplemental from the President.   Mr. Speaker, that is well over half a trillion dollars for the  Pentagon, more than the combined total military spending of the next  seven greatest military powers in the world. So for those who bemoan  how underfunded the Pentagon is, I would argue it is more a matter of  failing to set priorities and tens, if not hundreds, of billions of  dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Every report on every attempted  audit of the Defense Department reveals that the Pentagon doesn't have  a clue about where the money goes. Billions and billions of dollars  cannot be accounted for. No other agency in the U.S. Government gets so  much money or is allowed such sloppy  [[Page H1606]]  accounting, yet the White House and the Congress can't wait to throw  even more billions at the Pentagon, rather than demanding  accountability and setting clear spending priorities.   There are also other matters of concern with this bill, Mr. Speaker.  H.R. 1301 not only continues, but adds to the prohibitions regarding  the detention facility at Guantanamo. This is all an effort to prevent  Guantanamo from shutting down, which hurts America's ability to do  human rights work around the world and remains a stain on our own  values and ideals.   This bill continues to spend billions of dollars on the insane  trillion-dollar effort to modernize and produce new generations of  nuclear weapons when what we should be doing is continuing to reduce  our nuclear arsenal and enter hard negotiations with other nations that  have nuclear weapons to eliminate them altogether.   Finally, H.R. 1301 continues to provide so-called emergency funding  through the OCO account to continue wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and  elsewhere. These wars are hardly unexpected or an emergency and should,  therefore, be fully incorporated into the base budget for the Pentagon.  They are also wars for which Congress has not debated or approved any  authorization for the use of military force.   We do not have an AUMF to deploy our military forces against the  Islamic State, yet we have deployed military forces in the air, at sea,  and on the ground in Iraq, in Syria, and elsewhere in the region.   We do not have an AUMF to deploy our military forces in the civil war  in Yemen, yet we have deployed them to Yemen where one of our Navy  SEALs was killed in combat and several others wounded in January.   The Republican leadership continues to fail at its constitutional  responsibilities by not bringing any AUMF before the House for  consideration, despite promises to do so. So here we are in the 115th  Congress, following in the failed footsteps of the 113th and 114th  Congresses, getting ready to vote on tens of billions of dollars for  wars that Congress has failed to authorize.   I am proud of the courage demonstrated every single day by our men  and women in uniform. I wish I could say the same thing about Congress  and this House.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, while I am glad that at least one of the  pending appropriations bills is going to see some action today, I  wonder about the fate of the other ten.   When will we see those bills, Mr. Speaker?   In fact, speaking of urgent pending matters, when will we see a jobs  bill?                                time  1245    When are we going to see legislation to repair and modernize  America's infrastructure? Will extra funds be included in the fiscal  year 2017 Transportation--HUD Appropriations bill, in the Energy and  Water Appropriations bill, in the Interior Appropriations bill for  similar improvements on Federal lands?   We have all read about the replacement proposed by the Republican  leadership for the Affordable Care Act, and correct me if I'm wrong,  Mr. Speaker, but I am having trouble remembering how many hearings were  held on that proposal so that Congress could benefit from experts in  the healthcare field about whether this replacement bill will provide  health care to even more Americans at less cost than the ACA. Oh, that  is right, Mr. Speaker. The proposal is being marked up today without  any hearings or expert testimony whatsoever.   Especially for the new Members of this body, it is important to  remember that, when the Democrats drafted the Affordable Care Act,  there were dozens of hearings and 30 days prenotification before Energy  and Commerce held its markup, a markup that continued over many days.  And then the bill, as reported out of committee, was posted for over 2  months online before coming before the full House for debate on  amendments and final passage.   Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, if a replacement bill to the ACA is not  able to make sure that more Americans have health insurance at a lower  cost, then what is the point other than politics?   We don't need to see any bill that covers fewer people and forces  workers, families, and individuals to pay even more for their  healthcare coverage and get even less in terms of healthcare  protections. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Republican replacement bill is  being marked up in committee without a score by the Congressional  Budget Office; and without a CBO score, then no one in this Chamber, in  this city, in this Nation has any idea, has any clue how much this  replacement bill will cost the taxpayer, let alone who will benefit and  who will suffer under its provisions.   That is simply a scandal, Mr. Speaker, completely unacceptable. It is  a cruel joke on American families, American workers, and the States,  local communities, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers  who will have to struggle with the consequences of people losing their  health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, let's see America's priorities taken care of: a jobs  bill, an infrastructure bill. Let's make sure we don't weaken  healthcare protections for people in this country, and let's see all of  the FY 2017 appropriations bills come before the House in the next few  days so that we can complete the work that should have been done last  December.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind words and  for understanding that it is inappropriate for Congress to continue  these wars without having a vote on an AUMF. I hope that that changes,  but I appreciate his support, and there is bipartisan support for  having this body actually do its job. That shouldn't be a radical idea,  but, unfortunately, nowadays, doing our job seems to be something that  a lot of people don't want to do.   Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of the year, the Republican  majority adopted a rule to explicitly exempt the cost of any bill that  repeals or amends the Affordable Care Act from a requirement that it  not increase spending by $5 billion. They effectively adopted a  legislative blindfold to completely ignore the cost of repeal.   Let me show you the poster of the language, and I am happy to provide  this to my colleagues on the Republican side. I will even give you my  bifocals if you want to read it, because I think it is important that  people understand what it says. It says:         Point of order: It shall not be in order to consider any       bill that would cause a net increase in direct spending in       excess of $5 billion.        Limitation: This subsection shall not apply to any bill       repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, as you can see, with this act, the majority declared  that they were not going to let the rules of this House, which are  purportedly in place to ensure fiscal discipline, stand in the way of  repealing the Affordable Care Act no matter how much it would cost  American families.   But, Mr. Speaker, it gets even worse. As we stand here today,  Republicans have taken their head-in-the-sand approach to the  Affordable Care Act to a new low. Right now, both the Energy and  Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are considering Republican  legislation to repeal healthcare reform without providing any analysis  from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office on the  cost of their legislation.   So let me put this another way. Earlier this year, the Republicans  said: It does not matter how much it will cost to take health care away  from millions of Americans. Now they are saying they don't even want to  know how much it will cost or what impact it will have on American  families.   Mr. Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget  Office. That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to  advise us precisely at times like this. Republicans have talked about  repeal and replace for 7 years. Acting like they had not enough time to  weigh the cost of their actions would be laughable if it were not so  irresponsible.   Now, we Democrats care about health care and we care about costs and  we demand to know what the impact of this repeal bill will be. Members  should not be asked to vote on this legislation until they know the  full weight of their decision.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made  publicly available before any legislation that amends or repeals the  Affordable Care Act may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or  Ways and Means Committee or on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of that  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), who has been a leader on this  issue, and he will explain this even further.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciated the gentleman from Florida's comments, but I would just  ask him: Why is the Republican leadership 5 months late in bringing a  defense appropriations bill to the floor?   We could have done this months ago. So if there was this urgency, it  seems to escape the Republican leadership.   I want to take issue with the gentlewoman from Wyoming when she says  that what is important today and what we are debating today is only  this Defense Appropriations bill.   As you know, we are currently debating the rule, and the rule is a  tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of  legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate  time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would  like to prioritize, what is of grave concern to us, and what agenda we  would like to pursue in this House.   The fact of the matter is that, as we are speaking, the House Ways  and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee are marking  up TrumpCare, which we know, in all likelihood, is going to result in  millions of Americans losing their health insurance. We also are  concerned that it is going to cost the American taxpayer a boatload of  money.   What we are simply saying here today is that the Congressional Budget  Office, which we fund and we rely on, ought to be able to give us a  cost estimate, ought to tell us how much this is going to add to our  deficit, how much it is going to cost the American people, how many  people are going to lose their health care.   Why in the world would you rush a major piece of legislation through  committee and onto the floor without even knowing what you are talking  about?   I mean, this process constitutes mindless legislating. This is not  doing your job, and that is all we are requesting.   We can argue over whether or not you like the Affordable Care Act or  you don't. But whatever you are going to do, we ought to bring it to  the floor with everybody's eyes wide open and knowing what the impacts  are going to be.   Talk about lack of transparency, this TrumpCare bill was under lock  and key until just a couple of days ago. It was the best-kept secret in  the world. For 7 years, my friends have been talking about a  replacement bill. No one ever saw it. But all of a sudden, it is  brought out before the American people at a press conference and,  again, in a way that doesn't answer a lot of questions. It is being  rushed through committee, and it is going to be rushed onto the House  floor. That is not a good process.   I will remind my colleagues that when the Affordable Care Act was  considered here in the House, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and  markups on the health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. You have held  no hearings. None. There has been no expert testimony, no healthcare  professionals, no doctors, no patients, no nurses, no families,  nothing. There have been no hearings. The bill went right to markup.    House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181  witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, both  Democratic and Republican, accepted 21 amendments. Again, there have  been no hearings.   In markup, the Energy and Commerce Committee adopted 24 GOP  amendments. In markup, the Education and the Workforce Committee  adopted six GOP amendments. The original House bill was posted online  for 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than  100 days before the tricommittees formally introduced their merged bill  in the House.   House Democrats posted their first House bill online for the promised  72-hour review. The Senate bill voted on in the House was online for 3  months, and the reconciliation bill was online for 72 hours of review  before the final vote.   House Democrats heard and answered questions from constituents at  more than 3,000 healthcare townhalls and public events. Tens of  thousands of emails, calls, and letters were logged in congressional  offices to register public comment. My friends are busy trying to avoid  public town meetings.   I am just simply saying that we are raising this issue because we are  deeply concerned about the prospect of millions of Americans losing  health care and about you adding God knows what to our deficit. I don't  think it is too much to come together in a bipartisan way to say: Let  us know what the costs are going to be, let us know what the impacts  are going to be. And if you still want to vote for TrumpCare, you can  vote for it, but you ought to know what you are voting for.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to say to my colleagues on the other side: I know you don't  like me talking about health care. If I were you, I wouldn't want to  talk about health care either. This is a serious matter, and it is a  matter of security for millions and millions of Americans in our  country.   Again, maybe somebody over there can tell me: How much is this new  TrumpCare bill going to cost? How much is it going to add to the  deficit? How much are the American taxpayers going to have to pay for  it? Does anyone know how many people will lose their coverage? Hello?   I guess I would ask the questions: Why do we have over 200 employees  at the Congressional Budget Office, who we pay $50 million a year to be  able to give us these estimates, if we are not going to utilize them?  Why are we doing this?   It seems to me that before we do something that could harm millions  of people in this country, before we could do something that could  result in an increase in our deficit, why don't we ask the experts? And  we all acknowledge that they are experts and we pay them lots of money.  Why don't we get their advice?    This whole process seems backwards. You ought not to be marking up  bills when you don't know what their impact is going to be.   Part of our job as Members of Congress, in addition to holding  hearings and listening to experts and listening to citizens tell us  their perspective--which, again, has been totally ignored in this  process of the repeal of the healthcare bill--is also to make sure that  when we are voting, we know what the impact is going to be, we know  whether or not it is going to have a positive impact or whether it is  going to have a negative impact.   Again, one of the reasons why I want to defeat the previous question  is so that we can vote in a, hopefully, bipartisan way to get a CBO  score so we know what is what.   I get it. I know my colleagues don't want to talk about health care.  They would rather talk about something we should have done months ago.  That is what we are doing now, we are doing old work now. This should  have been done 4 or 5 months ago. I am just baffled why you don't want  to do your job.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I surely want to make sure that we support our  warfighters. My problem with the Defense bill is that we are spending  so much money on things that I think are questionable. I would rather  spend money on supporting our troops more than spending $1 trillion  over the next 3 decades building more nuclear weapons. We have more  nuclear weapons than any other country in the world, and we ought to be  talking about limiting nuclear weapons and eliminating them altogether.   I want to support our men and women who we put in harm's way, but I  want this Congress, I want Members of this House, to do their job. It  doesn't take any courage to sit back and have troops deployed all over  the world, in harm's way, and we don't even take the time to actually  debate an authorization for the use of military force. We are too  afraid to talk about those issues.   So when we talk about supporting our men and women in uniform, people  ought to do a little bit of reflection on how we have not been doing  our job.   Again, I note my friends don't want to talk about health care. My  colleague actually said she would like to talk about health care more.  Well, we should, because the fact of the matter is, as I said, as we  are speaking here, the Republicans have unveiled this bill that has  been in secret, that nobody has really had a chance to digest. No  hearings. They want to talk about health care so much--no hearings, no  expert testimony, no nothing. Right to markup; trying to rush it to the  floor before we find out the true cost to the American people about  what this TrumpCare bill is going to be all about; when they find out  how many of them are going to lose their care; how it is going to cut  Medicare; how senior citizens are going to see an increase in their  healthcare costs; how average Americans are going to pay more for  health care and get less protections; how people who are struggling in  poverty are going to be out of luck because they are going to do away  with the Medicaid guarantee to States.   Health care ought to be a fundamental right in this country, and they  are taking that right away, and they are doing it in a fashion so that  CBO, again, 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office that  Congress appropriates $50 million a year to support so they can do  their expert work, they are doing this in a way so we are not even  asking for their expert advice. What sense does that make?   This is the rule. This is where we set our priorities about what our  legislative agenda ought to be; and all I am simply saying is vote  ``no'' on the previous question so we can vote on an amendment so we  can demand a CBO score in the healthcare bill.   By the way, that doesn't slow down the Defense Appropriations bill.  It still goes forward. Nothing stops. So let's do what is right. Let  there be a little sunshine on this House of Representatives.   There is a pattern that has developed under the Republican leadership  where everything is closed. This bill that we are dealing with right  now, closed rule. It is not a conference report, closed rule.   We have had more closed rules in the first few months in this  Congress than any Congress, I think, in history, and that is the  pattern. No hearings, no discussion, just go right to markup. We don't  want to know how much it is going to cost. We don't want to know how  many people are going to be thrown off of health care. Let's just rush  something through. That is mindless legislating, and it has to stop.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H1611]]    Mr. Speaker, I am going to again urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to vote to defeat the previous question so we can actually  bring an amendment to the floor to demand CBO tell us how much the  Republican healthcare bill is going to cost and what its impact is  going to be on the American people.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you why I am worried. The AARP estimates  that the Republican repeal bill could increase premium costs by $8,400  for a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year, and it could put at risk the  health care of millions of vulnerable Americans.   Now, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office.  That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to advise us  precisely at times like this. We ought to rely on their information. We  ought to ask for their guidance. Before marking up bills, before  rushing bills to the floor that could adversely impact millions and  millions of Americans that could break the bank in this country, we  ought to find out what we are talking about.   We can walk and chew gum at the same time. You can pass the Defense  bill and you can also pass an amendment that tells us how much this  Republican healthcare bill is going to cost. We ought to do both.   So defeat the previous question so that we can bring this amendment  to the floor. Let a little sunshine in on this process. Let the  American people know what is going on here. I think that is the  appropriate way to proceed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I am wondering whether or not you could  inform us whether or not a CBO score has been completed on the  Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act because many of us are  worried it will kick up to 20 million Americans off their health  coverage. It will increase out-of-pocket expenses for millions of  families.    Mr. Speaker, I will give the Republicans a little bit  more time to request a CBO score.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
