 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can amend the rule to allow the consideration of H.R. 18, the  No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   This critical bill will finally codify the Hyde amendment and uphold  the longstanding bipartisan agreement that prevents taxpayer dollars  from funding abortions.   While Republicans and Democrats have engaged in heated debates over  abortion in the past 40 years, we were always able to agree on the  simple principle that public funding should not be used for abortions.  The Hyde amendment, which explicitly spelled this policy out, has been  included in every single appropriations bill since 1976, including  those passed under the Clinton and Obama administrations.    This commonsense, lifesaving amendment has been supported by many  Members of this body, including many of my colleagues across the aisle.  It is incredibly disappointing to see that this administration and the  Democratic majority have decided to ignore four decades of consensus  and instead embrace a controversial new policy opposed by over 60  percent of Americans.   As both a Christian and a mother, I deeply understand the  preciousness of an innocent child's life. When I arrived in Congress a  few months ago, one of my first actions was to sign on to H.R. 18, the  No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. But whether you are a strong pro- life advocate like me, or hold an opposing view, we should all be able  to get behind this bill.   Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. It is a  simple, commonsense measure that should have as much bipartisan support  this year as it has in the past.
