 Mr. Speaker, we all stand united with our allies across  Europe and with the people of Ukraine against Vladimir Putin's  aggression against this democratically elected country.   We also support actions to stop the purchasing of Russian oil. But  without action to increase production here domestically, the American  people will suffer.   It was only 2 years ago when, for the first time since the mid-1950s,  under President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States was a net  total energy exporter in 2019 and 2020.   This was made possible because of the Trump administration's  commitment to increasing domestic production of oil and natural gas,  which drove costs down and benefited American consumers.   But, sadly, look at where we are now. In just 13 months of President  Biden's liberal energy policies, we are now facing skyrocketing gas  prices. Even before the crisis in Russia unfolded, gas prices had  increased 40 percent, marking an 8-year high.   Now, because of President Biden's Green New Deal attitude and  reversal of Trump-era policies, we are once again reliant on countries  overseas, and energy costs are soaring.   In my district, across the Roanoke Valley, the cost of a gallon of  gas has increased nearly 72 cents in the past month alone. This  increase, in and of itself, will cost the average driver $363 a year  for those who fill up three times a month. That might not seem like a  lot to Washington elites, but it sure is for folks in rural areas like  mine.   I urge President Biden to pursue an American agenda to help get this  country back to energy independence. If all Joe Biden does is ban  Russian oil imports without increasing production domestically, we know  where the blame lies for spiking gas prices: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.           Congratulating the Strasburg High School Wrestling Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Strasburg High  School wrestling team for winning this year's VHSL Class 2 State  championship.   This victory marks the program's fifth overall State title and the  first in 22 years.   The Rams dominated the competition, ending the tournament with a  total score of 218 points. This was truly impressive, considering the  runner-up, the four-time defending champion, Poquoson High School,  scored only 150.5 points, meaning the margin of victory was nearly 70  points.    This win was a total team effort, with all 11 Rams wrestlers who  qualified for the tournament placing in the top four of their weight  class. As Coach Daniel Reynolds noted:         It is an incredible feat that we were able to bring 11 and       place 11, bring six to the finals. To have three champions of       six finalists is great.    The three Strasburg athletes that took home individual titles were  sophomores Heath and David Burks and junior Chuck Fake.   Further, with only one graduating senior in the starting lineup this  year, the prospects for another great season are high.   Congratulations again to the Strasburg High School wrestling team.  They deserve it.                            ____________________
