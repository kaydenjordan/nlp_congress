 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Mr. Ryan Ziem's American  Government students at Arnold High School the very best luck in their  upcoming advanced placement exam. I visited these students last fall,  and I was impressed by their articulate questions and commitment to  understanding our system of government.   Of course, understanding our system of government means understanding  the U.S. Constitution. It is the greatest gift left to us by the  Founders, and it has stood the test of time.   The success of the Constitution is due to its carefully designed  system of checks and balances. By separating the powers of government  into separate but equal branches and guaranteeing individual rights,  the Constitution has been, as James Madison suggested, ``the guardian  of true liberty.''   Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing these bright young students  good luck on their AP exam and in their college applications.                            ____________________
