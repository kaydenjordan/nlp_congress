 Mr. Speaker, we have an ongoing saga which the  mainstream media has begun to wake up to, but they are still not  publicizing enough; and that is what is going on at our southern  border.   I stand today because last Friday--always on Friday when the  President is paying attention--the numbers for December came out as far  as illegal immigrants entering the country. They hit an all-time high  again. Mr. Speaker, 238,000 illegal immigrants stayed in the country  from December 2022. This is not inevitable.   Two years ago, before this administration, in December of 2020, there  were about 21,000 immigrants. So we have gone from 21,000 to 238,000  with, I assume, a corresponding increase in the amount of fentanyl  coming across the border. Of those 238,000, over 8,000 were  unaccompanied minors coming here without a family.   I don't know where these people were or are today who supposedly care  about keeping families together when over 8,000 children come here  unaccompanied by their parents.   In any event, I hope the American public wakes up and talks a little  bit more about the all-time record number of illegal immigrants coming  here in December.                            ____________________
