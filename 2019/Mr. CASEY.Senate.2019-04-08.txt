 Mr. President. I recently visited two senior  centers in Pennsylvania, the Emporium Senior Center in Cameron County  and the Clearfield Senior Center in Clearfield County, to discuss  issues on the minds of older Pennsylvanians and those who serve them.  We spoke about the need to protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security; the importance of bringing down the high cost of prescription  drugs; and how to prevent con artists from scamming older adults out of  their hard-earned savings.   We must continue to support senior centers and other gathering places  for older adults. For many, senior centers are a hub for services and a  place where older Americans find a sense of community and belonging.  They are the  [[Page S2293]]  place where seniors gather with friends to socialize, look for help  with everyday challenges, and learn about timely topics. I am pleased  that the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, of which I am the  ranking member, has examined ways to enhance the services and supports  that senior centers provide. I'd like to commend the Emporium Senior  Center and Clearfield Senior Center for the excellent services that  they provide seniors and important role they play in the  community.                            ____________________
