 Madam Speaker, Go Knights Go. This is a great morning  in Las Vegas as we celebrate the first-ever Stanley Cup in Nevada.   Our champions, the Las Vegas Golden Knights have truly entered their  golden age.   Madam Speaker, our Knights played 82 games this season and won 51-- their best season in franchise history. In their 6 years, they have  blazed into NHL history and energized their fans in Nevada and across  the Nation.   I would especially recognize Team Captain Mark Stone and Head Coach  Bruce Cassidy, who celebrates 1 year on the job today.   Of course, congratulations go to the MVP and winner of the Conn  Smythe Trophy, an original Golden Knight, Jonathan Marchessault.   Madam Speaker, Nevadans are beaming with pride over our Stanley Cup  champions today. I know that glow will be with us for the weeks and  months and years to come.   I look forward to getting back to the district and celebrating our  NHL champions. Go Knights Go.                            ____________________
