 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for yielding.   Today, Democrats lower the bar for impeachment.   Under this standard, a President can be impeached in the absence of a  crime, without due process, and for asserting a legally,  constitutionally recognized privilege.   History shows Democrat Presidents have abused power and undermined  democracy to win elections, and yet they have not been impeached.   President Franklin Roosevelt used the IRS to target his political  opponents. His son later admitted FDR used ``the IRS as a weapon of  political retribution.''   President John F. Kennedy used the FBI to wiretap and monitor  political opponents, including congressional staff. He deported one of  his mistresses to avoid scandal.   President Lyndon Johnson spied on Goldwater's campaign, signing off  on wiretapping his opponent and Goldwater's airplane, and using a CIA  spy to obtain advance copies of Goldwater's strategies and speeches.   President Barack Obama refused to provide documents to Congress  related to Fast and Furious. His unconstitutional recess appointments  were unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court. He used national  security agencies to lie to the American people about Benghazi to win  the 2012 election. He spied on reporters. Finally, it  [[Page H12153]]  was the Obama administration that committed 17 serious violations  before the FISA Court to spy on Trump campaign associates.   Despite these clear abuses of power by FDR, JFK, LBJ, and Obama,  Republicans did not impeach.   Why? Because the Framers did not want a low bar for impeachment. They  wanted Congress and the President to work out their differences.   When I asked Professor Turley in a Judiciary Committee hearing if any  President could avoid impeachment with those low standards, he said,  ``No.''
