 Mr. Speaker, the United States Senate is about to embark  on a misguided journey. How can there be a vote to place Judge  Kavanaugh in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court under this  cloud?   To be sure, a person is innocent until proven guilty, but without a  full and public hearing about the veracity of these very serious  charges of sexual harassment, a decision today to elevate Judge  Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court casts doubt on the entire process.   Allegations of sexual harassment are serious charges which deserve  serious consideration. The Justices of the Supreme Court must  demonstrate respect for the law and for individual rights.   To impugn the integrity of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, to  elevate that of Judge Kavanaugh, is not appropriate  [[Page H9394]]  nor is it a credible tactic. The American people deserve more than a  dismissal of Professor Ford's charges. They deserve to know the truth.   Mr. Speaker, let us take time to uncover the truth. I gave this same  exact speech on October 8, 1991. The only difference was the  substitution of Clarence Thomas' name for Brett Kavanaugh's and Anita  Hill's for Christine Blasey Ford's.   Republicans attempted to censure me for that speech. History is  repeating itself before our eyes, and women are once again being  ignored instead of being believed.   We must do better than that in the United States of America and in  the United States Congress.                            ____________________
