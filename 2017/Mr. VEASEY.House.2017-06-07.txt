 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Houston,  Representative Green, and I also thank the Republicans that participate  in the shoot every year. Obviously, we all play to win every time and  we take the competition very seriously. Democrats only lost by about 13  shots this year. We actually did pretty good. So we are improving.   I want to remind everybody that we work on issues like conservation,  environmental issues, and other things where Democrats and Republicans  can come together for the greater cause of the country. I want to  remind the gentleman that next year we are going to find those 13  shots.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), who is Marc Veasey's co-chair on the  caucus.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my  colleague that those shots were in my bag and on our side.   We are going to win again next year. We always enjoy the friendship,  and I look forward to seeing the gentleman again out there and standing  up for the rights of sportsmen. I certainly appreciate his friendship  and look forward to traveling again with him.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. What a great event. It was a great  opportunity for us to get together, get to know each other better, and  spend some time in the outdoors.   I invite all Members to join the caucus. Come and be a part of this  next year. Republicans retain the trophy this year, and I hope we will  next year.                            ____________________
