 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 20-year  anniversary of the Clinton Foundation opening its headquarters in  Harlem, USA. For the past two decades, the Clinton Foundation has been  at the heart of the Harlem community, empowering local businesses and  working to improve the neighborhood. This is, as you know, Mr. Speaker,  an iconic neighborhood in the United States, and it is the center of  the African diaspora in the United States, if not the world.   Throughout their time in Harlem, the Clinton Foundation has helped  facilitate the microfinancing of 136,000 low-income women  entrepreneurs. It has created sustainable models to help foster  entrepreneurship, and it has undertaken critical projects to address  inequalities in this community.   From 2002 to 2013, the foundation operated the Clinton Economic  Opportunity Initiative, offering technical and managerial support to  local entrepreneurs. However, the work did not stop at the boundaries  of Harlem. In fact, in 2013, the foundation expanded their mission of  unlocking opportunity and addressing inequality across our country and  the world.   Due to the extraordinary work of the foundation, 430 million people  in more than 180 countries have benefited from the Clinton Global  Initiative. Twenty-one million people now have access to lifesaving  HIV/AIDS medications, 1.2 million children's books have been  distributed to under-resourced communities across the world, and 71  megawatts of clean energy projects have been facilitated in small  island nations.   In the face of the pandemic, the Clinton Global Initiative also  launched Action Network which brings together leaders from business,  government, and philanthropic sectors to take action and address  inequalities facing historically excluded groups.   Now, as we look to the challenges of the next 20 years, we know that  the Clinton Foundation will continue to sharpen their focus on  partnership building, expanding upon new horizons, and empowering more  and more communities.   I want to commend the Clinton Foundation on their prodigious work of  the past 20 years and their strong presence in the village of Harlem  and thank former President Clinton and former Secretary Clinton for  their continued dedication to furthering humanity and prioritizing  historically excluded and underserved communities.                            ____________________
