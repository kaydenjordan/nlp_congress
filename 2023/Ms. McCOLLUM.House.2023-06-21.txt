 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very heavy heart to  pay tribute to St. Paul firefighter, my friend, Captain Christopher  Parsons, who was just 48 years old when he sustained a major medical  event shortly after completing his shift and passed away last week.   Christopher's untimely passing is a deep and profound loss for his  loved ones, fellow firefighters, our entire city, and, in fact, the  entire State.   After joining the department in 2000, he was promoted to captain in  2007. He served in leadership roles for the IAFF Local 21, the  Minnesota Professional Fire Fighters, and the Minnesota Fire Service  Foundation, and he took his expertise and passion for public safety to  our State capital, where he improved public safety for so many.   Chris was a guide for me. I learned so much from him about  firefighting and the needs of those who fight fires.   Captain Parsons had an impact on so many lives. He fought to save  lives during his time on Earth, and he continues to do so through the  gift of organ donation.   I extend my deepest condolences to Chris' family, and I express my  gratitude for all those who put their lives on the line day after day  to keep our communities safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``aye'' on rollcall no. 278.
