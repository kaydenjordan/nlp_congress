 Madam Speaker, this week I have heard from grandfathers,  moms, students, and even from my Uber driver the other night, all  asking some version of the same question, which is, how can we continue  to allow our children to get murdered in their schools?   This week, six Nashville families are heartbroken. The parents of  three 9-year-olds are grieving. They will join the families of  thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of American  families who have lost loved ones to gun violence. Four hundred  American children have been gunned down this year already.   It is unbelievable that it is happening in this Nation.   I do not accept that this is the cost of freedom in this country.  Americans have said overwhelmingly that they want us to do something  about it. We in Congress actually could do something about it. We can  vote on the floor of this Chamber for background checks and to ban  assault weapons.   Throwing up our hands and saying there is nothing that we can do is a  dereliction of duty.   I stand with the children of America.                            ____________________
