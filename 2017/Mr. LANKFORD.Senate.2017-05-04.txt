 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is a busy day. There is a lot going  on in Washington, DC. Quite frankly, at home there is a lot going on in  homes, families, and lives. Today is also a unique day for America as  well. It is the one day that we as a nation have something called the  National Day of Prayer. It started in 1988. It was an official day on  this day, the first Thursday of May. But in the 1950s, Harry Truman  started this process of a national day of prayer. So it far precedes  that.   Our Nation has a rich and beautiful history in prayer. Members of the  House and Senate, as the Presiding Officer knows, open the day every  day with a prayer. It has been that way from the very beginning. Even  the first Continental Congress on September 7, 1774, opened in prayer.   Tonight, Americans will gather in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol  to celebrate the National Day of Prayer. Statuary Hall was once the  House of Representatives, where the House gathered. It was also the  largest gathering place in Washington, DC, and many churches for years  met in Statuary Hall to be able to pray. It was the common meeting  place. In fact, for a period of time in the early 1800s, four churches  a Sunday used at that time the House of Representatives Chamber--what  is now known as Statuary Hall--as their place for worship.   Thomas Jefferson worshipped there. In fact, every President from  Thomas Jefferson all the way to Abraham Lincoln attended church on  Sundays in Statuary Hall, what was at that time the House of  Representatives Chamber.   That is an interesting fact. I have had folks talk about Thomas  Jefferson's statement about the wall of separation between church and  state. That was actually in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to the  Danbury Baptist Association, saying they would not allow the State to  take over churches--that there would be this wall of separation between  church and state. Two days after President Jefferson wrote that  statement, he attended church in the House of Representatives Chamber  on a Sunday.   Even earlier, at our Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin  Franklin stated: ``In the beginning of the Contest with Great Britain,  when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for  Divine protection.''   Many U.S. Presidents have signed proclamations for national prayer  since 1799, from George Washington all the way to the present.   The National Day of Prayer is a good day for us to be able to reflect  as a Nation and to be able to remember well that there are many people  of faith in our country that do believe there is a Creator God and that  he has made a difference in our own personal lives and he has made a  difference in our Nation.   We go back to President Truman's statement. He said in 1952: ``The  President shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other  than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the  United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation in churches, in  groups, and as individuals.''   As I mentioned, in 1988, President Reagan even affirmed that.  [[Page S2767]]    I don't think I could find very many Americans who would say we are  running out of things to pray for: debt; anger in the Nation;  conversation about hard, difficult issues that we face; terrorism and  threats of violence from around the world. We are not out of things to  pray for. Far from it. But people of faith believe that, regardless of  the obstacles we face, there is a God that we can call out to who hears  us and who cares about our daily lives. He is not a God who just  created and walked away. He is a God whom we can know, and we feel  confident that God knows and loves us.   Philippians 4:6 says: ``Do not be anxious about anything, but in  everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your  requests be made known to God.''   I am always encouraged when I travel around Oklahoma and around the  Nation. I even ran into some people this week who stopped me in the  hallway and just said: ``I want you to know I'll pray for you.''   I encourage Americans to pray for the President, for the Vice  President, for their Cabinet, for the Supreme Court, for Members of the  Senate and of the House, for the staff who serve around us and with us  and serve people around this country, for our military, and for first  responders. The list could go on and on of people who set aside their  time and their life to be able to serve. It is not an unreasonable  request to be able to say: Pray for them; ask God to continue to  protect them.   It is amazing to me how many Christians I bump into of my own faith  who find it easier to complain about government than it is to pray for  those in government. I think that is an issue we need to fix, and today  is a good day to begin that, on this National Day of Prayer.   I remember well, personally, that I grew up around the church. My mom  dragged me to church. I mean it. She made me go. But I remember  extremely well sitting in the balcony of the church one Sunday and  actually paying attention to our pastor as he would read through  Scriptures. Probably for the first time in my life, I started actually  thinking about this one simple truth: There is a God, and I don't know  Him.   I couldn't shake that reality. Laying in bed late that Sunday night  by myself, I remember praying--probably for me, for the first time in  my life, actually praying. And I prayed a very simple 8-year-old  prayer. My prayer was this: God, I don't know You, but I know I have  done things wrong in my life and I need Your forgiveness. Would You  come into my life and take control?   It was the beginning point for me--just the most simple of ways for  me to begin a relationship with God, trusting in His forgiveness and  His ability to forgive.   I have in my office two paintings that hang. One painting is the  hands of a potter at a wheel, shaping the clay as they choose to. It  reminds me of the sovereignty of God. Below it is a painting of those  same hands sitting at that same bowl holding it, but this time the bowl  is done. It is full of water. There is a towel in it, and there are  feet around the bowl. It reminds me of the call to serve that we all  have--to be able to serve people in the most humble of ways. It reminds  me that there is a God, and that He has called us to a task. Part of  that task is to pray.   The National Day of Prayer is not a mandate from the Federal  Government that all people should pray--far from it. It is just a  reminder. It is a reminder for people of faith who choose to pray that  this is a good day when we can reset to be able to pray for our Nation  and for our leaders. It is an acknowledgement, quite frankly, that  millions of people of faith believe in God and that those individuals  believe that God hears our prayers and responds. So thus we should  pray.   Culturally, it is fascinating to me to be able to talk to people  about prayer. I ran into some people that find it perfectly permissible  in times of great struggle and anguish to pray, but in times of  thanksgiving, it seems odd. Let me give a for instance.   A couple of years ago, a football coach in our country was fired from  his job because at the end of a football game he would kneel down after  the game was over and thank God for the safety of his players. For  that, he was released from his job because, for some reason, Americans  don't accept prayers of thanksgiving. But at those same football games,  if a player was injured and the coaches and players were to kneel down,  the crowd would see that as a good sign of respect--that we respect  someone who is injured, and it is entirely reasonable to pray when  there is an injury on the field but maybe not if it is just a prayer of  thanksgiving.   It is an odd season for us as a nation, trying to figure out who we  are and what we believe and if Americans of faith can live their faith.  I would challenge us as a country, for those of us who have faith, to  be able to live our faith with integrity and with consistency, and on a  National Day of Prayer like this, to remind our Nation that there are  millions of people of faith but that there are also millions of people  that have no faith at all. They are also Americans, and they are also  to be respected because many people are on a journey with God.   There are many people who don't practice faith at all today that  consider simple things in their life. Their financial house may be in  order. Their family life may be in order. But their spiritual life  remains a vacuum, and they are, quite frankly, trying to figure that  out.   I am always interested in the stories of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham  Lincoln in his earliest political campaigns was chastised that he was  anti-faith or that he was secretly an atheist because he never attended  church everywhere. He said he had respect for the Bible and read the  Bible and had respect for faith, but he just personally didn't practice  it. In his earliest campaigns, he was really challenged by that and  only narrowly won at times. In fact, he lost some of his campaigns, and  he had attributed losing those campaigns to people having challenged  him that he was anti-faith.   But then we read his words when he was President of the United  States, and we find a person who was on a journey with God. It wasn't  anti-faith. He just didn't practice faith.   But listen to these words in 1863 from President Lincoln. He  proclaimed a National Day of Prayer, as every President before him has,  and he wrote this:         We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of       Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace       and in prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and       power, as no other nation has ever grown. But we have       forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which       preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and       strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the       deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were       produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.       Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-      sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving       grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us! It behooves       us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to       confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and       forgiveness.    That is a man who was on a journey with God, who came to the  Presidency as a person of no faith, who understood the  responsibilities, and his heart dramatically changed.   It is a good day for us to reflect on this National Day of Prayer. I  would encourage the Nation, if they choose, to be able to watch and  join in or to just quietly be able to pray on their own, to remember  again that those of us who pray for others should probably spend some  time praying for ourselves as well. At times, as we criticize others,  we should probably self-evaluate and ask the simple question: Do we  live the values that we demand of others?   It is a good day to pray. Later tonight, I will stand in that  historic Statuary Hall where Presidents and Members of Congress and  individuals have prayed for a long time, and I will read Daniel,  Chapter 9 to the group, which reads:         Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your       servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your       desolate sanctuary. Give ear, our God, and hear us.    It is a similar prayer that many of us pray in gatherings all over  this Capitol every week. Members of the House and the Senate and staff  quietly find places in this building to pray. It is not a bad idea for  the Nation to join us.   Hear, O God, our prayer. We need Your help.   Mr. President, I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
