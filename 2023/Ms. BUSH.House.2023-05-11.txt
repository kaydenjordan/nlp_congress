 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in honor of  National Nurses Week and to honor the life and legacy of America's  first professionally trained Black nurse, Mary Eliza Mahoney.   Today, I am proud to introduce a resolution supported by the National  Black Nurses Association and National Nurses United to uplift and  celebrate the timeless contributions of Mary Eliza Mahoney.   Mary Eliza advanced the nursing profession by confronting issues  affecting professional nurses, such as poor working conditions and  racial discrimination.   She was one of the founders of the National Association of Colored  Graduate Nurses, whose mission was to improve access to educational and  nursing practices for all Black Americans.   Her legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of Black nurses across  this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating America's  first Black nurse and in honoring Black nurses who are saving lives  across our country every day.                            ____________________
