 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his leadership as chair of the Rules Committee for  bringing this important legislation to the floor today.  [[Page H1912]]    I also acknowledge the bipartisan cooperation of the Republicans in  this House and pay tribute to Mr. Cole, who is highly respected on both  sides of the aisle. I am sorry that he doesn't see a pattern in this,  as the Republicans have had these kinds of committees time and again. I  never heard him question them then, but I do hear him questioning them  today.   But I am very pleased that the two of them will be working together  with the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, and the  distinguished Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy, as well as with the  leadership of Chairwoman Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis in the days  ahead to consider the proposal that we have for how we can act as a  Congress when everybody cannot be present.   I see in the paper that I pulled it. No, I didn't pull it. I said all  along I wanted this to be bipartisan. As Speaker of the whole House, as  we changed how we participate, I wanted it to be bipartisan. When we  saw that that opportunity existed, in my conversation with the  distinguished Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy, I then said we have to  give this a chance.   I do think that there are many options that may be available. We want  to give all the options to our Members, but consistent with the  Constitution of the United States, the rules of the House of  Representatives, the security of this body's information, as well as,  again, the technology to make sure it works when we are depending on  it.   So I yield to the wisdom that they will bring to all of this to give  Members as many options as possible and to do so in a way that, again,  is respectful of this being the coronavirus--and not just for how we do  business generally, but in this specific time--as, also, a template for  any other kind of emergency that might arise.   So I thank the chairman and I thank Ranking Member Cole for their  comments about willingness to discuss that, and hopefully by the time  we return, if that is May 4, we will have an opportunity to vote in a  bipartisan way on how we can do that.   By the way, when we are talking about proxy voting, we have to be  sure that it is consistent with the wishes of the Member of Congress  who is yielding a proxy, consistent with his or her representation of  their district. It is not just a license to the proxy holder to work  his or her well or the leadership to have a handful of proxies. It is  about the actual representation of that person whose district, his or  her district, wishes to vote on a matter, with not that much latitude  except as spelled out by the granter of the proxy.   As a new Member of Congress--some of you may have identified with  this--I would go into a committee room and think I had the best  argument in the world for my new, fresh idea as a Member of Congress,  and the chairman would have a pocketful of proxies and there was no  need to even have a discussion if he or she were not in agreement. So I  have been a victim of that, and I don't want there to be any doubt in  mind that it is a complete, accurate, guardrailed reflection of the  wish of the person granting the proxy.   Having said that, I want to salute our distinguished chairman for his  championship. He has gone on starvation, this, that, and the other on  behalf of solving the hunger crisis, the food insecurity crisis in our  country, and his enthusiasm on SNAP and what we are doing as we go  forward, the recognition that people are hungry in our country and that  we have to do something about it.   But hearing him as chair of the Rules Committee talk about that,  recognizing his history, chair of the task force on hunger, so many  times going on starvation diets and I would say, ``Why are you doing  that? I am not sure the other side even cares if you are on a  starvation diet,'' but, nonetheless, I salute the gentleman again and  again for his leadership on that.   So, Madam Speaker, here we are, and I thank Mr. McGovern, our  distinguished chairman, for bringing this resolution to the floor,  again for his great leadership trying to move us forward in a  bipartisan way to continue the operations of Congress during this  extraordinary time. I again acknowledge Mr. Cole's interest in doing  that as well.    Our Nation faces a deadly virus, a battered economy with tens of  thousands of sick, some died, millions out of work. This is really a  very, very, very sad day.   We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of  people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all. We have to be very  prayerful, and we have to be as bipartisan as we can possibly be, as  united, working together.   The bill we will vote on later today, which I will speak about later  today, is the fourth bipartisan bill that we will be passing in the  Congress of the United States. Starting March 4, we had our first bill:  testing, testing, testing; shortly thereafter, the 14th: masks, masks,  masks, in terms of the personal protective equipment that people  needed; and, again, our big CARES Act, which was bipartisan, as is this  bill today. That is why I hope, as we continue to talk about how  Congress conducts itself, we can do so in a bipartisan way.   Congress, again, has taken important steps in addressing this crisis,  as I mentioned, by passing three bills, over $2 trillion in desperately  needed emergency relief. We started: emergency, emergency, mitigation  for the impact on the health and the economy of our country. We hope to  soon get to a recovery phase. But right now, we are still in  mitigation.   Again, later today, as we pass this, the fourth bill and urgently  needed interim bill, I am very pleased that it was transformed from a  bill 2 weeks ago on the floor where the leader in the Senate said: This  is it, 250. We are not doing anything else.   That failed to get unanimous consent. At the same time, that other  proposal was put forth. But I will talk about that later.   Again, why we are here for this particular initiative is we need to  ensure that the historic advancement of dollars in these bills and in  future packages are spent carefully and effectively to save lives and  rebuild our economy.                                time  1030    As the distinguished chairman mentioned, at the dawn of World War II,  then-Senator Harry Truman spearheaded the creation of a special  committee to ensure that the dollars spent on the war effort had  oversight and accountability.   Now, there was a democratic President in the White House, President  Roosevelt, so this was not partisan in any way, nor should this be  considered partisan. The purpose was to prevent waste, fraud, and  abuse, profiteering, price-gouging, and the rest.   As Truman said later, when he was President, he was interviewed about  this and he said: I knew that after World War I there had been 116  committees set up to investigate the money spent in World War I. 116  committees, after the fact. He said: First of all, there had been 116  investigating committees after the fact, and I felt one committee  before the fact would prevent a lot of waste and maybe even save some  lives. And that, he said, is the way it worked out.   The Truman committee turned into a tremendous investment for  taxpayers. The total cost at the time was less than $1 million, and it  saved lives and nearly $15 billion by preventing waste, fraud, and  abuse. That is the equivalent of like $750 billion today.   What made sense then makes even more sense now. That is why the House  is forming a special bipartisan oversight panel, the House Select  Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis.   And by the way, Mr. Cole, I did inform the distinguished leader of my  intention to announce such a thing before I did.   The committee won't root out waste, fraud, and abuse. We keep saying  it. It will be laser focused on ensuring that taxpayer money goes to  workers' paychecks and benefits, and it will ensure that the Federal  response is based on the best possible science and guided by health  experts and that the money invested is not being exploited by  profiteers and price-gougers.   We already have been hearing of families facing scams. There are  people out there creating scams to steal the direct payment checks. The  Secretary of HHS told me of a scam, one entity was selling masks they  didn't even have. That is why this is so important, and that timing is  important, so people know we will be watching how these tax dollars are  spent.   I agree with Mr. Cole. There is plenty of time later for an after- action review of what went before. What we are  [[Page H1913]]  talking about is how this money is spent as we go forward, to make  sure, as President Truman--Senator Truman at the time--did, to put a  spotlight on the factories that were doing the work that they were  supposed to be doing.   We have a tall order in terms of vaccines and therapies and the rest,  and we want to be sure that if there is, God willing, a vaccine soon or  a cure, even sooner than that, that we will be able to have the  resources available in places where they need to be in real time, to be  able to advance that.   Led by Majority Whip Clyburn--and I am very proud of him, Mr.  Clyburn. I had the privilege of naming him then to oversee what was  happening in response to Katrina, and he just was magnificent in his  precision of thought and objectivity.   And again, this isn't about assigning blame. This is about taking  responsibility and to be able to answer for what we have put forth,  that it really did work.   And so, the committee will exercise oversight to ensure that the  historic investment of taxpayers' dollars, which is enormous, are being  used wisely and efficiently and that nobody is ripping us off. Because  where there is big money--we know this--people will come up with a scam  of some kind.   Mr. Clyburn's leadership, again, is essential to the work. His review  of the response to Hurricane Katrina, which I mentioned, and so many  issues critical to working families, I am proud that he has accepted  the opportunity to serve our country in this role now.   We urge our Republican colleagues and the administration to join us  in respecting this oversight, that we can save lives, deliver relief,  and protect our economy. And I say this with all the hope that I can  muster, that we can do this in a very bipartisan way.   So anyone who is thinking of a scam or a delay in terms of how the  product we are looking out for is produced and how available it is to  everyone in our country, they will know that we, again, are watching  from both sides of the aisle how taxpayers' dollars are being spent.   With that, I once again thank the distinguished chairman for bringing  this important legislation to the floor. I hope that we may--on a  different side of this vote, when the committee is formed--have much in  common in how we put a very bright light on how the money is spent to  make people healthier, to make our economy stronger, and to do so in a  way that brings us all together.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for managing this important legislation on the floor of the  House. I also commend him for the work that he did in the previous  legislation that we have had.   As has been acknowledged, this is the fourth bipartisan bill that we  have brought to the floor to address the coronavirus pandemic, and this  is a very important piece of legislation.   So we come to the floor with such heartache, with such sorrow for  those who have lost their lives and for their loved ones, for those who  are suffering from the virus assault now, and for those who are in  doubt about their economic situation. It is about the lives and the  livelihood of the American people; that is what this is about.   Nearly 900,000 Americans have been diagnosed and are sick. Nearly  50,000 have tragically died. Oh, my goodness. We have to be prayerful,  prayerful about this assault again on the lives and livelihoods of the  American people.   Countless hospitals and healthcare systems remain swamped with cases,  and far too many frontline workers still do not have the personal  protective equipment that they need.   And just this morning, we learned that more than 4 million workers  filed for unemployment last week, with more than 26 million having lost  their jobs during this pandemic so far.   So, as we work to protect the American people, we have to make  decisions. We recognize that the key to opening up our economy, the key  to opening that door, the threshold we must cross, is a scientific one:  testing, testing, testing, testing; contact tracing; isolation; of  course, treatment; and, best of all, prevention. But the key is  scientific, and we must make our decision in that way.   So here we are, and I say this in terms of the overarching. The  American people have told us, when we did our earlier bill, they do not  want any taxpayer dollars going to enriching shareholders, dividends,  bonuses, CEO pay, all of that. They want their taxpayer dollars to keep  people in their jobs.   The oversight of that is exactly what we passed, we will pass--we  passed by voice vote earlier, we will vote on later. That is very  important. It is very important to the American people to have  confidence, as they make their sacrifices, that their taxpayer dollars  that they pay are not being squandered.   Our colleagues have said: Why do we need oversight? We have all these  committees that do oversight--and I hope they will--but they have other  work to do as well.   And as the Republicans have put forth select committees themselves-- Benghazi; trying to destroy Planned Parenthood, which did not have any  urgency for the American people--this has an urgency to the American  people.   We need a select committee whose focus, whose purpose is to address  the challenge that the coronavirus places on us. That is one.   Two, the American people want their checks. They want their checks,  and that is what we are doing with the PPP and the direct payments and  other initiatives that are there, and we need to do more.   And third, and we haven't done enough in this regard, they want our  heroes, our healthcare providers, our police and fire, our first  responders, our emergency services folks, our transit people, everyone,  our food service folks, they want everyone to have the equipment that  they need to do their jobs.    Our healthcare workers are on the front line, as are the others.  Emergency services, police, and fire, some of them are the first people  to respond to a 911 call. They are in the line of defense, and they do  not have the PPE, the personal protective equipment, that they need,  and we owe them.   We are not worthy of thanking them, thanking them, praising them,  unless we support them, and that is not being done sufficiently. That  is what we have  [[Page H1925]]  to do in the next bill--I call it the Heroes Act--when we will come  together to support our heroes.   Unfortunately, there was not enough interest in this bill right here  on the part of others to join us in supporting our heroes, our  healthcare workers, our police and fire, emergency services, in the  form of supporting State and local government.   When you hear State and local, it might sound bureaucratic, but it  isn't. Those are the people who meet the needs of the American people  and are on the front line of fighting this virus.   So, when we finish this--and I am pleased to hear the distinguished  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Neal, talk about the fact  that we are already preparing for that. We have been for a while,  because we just didn't really know that this interim bill would come  up. But when it did, again, we had to meet the needs of the American  people.   I am so proud that all of the bills we are passing, as has been  acknowledged, have been done in a bipartisan way, and the next bill  will be as well.   But let me just correct the Record, because the distinguished  gentleman from Texas said we held up this bill, and I want to correct  that Record because nothing could be further from the truth, and  perhaps he isn't aware, but let me inform.   Two weeks ago, the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury called me  and said: I need a quarter of a trillion in 48 hours.   Oh, really? Well, I don't know about that. Let's see what we can do.  Let's see. Why do you need that?   That was April 7. The next day, on April 8, Democrats came together,  House and Senate Democrats, and made a proposal that went beyond the  $250 billion for the PPP, a program that we helped shape and that we  fully support, supporting our small businesses, the entrepreneurship of  America, the optimism of America, the creators of jobs and wealth and  community in our country. So we are there with that.   But we saw some evidence that everything wasn't being done as we had  hoped, and so we proposed, 1 day later, that we would have additional  funding for small businesses, a $60 billion set-aside for the smallest  of small businesses: women, minority-owned businesses, rural America,  veterans, Native American communities, and the rest, who were not,  shall we say, as bankable as some others, the underbanked, $60 billion.   Another $60 billion, we said, for all of our small businesses: $50  billion of it for the EIDL, the disaster assistance loans, put $50  billion there. That $50 billion is leveraged to over $300 billion in  lending, easier lending for some than PPP because it is just a loan; it  is not about the bank deciding. And then the other $10 billion--we  wanted 15, we got 10 for the grants.   So there we got 60 and 60, 120, and then another $100 billion for the  hospitals. That was on April 8, $100 billion for the hospitals,  divided: hospitals, 75; testing, $25 billion.   The Senate Republicans went to the floor the next day, on April 9,  which was the 24 hours from the request of the quarter of a trillion  dollars. Mitch McConnell went to the floor and said: This is it, 250,  not one penny more. This is what it is.   The Senate Democrats objected, offered an amendment that includes  what we are voting on today. Mitch McConnell said: Absolutely not. That  was it.   So for 1 week, he kept saying: I am going to bring it up again on  Monday. I am going to bring it up on Thursday. For 1 week there was  that delay.   Finally, that was Thursday of last week, there was interest in  negotiation. And what we have on the floor today is the result of not  time that we delayed the legislation, but the time that the Republicans  refused to accept the fact that we needed $100 billion for our  hospitals and our testing, that we needed more money for those who do  not have sophisticated banking relationships, where we can have  community development financial institutions reach into communities  where they know the businesses, the neighborhood, the community, the  people, the customers, the clients.   So we should be very, very proud of the work that was done by  Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez of the Small Business Committee and  Chairwoman Maxine Waters, chair of the Financial Services Committee,  banks, small business coming with an idea that was rejected out of hand  by the leader of the Senate: Don't even bring that around. It is only  this; that is it, or else you don't support small business.   So when I hear, during the previous debate on the other bill and then  this distinguished ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, whom  I respect, and he knows that, say we delayed this, no, you delayed this  because--now, this isn't about assignment. This is about taking  responsibility.   Without the discussion over this past weekend which resulted in the  Senate passing the bill unanimously, Mitch McConnell, who wasn't going  to do one more penny, unanimously passing the bill, and then saying it  has all this additional help that we initiated, that he initiated. He  resisted it, but he initiated it.   So I think it is really important for people to understand what this  fight is about. It is not about trickle-down. We were successful in  turning the CARES Act from a corporate-oriented, trickle-down bill to a  workers-first, bubble-up bill, and we were proud of that and that it  passed and was signed by the President.   Once again, they just had the 250. We fully support that. We helped  create that. But that isn't the end of the day for what else we needed  to do.   And while I understand that they are resistant to helping those at  the lower end of the scale, I can't understand why they resisted $100  billion for the hospitals and the testing, because that was central to  meeting the needs, the health needs of the American people. I want  more, of course. I want more than that.   So now we go to the next bill. I call it the Heroes Act. We fully  support that. We helped create that. But that isn't the end of the day  for what else we needed to do.   And while I understand that they are resistant to helping those at  the lower end of the scale, I can't understand why they resisted $100  billion for the hospitals and the testing, because that was centra                                time  1200    Unfortunately, they do not want to put the heroes into this bill  today as fully as they should by supporting State and local.   And what does the distinguished leader on the Senate side, Mr.  McConnell, say? I am not doing any more bills. I think the States  should go bankrupt.   Oh, really? And not pay the healthcare workers and public hospitals,  the first responders and the rest? Oh, really? What made you think that  was a good idea? It is just more notion mongering to get attention, I  guess.   And so I came to this floor fully happy in terms of our  bipartisanship, totally sad about what it is in terms of the lives of  America's families and the uncertainty they face and the illness that  some are suffering and the loss of life that many others, tens of  thousands, have suffered.   But to hear them say we held up this bill, when they are doing today,  with great pride, exactly what the Senate Democrats asked them to do on  April 9. So I just wanted to set the record straight on that.   Again, I want to thank Maxine Waters and Nydia Velazquez and I want  to thank Frank Pallone for the great work that he did and the staff of  all of those committees.   We are voting on the floor today with a strong agreement that sets a  path that we had in the CARES Act, the issues that were addressed in  the CARES Act. Of course, we had State and local in the CARES Act; they  wouldn't go there here.   So what we are doing is we are helping small businesses. We are  strengthening the Paycheck Protection Program. It is $310 billion,  including that critical $60 billion reserved for underserved rural,  urban, and Tribal communities.   By supporting small businesses that cannot access the PPP, we secured  $50 billion for emergency assistance lending. That will be leveraged  into over $300 billion in disaster assistance loans and $10 billion  more for grants to small businesses.   For hospitals, providers, and health workers: We secured $75 billion  for health providers, which are losing revenue every day, and for  physicians and health workers who are risking their lives because they  don't have PPE.   In one of the New York hospitals, I heard a nurse say on TV that when  she went to meet the needs of the patients, she was given not the  regular gown and mask and gloves and the rest. She was  [[Page H1926]]  given a New York Yankees rain poncho. Others were wearing garbage bags.  Some of them said they were wearing medical waste on their faces  because they could not change the mask, and they would go to maybe four  patients instead of the one and discard.   So again, we thank them, we honor them, we revere them. But we have  no right to do that unless we support them with what they need. They  are risking their lives to save other lives, and now they may lose  their jobs unless we do our Heroes Act, which I look forward to doing.   For testing: We secured $25 billion for testing, which is key,  central, to reopening our economy and resuming our lives.   The administration has also agreed--and this is very positive--to a  national testing strategy that will increase domestic testing capacity  and address disparities, including across race, ethnicity, and  geographic regions.   Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the administration was not ready to  include funding for our heroes, our healthcare, fire, EMS, and other  essential workers, for the postal system, which is essential to us now  in getting information and materials where they need to be. And that is  why CARES 2 must be about our Heroes Act, focusing on support for  healthcare and essential workers. And I can't say it enough.   And then with that overarching concern for them, OSHA, so they have  safety in the workplace, family and medical leave, so that they can  meet the needs of their families, COBRA for those who have lost their  jobs. And we need full funding for COBRA, and I hope the administration  will be receptive to that. Pension, additional UI, and more indirect  payments and more.   So let us be clear, the health and safety of our country will be  endangered if we cannot pay the heroes who sacrifice to keep us safe.  They are being fired as we speak. Mr. Schumer was referencing hospitals  in his State where people were let go from public hospitals. But that  is not unusual. Our teachers, the custodians of our children, are being  let go. We have to face that, and we have to do it very soon and next.   And it is unacceptable that Leader McConnell thinks that no further  legislation is needed. That is what he said: No further legislation is  needed. And he thinks our heroic workers can wait and our States who  hire them should go bankrupt.   As CARES 2 protects the lives and livelihoods of the American people,  it must also protect the life of the American democracy: safeguarding  the integrity of our elections and supporting voting by mail.   So, again, it is the lives of the people, the livelihood of the  people, the life of our democracy.   Again, our prayers are with those who are suffering. His Holiness,  Pope Francis--and I quote him all the time--he said weeks ago, his  world prayer, that God would enlighten those who have responsibility to  take responsibility for those in their care.   Let us hope that we can all be prayerful, take responsibility, do the  job for the American people. We have an extraordinary opportunity to do  that.   But we must do so in a way that keeps them safe, as we want to open  our economy and do so--again, science, science, science, and science.  Let us show the same courage and strength and move with great urgency  to provide the support that they need, that they provide to others.   And, again, we have our differences, there is no question. I heard  the gentleman speak out against the $600 for people who are unemployed.  I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public  policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibility  and opportunity and results and progress for the American people and  that science and governance are the answers to meeting the healthcare  needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.    So I thank our colleagues for their leadership, Maxine Waters, Nydia  Velazquez, Frank Pallone, our distinguished chair of the Ways and Means  Committee, for his work, and so many people.   Again, right now, as we speak, the Agriculture Committee is meeting.  And as some of our colleagues have said, we can't do SNAP? They turned  down SNAP, food stamps, at a time when America is hungry?   We have our differences, but we are coming together on this  particular bill, and I am proud of that. It is bipartisan, it is  urgent, and let us get on with it so that we can get on to supporting  our heroes in a way that is worthy of their sacrifice.
