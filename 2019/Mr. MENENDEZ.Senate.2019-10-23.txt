 Mr. President, I guess if you live long enough and are  around here long enough, you get to hear it all.   Hypocrisy is when the party of the rich--now the party that gave $1  trillion in the Trump tax bill to the largest corporations, with most  of it going to the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent--now says it is  for the working guy. Amazing. Hypocrisy is when donor States, like my  State of New Jersey, give moocher States--those that actually receive  far more than they give to the Federal Treasury--say that somehow we  should continue to pay more. Yet that is overwhelmingly the reality  that is going on. In fact, I find the comments of some of my colleagues  here to be pretty ironic.   I urge the Senate to reject these new IRS rules that are designed to  block efforts by homeowners across America to avoid the Trump tax law's  harmful caps on their State and local tax deductions.   I thank Leader Schumer and Ranking Member Wyden for the opportunity  to exercise our authority under the Congressional Review Act to stop  these IRS rules from taking effect.   It was 2 years ago when President Trump and his allies rammed their  corporate tax bill through Congress. They promised middle-class  families thousands of dollars in tax relief and $4,000 raises in their  salaries. Instead, all they got was $1.5 trillion more in debt and an  economy that was even more rigged in favor of big corporations and  wealthy CEOs.   Of course, as bad as the tax bill is for the whole country, it is  even worse for States like New Jersey. That is because, even after  borrowing over $1.5 trillion from China, the President still can't pay  for his deficit-exploding corporate tax cuts. Where are all of my  colleagues--all of those deficit hawks--who talked about exploding  deficits and debt? They are silent.   Even though he couldn't have enough of this $1.5 trillion of  borrowing, what did President Trump do? He dipped into the wallets of  New Jersey's and other States' middle classes by gutting the State and  local tax deductions they used to write off, their property taxes. In  2016, $1.8 million, or around 40 percent of New Jersey's taxpayers,  deducted their property and State income taxes from their Federal  returns. That average was about $18,000 per deduction. More than 80  percent of those who deducted earned less than $200,000. So to say that  the Trump tax law was a giant hit job on New Jersey's middle class is  no exaggeration, for already New Jersey families are paying the price.   Earlier this month, new data from ProPublica revealed that because of  the new $10,000 cap on property tax deductions, home values in New  Jersey have taken a huge hit. In fact, home values in Essex County, NJ,  declined more than those of any other county in America.   And according to nj.com, of over 30 counties across the Nation  suffering the largest dip in home values, 16 of them are in the Garden  State. That is why Governor Murphy and New Jersey's legislative leaders  took action to protect homeowners from getting hammered. They adopted a  program, as did over 30 other States. And, by the way, these States, or  all these red States, are not the ``blue States'' or wealthy States.  These are States that adopted similar provisions before the Trump tax  bill that were getting the benefit of a local tax credit for charitable  contributions to nonprofits set up by local governments. They adopted a  program that 30-some other States have in the books in some form.   In return, taxpayers could receive a property credit worth up to 90  percent of their contribution. Other States have long used similar  charitable contribution programs. For example, in Alabama, there is a  100-percent tax credit available for contributions to private school  scholarship funds. In Missouri, one program incentivizes donations to  shelters for survivors of domestic abuse. In Florida, there are  programs that actually go to an education fund and to a conservation  fund. I could go through the list of these 32 States that had charity  tax-credit programs across the country, which now the IRS rules are  nullifying, and which all of those States--and many of my Republican  colleagues who represent them--are now facing. What was completely  acceptable and the IRS had no problem with now is not acceptable  whatsoever.   The IRS long respected these programs. So I was hopeful that New  Jersey's charitable contribution credits would provide relief to  homeowners suffering under the Trump tax scam and would be treated the  same as all of these 32 other States.   Unfortunately, as soon as New Jersey and other States took action,  the IRS reversed course and issued new regulations, hamstringing this  long-accepted type of charitable contribution program.   These are harmful regulations for all of the 32 States that are  represented through some of these programs, and the Senate has an  opportunity to protect all of those 32 States' charitable contribution  programs.   Look, in an ideal world, New Jersey's charitable contribution credit  wouldn't be necessary because Congress would uphold the full state and  local tax deduction as a bedrock principle of our Tax Code. As a matter  of fact, it is the oldest deduction in the history of the code, and it  is a principle that I would especially expect my Republican colleagues  to stand up for.   Since the Federal income tax creation in 1913, the State and local  tax deduction has encouraged States to stand on their own feet. It  encourages States to make smart investments that, at the end of the  day, make them less reliant on Federal handouts.   In New Jersey, we know that when we invest in public schools, we  prepare our students to succeed in high-paying fields. In New Jersey,  we know that  [[Page S6068]]  when we invest in mass transit, we connect workers to new jobs and  opportunities. In New Jersey, we know that when we invest in public  health and law enforcement, we all do better because our streets are  safer and our families are healthier.   It is no coincidence that New Jersey is one of the most economically  productive States in the Nation, to the betterment of all Americans,  especially those in less productive States--donor State versus moocher  States.   Isn't that a good thing? Isn't a State's right to set its own tax  policies a right worth defending?   For as long I can remember, I have heard my Republican colleagues  talk about self-reliance, about personal responsibility, about  protecting not punishing success, and about States' rights. Well, the  Trump tax law was nothing short of a massive tax on the success of  States like New Jersey and the State rights of States like New Jersey.   Likewise, I have heard Republicans talk about States' rights and the  virtues of federalism. Well, guess what. The State and local tax  deduction is a bedrock of federalism.   Today's CRA vote is an opportunity for my colleagues across the aisle  to actually stand up for those principles of self-reliance, of States'  rights, and federalism; to walk the walk, instead of just talking the  talk, and to preserve the programs of these 32 States with charity tax  credit programs that are now all threatened of being extinguished by  the IRS's determination.   I want to close by sharing a constituent letter I received earlier  this year about what the property tax deduction meant to one New Jersey  family.   This past April, Leigh, from Budd Lake, wrote:         My husband and I just did our taxes today--and for the       first time ever--we owe money. And not just a little,       hundreds.        We own a home and for the first time we were not able to       itemize our deductions; our deductions in fact were cut in       half.        There is no incentive to us owning our home anymore. We are       an average middle class family paying a mortgage and trying       to raise three kids. I'm tired of our family being collateral       damage in yet another political fight.    Leigh is absolutely right. New Jersey families shouldn't have to foot  the bill for massive handouts for big corporations.   To add insult to injury, while the new IRS rules crack down on New  Jersey's efforts to save families like Leigh's money, last fall the  Treasury Department made clear that corporations--listen to this--could  continue to benefit from the same exact kind of workaround.  Corporations can continue to benefit from the same kind of workaround.   How is that for protecting the little guy? How is that for hypocrisy?   It is not fair. It is not right. Our constituents deserve better. So  we will continue to push for a long-term solution to this problem. I  have introduced the Stop Attacking Local Taxpayers Act, or SALT Act, to  restore the full deductibility of State and local taxes.   Under my bill, the more you pay in property and State taxes, the more  relief you get. It is the exact opposite of what the Trump tax bill  says, which is that the higher the cost of living is in your State and  the more you pay in State and local taxes, the more you owe the Federal  Government come tax time. It is double taxation. It makes no sense.   The SALT Act deserves the full consideration of the Senate, but in  the meantime, we should use the opportunity before us today to help  hard-working homeowners suffering from the Trump tax law. We should  help these 32 States--overwhelmingly, most of them, Republican--that  have a tax credit program be able to sustain that program for the  benefits of the decisions they made in their States and for the  purposes they made, whether it be education, conservation, or whatever  else, that now are nullified by the IRS rule.   Join us, and let's exercise our power with the Congressional Review  Act to do what is right--to protect middle-class families throughout  the Nation from higher property tax burdens, to protect States and  their right to determine how their taxpayers will ultimately receive  the benefits for making investments in education, for making  investments in conservation, and for making investments in a whole host  of issues, that these States, in their rightful judgment, decided were  perfectly fine and that were always upheld by the IRS and are now  nullified by the Internal Revenue Service's decision.   That is what we have an opportunity to turn around, and I hope we  will.   I yield the floor.
