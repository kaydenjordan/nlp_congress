 Mr. Speaker, as we mark the solemn sixth anniversary of  Hurricanes Irma and Maria, I am reminded of the indomitable spirit of  Virgin Islanders who faced these devastating Category 5 storms, and the  invaluable support we received from Members of Congress who rallied to  secure much-needed funding for our recovery.   The impact of two twin Category 5 hurricanes unleased unprecedented  destruction upon the Virgin Islands of the United States, leaving a  trail of devastation that will be remembered for generations.   September 6, 2017, witnessed the relentless fury of Hurricane Irma as  it swept across our territory, carving a path of devastation that  lingers in our collective memory. A mere fortnight later, Hurricane  Maria descended upon our already devastated islands, compounding the  damage exponentially.   In the wake of these unparalleled catastrophes, the people of the  U.S. Virgin Islands demonstrated incredible resilience and  determination, while other places receiving such damage cried and  wailed about what had happened to them. Virgin Islanders, as always,  not believing that support would come, looked to one another.   We came together to support one another, rebuild our communities, and  lay the foundation for one more resilient future. The road to recovery  has been long and arduous, but the spirit of Virgin Islanders remains  unbroken, and the commitment to rebuilding stronger and more resilient  persists.   As we approach the exhaustion of FEMA disaster relief funding, we  face an impending crisis. FEMA has announced the implementation of  immediate needs funding due to the dwindling disaster relief fund.  Under INF, immediate needs funding, new obligations for public  assistance not essential for lifesaving and life-sustaining activities,  permanent work, and the hazard mitigation grant program will be paused  until the disaster relief funding is sufficiently supplied.   Without FEMA funding, crucial programs such as public school  reconstruction and essential services hang in the balance. Moreover, we  are only 10 legislative days away from a government shutdown, with some  of our colleagues more concerned about baseless political vendettas  than the well-being of the American people.    I implore my colleagues to rise above partisan extremes and deliver  for the American people. The Biden-Harris administration has requested  $16 billion in supplemental funding to replenish the disaster relief  fund. This request  [[Page H4270]]  should receive bipartisan support for disaster-impacted areas across  the United States. It is crucial that we put the needs of our  constituents first, prioritizing disaster relief over political  bickering.   I say to my Virgin Islands brothers and sisters, that opportunities  are fragile and don't always come through for us. We have got to do  what needs to be done to support our own rebuilding if Washington  cannot.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work on behalf of Virgin Islanders to  assess the support needed for our ongoing rebuilding efforts. Together,  we share the responsibility of ensuring that the U.S. Virgin Islands  emerge from the twin tragedies stronger and more resilient.   The opportunity before us is significant, and we must not let it slip  away. Let us act swiftly to provide the necessary funding and support  for all disaster-impacted areas across America to build a more  resilient preparedness plan.   Mr. Speaker, may we rise to this challenge with the strength and  unity it demands, and may we, as Virgin Islanders, remain VI strong.                            ____________________
