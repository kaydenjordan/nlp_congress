 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   In the middle of the historic health and financial security crisis of  the coronavirus pandemic, especially in my home State of Nevada that  has suffered the most debilitating economic impact, affordable  healthcare is now more important than ever.   Last week, in the middle of this COVID-19 crisis, President Trump  petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down every last protection and  benefit of the Affordable Care Act. On Friday, I learned that such a  ruling would cost 23 million Americans, including 309,000 Nevadans, to  lose their health insurance.   There is no excuse for this cruelty ever. But it is truly  unconscionable at a time when over 100,000 Americans have lost their  lives to a virus that we have yet to curb completely. When access to  quality healthcare could be the difference between life and death, we  should be building on the Affordable Care Act to lower health costs,  not ripping away every last benefit.   With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side who keep  saying this bill has no chance in the Senate, who do you work for:  Mitch McConnell or the American people? My constituents elected me to  do my job, and that is to fight for their healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I fully support the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Enhancement Act because we need to do more to provide affordable  healthcare and bring down the rising costs of prescription drugs.   This bill does that, and I urge my colleagues to join us. Do your job  today.
