 Mr. Speaker, a new survey by the Pew Research  Center found that an astounding two-thirds of Americans say the news  media has a negative impact on our Nation. What a comment on the media.   The survey asked participants whether a variety of institutions are  having a positive or negative effect on the way things are going in  this country today. The rating the media received was the lowest of all  institutions.   Another public opinion poll by Gallup showed the media's credibility  has reached a record low. This is not much of a surprise, given the  media's constant barrage of personal attacks and negative news  coverage. The American people deserve better than a biased media.   For the sake of our country, our democracy, and the credibility of  the media itself, let's hope they report the news more fairly and  objectively in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Shimkus) for yielding me time, and I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson) for sponsoring H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards  Implementation Act of 2017. I appreciate the efforts of Chairman  Walden, subcommittee Chairman Shimkus, and members of the Energy and  Commerce Committee to reduce the regulatory burden on the American  people and the economy.   As chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I have  worked to ensure that EPA regulations are based on sound science.  Specifically, the committee found that the 2015 ozone standards  implemented by the previous administration were based on questionable  science and would cost billions of dollars to implement. H.R. 806 is  commonsense legislation that appropriately delays the implementation of  these new standards, allowing States more time to work through  compliance.   This legislation also resets the time period for the next review of  Clean Air Act regulations. This is necessary to provide the Agency with  ample time to analyze the science and economic impact of new rules.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  reduce the regulatory burden on the American people and return the  Agency to sound scientific rulemaking.   Again, I appreciate Chairman Olson taking the initiative on this  subject.
