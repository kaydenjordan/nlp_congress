 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a  period of morning business for debate only until 4 p.m., with Senators  permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and that Senator  Schumer be recognized at 4 p.m.    Madam President, I go back home to Washington State  every week, and I talk to young people in Seattle who are urgently  calling for bold climate action. I talk to families in Yakima County  who are deeply concerned by a wildfire season that gets worse every  year and parents in Vancouver who are trying to figure out how they can  afford their kids' medication and make ends meet.   This summer has broken records in Washington State and not in a good  way. Energy prices and temperatures have both spiked. People from  Seattle to Spokane are feeling the stress, and they are feeling the  heat. Climate disasters have become an everyday reality in every  community across the country. Washington State has seen droughts and  wildfires and floods and heat waves that literally made our roads  buckle.   Families desperately need us to tackle rising costs and rising  temperatures because we cannot build a stronger economy if we do not  build a more sustainable economy, and that is why we need the Inflation  Reduction Act. It will reduce costs for families, it will reduce  emissions, and it will even reduce the debt and deficit.   The climate investments in this bill are, in a word, historic. They  won't just bring down carbon emissions by a whopping 40 percent; they  will help us establish real energy independence from dirty fossil fuels  and foreign adversaries. They will save lives by reducing air pollution  and supporting conservation efforts happening in rural Washington State  right now to prevent wildfires and protect families and address the  climate crisis.   This legislation will make historic, first-of-its-kind, economy-wide  investment in clean energy that will create millions of good-paying  clean energy jobs, including in Washington State, and it will bring  down families' energy costs for people who are struggling to keep the  AC on in the summer or the heat on in the winter or lights on year- round. It will help weatherize homes and install energy-efficient  appliances and heat pumps and rooftop solar panels and more.   This bill will offer huge cost savings for clean or electric  vehicles, new or  [[Page S4060]]  used, and give companies a good reason to build more of these cars in  America.   We aren't just cutting energy costs, though. No one should have to  worry about whether they can afford the healthcare they need, but I  have heard from countless patients who worked their whole life, who  saved their money, but still had to work an extra job or move in with  their family or even ration their prescription just to make ends meet.   Lifesaving medicine doesn't do any good if people can't afford it.  That is why this bill will finally give Medicare power to negotiate. We  are going to force drug companies to the bargaining table, and patients  everywhere are going to benefit. It will also cap seniors' annual drug  costs and cap insulin at $35 a month and protect patients from  companies that are jacking up prices on them with reckless abandon. It  extends the healthcare coverage relief that helped millions of people  save thousands of dollars on their healthcare this year.   This isn't just saving people money; this is going to save lives-- patients who are rationing their prescriptions, afraid to see their  doctors not because they are scared of getting a diagnosis but because  they are scared of the price tag. If that is not the goal when we come  to work every day, then I don't know what is.   But the Inflation Reduction Act won't just bring down families'  everyday costs; it will bring down the deficit by more than $300  billion because every cent of this bill is paid for by closing  loopholes used by enormous corporations. There is no reason a company  making a billion-dollar profit should pay a smaller tax rate than a  mom-and-pop shop in Washington State or a firefighter or a teacher in  Walla Walla, WA, so Democrats won't let it fly any longer.   Those big billion-dollar companies? They are going to pay no less  than the same 15 percent in taxes that many of our small businesses  already pay. Those stock buyback schemes that line the pockets of  corporate executives and Wall Street investors but do nothing for  working families? They are going to be taxed so companies pay their  fair share. As for everyday Americans, they won't see their taxes go up  one penny.   Make no mistake, the Inflation Reduction Act represents historic  progress. There is simply no reason anyone should be against these  policies and many reasons to get this done now.   This is not a bill for Democrats or Republicans; it is legislation  that will help all Americans--lowering prescription drug costs, making  healthcare more accessible and more affordable than ever, and pass the  largest investment in climate action in our country's history--all paid  for.                            ____________________     Madam President, but for everything good this bill  accomplishes, we have not yet addressed a critical issue families face  today: access to high-quality childcare.   There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the time to address  it is now. There can be no more excuses. We cannot simply vote on this  package and call it a day. Our childcare system isn't just stretched  thin; it is broken. Talk to parents, talk to businesses, talk to  anyone, and it is painfully obvious that our childcare system isn't  working for families, providers, or our economy and hasn't been for  some time.   Right now, families from Seattle to Spokane are stressed. They are  staying up late at night, trying to figure out how on Earth they are  going to find a childcare opening or how they are going to afford it if  they ever get off a wait list. When they can't find and afford  childcare, as is all too often the case, parents--moms in particular-- have to leave their job and stay out of the workforce, all while  childcare workers are being paid poverty wages, struggling to make ends  meet and provide for their own families, and they are leaving their  jobs for better paying work at fast food chains and big box stores,  which pay them more than their childcare position.   We have to do better for kids, for moms, for workers, for our  economy, for everyone, or this is just going to keep getting worse.   I know all of my colleagues have heard me say this before--you have  probably heard me say it 100 times--but I want to be clear: The  childcare system is on the brink of collapse, and parents are telling  us every single day this is an urgent crisis.   The emergency support that we did provide in the American Rescue Plan  was hugely helpful, but it is going to run out, and soon, and families  who are already at their wits' end will feel the pressure.   So we need to lower the cost for families as we fight inflation. We  need to expand parents' options so they can go back to work and support  the childcare workers caring for and educating our kids each and every  day. Now, I have been putting forward proposal after proposal to do  exactly this, and I am working with anyone I can to make progress here  because this isn't a ``my way or the highway'' proposal. It never was.  I hope my colleagues know that is not how I operate. What I am talking  about here is delivering a lifeline to kids, to moms, to our childcare  industry, not to mention the businesses and industries that desperately  want to hire more workers.   I am deeply disappointed that Congress has failed to meet this  crucial moment for our families and our childcare providers, so let me  just say this: I have been fighting for childcare my entire career,  since before I ever got here to the U.S. Senate. In fact, for a very  long time, I was the only person in the room fighting. So I am not  going to stop anytime soon.   And guess what. I am not the only one fighting today. There are  parents and advocates across the country who are fighting for this, who  know how critical this is for our families. There are small business  owners who understand how critical this is to strengthening our  economy--real people, not some army of invisible lobbyists. So I am  here right now to be a voice for them, and I am asking everyone here in  Congress to step up and speak for these families too. We have to get  this done. We must make this a priority. We must address this urgent  crisis before it is too late.   So I want everyone to know I am going to stay in this fight for moms  and for our kids, and you better believe, one day, we are going to win  this.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, let's be clear about what is going on  here. This amendment is an attempt by Republicans to derail our ability  to get this bill across the finish line and deliver for families in our  country.   Title 42 is a public health tool, and how it is used should be guided  by public health experts--looking at data, looking at science--not  politicians  [[Page S4179]]  looking to score political points or, in this case, Republicans trying  to stop a bill that lowers costs, lowers emissions, and lowers the  deficit.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5384     Mr. President, lifesaving medicines don't do any good if  people can't afford them. That is why it is so important that we do  help people get the medicine they need, especially insulin. It is  exactly why we need to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which does  take historic steps to lower costs, and it caps patients' insulin costs  at $35 a month.   If Republicans really want to help patients get insulin, they will  help us get this bill signed into law instead of trying to derail it  with amendments and trying to weaken the insulin provision Democrats  want to pass.   We are fighting to make sure that no one has to ration their insulin  and put their life at risk. I hope some Republicans will join us in  working to make this lifesaving medicine affordable and pass this  bill--hopefully soon--here today. But I do urge my colleagues to reject  this amendment so we can get to that point.    Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 1 minute prior  to the Senator from South Carolina moving to waive the Budget Act.    Mr. President, 37 million people in our country have  diabetes. And it is absolutely wrong that many of them cannot afford  the insulin they need to live. I have heard from people in my State who  risk their life and ration their insulin to make ends meet. All the  while, drug companies are jacking up prices.   The cost of insulin has tripled over the last decade, and it is not  like it is three times better. The reality is, the cost of insulin  isn't just out of control; it is devastating people and not just  seniors but workers and students and parents who are just trying to get  insulin for their kids.   We have an opportunity here to make a difference and permanently cap  insulin at $35 a month. It will save money. It will save lives. This  should not be a hard vote to cast. A budget waiver will continue  allowing people to get insulin at $35 a month.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to remove this  provision from the underlying bill.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the  pending amendment.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, let's be clear about what is going on  here. This is a procedural attempt by Republicans to derail our ability  to get this bill across the finish line and deliver for families in our  country.   It is actually outrageous that Republicans are trying to talk about  pregnancy when in this country, right now, they are forcing women to  stay pregnant no matter their circumstances, pushing cruel and extreme  abortion bans.   Republicans are now resorting to tactics like this to distract from  the fact that they don't have any serious reasons for working so hard  to oppose this bill that lowers costs, lowers emissions, and lowers the  deficit.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.    When we are facing the challenges in this country and  helping our constituents to lower costs, it is outrageous that  Republicans are trying to define pregnancy, of all things, on this  floor on this day after hours of voting on amendments.   I urge a ``no'' vote.                                Vote on Motion
