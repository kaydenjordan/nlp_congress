 Mr. President, I always laud and so appreciate the  principled leadership of the senior Senator from Rhode Island, who  never would have done what just happened on the floor when we were in  the minority. Jack Reed is always there for the troops and always there  for our national security, and I join my colleagues in showing our  appreciation. I know the Presiding Officer from New Mexico thinks the  same thing.                           Small Business Saturday    Mr. President, this weekend, we celebrated Small Business Saturday  for Ohioans. And people around the country showed their support for  local businesses in their communities by shopping local for holiday  gifts.   Small businesses and their workers drive this economy. There is  always talk on this floor about small business, but the focus is  rarely, in this body, actually on small business and their workers.  They create jobs and economic growth in our communities and the  heartland, in small towns and overlooked neighborhoods, places that  often don't get a lot of outside investment.   The stakeholders in these businesses aren't nameless, faceless  shareholders. They are our neighbors, our family members, the people  you see at church and at the grocery store, and they are vital to our  economic recovery. It is why we passed the bipartisan Paycheck  Protection Program last year. It is why Democrats and President Biden  expanded the American Rescue Plan.   Last week, I asked Ohioans on social media to tell us about their  favorite local businesses to support this holiday shopping season-- businesses that go above and beyond to help their community.   This was a little bit, Mr. President--and I have gone to the floor on  this before, and you and I have talked about this--when I post on my  website, ``What did the child tax credit mean to your family,'' and the  effusive outpouring and excitement from so many people saying this  should be the role of government. This is what really matters. That is  what we found when we posted asking people to share your stories about  favorite local businesses. I want to share a few of them.   Beth talked about Mootown Creamery in Berea. She said they are ``so  involved in the community, never say no when help is needed.''   Robin gave a shout-out.   And that is in northeast Ohio near Cleveland.   Robin gave a shout-out to Snazzies's in Oxford for local arts. That  is in southwest Ohio, north of Cincinnati, the home of Miami  University.   I would add that Berea is the home of Baldwin Wallace College too.   Sarah mentioned ``Sunset Bistro in Bowling Green. They not only  support their local community, they are devoted to honoring our  veterans''--another community with a big State university in northwest  Ohio.   Heather wrote about Let's Eat Cake in Urbana. She said: ``Owner Tina  is always doing something for the downtown business association and the  greater community.''   Donna said: ``I can't say enough about Scott, the owner of Salad  KraZe. Scott goes above and beyond to make the city of Avon Lake''--a  city on Lake Erie, just east of Lorain--``a great place to live and  raise our children.''   Loria said: ``Pouka Art & Photography in Grove City''--in central  [[Page S8777]]  Ohio--``does amazing digital printings and photography. She restores  old photographs into digital paintings.''   Tia said: ``Gemini Gems & Creations in Lancaster''--a small city  southeast of Columbus--``wonderful people who started selling out of  their home and during town events''--out of their home and during town  events--``and now finally have their own shop.''   Teresa mentioned ``Chris Fultz's sign company, Fultz Signs and his  pizza place, Bluelick General, in Lima.''   Lima just swore in this week a new mayor, Sharetta Smith, and the  mayor of Dayton, my friend Nan Whaley, attended the swearing in.   Adam mentioned the Copper Penny Salon in Pettisville.   Vickie mentioned the Charmed Farmhouse in Wellington. She said:  ``They take food drives and donate to those in town who directly help  our community. They survived shutdown and thrive still.''   Think about that: They survived and they thrive. This pandemic hit  small businesses hard. For so many of them, they are still paying their  workers and serving their communities because of PPP, because of our  work through the American Rescue Plan to get people vaccinated.   PPP has helped Ohio businesses survive. Vaccines are bringing back  customers, allowing these small businesses to thrive again.   The bipartisan infrastructure plan the President signed just last  month is going to mean investment--earlier this month. Excuse me. It is  going to mean investment in these businesses' local communities.   People in Ohio and across the country remember how after the last  economic crisis in 2008 and 2009, the biggest corporations recovered-- they always do--while large swaths of the country were left behind.   Many of these same communities have watched for decades as factories  closed, as investment dried up, as storefronts were boarded over. We  can't make that mistake again, and we are not making that mistake.   We are investing in rebuilding roads and bridges and bus and rail  systems to revitalize downtowns. We know businesses can't survive on  their own. They need safe streets and sidewalks. They need other  businesses around. They need bus stops nearby. They need customers with  money in their pockets.   As part of the American Rescue Plan, as I said earlier, we passed the  largest tax cut for working families ever. Ninety-two percent of  families in Ohio who have children under 18--92 percent of those  families--will get at least a $3,000-a-year tax cut.   It is essential that this Congress, that this Senate extend that tax  cut for at least another year. It is giving millions of Ohio families  that tax cut every single month--$250 or $300 per child every single  month. We need to make sure they continue.   We need this holiday season to commit to shopping local, and in the  Senate let's commit to protecting small business--putting small  businesses and workers at the center of our economy.   The workers who shared these--the Ohioans who shared these stories-- know the vibrancy and the dynamism and the diversity of working-class  towns in neighborhoods that Senator Portman, who is in the Chamber this  evening--that we represent. We need to get to work to invest in them.  We need to get to work to ensure that these places--Ohio's Main  Streets, America's Main Streets--are at the center of a better economy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  November 30; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4350; further, that  the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15  [[Page S8799]]  p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    If there is no further business, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate stand adjourned under the previous order following the  remarks of my colleague from Ohio.
