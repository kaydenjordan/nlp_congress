 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my friend, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but the highest respect for  my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), and I know he wants this House  to run better. But the fact of the matter is, I feel bad that he has to  defend this lousy, restrictive, indefensible process.   As I said last night in the Rules Committee, regular order in this  House is dead. The current Republican leadership has made it very clear  that they have nothing but contempt for regular order, and today's  appropriations package is only another example of that fact.   Instead of considering bills one by one, and allowing thoughtful  debate and Member input, Republican leaders decided to call up eight  appropriation bills all at once this week, and even set amendment  deadlines while Members were back in their districts for the August  work period.   Last night, in the Rules Committee, Republicans blocked 229  amendments from even coming to the floor on the four bills we are  talking about today alone. Those are Democratic and Republican ideas  that won't be heard and won't be debated. Who knows how many more they  will block on the next set of appropriation bills?   That is not the open process that we were promised by Speaker Ryan.  That is not regular order, my friends.   What is even worse than this terrible process is the substance of the  bills that are being brought before us. They are filled with funding  cuts and poison pill riders that attack women's health, attack poor  people, attack healthcare rights; repeal important financial reforms  that protect our constituents and our economy; undermine the Affordable  Care Act; make our land, air, and water dirtier; make our roads less  safe; and undermine important civil rights protections. I could go on  and on and on and on.   These bills are political documents, Mr. Speaker. They are red meat  for the Republican base which, I think, is at around 15 percent of the  American people the last time I checked. That is right, Mr. Speaker,  the majority's ideas are so unpopular that over three-quarters of the  American people disapprove of what they are doing here today. That is  not coming from any liberal or leftwing source. That poll was released  last week by FOX News, you know, the network that you guys always  watch.   We all know we will need a continuing resolution to avert a  government shutdown on October 1, so why are we wasting the House's  time on this partisan exercise when we should be dealing with the CR?   And oh, yes, we need to raise the debt ceiling, pass a budget,  continue to fund hurricane relief, and so much more we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of playing to the extremes. I am  sick and tired of this President picking a fight with a different group  of people every week, constantly trying to divide  [[Page H6680]]  Americans, rather than unite us for the common good.   And the latest target are the DREAMers. The DREAMers are our  coworkers, our relatives, our neighbors, and our children's classmates.  They have lived nearly their entire lives in America. They are part of  the very fabric of our country.   The decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or  DACA, is a cruel betrayal of their trust in the United States. It  needlessly and stupidly robs us of the enormous talents, hard work, and  ingenuity of these 800,000 young people. Ending DACA is a lose-lose  proposition for America and for us all.   President Trump vowed to show great heart in his decision and  declared that DREAMers could rest easy. That is a lie, and that is a  betrayal.   And shame on the Republican leadership of this House that has avoided  making DACA a permanent program for nearly 7 years. Shame on the  Republican Party for voting against the DREAM Act in 2010, even though  it ultimately passed the House.   Shame on the Republicans in the Senate for blocking cloture in 2010,  when it was clear that there were plenty of votes to pass the DREAM Act  then. Shame on the Republican leadership of this House for not making  DACA a permanent law when President Obama first initiated the program  in 2012.   Shame on the House Republican leadership for failing to take up the  Senate-passed comprehensive immigration bill for the past 4 years,  which included DACA and a pathway to permanent residency and  citizenship for the DREAMers and so many other immigrants caught in  legal limbo in our country.   Shame on the Republican leadership for being such political cowards  that they have failed time and time again to actually demonstrate  leadership and resolve these problems.   800,000 young people, who are totally American in every way that  matters, put their trust in the United States Government and in us here  in this Congress, not just to protect them, but to be proud of them.  They have been cruelly betrayed.   The memo issued yesterday by the Department of Homeland Security even  says that they should be prepared to pack their bags and be deported to  their countries of origin. But, Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is,  America is their home.   It is unconscionable that the President pardoned radical racist  Sheriff Arpaio, who actually is a criminal, while punishing 800,000  law-abiding, hardworking DREAMers.   I stand with the CEO of Microsoft and hundreds of other business  leaders who said to the President: ``To deport a DREAMer, you'll have  to go through us.''   I stand with the thousands of religious leaders, college and  university presidents, mayors, State attorneys general, and civic  leaders who demand that we reject the President's decision and have  Congress pass the DREAM Act immediately. This Congress cannot and must  not continue to fail these 800,000 young people.    This morning, this House passed emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey. A  DREAMer died in Houston attempting to rescue victims of the  floodwaters. Another DREAMer, who is a Houston paramedic, and who  worked night and day in rescue and relief efforts, just found out  yesterday that his country, the only country he has ever known, has  turned its back on him. Well, I refuse to turn my back.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the DREAMers need a permanent  legislative fix. We can do that this very day. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Roybal-Allard's bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM  Act. It is time to do what is right.   You know, earlier today, Speaker Ryan said: Well, we have time to  work this out. Really?   The Speaker seems totally content to have 800,000 people continue to  live with uncertainty and fear. I think that that is sad and that is  cruel.   He also said: We need to develop some sort of compromise.   I don't know what he is thinking about. Maybe he is thinking about  trying to add more border security money or add this stupid wall that  the President keeps on talking about.   Well, here's the deal. There is nothing to compromise on. You either  support the DREAMers or you don't. They are not political pawns. They  are people like you and me and our kids. They deserve better from us.  Stop screwing around with their lives.   Defeat the previous question. We can pass the DREAM Act today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my good friend from Oklahoma, who  I respect a great deal, that if he wants to defend this process, he can  go right ahead and do so. But I think most people watching this, the  fact that two-thirds of all discretionary Federal spending is going to  be decided in, like, a week's time, I don't think is a good process,  and I don't think it is one that the American people have much  confidence in.   I don't think it is reasonable to expect that any Member, really, has  read all 1,305 pages of the eight bills that my friend is bringing to  the floor, and I am not sure everybody has had time to read all the 970  amendments that were proposed--many of them that were not made in order  by the Rules Committee. So this is not a process I think anybody wants  to defend.   The final point I want to make with regard to the President's  decision on DACA, as the gentleman knows, this Congress and the  previous Congresses could have acted on this any time they wanted to.  When the Democrats were in control here in the House, we did. We passed  the DREAM Act. Unfortunately, many of you wouldn't support it, but it  actually passed the House, and we had Republican obstructionism in the  Senate.   Now, if you want a legislative fix, we have the solution for you.  Vote ``no'' on the previous question, and we will bring up Ms. Roybal- Allard's bill to pass the DREAM Act. We will get this done today. We  will actually have a day of consequence where we are doing something to  help people in this country.   So, Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat  the previous question. We will then offer Representative Roybal- Allard's bipartisan, bicameral bill, H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act.                                time  1445    The legislation would help thousands of young people like the ones  whose heroic stories my colleagues will highlight today and who are  Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 18  evangelical religious leaders and other religious leaders in opposition  to President Trump's decision to end DACA.                                                  September 4, 2017.   A Letter From Faith Leaders and Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration                                   (.Com)       President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,      Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.        Honorable President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell and       Speaker Ryan: We agree that immigration reform and DACA are       difficult subjects. God loves the foreigner. Indeed, God       loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy       and justice by which a nation thrives.        It is easier to speak publically of mercy, as we, and many,       do. And, while loving mercy, who will also stand for justice       to those citizens who cannot find a job due to cheaper       foreign labor? Who will speak of the real cost of illegal       immigration to our states? And while many non-citizens are       good neighbors, who will stand for justice for Americans       victimized by people here illegally who do not uphold our       values and laws? And who will prevent more needless crime and       death?        The Church is called to serve all people, and our       Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the       Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic       stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected       officials, responsibility to oaths must prevail. Law and       order sustain stability and peace. A nation of wise rule       grows strong enough to sustain care for the vulnerable in our       midst.        While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open       borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of       Scripture. We find that the Bible does not teach open       borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful       foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s       Ruth and Rahab) We also find Nehemiah building walls to       protect citizens from harm. In Isaiah 1, we see God       condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture.        All lives matter. The lives of North, Central and South       Americans matter. The lives of Africans, Asians, Europeans       and people from the Middle East matter. In Scripture, we       learn that God placed us each in a family, a land, an epic       story of creation, the fall and redemption. The Bible       envisions a world of beautiful and unique nations, not a       stateless ``open society'' run by global oligarchs. Each of       us is called to be a blessing where God has placed us in the       world.        In policy decisions ahead, while treating undocumented       people kindly, we ask that you would first and foremost honor       often forgotten American citizens whose families have served       our nation for many generations, and the patient people who       have applied lawfully to come here and to become citizens of       the United States. These lives also matter. These people also       dream. Gratefully Yours,        Names are listed alphabetically and for identification       purposes only.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by  20 State attorneys general in strong opposition to what the President  has done.                                                State of California,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                      Sacramento, CA, July 21, 2017.      Re June 29, 2017 letter from Ken Paxton re Texas, et al., v.           United States, et al., Case No. 1:14-cv-00254 (S.D.           Tex.).       Hon. Donald J. Trump,      President of the United States, The White House, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. President: We write to urge you to maintain and       defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or       DACA, which represents a success story for the more than       three-quarters of a million ``Dreamers'' who are currently       registered for it. It has also been a boon to the       communities, universities, and employers with which these       Dreamers are connected, and for the American economy as a       whole.        Since 2012, nearly 800,000 young immigrants who were       brought to this country as children have been granted DACA       after completing applications, submitting to and passing a       background check, and applying for a work permit. In the case       of young adults granted DACA, they are among our newest       soldiers, college graduates, nurses and first responders.       They are our neighbors, coworkers, students and community and       church leaders. And they are boosting the economies and       communities of our states every day. In fact, receiving DACA       has increased recipients' hourly wages by an average of 42       percent and given them the purchasing power to buy homes,       cars and other goods and services, which drives economic       growth for all.        In addition to strengthening our states and country, DACA       gives these bright, driven young people the peace of mind and       stability to earn a college degree and to seek employment       that matches their education and training. The protection       afforded by DACA gives them dignity and the ability to fully       pursue the American dream. For many, the United States is the       only country they have ever known.        The consequences of rescinding DACA would be severe, not       just for the hundreds of thousands of young people who rely       on the program--and for their employers, schools,       universities, and families--but for the country's economy as       a whole. For example, in addition to lost tax revenue,       American businesses would face billions in turnover costs, as       employers would lose qualified workers whom they have trained       and in whom they have invested. And as the chief law officers       of our respective states, we strongly believe that DACA has       made our communities safer, enabling these young people to       report crimes to police without fear of deportation.        You have repeatedly expressed your support for Dreamers.       Today, we join together to urge you not to capitulate to the       demands Texas and nine other states set forth in their June       29, 2017, letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. That       letter demands, under threat of litigation, that your       Administration end the DACA initiative. The arguments set       forth in that letter are wrong as a matter of law and policy.        There is broad consensus that the young people who qualify       for DACA should not be prioritized for deportation DACA is       consistent with a long pattern of presidential exercises of       prosecutorial discretion that targeted resources in a       constitutional manner. Indeed, as Justice Antonin Scalia       recognized in a 1999 opinion, the Executive has a long       history of ``engaging in a regular practice . . . of       exercising [deferred action] for humanitarian reasons or       simply for its own convenience.'' Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-      Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483-84 (1999). DACA       sensibly guides immigration officials' exercise of their       enforcement discretion and reserves limited resources to       address individuals who threaten our communities, not those       who contribute greatly to them.  [[Page H6686]]         Challenges have been brought against the original DACA       program, including in the Fifth Circuit, but none have       succeeded. On the other hand, in a case relating to Arizona's       efforts to deny drivers' licenses to DACA recipients, the       Ninth Circuit stated that it is ``well settled that the [DHS]       Secretary can exercise deferred action.'' Ariz Dream Act       Coalition v Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 967-968 (9th Cir. 2017).       The court also observed that ``several prior administrations       have adopted programs, like DACA, to prioritize which       noncitizens to remove.'' Id. at 976.        As the Fifth Circuit was careful to point out in its ruling       in the Texas case, the Deferred Action for Parents of       Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (``DAPA'')       initiative that was struck down is ``similar'' but ``not       identical'' to DACA. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134,       174 (5th Cir. 2015). Indeed, as DHS Secretary Kelly pointed       out in a press conference the day after his June 15       memorandum explaining that DACA would continue, DACA and DAPA       are ``two separate issues,'' appropriately noting the       different populations addressed by each program. Notably,       only a fraction of the 25 states which joined with Texas in       the DAPA case before the Supreme Court chose to co-sign the       letter threatening to challenge DACA.        Among other significant differences, DACA has been       operative since 2012 while DAPA never went into effect. More       than three-quarters of a million young people, and their       employers, among others, have concretely benefitted from       DACA, for up to five years. The interests of these young       people in continuing to participate in DACA and retain the       benefits that flow from DACA raise particular concerns not       implicated in the pre-implementation challenge to DAPA.       Further, the Fifth Circuit placed legal significance on the       ``economic and political magnitude'' of the large number of       immigrants who were affected by DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 181;       thus, it is notable that many fewer people have received DACA       (about 800,000) than would have been eligible for DAPA (up to       4.3 million).        One additional, but related, issue concerns DHS's current       practices regarding DACA recipients. A number of troubling       incidents in recent months raise serious concerns over       whether DHS agents are adhering to DACA guidelines and your       repeated public assurances that DACA-eligible individuals are       not targets for arrest and deportation. We urge you to ensure       compliance with DACA and consistent enforcement practices       towards Dreamers.        Mr. President, now is the time to affirm the commitment you       made, both to the ``incredible kids'' who benefit from DACA       and to their families and our communities, to handle this       issue ``with heart.'' You said Dreamers should ``rest easy.''       We urge you to affirm America's values and tradition as a       nation of immigrants and make clear that you will not only       continue DACA, but that you will defend it. The cost of not       doing so would be too high for America, the economy, and for       these young people. For these reasons, we urge you to       maintain and defend DACA, and we stand in support of the       effort to defend DACA by all appropriate means.            Sincerely,          Xavier Becerra, California Attorney General; George             Jepsen, Connecticut Attorney General; Matthew Denn,             Delaware Attorney General; Karl A. Racine, District of             Columbia Attorney General; Douglas S. Chin, Hawaii             Attorney General; Lisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney             General; Tom Miller, Iowa Attorney General; Janet T.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the gentleman neglected to  mention that there were 227 amendments, Democratic and Republican  amendments, that were denied yesterday. The frustration that we have  over here is that we are going through an exercise with these  appropriations bills knowing that they are going nowhere and that we  are going to have to deal with a short-term continuing resolution,  [[Page H6687]]  and there will probably be a big omnibus that will be passed at the end  and which might not reflect any of the deliberations that we are doing  on the appropriations matters in the next couple of days.   It is a little bit frustrating because we have other things to do.  What we are saying is let's make this week a week of consequence, and  let us bring up the DREAM Act.   President Trump did something horrible yesterday. He basically pulled  the rug right from underneath 800,000 good, decent, and law-abiding  people, citizens in this country, good people who are American in every  way except they don't have a piece of paper. They were brought here, in  many instances, when they were infants. They now have businesses, are  leading relief efforts in Texas, and serve in our military. And he  pulled the rug right from underneath them all. It is a cruel, awful,  and nasty thing to do.   Listening to the rationale of this White House, this kind of  schizophrenic tirade that we have seen unfold where 1 minute he is  against the DREAMers, then he loves the DREAMers, then he is against  the DREAMers, then he loves them, all of this kind of rambling that we  have seen out of the White House hasn't changed the fact that he has  thrown 800,000 lives in turmoil. People now have to live in fear and in  uncertainty, and it is just a rotten thing to do. What we are saying is  let's fix it.   My friends say they didn't like what President Obama did through  executive order. We tried to legislate. We did, in 2010, pass the DREAM  Act here in the House. Republicans did their best to make sure we  couldn't bring it to the floor in the Senate, but we tried that way.  Then President Obama, thank goodness, stepped up to the plate and put  forward an executive order which has protected 800,000 people.   My friends say that they like the DREAMers and they want to help  them. Well, let's help them. You guys are in charge. You can do  anything you want. All we are asking for is a vote--that is it, a vote.  The way we can ensure a vote is to defeat the previous question so we  can bring up the DREAM Act.   If you don't have the courage to bring it up yourself, then vote to  defeat the previous question and we will bring it to the floor. We will  have the debate, and you can vote any way you want.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my friend doesn't like words like  ``cruel'' when it comes to the President's actions with regard to the  DREAMers.   A man named Jesus Contreras, a Houston paramedic, helped rescue flood  victims after the storm, Harvey, hit Texas. Now he faces deportation if  stripped of his DACA protections. I don't know what you call that. I  call it cruel. I can't imagine why anybody would want to take away this  man's ability to be able to live his life in the only country he knows,  a man who is saving lives.   This is just one of many stories. We are telling these stories  because we are hoping that maybe it might move some of my friends on  the other side of the aisle. Maybe it might move the leadership to  allow us to schedule a vote and actually fix this and remove the level  of uncertainty and fear that, now, 800,000 people have to deal with  because of what the President did yesterday and because of the  inaction, over the years, of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) for  the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article about  Alonso Guillen, a DREAMer who died trying to rescue Harvey flood  victims.                     [From the LA Times, Sept. 4, 2017]            `Dreamer' Dies Trying To Rescue Harvey Flood Victims                         (By Molly Hennessy-Fiske)         Alonso Guillen drove more than 100 miles south from his       home in Lukfin, Texas, last week, determined to help those       trapped by Hurricane Harvey flooding in the Houston area.        But he and another man disappeared after their boat       capsized in a flood-swollen creek Wednesday, and relatives       began searching for their bodies.        On Friday, searchers found the body of Tomas Carreon, 25,       of Lufkin. On Sunday, relatives spotted Guillen's body.        ``He was floating in the water,'' his brother Jesus       Guillen, 36, a Lufkin truck driver, said in Spanish during a       phone interview.        Luis Ortega, 22, of Lufkin, who survived the boat accident,       told searchers the men had been swept away by a powerful       current. Ortega barely escaped by grabbing a floating gas       tank, then a tree.        Relatives said Guillen, a Mexican national, was a       ``Dreamer'' enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood       Arrivals program, which President Trump is said to be poised       to scrap, though he may leave it intact for six months to       give Congress time to find a legislative solution. (Ortega is       a U.S. citizen, as was Carreon, Guillen's brother said.)        Guillen moved to Lufkin at age 14 from just across the       border in Piedras Negras, Mexico. He later graduated from       Lufkin High School, attended St. Patrick's Catholic Church,       worked in construction and at a local club, Rodeo Disko, and       radio station, SuperMix 101.9 FM.        He was known as ``DJ Ocho,'' who mixed country and hip-hop,       followed Texans football and the Houston Astros, played       softball and soccer, sported Cowboy hats and red, white and       blue sunglasses.        He used the station to organize fundraisers for those in       need. ``It didn't matter what situation it was,'' said friend       Linda Alvarez.        Guillen masterminded the rescue trip to the Houston area       just like one of his radio station fundraisers: on the fly,       with friends' help. After the storm hit, they borrowed a boat       and drove south to save strangers.        Like many in Texas, Guillen's family has mixed immigration       status and is divided by the border. His mother, a Mexican       national, still lives in Piedras Negras, Mexico, with one of       his brothers. His father is a legal resident, and his brother       Jesus is a U.S. citizen.        Alonso Guillen applied for DACA, an Obama-era program that       protected from deportation about 800,000 immigrants brought       to the country illegally as children. He applied because so       many of his family and friends were in the U.S., and that's       where he saw his future, his brother said.        ``His dream was to open a restaurant, something the whole       family could enjoy and where they could come together,'' his       brother said.        ``He was trying; he was always updated with the news about       the Dreamer program.  [[Page H6690]]       He was ready to get it fixed and done,'' friend Manny Muniz       said of Guillen's immigration status.        Muniz, a fellow disc jockey, met Guillen a few years ago in       the midst of a more minor crisis: He had booked a gig and       didn't have any speakers. Guillen lent him some, and they       started working together.        After the storm struck, Guillen started posting weather       reports on Facebook.        Early last week Guillen told Muniz he was headed to       Houston, ``to go save lives, go help people, volunteer his       time.''        Muniz said part of the reason Guillen applied for DACA and       wanted to become a legal resident was that he longed to be       able to cross the border legally to visit Mexico, especially       his hometown.        Instead, Guillen will be buried this week in Lufkin. He is       survived by an 8-year-old daughter, Mariana, who lives in       Guanajuato, Mexico, his brother said.        Guillen's family is planning his funeral at St. Patrick's       Catholic Church. Guillen's mother may not be allowed to       attend. The U.S. government has not granted her permission to       cross the border for the service, relatives said.        ``We hope that she can come, that they allow her to come,''       said Jesus Guillen's 14-year-old daughter, Zorayda.        U.S. Customs and Border Protection tweeted condolences to       Guillen's family Monday, calling him ``a rescue volunteer who       died during Hurricane Harvey'' and promising to allow       Guillen's mother to cross the border to attend his funeral.        Jesus Guillen said he hopes the DACA program will not be       dismantled.        ``It gives people like my brother opportunities to be       better, to have strength and believe in themselves and become       what they want to be,'' he said.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to  Members of Congress from The United States Conference of Mayors  strongly objecting to what the President did.                                                   The United States                                            Conference of Mayors,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2017.      An Open Letter to the Congress on Dreamers from America's           Mayors         Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the       U.S. Senate: We write on behalf of the nation's mayors to       urge you to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that would       enable Dreamers--people who have lived in America since they       were children and built their lives here--to earn lawful       permanent residence and eventually American citizenship if       they meet certain criteria. We pledge to work with you in       this effort and to do whatever we can to assist you in seeing       it enacted into law.        This June at the 85th Annual Meeting of The United States       Conference of Mayors, we adopted strong policy supporting       permanent legal status for Dreamers and extension of the DACA       program We did this because it is the right thing to do--for       Dreamers, for our communities and for our country.        DACA has benefitted nearly 800,000 undocumented youth since       it began in 2012. With work authorization and without the       fear of deportation, these young people, who have done       nothing illegal, have been able to participate in and       contribute to our country, our cities and the nation's       economy:        Eighty-seven percent of DACA recipients are employed by       American businesses, and six percent have started their own       businesses, leading to higher wages and better economic       outcomes.        DACA recipients contribute 15.3 percent of their wages to       taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, and DACA       recipients are investing in assets like houses, and starting       new businesses, bringing significant tax revenue to cities       and states.        It is expected that DACA recipients will contribute $9.9       billion in tax contributions over the next four years, and at       least $433.4 billion to our gross domestic product (GDP) over       the next decade.        There is broad public support for Dreamers:        Sixty-four percent of Americans support letting       ``Dreamers'' remain in the U.S.        Seventy-one percent of Americans feel undocumented       immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to       apply for legal status.        Seventy-five percent of Americans who voted for the       President support Dreamers.        Because of the Trump Administration's decision to terminate       DACA in six months, this legislation must be passed as       quickly as possible so that the benefits to Dreamers, to our       cities, and to our nation can continue. It would remove       Dreamers' fears of deportation and allow them to contribute       even more to the country they love, which for many is the       only country they have known. They would be able to reach       their full potential in many ways, including serving in the       military. The U.S. Conference of Mayors pledges to work with       you to make this happen.            Sincerely,      Mitchell J. Landrieu,        Mayor of New Orleans, President.      Eric Garcetti,        Mayor of Los Angeles, Chair, USCM Latino Alliance.      Jorge Elorza,        Mayor of Providence, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task       Force.      Tom Tait,        Mayor of Anaheim, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task Force.      John Giles,        Mayor of Mesa, Trustee.      Tom Cochran,        CEO and Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, next, I include in the Record an article  that appeared on the National Public Radio web page, entitled,  ``Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport a DREAMer, You'll Have to Go  Through Us.''                         [From NPR, Sept. 5, 2017]   Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport A DREAMer, You'll Have To Go                                 Through Us         America's business leaders are speaking out against       President Trump's move to end DACA.        The president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, took a notable       stand. He said not only will his company lobby for a       legislative solution but also that Microsoft is calling on       Congress to make immigration the top priority, before tax       reform. And he is calling on other business leaders to follow       suit.        ``There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly       for Congress to act on,'' Smith said in an interview with       NPR. ``We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax       reform bill. The entire business community cares about a tax       reform. And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill       needs to be set aside until the DREAMers are taken care of.       They have a deadline that expires in six months. Tax reform       can wait.''        Smith also said if the government moves to deport DREAMers       who are Microsoft employees, ``it's going to have to go       through us to get that person.''        This is the second time in a week that Smith has spoken       out. Last Thursday, Smith and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella       both issued statements calling on the administration to       preserve DACA. Nadella, a first-generation immigrant from       India, struck a personal note: ``I am a product of two       uniquely American attributes: the ingenuity of American       technology reaching me where I was growing up, fueling my       dreams, and the enlightened immigration policy that allowed       me to pursue my dreams.''        Meanwhile, in a letter to employees this morning, Apple CEO       Tim Cook said more than 250 Apple workers are affected by the       DACA repeal and that he has been hearing from them all       weekend.        ``I want to assure you that Apple will work with members of       Congress from both parties to advocate for a legislative       solution that provides permanent protections for all the       Dreamers in our country,'' Cook said.        Dozens of CEOs including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed       Hastings from Netflix, Randall Stephenson from AT&T and Tim       Sloan of Wells Fargo wrote a letter addressed to the       president asking him to preserve the program.        The leaders argued that all DACA recipients grew up in       America and give back to the community and pay income taxes.       They said: ``More than 97 percent are in school or in the       workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent       have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their       first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500       companies count DACA recipients among their employees.''        In a public post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said about       Trump's announcement: ``This is a sad day for our country''       and that he and his immigration advocacy vehicle at Fwd.US       will be ``doing even more in the weeks ahead to make sure       Dreamers have the protections they deserve.''        Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google (an arm of Alphabet), did       not make quite the same commitment on Twitter. But he took a       moral stand, writing, ``Dreamers are our neighbors, our       friends and our co-workers. This is their home. Congress       needs to act now to #DefendDACA. #WithDreamers.''        When President Trump was first elected, leaders in the tech       industry were reluctant to criticize campaign pledges of his       that went against their values and interests. They took a       wait-and-see approach and grappled with how to be a       successful multinational in an increasingly nationalistic       world. Tuesday morning's outpouring illustrates a clear shift       in business leaders' willingness to speak out against       decisions by the administration.        Microsoft's Smith says in the beginning of 2017, business       leaders looked around and wondered how they would navigate       this new unpredictable environment. They feared being       attacked by the commander in chief on social media. Now,       Smith says, ``I don't think people get up in the morning       worrying about tweets. We have much bigger problems to worry       about than that.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over  500 business leaders in support of DACA who oppose what the President  did yesterday and who are upset at Congress for its inaction.   [[Page H6691]]                 Open Letter From Leaders of American Industry on DACA        August 31, 2017       To: President Donald J Trump       To: Speaker Paul Ryan; Leader Nancy Pelosi; Leader Mitch           McConnell; and Leader Charles E. Schumer         As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned       about new developments in immigration policy that threaten       the future of young undocumented immigrants brought to       America as children.         The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,       which allows nearly 800,000 Dreamers the basic opportunity to       work and study without the threat of deportation, is in       jeopardy. All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered       with our government, submitted to extensive background       checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and       paying income taxes. More than 97 percent are in school or in       the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65       percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have       purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25       Fortune 500 companies count DACA recipients among their       employees.         Unless we act now to preserve the DACA program, all       780,000 hardworking young people will lose their ability to       work legally in this country, and every one of them will be       at immediate risk of deportation. Our economy would lose       $460.3 billion from the national GDP and $24.6 billion in       Social Security and Medicare tax contributions. Dreamers are       vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With       them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will       continue to have a global competitive advantage.        We call on President Trump to preserve the DACA program. We       call on Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act or       legislation that provides these young people raised in our       country the permanent solution they deserve.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  signed by over 1,300 Catholic educators who call on President Trump and  his administration to save DACA and protect the DREAMers.     [From Faith in Public Life, Ignatian Solidarity Network, and the                                  Jesuits]  Over 1,300 Catholic Educators Call on Trump Administration to Save DACA                            and Protect Dreamers         Dear Gen. Kelly: As educators at Catholic institutions, we       write to convey profound concern for our vulnerable immigrant       students. In your new position as Chief of Staff, you are now       one of the most prominent Catholics in the Administration.       Your direct line to President Trump and recent experience as       Secretary of Homeland Security provides an opportunity for       you to be an influential champion for the children and youth       who are the next generation of American leaders. We ask that       you protect the dignity of our nation's immigrant youth by       advocating for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals       (DACA) program until Congress passes the Dream Act.        We stand with our students who are DACA beneficiaries.       Their perseverance, hard work and hopefulness is an example       to us as teachers. We witness the obstacles they overcome       each day as they pursue their dream of a better life for       themselves and their families. In facing adversity and       uncertainty with grace and hope, they embody the best of our       schools, our country and the Catholic tradition.        It is a moral and policy failure when our government       targets children and young adults who simply aspire to live       the American dream. Breaking up families and communities       undermines the best values of our nation.        Bishop Joe S. Vasquez, Chair of the Migration Committee at       the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bishop of Austin,       Texas, said recently in a statement.        ``These young people entered the U.S. as children and know       America as their only home. The dignity of every human being,       particularly that of our children and youth, must be       protected.''        We join Bishop Vasquez in urging you to uphold the DACA       program. On several occasions, you have expressed that you       would not make changes to DACA. We strongly encourage you to       maintain DACA as an essential program for the well-being of       young people and our communities.        Please know we are praying that you use your power       prudently and that we remain committed to constructive       dialogue.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire how much time I have remaining, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, with regard to the underlying bill that is being  brought before the House today, a whole bunch of appropriations bills  bunched together in an unprecedented way and, I would say, in an  undemocratic way as well--nobody has had a chance to read these bills,  over 1,300 pages--I don't think anybody in this Chamber has read them  all.   Close to 1,000 amendments were submitted. They were all asked to be  submitted before we came back into session while people were still on  work recess. I don't think Members have had a chance to review all of  the amendments. As I said, hundreds of good amendments have already  been rejected.   Last night in the Rules Committee, I invoked Senator John McCain's  name. He recently wrote a piece in which he called upon Congress to go  back to regular order. I agree with him. We ought to go back to regular  order. That is what the Speaker of the House promised when he took the  gavel, we would have regular order. This is not regular order. This is  not the way we should decide spending matters.   I will tell you right now that there will be lots of mistakes in this  legislation that is being rushed through--if it even goes anywhere-- because we are now being told we are going to have to do a continuing  resolution, and chances are we are going to end up having to do a long- term spending bill. But process matters, and when you bunch things  together and when you rush things like this, mistakes are made.   As I said in my opening, we are going to ask for people to vote  ``no'' on the previous question. If you vote ``no'' on the previous  question, I will offer an amendment to bring up Representative Roybal- Allard's bill, which is the DREAM Act, which would actually solve the  dilemma that we face. It would solve the dilemma that 800,000 good  people in this country are now facing as a result of President Trump's  cruel decision yesterday to repeal DACA, to end DACA.   These are people who, as you have heard from all my colleagues as  they have told their stories, are working in this country. They are  leading efforts to rescue people in hurricane-ravaged Texas. They are  paramedics and they serve in our military.                                time  1530    These are good people. This is their country. They were brought here  as infants. This is the only country they know. The fact that we are  treating these good people in such a terrible way, every one of us  should be ashamed. That is not who we are. We keep on saying that every  time the White House does something else that we find offensive. We  keep on saying: That is not who we are; that is not who we are.   Well, at some point, we have to prove it. We have to show it.   If we believe DREAMers are a valuable part of our community, then we  need to protect them. This is a way to do it today. There is no need  for compromise and more discussion. It is very simple: you either  support the DREAMers or you don't. That is it. That is the only  question at hand. If you want to load it up with all kinds of other  extraneous materials, that is not a fair thing to do. That is not what  these people deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are  hearing from their constituents. I know they are hearing from their  churches, synagogues, and mosques that we need to protect these people.  Well, let's do it. The DREAMers don't need your words. They don't need  your sympathies. They don't need your empathy. They need your vote.   We have an opportunity today, by voting ``no'' on the previous  question, to have a vote today on whether to protect the DREAMers. It  is that simple. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side have  spoken very eloquently about the DREAMers. If you mean it, then give us  your vote. If you mean it, do less talking and give us the vote. That  is what we are asking for today.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let us help these great people.  Let us help these people who have been such a valuable part of our  community. Let us treat them with the dignity and respect that they  deserve. Let us recognize that they view this country as their home. We  should view this country as their home as well.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question. If that doesn't work, then vote  ``no'' on this lousy rule.  [[Page H6692]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
