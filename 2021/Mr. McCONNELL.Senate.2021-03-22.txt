 Mr. President, on Thursday, the Biden administration  officials had their first person-to-person meeting with representatives  from the People's Republic of China. By diplomatic standards, the  opening public exchange was tense. The belligerent grandstanding by PRC  diplomats was, unfortunately, no surprise. It is what we have come to  expect.   As China's military and economic might have grown, Beijing has found  that the bullying tactics that people call their ``wolf warrior''  diplomatic strategy have often worked out for them. So I was glad the  U.S. team used the opportunity to cut through the CCP's spin and tell  some plain truths about China's regional bullying and disrespect for  the rule of law, whether in Hong Kong or Tibet.   I am also glad the administration has sent U.S. personnel to join  other diplomats in Beijing to protest the secret trial of Canadian  citizen Michael Kovrig.   But like I said last week, calling out China rhetorically is just the  first step. An effective U.S. strategy will require more than just  tough talk and symbolism.   The PRC poses all matter of threats to the United States and to the  free world. They want to control crucial sea lanes in the South China  Sea. They want to expand their capabilities to menace other countries'  forces, including ours, with increasingly accurate long-range weapons.  They want to rewrite the rules of the international system to suit  their interests instead of ours and our friends.   These are hard and real challenges. Facing them down will require  strength and resolve from the United States and from our partners. So  like I said last week, if the administration is serious about staying  tough on China and strengthening our hand, they will have support among  Senate Republicans.   But any such serious strategy will need to start with maintaining and  building up the backbone of our hard power--the competitive edge of the  U.S. military. To defend America, defend America's interests, and deter  adversaries, we need to sustain our military edge. And to sustain our  edge, we need to modernize our forces and maintain our capability to  project power.   Defense spending is the single most important policy lever available  to us in our competition with China. The President's budget submission  will tell Beijing a lot about whether the Biden administration intends  to back up tough talk with actual strength.   Finally, whatever Congress may do to step up our game on China, it  will be essential that it be bipartisan. The legislative components of  national security should not swing wildly every time the gavels change  hands.  [[Page S1662]]    It is a perfect demonstration of why scrapping the 60-vote threshold  for legislation would be catastrophic. For important bills to have a  stable and lasting impact, they need broad bipartisan buy-in.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on a completely different matter,  this afternoon the Senate will vote on the President's nominee to head  the Department of Labor.   I will be voting against confirming Mr. Walsh. The Biden  administration has already signaled they will ask him to implement a  variety of policies that do not serve the long-term interests of  American workers.   Unfortunately, it appears that won't just be the case at the  Department of Labor but throughout the Democratic agenda.   One of the President's first acts in office was to kill thousands of  American jobs, including union jobs, by canceling the Keystone XL  Pipeline. Both, working Americans and domestic energy security, took a  back seat to a leftwing signaling.   We are hearing that the next few months might bring a so-called  ``infrastructure'' proposal that may actually be a Trojan horse for  massive tax hikes and other job-killing, leftwing policies.   Remember, the House Democrats tipped their hand last year. They  published a sprawling proposal that pretended to be a highway bill but  was really just a multithousand-page cousin of the Green New Deal. It  would have plowed unbelievable sums of money not into the kinds of big,  practical projects that Americans even think of as ``infrastructure''  but also into their obsessive focus on climate policies to the  exclusion of everything else.   Look, we know what kinds of policies are actually pro-job and pro- worker. We know what kind of agenda helps American workers build all- American prosperity up and down the income scale.   We know that because, just over a year ago, before the pandemic, 4  years of Republican policies had built one of the most inclusive and  optimistic economies in modern history. Wages were growing faster at  the bottom than at the top. Unemployment was at historic lows. American  workers were a hot commodity and were getting compensated accordingly.   Pro-worker prosperity does not entail having Big Government  politicians or Big Labor bosses micromanage every aspect of the economy  to suit liberal fads. It means remembering what kind of pro-worker,  pro-growth, pro-opportunity policies built the best job market in  recent history right before this pandemic.   Those are the ideas and the solutions that were unlocking more money  and more opportunities for American workers before COVID-19 took the  world by storm. And those are the ideas and solutions the American  people elected 50 Republican Senators to fight for.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, Kentucky is home to many talented  artists. They capture our heritage with color, movement, and language.  Their creativity offers inspiration and makes us proud to call the  Bluegrass home. Today, I would like to recognize my friend Cornelia  Dozier Cooper, one of these gifted Kentuckians, who continues to awe  our Commonwealth with her vision, generosity, and leadership. Cornelia  was recently recognized by her hometown with a Distinguished Community  Service Award. It is a privilege to join her many fans in sharing my  hearty congratulations.   Cornelia moved to Pulaski County in Southeastern Kentucky six decades  ago. Instantly, in her words, she ``fell in love.'' The breathtaking  landscapes fill her imagination and fuel her art. Cornelia skillfully  captures the region's beauty and the distinct character of its people  in her watercolor. She brings joy and appreciation to all those who  have viewed her work. I am proud to count myself among them. In 2019,  Cornelia received the Milner Award, our Commonwealth's highest artistic  honor, in tribute to her mastery of the brush and her devotion to her  craft.   Kentucky's traditions are reflected in Cornelia's artwork as well as  in her philanthropy and service. She has helped found and continues to  support numerous local organizations to foster artistic expression.  After receiving a donation of books from the Carnegie Library, Cornelia  knocked on doors around Somerset to gather support for the area's first  library. Her own endowment provides grants to aspiring performers and  artists in the Lake Cumberland area. As an enthusiastic mentor and a  compassionate friend, Cornelia has singlehandedly led a new generation  of budding artists to find their own inspiration in the hills of  Southeastern Kentucky.   Even beyond the brush, Cornelia has brought beauty to her community.  In Somerset's Fountain Square--which hosts a statue of Cornelia's  brother-in-law, Kentucky Senator John Sherman Cooper--she has taken  personal responsibility for planting flowers and leading renovations.  She is driven to make the square a source of collective pride.  Cornelia's influence on the local creative community is difficult to  overstate, and it will continue for years to come.   My friend continues to create well into her nineties. She has lifted  this entire community with grace and art. It is a privilege to once  again thank Cornelia for sharing her talents across Kentucky. She has  earned this award and our sincere praise. I encourage all my Senate  colleagues to join me in congratulating Cornelia Cooper on a lifetime  of distinction and success.                            ____________________
