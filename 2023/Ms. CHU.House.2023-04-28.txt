 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.  Democrats successfully passed America's single largest investment in  clean and renewable energy last year in the Inflation Reduction Act,  which will quickly decarbonize our economy and shift manufacturing back  here to the U.S. That includes production of solar panels that will be  critical to the clean energy transition.   Last year, the Commerce Department made a thorough and data-driven  determination that some companies in four Southeast Asian countries are  circumventing U.S. tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Our trade policy  requires balance, and the President's emergency order created a short- term bridge to secure the solar materials needed to protect jobs and  meet our energy transition goods over the next year.   While the emergency order is not perfect, it is necessary to give  solar projects in the pipeline enough time to come into full compliance  with our trade laws.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
