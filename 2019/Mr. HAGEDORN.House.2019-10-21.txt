 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for yielding  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4405, the Women's  Business Centers Improvements Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Davids, for  sponsoring this bill, introducing it, and inviting me to co-author it.  I appreciate her leadership on this.   This bipartisan legislation works to support women entrepreneurs  nationwide by modernizing and strengthening the Women's Business  Centers program. Our bill will increase access to training, counseling,  assistance programs, capital, and workforce investment. All these  measures are essential to create new businesses, expand enterprises,  and grow our United States economy.   Millions of women own small businesses in the United States, and that  is a wonderful thing. Entrepreneurship and the Women's Business Center  program are essential for empowering women to become business owners.  By enhancing these services, we increase the ability to inspire and  foster new generations of business leaders.   Small business is the job-producing backbone of our American economy.  Whether you are in southern Minnesota, eastern Kansas, or communities  across our Nation, it is critical that we foster an environment of  growth where entrepreneurs of all stripes have access to the resources  they need to succeed and are not stymied by excessive regulations,  taxes, and other antibusiness burdens.   According to the National Association of Women Business Owners, as of  2017, more than 11.6 million firms are owned and operated by women.  These firms employ almost 9 million people and generate $1.7 trillion  in revenue.   To keep our economy growing, we must embrace, encourage, and promote  emerging enterprises, including those owned by folks who do not fit the  traditional mode of business owners to get started.   One of the great success stories that we have in women  entrepreneurship is that of Christine Lantinen and her candy company in  Minnesota's First District out of Le Center, Minnesota. The company is  called Maud Borup.   In May I had the opportunity to tour the 112-year-old wholesale  confections company that specializes in gourmet candy, baking kits,  food kits, and lots of other things, including gummy bears, the best I  have ever enjoyed, to be honest with you.   Maud Borup started as a woman-owned, brick-and-mortar candy shop in  St. Paul, even before women had the right to vote. Today, it is a  wholesale company, continuing to offer opportunities for women. Ninety- six percent of its more than 100 employees are women.   Christine, an Army veteran, no less, bought the company in 2005 and  has expanded the company's employment by 2,000 percent and sales by  2,500 percent. To put that into perspective, sales have gone from  $500,000 all the way to $20 million in just 10 years. And for good  reason. She was named the Small Business Person of the Year in  Minnesota for 2019.    She served her country and now she is serving her community by  expanding jobs and economic opportunity for folks in southern  Minnesota. This is one of the types of success stories that we are  trying to emulate and replicate all across the country with our  legislation, the Women's Business Centers Improvements Act.   Our legislation will fund more than 100 nonprofit organizations that  provide training, counseling, and technical assistance, specifically  for women entrepreneurs.   Our bill, as the ranking member said, expands upon the success of  H.R. 1680, which was passed by the House in May of 2018, but didn't  quite make it into law. Our legislation will make key improvements for  the Small Business Administration's Office of Women's Business  Ownership and the Women's Business Center program by raising the  initial grant amount to $300,000 and increasing the authorization level  to $31.5 million for fiscal years 2020 through 2023.   This legislation establishes an accreditation program to strengthen  Women's Business Centers by increasing accountability and raising the  standards of excellence for training and counseling of women  entrepreneurs and will also create a transparent and consultative  process for the selection of new center locations, while also requiring  an annual report to ensure transparency and measure the effectiveness  of the overall program.   Most importantly, the bill will help facilitate small business  creation, provide much-needed reforms that will be a helping hand to  women business owners, free aspiring entrepreneurs of undue burdens and  barriers to entry, further economic expansion, and help hardworking  Americans achieve their dreams.   I am incredibly proud of the bipartisan nature of this bill. I thank,  again, Congresswoman Davids for introducing and managing the bill. I am  proud to stand with her to champion women-owned enterprises. And a  special thanks to the Committee on Small Business, of course our chair,  Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot for the bipartisan  support that they have offered.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4405.                                time  1600
