 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the  [[Page S1816]]  vote at 11:45, I be permitted to speak for 15 minutes and Senator  Sherrod Brown be permitted to speak for 2 minutes.    Mr. President, last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee  was busy. We met for over 30 hours to consider the nomination of Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.   During the meeting of the committee, hundreds of questions were posed  to Judge Jackson. She spoke thoughtfully and at length about her years  in public service, and, most importantly, she really imparted to the  committee--and to America that has watched--what she thought about this  great Nation, her pride in being an American, the opportunities which  were given to her, and opportunities which she used to make this a  better place for many.   I was one of the millions who came away from last week's hearing  deeply impressed with Judge Jackson. It proved to me during the course  of her testimony that the words over the steps of the Supreme Court,  ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' are a personal challenge and an invitation  to a person just like Judge Jackson.   But it appears some of our Republican colleagues are more reluctant  to support her at this moment. She is still making the rounds. Over 50  Senators have received personal visits, and even more will during the  course of this week. They have reservations, and I have spoken to some  of them and listened to their statements. They say that they don't have  any question about her qualifications or experience. Well, thank  goodness. She has a stellar resume. Anyone who is a lawyer in this  Nation would look at her with envy to think what she has achieved  against the odds in her life.   Unfortunately, some of the members of the committee misrepresented  her record on several issues. I would like to try to set it straight at  this moment.   There seems to be this passion amongst some Republicans to get this  nominee to state in a word or two her judicial philosophy. I find that  interesting. If a person came up to one of my colleagues and said,  ``What is your political philosophy?'' there are a number of things a  person might say. They might say, for example, ``I am a fiscal  conservative.''   You might then ask, ``Well, then why did you vote for the Trump tax  cuts that gave tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and added almost  $2 trillion to the national debt? And if you are a fiscal conservative,  why is it that you only preach for a balanced budget amendment when  there is a Democrat in the White House and never when there is a  Republican?''   Basically what you are saying is, ``I can hear you and your  declaration, but I want to know what you have done.''   When it comes to Judge Jackson, those who seek her judicial  philosophy and want a simple label one way or the other just haven't  done their homework. She has almost 600 published opinions. This woman,  this jurist, has not held back in explaining, in case after case, how  she views the law. It is there for the reading. Every Member of the  Senate and the public has access to that information to get the true  measure of a judicial philosophy.   What she said over and over again at the hearing was, I believe in  judicial restraint. I think that is exactly what we need in a judge,  personally. That is exactly what you will find when you review the  hundreds of opinions she has written to date.   Then there is this litmus test question that meant so much to Senator  McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, that he led off his  opposition to Judge Jackson on the issue. And the issue, quite simply,  is whether or not Judge Jackson is willing to say what her position is  on increasing the number of Justices serving on the Supreme Court-- interesting question.   Most Americans think it has been nine for all time, but that is not  true. I believe it was in 1869 that that number was established. Before  then, it was a fewer number of Justices. It hasn't been changed since.  There is speculation among some political quarters that people are  thinking about changing it in the future.   So when it came to Senator McConnell's opposition to Judge Jackson  because she said it is a policy matter to be decided by Congress, not  to be decided by the Court, as to the composition and number on the  Supreme Court, Senator McConnell went on to say that that disqualified  her; that was the leading disqualification.   Well, you might ask Senator McConnell: How did the previous nominee,  Amy Coney Barrett--you went to great lengths in maintaining a vacancy  on the Court so that a Republican judge could fill the vacancy--how did  she answer this probing threshold question when it came to the  future composition of the Supreme Court?    She said virtually exactly what Judge Jackson said: It is a matter  for Congress to decide, not for the courts. That was an acceptable  answer with Amy Coney Barrett, but for Senator McConnell, it is an  unacceptable answer when it comes to Judge Jackson.   The other questions that were raised were about her legal  representation. Those of us who have practiced law understand that you  don't necessarily agree with the legal position of every client who  walks in the office, and sometimes you have no choice. If the court  appoints you as a defender or as an attorney to represent someone who  is an indigent client, you often have a client before you--not  necessarily a savory character--who might have some questionable  background. Your job is to be a zealous advocate for that client but  never to lie to the court, stick with the truth, do your best, and  represent them in the course of litigation.   That is what Judge Jackson has done in her private practice and her  years working for the Federal public defender. Most attorneys get it.  Most of them understand that the client you are representing is not  necessarily espousing your point of view, nor, really, boasting a  lifestyle that you admire, but you have a professional obligation to do  your best as a lawyer to represent them before the court of law.   Some of them were opposed to Judge Jackson because she represented  detainees at Guantanamo Bay. That is curious because these same  lawmakers once claimed that judicial nominees should not be held  accountable for the views and actions of their clients.   It was the junior Senator from Missouri who not that long ago argued  that litigators ``do not necessarily share the views of the people  [they represent]'' but must ``represent them effectively and fairly.''  He was right then, and he ought to remember it now.   Consider the words of the junior Senator from Texas, who told us in  September of 2019:         Saying that the views of your clients or the positions of       your clients are necessarily your own personal views is no       more accurate than saying a criminal defense lawyer who       represents capital defendants is advancing the cause of       murder.    That is the quote from the junior Senator from Texas.   Finally, some of our Republican colleagues have accused Judge Jackson  of being soft on crime. We had an interesting panel the last day when  we considered the judge, and on that panel was a gentleman who is the  president of the Black law enforcement organization known as NOBLE.   I asked him point blank: We know the Fraternal Order of Police has  endorsed Judge Jackson's aspiration to the Court. We know that the  International Association of Chiefs of Police also endorsed her. You,  NOBLE, representing Black law enforcement agents across the Nation,  have endorsed her. Would you or any of these organizations have even  considered the endorsement if you thought she was soft on crime or  wanted to defund the police? He was unequivocal. No, he wouldn't have  considered her. But her critics ignore that reality.   I want to make it clear that any Senator considering her nomination  has the right to make their own choice in this process. They can also  look beyond the fact that she comes from a law enforcement family to  her actual decisionmaking and sentencing. But to claim, as a few have-- only a few--that somehow Judge Jackson was soft when it came to child  predators or endangering children is just inaccurate and, frankly,  insulting.   Look at the facts. Judge Jackson is well within the judicial  mainstream of 70 to 80 percent of sentences by Federal judges when it  comes to child pornography offenders--not out of the mainstream, in  it--and she has put many  [[Page S1817]]  behind bars for decades. Her approach to these cases is comparable to  that of many of President Trump's nominees on the bench today.   Independent fact checkers have exposed these baseless attacks for  what they are. I can't say it any better than the conservative Federal  prosecutor who wrote in a conservative magazine, the National Review,  that this line of attack against Judge Jackson is ``meritless to the  point of demagoguery.''   Let's be clear. None--absolutely none--of the attacks that have been  leveled against Judge Jackson stand up to scrutiny. I assume that is  why only a few of my Republican colleagues have spoken out in support  of them.   So I want to thank the majority of Republican Judiciary Committee  members who treated last week's hearing with dignity and respect. They  posed challenging, probing questions to Judge Jackson, and that was  their responsibility to do so. Judge Jackson's forthright responses  showed the American public why she deserves this historic opportunity.   She is a brilliant jurist, evenhanded, with a model temperament.  There were so many moments--for those who followed the hearing, they  know what I am speaking of--when I looked up and saw her sitting at the  table, thinking that she could stand up at this very moment and say  ``Enough. My family and I are leaving.'' But she didn't. She had the  strength and the grace and the dignity and determination to weather  even that political firestorm.    I am honored to support Judge Jackson. I look forward to our  Judiciary Committee vote on her nomination next Monday.   (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 3950  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr.  Whitehouse) is necessarily absent.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 112 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Whitehouse            I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, on another matter, Senator Rob Portman of  Ohio and I are cochairs of the bipartisan Senate Ukraine Caucus.  Tomorrow, we are hosting a meeting for Senators with members of the  Ukrainian Parliament. The Parliament there is known as the Rada. They  are coming to Washington to discuss how we can help even more in  assisting the valiant people of Ukraine defending against this barbaric  invasion by Vladimir Putin. I hope our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will join us to send a clear message to Ukraine that we stand  united in their efforts.   Putin's unprovoked and unconscionable war on Ukraine has revealed  what he is really all about. He is a tyrant seething with resentment,  driven by delusions of great mother Russia, willing to slaughter  innocent men, women, and children to restore a lost Russian Empire.  [[Page S1834]]    We know from his current ravings and his past actions, Putin's  ruthless pursuit of Russia's lost empire didn't begin with this war,  and if we don't do something about it, it won't end there either.   In 2003, the people of Georgia--another Soviet Republic--waged a Rose  Revolution to claim a place among the family of democratic nations.  Putin's aggrieved response was to send troops into that country to  occupy portions of it--South Ossetia and Abkhazia--to redraw Georgia's  national boundaries by force. I traveled to that area in 2012 and saw  firsthand what Putin's occupation of that tiny nation meant.   In 2014, the people of Ukraine rose up to demand change as well--the  Revolution of Dignity, they called it. They succeeded and threw out the  deeply corrupt Russian-backed President. They ousted him from  Parliament. When they did, he fled to Moscow, his real home. Putin's  revenge months later was to send Russian troops to invade and annex the  Crimean peninsula and the Donbas regions of eastern Ukraine by force.  They have continued to wage that war.   I have mentioned many times my concern for this region, and I guess  it is attached to the fact that my mother was born in Lithuania and  came here as a little girl. Her family fled from the oppression of  czarist Russia, which then controlled the Baltic States and far beyond.   During World War II, the Baltic States endured brutal Nazi  occupation, and after the war, they were held captive behind the Iron  Curtain by the USSR.   In August 1989, 2 months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, 2  million people in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia physically, literally,  joined hands in a peaceful protest. They formed a human chain, declared  that they wanted to join Europe and be part of the family of  democracies.   Two years later, the Baltics threw off Russian occupiers and  reclaimed their independence. It was a festive day. I was honored to be  a witness to part of it. They worked to achieve the reform fundamental  to democracies, to weed out corruption, establish market economies, and  encourage the growth of civil society.   In 2004, in a historic moment, a live-or-die moment for the Baltics,  they became part of NATO. It was the first time--the very first time  that NATO had opened its doors to nations that had been part of the  Soviet Union. Over the years, the Baltic States strengthened their  militaries to prove they would be assets and not liabilities to the  alliance.   Today, the Baltics provide a home to activists and dissidents from  Russia and Belarus and are a beacon of democracy. And I say that with  personal pride to have any association with these great nations.   In 2008, after Russia had annexed parts of Georgia, the President of  Poland visited Georgia's capital of Tbilisi and warned of the threat  posed by Russia to the entire region. He said:         Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the day after tomorrow--      the Baltic States and, later, perhaps, time will come for       [his] country, Poland.    Well, today, Senator Grassley and I are introducing a bill to  discourage Russia from extending Putin's war into NATO territory and  forcing the alliance to invoke its article 5 collective security  commitment.   Our bill is called the Baltic Defense and Deterrence Act. It directs  the Department of State and the Department of Defense to establish and  implement economic and security initiatives to deepen U.S. ties with  the Baltic States. Our bill will strengthen our strong partnership. It  will enhance the capability of the region's critical allies in NATO's  eastern flank to respond to threats, including Russia's misinformation  and disinformation, their cyber warfare, and, in Lithuania's case,  growing economic pressure.   Cosponsors come from both sides of the aisle: Senators Stabenow,  King, Feinstein, Blunt, Blumenthal, Baldwin, Duckworth, Booker, and  Senator Scott of Florida. Representatives Ruben Gallego and Don Bacon  are cosponsoring a bipartisan companion bill in the House.   In conclusion, in 1997, Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered the  Baltic States unilateral security guarantees if they would give up  aspirations to join NATO. They refused. They were determined to become  their own sovereign states, their own democracy, and they have  succeeded.   Kurt Volker, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and former U.S. Special  Representative to Ukraine, has said that, far from being a burden on  NATO, the admission of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia has reinvigorated  the alliance. In his words, the Baltic States turned out to be ``the  best democratic and economic reformers, the ones most committed to  build fresh new militaries, and the ones willing to support the U.S. in  other fora.''   They have sent troops on costly U.S. missions, and their troops have  fought and died alongside NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. By  securing America's economic and security partnerships with the Baltics,  our bill will help deter Vladimir Putin from extending his barbaric war  into NATO territory.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3950         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
