 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  proposal by some Members to pack the Supreme Court.   At first glance, you would think this came from Hugo Chavez or  Nicolas Maduro, pictured here. It is sad to see that it actually comes  from some people in this institution.   As a Cuban exile who fled the Communist Castro regime, I know the  consequences of these dictatorial moves to centralize power in the  hands of a few ideologues.   Packing the courts is a tactic used by brutal dictatorships, like  Venezuela, to consolidate the Socialists' power, which resulted in tens  of thousands of court rulings in its favor and basically destroyed the  country.   Packing the courts sets the precedent for the judicial branch being  expanded at every transition of power, with each President wanting to  put their four or more additional Justices, which eventually could  result in hundreds of Justices of the Supreme Court.   This proposal to fundamentally rebalance our judicial system towards  one political ideology should not only be opposed, but must be  condemned to the fullest extent.   I will fight to my last breath the attempts by anyone to  fundamentally change government in such a militant manner.                            ____________________
