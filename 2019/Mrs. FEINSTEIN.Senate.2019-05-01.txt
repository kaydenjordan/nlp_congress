 Mr. President, I rise in support of the Choose  Medicare Act, which would strengthen the Affordable Care Act and help  reduce healthcare costs for all Americans.   This commonsense bill would create a public healthcare option based  on Medicare that would increase choice and competition in the  Affordable Care Act marketplaces, including California's state  exchange, Covered California.   I would also allow the Secretary of Health Human Services to  negotiate drug prices under Medicare, increase healthcare subsidies for  middle-income Americans, and allow the federal government to block  unreasonable health insurance rate increases.   The majority of Americans support expanding healthcare choices to  achieve universal coverage and lower costs for everyone. However, too  many Americans are still unable to afford a private plan that covers  the care they need. The Choose Medicare Act would fix this by creating  a public health insurance plan that would compete alongside private  insurers in the individual and group insurance marketplaces.   Known as Medicare Part E, the public option health plan would offer  comprehensive coverage and all of the benefits covered under  traditional Medicare. Every doctor that accepts traditional Medicare  would also be enrolled as a provider for the public health plan,  [[Page S2562]]  giving patients access to a large network of doctors across the  country. It would also benefit employers. Around half of Californians  receive their health insurance through their work. The Choose Medicare  Act would give them more options, allowing large employers to choose a  plan modeled on traditional Medicare for their workers. Just as they do  now, employers would cover a portion of the cost of their employees'  coverage.   Having access to this new public option would increase competition  and choice in the employer market, and the public plan's negotiating  power would help reduce health costs for employers, not just  individuals. Moreover, our bill would ensure that people who receive  their health coverage through the public option would be able to keep  their health insurance when they change employers. Americans would no  longer feel stuck in low-paying jobs because they are worried about  losing their health insurance.   The Choose Medicare Act would also provide funding for a new  reinsurance program to partially offset the high healthcare costs paid  by insurers for the sickest individuals. This reinsurance program would  improve insurer participation in the Affordable Care Act exchanges and  lower premiums for everyone. It would also give States the option to  use this funding to address high out of-pocket costs, such as  copayments, coinsurance, premiums, and deductibles.   I am proud to note that this bill includes rate review legislation I  have previously introduced to help keep insurance premiums down. Rather  than allowing American workers to suffer under excessive premium  increases, our bill would give the Secretary of Health and Human  Services the authority to review, modify, and reject unjustified  premium increases in States where the insurance commissioner does not  have that authority.   This review process has already been successful in States where it  was implemented. Our bill would ensure that everyone, regardless of  where they live, is protected from unreasonable premiums increases.   The rising cost of drug pricing is also a huge problem in our  healthcare system. Our bill would give the Secretary of Health and  Human Services the authority to negotiate lower drug prices with  manufacturers, reducing the amount patients pay at the pharmacy.   After 1 year of negotiations, if the Secretary and drug manufacturers  are unable to agree on a fair price, the Secretary will then be able to  use the price that the Department of Veterans Affairs or other Federal  agencies that purchase prescription drugs already use.   Finally, our bill would protect America's seniors enrolled in  traditional Medicare from unlimited out-of-pocket costs by adding an  annual out-of-pocket maximum for what they can pay. Seniors would no  longer be burdened with mounting medical costs because they are  enrolled in Medicare instead of private insurance.   I want to thank Senator Merkley and Senator Murphy for leading our  efforts on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to join us  in supporting this much-needed, commonsense bill to strengthen the  Affordable Care Act, give consumers more choices when picking their  healthcare plan, and make healthcare more affordable for all.                            ____________________
