 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 321, the Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators,  Researchers, and Explorers Women Act.   I want to express my appreciation for the leadership of Congresswoman  Esty and Congresswoman Comstock.   This bill would help ensure that the incoming administration  continues to promote and strengthen important programs at NASA to  inspire and mentor girls and young women to pursue studies and careers  in STEM areas.   Despite progress in the right direction, women remain largely  underrepresented in STEM fields because they continue to face cultural  and institutional barriers throughout their studies and career  progression.   H.R. 321 would support existing programs at NASA that encourage young  girls and women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace.                                time  1600    These programs include NASA GIRLS, a virtual mentoring program;  Aspire to Inspire, a program connecting young girls with women in STEM  careers at NASA; and a summer institute program that increases  awareness and exposes young, middle school girls to the STEM careers at  NASA.   H.R. 321 also calls on NASA to develop a plan for how best to use its  current and retired workforce to mentor female K-12 students. What  comes to mind are the inspirational women who are featured in the new  movie ``Hidden Figures.'' Those brilliant and brave women opened the  door for so many who followed. We must continue to support our great  women in STEM who dedicate their time to mentor the girls and young  women who will be our next scientists, engineers, and innovators.   I thank my colleagues again--Representative Comstock for her  leadership on this bill and Representative Esty. I strongly support  this bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  pass it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.   The bill helps to build on STEM education and mentorship programs,  such as those highlighted in the INSPIRE Women Act.   More women are pursuing STEM degrees and careers overall, but they  continue to be underrepresented in many STEM fields. This is especially  true in STEM fields with high entrepreneurship rates, such as  engineering and computer science. Women who successfully complete  degrees in these fields and want to turn their research and their  talents into building new companies and creating new jobs then  disproportionately face new hurdles, such as obtaining access to  credit.   Unfortunately, because of these barriers, it remains as important as  ever for our Federal science agencies to support programs and provide  grants with the goal of encouraging, inspiring, and supporting women in  STEM at all levels of their education and training, including  entrepreneurship education and training.   H.R. 255 ensures that longstanding entrepreneurship education and  training programs at the National Science Foundation continue to  encourage and recruit women who are looking to move beyond the  laboratory and commercialize the results of their research. If we are  serious about growing our economy, it is just common sense that we  would encourage all of our best and brightest--male and female--to  commercialize their best ideas and create new companies and new jobs.   I thank my colleagues Representative Esty for her leadership and  Representative Comstock for her leadership on this bill. I strongly  support the bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support it.
