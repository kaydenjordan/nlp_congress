 Madam Speaker, tonight, I stand with my  Congressional Black Caucus members, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee  and Congressman Jamaal Bowman, to call attention to the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which recognizes that, in order to transform  policing, we must hold bad actors accountable while working to prevent  instances of brutality and misconduct.   As a mother and a grandmother of Black men and boys, these issues are  really personal to me and my family and countless other families who  face excessive force from law enforcement each and every day. This bill  will address racial profiling, create a use-of-force database, improve  transparency with a national police misconduct database, ban no-knock  warrants and choke holds, end qualified immunity--nobody is above the  law--and will limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to State  and local law enforcement.   We stand with the American people to turn this moment of agony into  one of action, as we honor Mr. George Floyd's life and the lives of all  those killed by police brutality. We will continue working with the  millions of Americans marching and demanding action, and we will not  stop until this legislation becomes law.   As an original cosponsor of this bill, I urge us to take this  opportunity to honor the lives of all police misconduct victims by  preventing future cases from occurring.
