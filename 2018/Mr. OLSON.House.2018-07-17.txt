 Mr. Speaker, countries that were part of the old Soviet  Union are now growing democracies, but they face ongoing interference  from the new Soviet Union, Russia. The country of Georgia is one such  country.   Georgia and those nations that were behind the Iron Curtain are now  working to improve their democracies. A strong economy allows these  countries to grow and stand on their own. That is why Georgia and  others seeking real freedom must work harder on the international stage  to keep American and Western money flowing.   This money goes away if the rule of law is not followed. It is  simple: Follow the rule of law; prosperity follows. Don't follow the  rule of law; poverty follows. This simple act will make our world more  free.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of Congressman Ted Poe  to speak on behalf of his amendment.    Madam Chair, we have a class of American warships that  haven't been built since World War II. They are called battleships.   America made 64 battleships. Only seven survived World War II. They  are the North Carolina, Alabama, Massachusetts, Iowa, New Jersey,  Missouri, and Wisconsin.   But one survived World War II and World War I. This ship is special.  It is the Battleship Texas. She is over 104 years old. She was  commissioned on March 12 of 1914. She patrolled the Atlantic during the  First World War. She is the first American ship with antiaircraft guns.  She is the first battleship that had directors and rangekeepers to lock  on with their 10 14-inch main batteries.   There she is today. She has made history in our Navy.   March 1919, Lieutenant Commander Edward McDonnell took a British  Sopwith Camel off turret number 3, Naval aviation was born. The wings  of gold started on the USS Texas.   The skipper of the Texas was so impressed. He noticed those planes  could see splashes for the weapons. They could target with aircraft.  That meant the Texas would be the first ship ever to launch planes to  recover as spy mechanisms during a war.   The Texas was at Casco Bay, Maine, on December 7, 1941, the day Japan  bombed Pearl Harbor. In the Atlantic Ocean, on October 23, 1942, as  part of Operation Torch, the invasion of French Morocco, the Texas  bombed and bombed and bombed the enemy.   June 6, 1944, at 5:50 a.m., the Texas roared to life with a constant  bombardment of all the weapons--225 14-inch rounds hit the Germans in  34 minutes.   June 7, the next day, she is off the cliffs of Pointe Du Hoc where  the rangers were in a dogfight for their lives being shot at from  above. The Texas launched two Higgins boats, supplied the rangers with  more weapons, and brought the wounded home.   That may have been a natural fit. And the command of those rangers  was a Texan, a proud Texas Aggie, Earl Rudder.   On the beaches that day, my colleague, Ted Poe's father, Virgil Poe,  heard the Texas roar and saw the flame come out of the big guns. When  the war in Europe with Hitler went ashore, the Texas redeployed to the  Pacific. On February 16, she pounded the Japanese on Iwo Jima for 3  straight days before the Marine Corps landed.   March 1945, 6 straight days of bombing Okinawa cleared the way for  the Army and Marines to take that island back.   The Texas struck the Naval record as a registered vessel on April 20  of 1948. She was given to my home State, the State of Texas. She is now  the flagship of the Texas Navy, Admiral Ted Poe's flagship. Our  colleague, Ted, is an admiral of the Texas Navy.   She is moored right where Texas won independence, the San Jacinto  Monument, right there southwest of Houston, Texas. But sadly, inaction  in D.C. and in Texas has done what the German Kaiser, General  Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and General Tojo could not do. The Texas is  sinking. Rust and time are winning.   The Texas still has a heart of a warship. She twice set sail during  Hurricane Ike. She and all these battleships deserve to be saved. It is  time to heave up and trice up. Vote for this amendment, and save our  battleships.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
