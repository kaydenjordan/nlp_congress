 Mr. Speaker, while my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are singularly focused on the happenings only within the  walls of Capitol Hill, the rest of us, working families, are struggling  with the consequences of this failed administration, including rising  inflation; pending unemployment; border threats; increased drugs and  violence in our neighborhoods; and an out-of-control, power-hungry  administration.    I cannot explain the chairman's and majority leader's absolute and  unhealthy obsession with a former President, but I sincerely urge them  to seek treatment so that they can focus on the insurmountable harms  that are being caused by the current administration and how they are  currently forcing them on all of the American people.   I rise in opposition to the previous question so that the House can  immediately consider H.R. 5586, legislation critical to stopping the  Democrats' unending attempts to control every aspect of American lives.   Now the left is in an unrelenting pursuit of tracking every penny you  and your family personally earn and spend. If the price tag for their  socialist policies weren't alarming enough, what is hidden inside the  bill should truly horrify all Americans.   If you pay rent, if you buy groceries, or pay a mortgage, you are  going to be subject to surveillance. From the lowest income earners on  up, every American will be checked.   Thousands more IRS bureaucrats will be hired for their new  surveillance program, with authority to monitor every transaction you  make. Every account transaction would be traced and reported to the  Federal Government, edging us closer and closer to a communist- controlled police state.   Republicans are unified in our fight against this new surveillance  program. My friend and ranking member, Kevin Brady, led the charge to  stop this early on, but not a single Democrat stood up for Americans'  financial privacy.    First, things are reported and monitored, and then  they are controlled. We cannot let Democrats push us down this  dangerous and slippery slope.                                time  1330
