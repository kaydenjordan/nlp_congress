 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Clermont County  resident Brett Milam for selflessly donating his kidney to a stranger  in need.   He recently shared his decision with our community in The Clermont  Sun in Ohio where he works, describing his recent kidney donation and  journey.   Brett was inspired by an article written by a man who had made the  same choice to donate a kidney for no other reason than to commit an  act of kindness.   As Brett tells it, after months of research, contemplation, and  discussion with other organ donors, he decided to help a stranger,  giving them an early Christmas present: a healthy kidney.  [[Page H609]]    I applaud Brett for making this donation to save a complete  stranger's life, and I am particularly moved by the selflessness and  kindness that Brett made with this action.   Brett's choice to donate his kidney demonstrates the most  compassionate side of humanity.   Today, I recognize Brett Milam for his extremely selfless act of  kindness.   Thank you, Brett, and God bless.                            ____________________
