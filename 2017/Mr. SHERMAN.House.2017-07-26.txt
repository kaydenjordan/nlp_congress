 Mr. Speaker, vote against the rule, vote against the  bill. But the bill does contain one provision that I want to applaud  the committee for including, and that is section 8907, which states:  ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used in  contravention of the War Powers Act.''   I first proposed this language in 2011. It failed at first, but now  it has been included in every Defense Appropriations bill since FY12.  It is necessary to enforce the War Powers Act because every Attorney  General since the 1970s has advised Presidents that the War Powers Act  isn't binding on the President, and that the President can send  unlimited numbers of troops anywhere in the world to fight any battle  without a declaration of war.   That is why we need this language, because Attorney General Mukasey,  a Republican Attorney General, testified before the Foreign Affairs  Committee yesterday that by including this language in the  appropriations bill, Congress enforces the War Powers Act and its  proper role in international affairs.   I thank the committee for including this language.
