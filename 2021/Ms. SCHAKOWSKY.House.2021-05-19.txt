 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Thompson for  his leadership.   While the events of January 6 were devastating and will stain our  country's history forever, I have no doubt that democracy will prevail.   This Nation has fought back against hatred, authoritarianism, and  fascism since the very founding.   Yes, I stand proudly today to ask for a January 6 commission so that  we can develop a full public record that will let us know how we can  avoid this in the future.   We should all vote ``yes.''
