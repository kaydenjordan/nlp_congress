Without objection, it is so  ordered.                        Attorney General Jeff Sessions     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                        Attorney General Jeff Sessions     Madam President, 1 year ago today, I came to the Senate  floor to oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions to lead the Department  of Justice.   The Justice Department is charged with defending our laws and  standing up for all people regardless of color, sex, sexual  orientation, religion, or ability.   That night, I described Jeff Sessions' appalling record on nearly  every major national issue handled by the Justice Department, including  civil rights, immigration, and criminal justice reform.   That night, I also read a letter that Coretta Scott King sent to the  Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986 that opposed Sessions' nomination to  serve as a Federal judge. Mrs. King wrote a vivid account of how Jeff  Sessions, as a U.S. attorney in the 1980s, had ``used the awesome power  of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black  citizens.'' That letter had been a part of the Senate Judiciary  Committee's records for more than 30 years. It helped sink the  nomination of Jeff Sessions for the Federal judgeship for which he had  been nominated back in the 1980s.   I had hoped that by reminding the Senate of its bipartisan rejection  of Sessions in the 1980s, that the letter might help us to once again  come together in a bipartisan way to say that this kind of bigotry  shouldn't be allowed in our criminal justice system. That was my plan.  Yet, for reading  [[Page S669]]  those words--the words of an icon of the civil rights movement--I was  booted off of the Senate floor. Every one of my Republican colleagues  who was present that night voted to shut me up for reading Mrs. King's  words. Then, the next day, every single Republican voted to confirm  Jeff Sessions--a man deemed to be too racist to hold a Federal court  judgeship in 1986. Nope. They confirmed him to lead the agency charged  with defending justice for all Americans.   Now it has been 1 year since the Republican-controlled Senate made  Jeff Sessions Attorney General of the United States. I wish I could say  that I had been proven wrong--I actually really do--but Coretta Scott  King's warnings ring even louder today than they did in 1986. On issue  after issue, Jeff Sessions' Justice Department has failed in its  mission to promote justice for all Americans. Instead, Sessions has  taken the Department in exactly the opposite direction. So let's make a  list and start with voting.   In 1986, Mrs. King warned us that Sessions had used the awesome power  of his office as an Alabama prosecutor to chill the free exercise of  the vote by African Americans. As Attorney General, he has continued  that crusade, targeting not only African Americans but Latinos, the  elderly, veterans, and other marginalized groups.   Only weeks after Sessions took the reins, the Justice Department  abandoned its legal challenge of a Texas voter ID law that  intentionally discriminated against voters of color. Later, the  Department argued that it should be easier for States to strike  eligible voters from their voting rolls--a proven way of preventing  eligible citizens from voting.   Sessions has eagerly embraced President Trump's make-believe, fact- free conspiracy theories about voter fraud--condoning the President's  voter suppression commission and engaging in State-level inquiries into  voter databases.   Next on the list: defending all Americans--equal protection under the  law.   In her letter, Coretta Scott King warned that Jeff Sessions would  undermine equality under the law. Sure enough, when Jeff Sessions took  over at the Justice Department, he immediately got to work in reversing  the agency's prior efforts to defend laws and policies that protect  Americans from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender  identity.   Sessions' Justice Department has rescinded guidance that protects  transgender students and workers from illegal discrimination. The same  day that President Trump used Twitter to announce that he was banning  transgender individuals from serving in the military, the Justice  Department filed a legal brief that reflected Sessions' view that our  great civil rights laws don't protect gay Americans from  discrimination. This was despite the rulings by other Federal courts  and guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reaching  the opposite conclusion. Sessions' Justice Department has also gone out  of its way to argue in the Supreme Court that business owners should be  able to deny service to gay customers.   In 1986, Mrs. King wrote: ``I do not believe Jeff Sessions possesses  the requisite judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights  guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for appointment  to the federal district court.'' It is clear that Sessions has not  acquired those skills in the 32 years since Mrs. King issued her  warning.   Third, criminal justice.   Jeff Sessions is using the monumental power of his office to invert  our criminal justice system. For too long in America, we have had a  dual justice system--one sympathetic, soft-on-crime system for the rich  and another ineffective, cruel system for everyone else. Coretta Scott  King told us about Sessions' role in this broken system when she wrote  that he ``exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict'' Black  civil rights leaders despite there being evidence that clearly  demonstrated their innocence of any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, she said, he  ``ignored allegations of similar behavior by whites.''   In recent years, we have made some progress away from that broken  system by having implemented proven reforms that make our communities  safer. Jeff Sessions has worked with laser-like focus to reverse those  gains.   Just last week, Sessions effectively closed an office within the  Justice Department that helped to make legal aid more accessible to  people who don't have enough money to pay for a lawyer, and that is  just the tip of the iceberg.   Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department killed off a reform  initiative that allowed local police departments to voluntarily partner  with the Federal Government to improve community policing.   The Justice Department has abandoned its longstanding efforts to hold  local police forces accountable when they routinely and systematically  violate the constitutional rights of American citizens.   Sessions ended the Justice Department's Smart on Crime Initiative,  which allowed prosecutors to divert some low-level, nonviolent  offenders into rehab programs. This was a program that saved money,  allowed offenders to avoid incarceration, and improved safety in our  communities. It improved the lives of these offenders and their  families. Instead, Sessions instructed all prosecutors to bury even  low-level, nonviolent drug offenders under the most serious charges  possible that guaranteed the longest prison terms possible.   Sessions even rolled back efforts to take weapons of war off of our  streets by lifting commonsense restrictions on the transfer of  military-grade weapons to local police departments--weapons of war,  such as grenade launchers and armored vehicles that belong on  battlefields, not on the streets where our kids ride their bicycles and  walk to school--weapons that even the Pentagon cannot justify handing  over to local police.   Next, immigration.   As a Senator, Jeff Sessions was an anti-immigration extremist who led  multiple successful campaigns to defeat bipartisan, comprehensive  immigration reform. As a Senator, he urged the deporting of Dreamers  who were brought to the United States as kids.   Now, as the head of the Justice Department, he has continued his ugly  anti-immigrant rampage. He has zealously defended every illegal and  immoral version of President Trump's Muslim ban. He has used the  Department to try to cut off aid to cities and States that prioritize  keeping their communities safe over being part of his national  deportation force. While it was Donald Trump who ordered it, Jeff  Sessions himself announced the end to the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals Program, or DACA, which has subjected 800,000 Dreamers to  deportation.   So there it is. Coretta Scott King's words about Jeff Sessions were  true in 1986, they were true in 2017, and they remain true today. On  Jeff Sessions' watch, the Justice Department has promoted voter  suppression. On his watch, the Justice Department has endorsed  discrimination. On his watch, the Justice Department has reversed  efforts to reform our broken criminal justice system. On his watch, the  Justice Department has led an all-out, bigotry-fueled attack on  immigrants and refugees.   All of this, all of it, was predictable. All of this, all of it, was  foreseeable. All of this, all of it, could have been avoided if just a  few Republican Senators had stood up for fair and impartial justice,  but they didn't--not one. So here we are.   Here is the ultimate irony: President Trump turned on his Attorney  General. Why? It was not over voting or equal rights or criminal  justice or immigration--no. The President turned on Sessions because  Sessions formally recused himself from a law enforcement investigation  into the President's ties to Russia. Sessions has groveled, but Donald  Trump will never forgive the sin of Sessions' failing to serve Donald  Trump personally.   Jeff Sessions, President Trump, and this Republican Congress seem to  think that they can stoke the fires of hatred and division without  being consumed by them. Maybe they can for a time, but people are  resisting and persisting. States and cities are stepping up to defend  civil rights that are under assault by the Federal Government. The  American people are showing up in the streets, in the airports, in the  courtrooms, and even at the polls to hold this government accountable.  [[Page S670]]  They will continue to show up and to fight day in and day out--to fight  for fairness, to fight for equality, to fight for liberty and justice  for all.   Republicans tried to silence Coretta Scott King for speaking the  truth about Jeff Sessions. They tried to silence me for reading Mrs.  King's words on the Senate floor. They have tried to silence all of us  from speaking out, but instead of shutting us up, they have made us  louder.   Warn us. Give us explanations. Nevertheless, we will persist, and we  will win.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
