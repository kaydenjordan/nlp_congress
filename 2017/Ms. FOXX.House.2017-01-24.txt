 Madam Speaker, our colleague on the other side of the aisle  asked: Who the hell are we to be here speaking on this legislation and  passing this legislation?   Well, Madam Speaker, we are the Representatives of the people of this  country.   Madam Speaker, the most conservative estimates show that we have lost  54 million children to abortion since 1973. In a nation founded upon  principles that recognize the dignity of every human life, we should  not tolerate this extermination of innocent lives.                                time  1245    The majority of Americans recognize this tragedy for what it is, and  there is consensus among them that they do not want their tax dollars  paying for a practice they sincerely oppose, and we are their  representatives.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has been included in relevant  appropriations bills to prohibit Federal funding of abortions. Each  year it has been consistently renewed and supported by congressional  majorities and Presidents of both parties.   Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that the Hyde  amendment has prevented hundreds of thousands of abortions each year.  That means millions of Americans are alive today because of the Hyde  amendment. After 40 years, it is time for this lifesaving amendment to  become permanent law.   H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance  Full Disclosure Act, makes the Hyde amendment and other current  abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide. This  commonsense measure restores a longstanding agreement that protects the  unborn and prevents taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of  elective abortions.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to respect our  Nation's consensus on abortion funding and affirm life by voting in  favor of this rule and H.R. 7.    I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his unflagging  leadership on the issue of pro-life as well as on other issues related  to human rights.   Mr. Speaker, since 1973, as my colleague before me said, at least 58  million children's lives have been tragically taken by abortion in the  United States. Over these last 44 years, science has made the facts  increasingly clear: the unborn child in his or her mother's womb is a  member of the human family, fully alive and simply awaiting the right  conditions before joining the rest of us in the world.   Our laws should recognize and uphold the dignity of these unborn  children. And thankfully, we have made significant progress in this  endeavor since the decision of Roe v. Wade. The Hyde amendment has  saved over 2 million lives since 1976, and just earlier today, we  passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. This  bipartisan legislation makes the Hyde amendment permanent, ensuring  that unborn children are better protected and that taxpayers are not  forced to fund thousands of abortions each year.    The American people overwhelmingly agree that we should protect  innocent lives and that taxpayer dollars should not be used to finance  abortions. This Friday, hundreds of thousands of Americans will pour  into D.C. from across the country to voice their vision of a world  where every human life is valued and protected. As we mourn the lives  already lost to abortion, we should continue to strive for better legal  protections for the unborn so that one day every unborn child will be  able to join us in exercising their rights to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   Once again, thanks to Congressman Smith for this Special Order.
