 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res.  354, condemning the violence perpetrated against peaceful protesters  outside the Turkish Ambassdor's residence during Turkish President  Erdogan's visit last month. This timely and critically important  measure was introduced by my good friend, and Foreign Affairs Committee  Chairman, Ed Royce.   Mr. Speaker, as representatives of the American people, we take a  solemn oath to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United  States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' This sworn  commitment spurs us to speak out now after the violent attack last  month on peaceful protesters in Washington, D.C. who were peacefully  exercising their First Amendments rights.   On that day a group of peaceful demonstrators--including a resident  from my home state of New Jersey, Ceren Borazan--gathered outside the  Turkish Ambassador's residence to protest the policies of Turkish  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Shortly after President Erdogan's  arrival at the residence during his official visit to the United  States, a contingent of his security guards, joined by some supporters,  rushed across the street where the protesters were gathered. Before the  demonstrators knew it, this group of thugs was upon them, throwing them  to the ground and raining blows upon them.   By now we are all familiar with the shocking video images captured of  men in dark suits, some with guns, and others in plainclothes  mercilessly kicking protesters in their faces while they lie helplessly  on the ground. Some demonstrators were outnumbered four to one by their  assailants who punched and manhandled them until DC police intervened.  When police stepped in, some attackers turned to assault our uniformed  officers.   Among this group of protesters were Kurdish- and Armenian-Americans,  members of minorities with a painful history of persecution and  marginalization in their ancestral homelands. These individuals came to  the United States to seek the freedom and safety they were deprived in  their lands of origin.   The United States and its Bill of Rights are a promise to these  people that must not be broken. That members of the President's  security detail and others felt they could attack these sacred rights  with impunity should offend us all. That Erdogan would calmly watch the  melee unfold--as video evidence shows--is as galling as it is  unsurprising. Indeed, just a year ago his security detail was involved  in an all-too-similar incident at a public event in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, the steps recommended by this measure should be urgently  implemented. Among other things, the United States should charge and  prosecute all those involved in the attack. The State Department should  request a waiver of immunity for any Turkish officials charged and  detained in connection with the incident. Finally, the United States  should redouble its efforts to promote democracy and human rights in  Turkey.   Mr. Speaker, this was a brutal physical assault on a group of  peaceful demonstrators in our nation's capital and a brazen insult to  all Americans. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join their voices and votes in strongly condemning this incident and  calling for justice.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this bill.  I want to thank Ranking Member Engel for his support and also Majority  Leader McCarthy for making sure this bill came to the floor. Without  that, we wouldn't be here, so I want to thank him especially for his  support.   Mr. Speaker, I start off by saying that, since 2013, I have chaired  nine congressional hearings focused in whole or in part on atrocities  in Iraq and Syria. The distinguished chairman has had another dozen or  so such hearings that have brought to light these atrocities.   In one of our hearings in December of 2015, Gregory Stanton,  president of Genocide Watch, testified that ``weak words are not  enough,'' noting that 21 human rights organizations, genocide scholars,  and religious leaders wrote to President Obama imploring him to  recognize the ISIS genocide.   At that same hearing, Chaldean Bishop Francis Kalabat said that  ``since the fall of Mosul in early June 2014, Christians have endured  targeted persecution in the form of forced displacement, sexual  violence, and other human rights violations.'' He said, ``ISIS has  committed terrific atrocities against the Yazidis,'' and then he  bottom-lined it and said the Christians are ``under threat of  extinction.''   On May 9, 2016, the House passed Jeff Fortenberry's genocide  resolution 393-0. A few days later, Secretary of State John Kerry  declared ISIS atrocities to be a genocide.   The existential threat to Christians and Yazidis and other minority  faiths, however, continues to this day. Some of the fortunate ones have  made it to the relative safety of Erbil but, astonishingly, have gotten  no assistance from the United States Government.   Since 2014, as a matter of fact, the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of  Erbil has provided almost all of the medical care, food, shelter, and  education received by over 13,200 Christian families,  [[Page H4635]]  almost one-third of the Christians remaining in Iraq, who escaped ISIS.  The archdiocese also provides assistance to Yazidis and Muslims. The  funding for all of this has been private, with money from Knights of  Columbus, Aid to the Church in Need, and a few others.   Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, which has  donated more than $12 million to the effort, testified in one of my  hearings and said the Knights and other private sources have responded.  ``But nongovernmental organizations can only do so much.''   ``The rich tapestry,'' as he pointed out, ``of religious pluralism in  the region must be preserved now or it will be lost forever,'' noting  that there has been an 80 percent decline of Christians in Iraq and 70  percent in Syria.   He said: ``With its loss will come increased instability and threats  to our own security and that of the world.   ``We have a unique opportunity--and, some would say, unique  responsibility--to protect the victims of genocide.''   Mr. Speaker, just before Christmas of last year, I traveled to Erbil  with a staff delegation at the invitation of the Chaldean archbishop,  Bashar Warda, to meet with survivors and to visit an internally  displaced person camp of about 6,000 individuals. Both my staff and I  were amazed and inspired by the genocide survivors' resiliency and deep  faith in the Lord, despite the cruelty that they had endured.                                time  1715    There was so much joy, love, and courage despite the loss of family  and friends to ISIS. They had deep hope. The children sang Christmas  carols--it was December 23 when we were there--with smiles and with  reverence. The leaders, especially Archbishop Warda, trusted in God  while working unceasingly and unselfishly for others.   Because the needs on the ground have always exceeded private support,  the archdiocese has had to battle chronic funding crises over these  last several years. Archbishop Warda told me recently that they had to  temporarily suspend their distribution of medicines, and are on track  to run out of money for food sometime this June.   H.R. 390 provides authority and direction to the secretary and the  administrator of USAID to identify the humanitarian, stabilization, and  recovery needs of these communities.    This bill also authorizes and directs the  secretary to fund entities, including faith-based ones, that are  effectively providing assistance to meet those needs on the ground.   It addresses another urgent aspect of this crisis: evidence linking  specific ISIS perpetrators to specific atrocity crimes that is being  destroyed or lost. And we have seen this in the past in Rwanda, in  Sierra Leone, and in the former Yugoslavia. You have got to collect the  information that is actionable in order to prosecute these crimes  against humanity. This legislation directs that, and that is why it has  the support of all four former U.S. Ambassadors at Large for war crimes  issues.   It also directs the Secretary of State to work with foreign  governments to ensure that they are including identifying information  about suspected perpetrators in their security databases and security  screening and are prosecuting perpetrators of these horrific crimes.   President Trump and Vice President Pence have strongly, publicly, and  repeatedly committed the administration to providing relief to  Christians, Yazidis, and other genocide survivors. This legislation  tangibly supports this commitment and is a blueprint for action.   I especially want to thank tonight the coauthor of this legislation,  Anna Eshoo. Her tireless efforts on behalf of all Christians and other  persecuted religious minorities has been really fantastic, and I want  to thank her for that and for working so cooperatively together with me  and my staff and the full committee staff.   I would also like to thank the great staff work of Nathaniel Hurd,  Piero Tozzi in my office, Matt McMurray in Anna Eshoo's office, Doug  Anderson and Joan Condon in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and  Roger Mahan and Luke Murry in the majority leader's office. And, as  always, I want to thank Kelly Dixon, who ultimately helped us bring  this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the statement of Mr. Carl A.  Anderson before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.   Opening Statement of Mr. Carl A. Anderson, Supreme Knight, Knights of                                  Columbus         (Before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health Global       Human Rights and International Organizations of the Committee       on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, at a       hearing titled The ISIS Genocide Declaration: What Next?, May       26, 2019)        Thank you for the opportunity to appear before this       subcommittee and to discuss the next steps that need to be       taken needed to protect the survivors of ongoing genocide in       Iraq and Syria. Let me begin by saying that the House of       Representatives, the State Department and the United States       Commission on International Religious Freedom are all to be       commended for the important step of declaring the situation       confronting Christians and other religious minorities in the       Middle East genocide.        The world's greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II       is unfolding now in the Middle East. In addition to millions       of refugees, many of the region's indigenous communities now       face extinction. These communities may disappear in less than       a decade. But their fate is not inevitable. The United States       can avert this unfolding tragedy.                          A unique historical moment         Around the world, people of good will, Muslim and non-      Muslim alike, wish to differentiate themselves from the       horrific and violent theology espoused by ISIS.        It is certainly true that such extremists make up a small       percentage of Muslims overall. But among the world's billion       Muslims, the majority simply want to raise their families in       peace and are scandalized by what ISIS is doing in the name       of Islam.        Prominent Islamic leaders and scholars from around the       world have recently taken an important step in the Marrakesh       Declaration. Attempts such as this, which seek to align Islam       with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be       supported.        At the same time, it is clear that Christians, and other       indigenous minorities, are experiencing genocide, at the       hands of the Islamic State and related groups. Their plight       is now at the top of the world's agenda in a way that it       never has been before.        These factors together create an unparalleled opportunity       for the United States, and for all those opposed to ISIS'       radical vision--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--to advance an       agenda of equality, justice, peace, and accountability in the       region.                Six principles for sound policy in the region         The United States can avert the extinction of indigenous       religious and ethnic communities in Iraq and Syria with a       policy that contains the following six principles:        (1) Increase aid and ensure that it actually reaches those       most in need;        We are reliably informed that official government and U.N.       aid does not reach the Christian genocide survivors in Iraq       and Syria.        Repeatedly, we hear from Church leaders in the region that       Christians--and other genocide survivors--are last in line       for assistance from governments. Significantly, the       Archdiocese of Erbil, where most Iraqi Christians now live,       receives no money from any government whatsoever. If       assistance from outside Church affiliated agencies ends in       Erbil, Christians there will face a catastrophic humanitarian       tragedy within 30 days. The situation is similar in Syria,       according to Christian leaders there.        Those who face genocide are a tiny fraction of the       population. They often must avoid official refugee camps       because they are targeted for violence there by extremists.       As a result, these minorities often do not get ``official''       aid. This will continue to be the reality unless specific       action is taken to bring the aid to where these minorities       are forced to reside by continuing violence.        The Knights of Columbus and others private sources have       responded to this situation. Since 2014, we have raised more       than $10.5 million for relief, assisting Christians and other       internally displaced persons and refugees in Iraq, Syria,       Jordan, and Lebanon. We have partnered with dioceses and       religious agencies working in the region to provide general       relief, food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care.       In doing so we assist both Christians and non-Christians. We       are also working with church entities to ensure that they are       making use of all government or U.N. resources available.        But non-governmental organizations can only do so much.       Government aid is essential to the long-term survival of       these indigenous religious and ethnic minorities. It is       urgent that Congress appropriate funding to save those who       have escaped genocide. I urge you to consider special       emergency appropriations, however modest, to improve the       humanitarian conditions on the ground in Iraq.        This funding, whatever the vehicle, should come with       mechanisms in place--reporting  [[Page H4636]]       requirements and oversight--to ensure that American aid does       not get diverted from its intended purpose.        (2) Support the long-term survival in the region of these       ancient indigenous religious and ethnic communities;        In Iraq, the Christians population has declined by more       than 80 percent, and in Syria by nearly 70 percent.        American policy should recognize the important differences       in the situations of those fleeing violence and those       targeted for genocide. And we should prioritize the latter.        Consider this analogy. After World War II, there were       approximately 50 million refugees, and only a small fraction       were Jews. Yet the world understood that Jews, who had       survived genocide, faced a qualitatively different situation,       and deserved heightened consideration.        The same is true today for the indigenous religious and       ethnic minorities of the region. They have an indisputable       right to live in their country--in whatever region of it they       wish. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean where       they are originally from, or where they find themselves now,       but as survivors of an ongoing genocide, they deserve to be       prioritized, not left behind by American policy decisions.        (3) Punish the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against       humanity;        The United States should support action by the U.N.       Security Council to refer key perpetrators of genocide for       prosecution. Equally important, we should support the Iraqi       Central Government and the Kurdish Regional Government's       adjudication of the cases of thousands of ISIS fighters       and supporters who currently remain in local detention       centers.        As the population of captured ISIS fighters increases,       local detention centers and jails risk becoming their own       humanitarian issue. The need to improve this situation cannot       be overstated.        Additionally, although substantial evidence of genocide       exists, the United States should cooperate in taking further       action to develop additional documentation and preservation       before physical evidence is lost. Appropriations intended to       assist in the adjudication of ISIS fighters will be critical       in the coming months.        (4) Assist victims of genocide in attaining refugee status.        A news report last week indicated that of the 499 Syrian       refugees admitted to the U.S. in May, not one was listed as       being Christian or as explicitly coming from any of the       groups targeted for genocides. How long will this situation       be allowed to continue?        The U.S. should appropriate funding and work with the U.N.       High Commissioner for Refugees to make provisions for       locating and providing status to individuals--such as Yezidis       and Christians--that have been targeted for genocide. Many of       these genocide survivors fear going into official U.N.       refugee camps, where they are targeted. Thus they are       overlooked, and find it nearly impossible to acquire official       refugee status or immigrate.        Congress should act now. Senator Tom Cotton has introduced       the Religious Persecution Relief Act, S. 2708, to provide for       overlooked minorities in the prioritization of refugees. We       support this bill and urge its passage.        (5) Prepare now for foreseeable human rights challenges as       ISIS-controlled territory is liberated by ensuring that       Christians and other minorities have equal rights to decide       their future;        We should prepare now for the consequences of the       liberation of ISIS controlled areas, including Mosul and the       Nineveh Region, as well as regions in Syria. We are likely to       see another humanitarian crisis as civilians flee the       fighting or return to their former communities when fighting       ceases.        There has been much debate concerning plans for victims of       genocide in Iraq. Some have argued for returning people       safely to the Nineveh Region, others that they should be       allowed to stay in Kurdistan, still others that they be       allowed to immigrate. But these are not necessarily mutually       exclusive, competing proposals. People should be allowed to       decide their own future. And when they do, we should work to       ensure they are treated with fairness, dignity and equality.       This also means that it will be increasingly important to       ensure that the property rights and claims of minority groups       are respected.        (6) Promote the establishment of internationally agreed       upon standards of human rights and religious freedom as       conditions for humanitarian and military assistance.        The United States should advocate for full and equal rights       for religious and ethnic minorities in the region in exchange       for our military and humanitarian aid. A necessary first step       to prevent genocide is to overcome the social and legal       inequality that is its breeding ground.        Religious hatred, discrimination and second-class       citizenship too often constitute a way of life in the       region--and it is a way of life that is an antecedent to       genocide. We cannot accept one standard for human rights in       the region and another standard for the rest of the world.        The guarantees in the Universal Declaration of Human       Rights--and the First and Fourteenth amendments to our own       constitution--regarding equality under the law and freedom of       speech and religion must become a reality for all citizens of       Iraq, Syria and elsewhere throughout the region.                                  Conclusion         The rich tapestry of religious pluralism in the region must       be preserved now or it will be lost forever. With its loss       will come increased instability and threats to our own       security and that of the world.        We have a unique opportunity--and some would say, unique       responsibility--to protect the victims of genocide. The       United States can provide such protection with a policy that       includes the principles outlined above. Mr. Chairman, thank       you very much for your leadership and that of the members of       this subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, since 2013, I have chaired nine  Congressional hearings focused, in whole or in a large part, on  atrocities in Iraq and Syria.   At one hearing in December of 2015, Professor Gregory Stanton,  President of Genocide Watch testified that ``weak words are not  enough'' noting that twenty one human rights organizations, genocide  scholars, and religious leaders wrote to President Obama imploring him  to recognize the ISIS genocide.   At the same hearing, Chaldean Bishop Francis Kalabat testified that  ``since the fall of  [[Page H4637]]  Mosul in early June 2014, Christians have endured targeted persecution  in the form of forced displacement, sexual violence, and other human  rights violations.'' He said ``ISIS has committed horrific atrocities  against the Yazidis.'' The bishop said Christians are ``under threat of  extinction.''   On May 9, 2016, the House passed Jeff Fortenberry's Genocide  resolution 393 to 0. A few days later, Secretary of State John Kerry  declared ISIS atrocities to be a genocide.   The existential threat to Christians and Yazidis and other minorities  continues to this day. Some of the fortunate ones, however, have made  it to relative safety in Erbil but astonishingly have not gotten  assistance from the United States.   Since 2014, the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil has been  providing almost all of the medical care, food, shelter and education  received by 13,200 Christian families, almost one third of Christians  remaining in Iraq, who escaped ISIS. The Archdiocese also provides  assistance to Yazidis and Muslims. The funding has been private-- Knights of Columbus, Aid to the Church in Need, and a few others.   Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus--which has  donated more than $12 million to the effort--testified that the Knights  and other private sources have responded, ``But non-governmental  organizations can only do so much.'' He also made numerous  recommendations including supporting the ``Long term survival in the  region of these ancient indigenous religions and ethnic communities. In  Iraq, the Christian population has declined by more than 80 percent,  and in Syria, it has declined by almost 70 percent . . . The rich  tapestry of religious pluralism in the region must be preserved now or  it will be lost forever.'' He said, ``With its loss will come increased  instability and threats to our own security and that of the world. We  have a unique opportunity--and some would say, unique responsibility-- to protect the victims of genocide.''   Just before Christmas last year, I travelled to Erbil at the  invitation of the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda,  to meet with survivors and visit an IDP camp.   Both my staff and I were amazed and inspired by the genocide  survivors resiliency and deep faith in the Lord despite the cruelty  they endured.   There was much joy, love, and courage despite the loss of family and  friends to ISIS. They had hope. The children sang Christmas carols with  smiles and reverence.   The leaders--especially Archbishop Warda--trust in God while working  unceasingly for others.   Because the needs on-the-ground have always exceeded private support,  however, the Archdiocese has had to battle chronic funding crises.  Archbishop Warda told me they recently had to temporarily suspend their  distribution of medicines and are on-track to run out of money for food  sometime this June.   H.R. 390 provides authority and direction to the Secretary and  Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to  identify the humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery needs of these  communities. The bill also authorizes and directs the Secretary and  Administrator to fund entities--including faith-based ones--that are  effectively providing assistance to meet those needs on-the-ground.   H.R. 390 addresses another urgent aspect of this crisis: Evidence  linking specific ISIS perpetrators to specific atrocity crimes is being  destroyed or lost. It is vital that evidence that can be used in a  range of court settings is collected and preserved. This will enable  accountability and support our efforts to counter terrorist groups by  demonstrating that the perpetrators are chronic rapists, child abusers,  drug dealers and human traffickers.   This legislation authorizes and directs the Secretary and  Administrator to fund entities that are conducting criminal  investigations into perpetrators of atrocity crimes in Iraq.   The Commission for International Justice and Accountability is an  example of a non-governmental organization that has been conducting  such criminal investigations on-the-ground. CIJA has collected and  preserved ISIS recruitment forms, foreign fighter passports, and ISIS  instructions from ISIS facilities, laptops, hard drives, and memory  sticks. It has taken hundreds of witness statements from victims,  perpetrators, detained fighters, defectors, insiders, witnesses, and  other witnesses. CIJA has developed pretrial briefs and perpetrator  profiles that are of a world-class quality.   In 2016, CIJA received 409 requests for assistance on cases from law  enforcement agencies in many countries, including the Department of  Homeland Security and FBI and works closely with both agencies. Yet,  CIJA has received no financial support from the U.S. government.   H.R. 390 also directs the Secretary to work with foreign governments  to ensure that they are including identifying information about  suspected perpetrators in their security databases and security  screening and are prosecuting perpetrators.   ISIS fighters in Iraq are being captured and detained in the battle  for Mosul and beyond. Others are escaping the region and attempting to  return to their home countries around the world. We should help ensure  that in addition to being screened and prosecuted for terrorism, they  are screened and prosecuted for atrocity crimes.   President Trump and Vice President Pence have strongly, publicly  committed the Administration to providing relief to Christians,  Yazidis, and other genocide survivors, and ensuring perpetrators are  brought to justice. H.R. 390 supports this commitment and is a  blueprint for implementation.   H.R. 390 has the bipartisan co-sponsorship of 46 members, support  from a range of prominent Christian, Yezidi, religious freedom, and  accountability organizations, and has been endorsed by all four former  U.S. Ambassadors-at-Large for War Crimes Issues.   I especially want to acknowledge my co-author and good friend Anna  Eshoo. Her tireless efforts on behalf of Christians and other  persecuted religious minorities, and the fantastic partnership with her  and her staff on this bill, are a testament to the hi-partisanship of  H.R. 390 and international religious freedom more broadly.   And finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the great staff work  of Nathaniel Hurd and Piero Toni in my office. Matt McMurray in Anna  Eshoo's office. Doug Anderson and Joan Condon in the House Foreign  Affairs Committee. Roger Mahan and Luke Murry in the Majority Leader's  Office. And Kelly Dixon who ultimately helped us get it to the floor.
