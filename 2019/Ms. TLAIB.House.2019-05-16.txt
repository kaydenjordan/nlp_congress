 Madam Speaker, we must have a moral awakening, a spiritual  revolution on how we treat a person's health in this country.   We must understand that every single human has a right to be healthy  and comfortable, to live with dignity, and to receive the healthcare  they need to flourish.   At present, this understanding is in conflict with a sinister, unjust  force in our society: corporate greed.   Why are people forced to skip insulin injections so they can pay  their rent?   Why are my residents charged $70 for a PrEP, a pill that could  dramatically reduce HIV transmission, when the same pill costs $7  abroad?   Corporate greed has replaced the moral imperative that everyone live  in health and dignity. There is more wealth in this country than any  other in human history, and millions go without health insurance and  prescription drugs, people condemned to live with pain and suffering  because we have chosen corporate profits over our dignity as a nation.   We are watching a crisis unfold in real time. It is time we break the  corporate stranglehold on our health and well-being, lost profits of  the insanely wealthy be damned.   We have much more important things to protect. We have the soul of  this country to rescue.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to uplift my LGBTQ neighbors  at home in the 13th Congressional District. I want them to know that I  uplift them today, and always, as their unwavering advocate in the  United States Congress.   There are ideals and values we all should attempt to live up to in  this country. I know many of us ran to be in this Chamber to ensure  that our laws match those values and ideals as well.   When I think of these issues we confront as people and as a  representative body, I always feel that we must use an approach that is  rooted in values that uplift our whole communities. The values of  equality, justice, and acceptance come to mind when I think of the need  to pass the Equality Act.   Far too long, our LGBTQ neighbors have been forced to live a life of  fear, a life in hiding, a life of oppression, and a life of  instability.   We have come a long way in the LGBTQ rights community, but we have a  long way to go. The Equality Act is a step in the right direction on  this important path toward justice.   I think of the right side of history, when the right to marriage was  afforded to same-sex couples, the moment when our LGBTQ neighbors in  Michigan were able to create that special bond with their loved ones.   But I am also reminded of the stark reality that they faced being in  States where they could still be fired from their jobs the day after  their wedding for being gay.   I think of the trans community across the country that still faces  discrimination and violence, especially trans women of color who are  disproportionately targeted and killed. Our laws still do not protect  them.   LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis  and, too often, have little recourse. Fifty percent of the national  LGBTQ community live in States where, though they have the right to  marry, they still have no explicit nondiscrimination practices in other  areas of their daily life.   One's identity could still mean deep harm and even death for some  communities in this country, and we must change this.   I think of our LGBTQ neighbors who are denied public accommodation  just because of who they are and whom they love. I think about how we  are failing them by not living out our values rooted in justice.   This week, we have a chance to begin to change with the Equality Act.  We now have a pro-equality majority,  [[Page H3918]]  Madam Speaker, in this Chamber, and I am so glad we can change the fact  that LGBTQ folks are being denied housing, services, and employment in  the majority of our States.   I am so glad to be part of ensuring that everyone has full protection  in our civil rights laws, regardless of who they are and whom they  love.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I also would love to recognize the fact--it  is pretty historic--that Madam Speaker who is presiding over this  Chamber right now is a member of our beautiful community, of the LGBTQ  community. That, to me, is pretty historic as we now are debating and  putting forward the Equality Act. That is Congresswoman Angie Craig.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), my  colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Haaland).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Porter).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin  (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who  puts this Special Order together every week, has truly been committed  to the rights of our LGBTQ neighbors, and I am very pleased that many  of my colleagues tomorrow, in a very bipartisan way, are going to be  supporting a historic, historic bill: the Equality Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
