 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from California for  supporting this very important legislation.   We all, all of us in California, have experienced what happens when  you have radical environmentalist nonsense determining policy. We have  just gone through one of the worst droughts in our history, yet during  that drought, those wonderful California environmental planners saw to  it that billions of gallons of freshwater were dumped into the ocean  instead of being redirected towards producing food crops in our Central  Valley area or providing water to drink or providing water so that  people could afford to have water throughout our State. Instead, it was  dumped into the ocean.   Now, what we needed and what we need now that the drought is over is  more water storage because we are in favor of people, not some  grandiose concepts of what a better view counts--now, without people in  it, that is, of course.   Now we need to think about what our policies will impact on average  people. And what we have in this radical environmental approach is  opposition to storing water, now that we have some extra water, right  after a drought.   Now, whose side are you on?   You can't tell me you are on the side of ordinary people, because  when water prices go up and there is not enough water for the crops,  the price of food goes up and the price of water goes up.   Who is the worst hurt?   America's lowest income people are the ones who are hurt the most,  the ones who can't afford to pay the little extra for food that it  costs when it costs more money to grow crops in the middle of a  drought.                                time  1515    So with that said, I dramatically support doing something for the  people, not some environmental theory--nonsensical theories in most  cases--that we are facing doom if we store water.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    If we store water, that is going to be bad for the  environment? I mean, I am sorry. That makes no sense to me.   And it doesn't make sense to ordinary people either that after a  drought, that in some way it is against the environment to make it  easier for us to store water so we don't have to have the same  destruction and the same lowering of the standard of living of our  poorer people when the next drought comes around.   This act by Mr. Tom McClintock, H.R. 1654, will make it easier and  quicker for us to build these dams. By the way, if we don't do this,  many of those dams will probably be built, only we are talking about  the evaporation not of water, but of money. After you have to go  through years and years of paperwork, what evaporates is the money that  should be going into education and transportation programs.   No. It is wrong all the way around not to permit people to go as fast  as we can rationally and engineeringwise to build storage for our water  supply today so when the next drought comes around, ordinary people  won't be hurt.
