 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is no secret that our economy has  broken some pretty amazing records lately. Last week's job report  surpassed all estimates and expectations, with a whopping 263,000 jobs  created in April alone. The first quarter saw 3.2 percent growth, which  is the best in 4 years.   I still recall, back during the previous administration, when we were  told that 2 percent growth was the new normal and that we could never  grow our economy the way we have seen in recent months. Obviously, 2  percent growth is not the new normal for the American economy. We all  ought to be relieved and comforted by that fact.   The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.6 percent--the lowest level in  nearly half a century. Everybody who is able-bodied and willing to work  and willing to be trained for jobs that pay well I believe has an  opportunity to do so these days. There is no doubt that this is an  incredible time for our economy, and I am confident that the pro-growth  policies that we have brought to the table during this administration  and during a Republican majority in the House and the Senate will  continue to bring real benefits to families across the country. But we  have also broken another record, one that has a much more negative  impact, and that is especially in my State of Texas.                                   S. 1303    In March, Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 103,000  migrants along the southwestern border--the highest number since 2007.  Unlike previous times when we saw numbers on that scale, these are  people who simply show up at the border and turn themselves in to the  Border Patrol and claim asylum--mainly families and unaccompanied  children, if you could believe that. To put this figure into  perspective, it is more than double that of the same period last year  and more than six times that in 2017. So something is clearly afoot.   Our country is simply not equipped to manage this sort of massive  influx, and folks in my State are bearing the brunt of the humanitarian  crisis.   Again, I would remind those listening that the first person who  called this a humanitarian crisis, in 2014, was President Barack Obama.  He called it a humanitarian and security crisis. It has  [[Page S2627]]  gotten worse since then, not better. Many of our cities along the  border and nongovernmental organizations--faith-based organizations  that take it as part of their mission to deal with the needs of  migrants along the border--are struggling to manage the growing need  for humanitarian relief, as well as businesses and manufacturers that  feel the tight squeeze of backed-up border crossings.   Most folks here inside the beltway probably couldn't comprehend the  cross-border traffic and how interdependent our economy really is.  There are 14,000 to 16,000 truck trips a day across the U.S.-Mexico  border at Laredo. As the already understaffed Customs and Border  Protection has tried to manage the flow of family units and  unaccompanied children entering our country, Customs agents had been  pulled off of that duty--their ordinary duties--causing lanes to be  closed and wait times to skyrocket. I was told by some American-based  car manufacturers that they simply have had to hire charter aircraft to  fly from the Mexican side of the border to the U.S. side of the border  in order to meet their just-in-time inventory needs because, otherwise,  trucks bringing those same parts across the border that ordinarily  would have taken an hour to get across now are taking 14 hours or more,  simply disrupting their supply chain and threatening to put many people  in the interior of the United States out of work if this situation  continues or gets worse.   The aerial footage of the border looks more like a parking lot than a  port of entry. Cargo trucks and personal vehicles sit at a complete  standstill, backed up for miles. People are supplying drivers with  water. Can you imagine being stuck in your car for hours on end with no  preparation for food or water--or fuel, for that matter--based on the  amount of time sitting idly in line?    With nearly $1.7 billion in products crossing our border every day,  as I have said, these delays have had a serious impact on manufacturers  and retailers in industries ranging from automobiles to medical devices  to just simply the produce that we take for granted in our grocery  stores.   A report released last week by the Texas-based Perryman Group  estimated that these slowdowns could cost the U.S. economy $69  billion--$69 billion--over a 3-month period. Nearly half of that--an  estimated $32 billion--would be a direct hit on the Texas economy.   Last week, I heard from the Chamber of Commerce in San Antonio and  the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce about these wait times. Their members  are facing delayed orders and increased shipping costs because of these  wait times, and they want us to do something about it. That is not an  unreasonable desire or request.   Unlike a lot of folks inside the beltway here in Washington, they  have to manage this crisis. They have to deal with it. They can't  ignore it or turn their eyes in another direction. They don't care  about talking points or winning a messaging war. They want a solution  to their problem. So, now, in addition to the humanitarian and security  crisis that President Obama talked about in 2014, we have the beginning  of a full-blown economic crisis as well.   It is an understatement to say that there is a lot of disagreement on  what the solution might look like, but anyone who has taken an  elementary school class can tell you that, for it to pass a Republican- led Senate and a Democratic-controlled House, this must be bipartisan.  I should say that anybody who has happened to see ``Schoolhouse Rock!''  should know that it is going to have to be bipartisan and bicameral and  that the President has to sign it in order for it to pass.   Over the years, I have worked closely with my friend and fellow Texan  Henry Cuellar on legislation to strengthen both border security and  customs operations along our State's border with Mexico. Henry is a  Democrat from Laredo, TX. I, obviously, am not, but that doesn't mean  we can't find common background. That is actually what I believe our  constituents sent us here to do--not to sacrifice principles but, when  there is a problem to be solved, to work together in a bipartisan way  to try to solve it. So last week, we introduced a bill that could bring  those recordbreaking border numbers back down and finally provide some  relief for law enforcement, for our cities, for our NGOs, and for our  businesses struggling to manage.   I have spent a lot of time with the officers and agents who defend  our borders every day, and I always ask them: What can I do to help  you? What do you need from Congress in order to succeed at the job we  have asked you to do?   There are two common answers I hear. One is to close the loopholes  that serve as a magnet or a pull factor on this massive wave of  humanity from places like Central America into the United States, with  people claiming asylum because they know they can exploit the loopholes  that exist in the law and be successfully placed in the United States,  never to be heard from again as they blend into this great American  landscape. In other words, they know they can successfully make it from  here into the United States unless these loopholes are filled. That is  what the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection have implored  us to do, along with the Department of Homeland Security--to close  these loopholes.   The main people benefiting from these loopholes in our asylum laws  are the human traffickers, the drug traffickers, and the people who get  rich moving this massive humanity from Central America into the United  States. They charge, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, or $8,000 a person. Of  course, these are also the same criminal organizations that move drugs  into the United States, trafficking women and children for sex.   Last year alone, we know that 70,000-plus Americans died of drug  overdoses in America. About half of them was from opioids, including  heroin--90 percent of which comes from Mexico--along with the synthetic  opioid known as fentanyl, which those of us working here know is much  more powerful and much more dangerous than heroin, which is dangerous  in and of itself. The same people who are trafficking in these migrants  are trafficking in the drugs that are killing Americans on a daily  basis and taking advantage of the desire of women and children to make  their way here to the United States and turning them into virtual sex  slaves.   The people who have patiently and properly tried to enter our country  legally are frustrated by illegal border crossers who try to game the  system and use well-intentioned laws as a literal get-out-of-jail-free  card.   One of the most frequently exploited loopholes is known as the Flores  Settlement Agreement, which was created to ensure that unaccompanied  children aren't spending long periods of time in the custody of the  Border Patrol. It was and remains an important protector for the most  vulnerable individuals who come across our border and ensures that  these unaccompanied children may be processed and released either to  relatives or to the Department of Health and Human Services.   A later, misguided ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in  2016 effectively expanded the time cap for unaccompanied children to  families--that is, adults bringing one or more children across the  border with them. These smugglers and human traffickers aren't fools.  They see this as an opportunity to be exploited, and they know that by  posing as a family, these individuals will be released after 20 days  and can virtually disappear into the interior of the country. The child  traveling with them could have been kidnapped, smuggled, or  trafficked--all of which has happened before.   Sadly, this is a common occurrence. The Department of Human Resources  announced last week that they have identified more than 1,000 cases of  fraudulent families trying to cross the border since October of last  year. Clearly, the criminal element is exploiting our laws and hurting  innocent children, and by doing nothing, we ourselves are complicit in  their bad behavior.   That is why we need to act. That is the one thing we can do. We need  to clarify that Flores only applies to unaccompanied children and not  to these family units who are gaming the system. First and foremost,  this would protect children from being used as an entry ticket by  criminals and smugglers, and it would also eliminate a pull factor for  those tempted to try to use this method to gain entry.  [[Page S2628]]    Of course, we know there are legitimate families who cross our  border, and we must take additional steps to confirm these biological  relationships and enable them to remain together in custody. No one is  advocating for separating these families from their children. The  HUMANE Act that Congressman Cuellar and I have introduced requires all  children to undergo biometric and DNA screening--something the  Department of Homeland Security has recently been testing. This was in  order to defeat the fraudulent claim of biological or familial  relationship with a minor child in order to gain entry into the United  States. I believe we have a responsibility to ensure that children are  actual family members and not being used as a pawn by the smugglers.   Our legislation also provides safeguards to prevent children from  being placed in the custody of dangerous individuals, such as sex  offenders or human traffickers. The last thing we should want to do is  welcome these unaccompanied children here to America, only to place  them, by action of the Federal Government, in the hands of sex  offenders or human traffickers because of our failure to take all  necessary caution to prevent it.   Consistent with the recommendations from the bipartisan Department of  Homeland Security Homeland Security Advisory Council, the HUMANE Act  would require DHS to establish at least four regional processing  centers along the southern border to house and process these families.  It is important that we provide them humane and compassionate housing  while they await their asylum hearing in front of an immigration judge.   By not doing so, by engaging in what has come to be known as catch- and-release, we essentially help facilitate the entry of these  individuals into the United States and encourage this pull factor that  would only encourage not only 76,000 migrants, like we saw come across  the border in February, not 103,000, like we saw come across the border  in March, but we are going to see those numbers continue to go up and  up and up and up, because, if you think about it, there is simply no  reason for them not to come. The smugglers are getting rich, and people  who want to come into the United States by falsely claiming grounds for  asylum have found a way to exploit our system. When we look in the  mirror, the only ones we can blame are ourselves for failing to act.   We know these regional processing centers could serve as a one-stop  shop, with DHS personnel, including asylum officers, on site to  adjudicate claims and expedite the entire process. We want to make sure  that if somebody does have a bona fide claim for asylum, they get to be  heard by an immigration judge and they get that immigration benefit to  which the law entitles them. But if they are not entitled to asylum, if  they can't make their case to an immigration judge, they should not be  able to do an end run around the system and enter the country under  false pretenses.   These central processing centers would also provide families with  better living conditions that can be provided at a CBP detention  facility meant to hold strictly single adults.   To prevent this humanitarian crisis from having a deeper impact on  legitimate trade and travel, this bill mandates the hiring of  additional Homeland Security personnel and upgrades our ports of entry  to expedite the legal movement of people and goods.   Just the binational trade with Mexico supports about 5 million jobs  in America; with Canada, another 8 million. That is why the North  American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, is so important, and now that  it has been supplanted by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement that we will  be taking up soon, it is very important for us to keep legitimate  commerce and trade flowing between Mexico, Canada, and the United  States because 13 million jobs or more in America depend on that  binational trade. That is another collateral piece of damage as a  result of this humanitarian crisis as well.   This is an opportunity for us to consider a bipartisan and bicameral  piece of legislation to solve a real and growing problem, and I hope  both of our Chambers will take seriously our responsibility to act and  to act soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
