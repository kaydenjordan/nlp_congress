 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. It is interesting to listen to the various arguments here,  but certainly there is unfair competition, if you will--it is hard to  even call it competition--overseas, but we have unfair trade practices.  Sugar policy here helps us defend ourselves.   These are manufacturing jobs in western Nebraska that utilize, very  responsibly, our natural resources, and I think it is only reasonable  to continue a policy that is not generally a cost to taxpayers.   I urge opposition to this amendment.
