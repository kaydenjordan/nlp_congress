 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De- Escalation Training Act of 2022, which would duplicate existing  programs.   S. 4003 creates a new Federal grant program to provide training for  law enforcement officers on de-escalation techniques, participation in  crisis intervention teams, making referrals to community-based service  providers safely responding to individuals in a behavioral or mental  health crisis, and alternatives to use of force.   It requires the Department of Justice to develop training curriculum  in collaboration with mental health providers, law enforcement  agencies, civil rights organizations, and other stakeholders.   It also authorizes $133 million in new money over the next 4 years  with no offsets.   There are several problems with this legislation. First, the COPS  Office at the Justice Department currently funds programs that already  do what this bill purports to support.                                time  1845    For instance, the COPS Office funds the Community Policing  Development De-escalation Training program through two different  mechanisms.   Through one mechanism, the COPS Office provides $3 million over the  next 2 years for the expansion of a network of regional centers to  provide nationally certified de-escalation training opportunities for  law enforcement.   The other mechanism, Law Enforcement Agency De-escalation Grants,  provides nearly $12 million in grant funding over the next 2 years to  support whole agency de-escalation, implicit bias, and duty-to- intervene training efforts.   These programs are appropriated and up and running as we speak  tonight.   We should not be creating new programs that are duplicative of  current programs without at least examining the efficacy of the  currently funded programs.   Second, this legislation represents a departure from traditional law  enforcement techniques, one that advances a soft-on-crime approach.   In recent years, these kinds of approaches to fighting crime have  been a boon to criminals and have led to our current crime epidemic.   We need to seriously address this crime epidemic, not fund  duplicative programs that would keep cops in cars.   Finally, this bill is yet another step in federalizing our local  police departments.   The bill imposes onerous reporting requirements that would be created  with input from liberal special interest groups which can amount to a  backdoor way to defund the police.   Law enforcement organizations that fail to meet rigorous reporting  requirements created by input from some organizations that advocated  for defunding the police would lose training funding under these  programs for 2 years.   Local policing is a function of local government. The Federal  Government should not be imposing its will over these departments and  expanding its spending program with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I offer this in closing and continue in our  opposition, we have programs that take care of this already, those that  are already expending $15 million. This has $130 million-  [[Page H9837]]  plus, and actually adds federalization of policing that's going to be  overseen by Federal agencies and special interests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
