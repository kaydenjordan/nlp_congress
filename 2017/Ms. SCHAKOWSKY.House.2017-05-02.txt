 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Actually, the idea of the 40-hour day began over--yesterday makes 130  years at Haymarket Square in the city of Chicago, my hometown. And the  idea is very simple: that after 40 hours of work, which is a reasonable  time in most industrialized countries in the world, that people then  get overtime pay. It is something that helps strengthen families and is  good for workers to have money in their pockets.   But the idea here, under the guise of flexibility--which is a really  nice word--is it allows employers to deny extra hours to workers who  want overtime. Instead, they can pick those who are willing to work  long hours without pay for promises in the future that they would be  able to have comp time, that they would be able to make it up at a time  of their boss' choosing. Oh, they say over a negotiation, but go ahead  and try and negotiate with your employer about that.   While the majority argues that providing comp time to private sector  workers creates parity between the public and private sector, workers  in the public sector have many more protections than workers in the  private sector right now.   Union density in the public sector is five to six times the union  density of the private sector. Workers represented by unions have far  more bargaining power than unrepresented workers, greatly increasing  the potential for employer abuse of comp time and decreasing the  employees' ability to defend themselves from such abuses.   Workers in the public sector have more job security, higher wages  than their private sector counterparts. This means public sector  workers are less likely to be putting their jobs at risk. So this is  just a bad idea, hurts workers, hurts families, hurts the longstanding  idea of the 40-hour workweek.
