 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 3494.   As the United States learned in 2016, there are few things more  important to our democracy than ensuring that our electoral system is  kept free from outside interference.   We also have a responsibility to educate our partners and our allies  about the threat from foreign interference, as well as share our best  practices with those nations that face similar threats.   Taiwan, one of Asia's most vibrant democracies, is acutely aware of  the risks posed by foreign influence. The Chinese Communist Party,  angry that another nation has the audacity to prove that a culturally  Chinese democracy can thrive, will stop at nothing to degrade Taiwan's  political independence.   This year's Intelligence Authorization Act requires the Director of  National Intelligence to report on influence operations China conducts  to interfere in Taiwan's upcoming 2020 elections and find out what  assistance the U.S. government provided to counter these operations and  provide a comprehensive list of the specific organizations that  conducted these influence operations.   The U.S. is in a unique position to share the tools and techniques  with others that we are implementing to safeguard our own democratic  elections.   In line with our obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, we urge  the administration to do all it can to assist Taipei with creating  conditions for a free, fair, and secure election that is free from  interference.   This provision brings us one step closer to that goal.
