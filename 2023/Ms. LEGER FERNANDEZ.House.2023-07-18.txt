 Mr. Speaker, I completely agree as well that we  do have an issue that we must address in terms of improving our  education system, investing in our students, investing in our schools,  but does this bill do this? Absolutely not.   Last night in Rules, we actually had the debate about the fact that  in the Education Committee, what has come out so far is nothing that  addresses reading, math, STEM.   What has come out so far is the kitchen sink of culture wars, and our  families do not want culture wars in our schools. They want us to focus  on learning, on making sure that our students cannot just survive but  thrive.   So here we are, standing on this floor once again to debate a bill  that would defund our schools and dehumanize asylum seekers and  immigrants.   I remind my colleagues that one of the first asylum seekers that we  know about was when a mother put her young baby into a raft, into a  basket, and sent that baby down the river, and he was saved. His name  was Moses.   Asylum seekers today are doing the same. They are trying to flee  incredible violence and get refuge here in the United States.   Republicans stated last night that the academic success and safety of  our students must always be placed first. No exceptions.   If it is no exception, then why are we not addressing gun violence  which is the biggest cause of death and injury for children in school,  and, sadly, also in their neighborhoods?   This bill does nothing to address gun violence even though more than  344,000 children directly experience gun violence; even though in just  6 months this year, we have already had 188 school shooting incidents  with 143 victims in our schools. When will you take up saving our  children in our schools by addressing gun violence?   So rather than making sure our students can thrive and stay alive in  schools, this bill would defund our schools with an empty gym. That is  all we are talking about; an occasionally empty gym used on the coldest  winter night or hottest summer day to shelter asylum seekers who have  already been processed through the system. At this point in time, they  are actually around. They have a legal pathway that they are seeking.   Republicans have decided to politicize the border and immigration.  They ignore the fact that apprehensions at the southern border are down  by 70 percent. They are down by 70 percent because of Biden's policies.                                time  1300     Yes, we have a broken immigration system, but  whose fault is that?   Last Congress, we passed several bipartisan immigration bills,  including the American Dream and Promise Act and the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act.   Did any of the Republicans pushing this bill vote for those, vote for  the problem solvers? No.   I will end with this: Matthew 25:35 reminds us: ``For I was hungry  and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a  stranger and you welcomed me.''   I ask my Republican colleagues to show the same humanity in this bill  and vote against it.
