 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, Keisha was 16 years old when she ran  away from a foster family to avoid being sexually assaulted by that  family. She thought she was finally safe from abuse when she met a man  named Mastur D.   Mastur D promised her that he would return her to her biological  family. But he lied. He forced her to have sex with other men for  money. Now she found herself to be a trafficked victim of the sex slave  trade.   Mr. Speaker, she was arrested for prostitution. After her second  arrest, authorities finally rescued her from the trafficking scourge  and provided her a way out of that situation.   My legislation, the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, will increase  prosecutions for perpetrators of human trafficking, like Mastur D, and  hold those accountable for their crimes of sex slavery.   We must support victims of human trafficking and put their predators  where they belong: behind bars. Tomorrow is Abolish Human Trafficking  Day, our society must prosecute the traffickers and rescue victims of  this scourge on America.   And that is just the way it is.
