 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S5595]]     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we start  the vote now.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The estimated       total cost is $2.35 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives  [[Page S5596]]       of the United States by improving the security of a major       ally that is a force for political stability and economic       progress in the Indo-Pacific region.        The proposed sale will improve Japan's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing a long range,       conventional surface-to-surface missile with significant       standoff range that can neutralize growing threats. Japan       will have no difficulty absorbing these articles into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon, Tucson, AZ.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Japan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-69       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Tomahawk Block IV/V All Up Round (AUR) consists of       the RGM-109E Tomahawk cruise missile assembled in a canister       for surface launch. Tomahawk Block IV/V capabilities include:       increased system flexibility; improved system response times;       improved lethality against an increased target set; improved       accuracy; improved Anti-Jam GPS Receiver (AGR) with Selective       Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and or M-Code       capability; enhanced availability due to a 15-year       maintenance interval; and two-way communications between       missile and Strike/Missile Controllers via Satellite       Communications (SATCOM).        2. The Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (ITWCS)       consists of command and control, targeting, mission planning       and distribution of the Tomahawk cruise missile.        3. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that Japan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Japan.                            ____________________
