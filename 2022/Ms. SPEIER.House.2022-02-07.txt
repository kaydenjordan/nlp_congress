 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for the opportunity.   This is nothing short of profound; the impact it is going to have on  60 million Americans who don't even know that they have agreed to  forced arbitration and the fact that in 98 percent of the cases of  sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace, the employer  wins.   We had a hearing last week in which the NFL staffers at the  Washington Commanders talked about the sexual harassment and sexual  assault that they endured. One of them said in the year and a half that  she worked there, she was sexually harassed every single day.   Let me speak about Loretta Lee of California who was fired from  Google after complaining about male coworkers making lewd remarks,  sending her disturbing messages, hiding under her desk, and showing up  at her apartment. In addition to losing her right to file suit, she was  also forced to meet with her perpetrators, resulting in retaliation.   Representative Bustos has done a great service to men and women who  are sexually harassed and sexually assaulted in the workplace. I  commend her, and I applaud her.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for this amendment  and for the legislation.
