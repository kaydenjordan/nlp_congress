 Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of the  remarkable life of an extraordinary woman, a true Georgia treasure,  First Lady Rosalynn Carter. I extend my deepest condolences to her  family and friends.   In my representation of the citizens of Georgia's Fourth  Congressional District, it is my honor to acknowledge the indelible  impact Mrs. Carter had, not only on the State of Georgia but also on  our country.   From her tireless advocacy for mental health and disability rights to  her dedication to humanitarian causes, Rosalynn Carter exemplified the  essence of public service.   A graduate of Georgia's Southwestern College in Americus, Georgia,  Rosalynn Carter was an accomplished woman who graduated as  valedictorian of her class in 1946.   She became an accomplished businesswoman while establishing herself  as an equal partner to her husband, Jimmy, who would later become  President of the United States.   Mrs. Carter was a devoted wife and mother, and her love and support  for her husband, President Jimmy Carter, was unwavering.   Her grace, resilience, and unwavering commitment to fostering a  compassionate society have left an enduring legacy.  [[Page H6136]]    In her selfless pursuit of making the world a better place, Rosalynn  Carter embodied the finest qualities of leadership, even expanding the  role of First Lady by attending Cabinet meetings and offering wise  counsel to her husband, our President.   As we celebrate the life of this consummate southern gentlewoman, let  us all commit to living a life such as hers, one that has enriched the  fabric of our country and serves as a guiding light for generations to  come.   I thank the gentleman representing Georgia's Second Congressional  District (Mr. Bishop) for organizing this Special Order hour.
