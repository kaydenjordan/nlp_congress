 Madam Speaker, being a parent is a sacred responsibility,  and every parent simply wants what is best for their kids. That is why,  over the past year, we saw parents speak up at local school board  meetings all across the country.   Whether it was pushing back against the radical teachings of critical  race theory or voicing their opposition to mask mandates or allowing  boys in girls' bathrooms, parents were standing up for their kids.   However, the National School Board Association deemed people  exercising their First Amendment rights as domestic terrorists, and the  Department of Justice used this narrative to launch investigations into  parents.   Now we are learning from a whistleblower that the FBI was using  antiterror tools to monitor parents and adding threat tags to files to  track them. This is absurd. We should never criminalize parents for  speaking up for their children.   To make matters worse, we now know the Attorney General lied under  oath when he said there was no coordination between the DOJ and the  National School Board Association. This administration has weaponized  the DOJ for political gain and has chosen to stand with teachers unions  over parents and students.   These actions are tyrannical, and Congress must know the extent to  which parents were spied on.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding and  for sponsoring this evening's Special Order.   Madam Speaker, this week the Labor Department's consumer price index  jumped 6.2 percent in October from a year earlier, reflecting an  increase in the cost of goods and services as well as energy and food.  Fuel costs surged 30 percent.   I have a quote from someone here in Washington about that. This  politician said, ``By all accounts, the threat posed by record  inflation to the American people is not transitory and is instead  getting worse. From the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans know  the inflation tax is real and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain  Americans feel every day.''   Now, that wasn't my colleague, Congressman Johnson. That wasn't  Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy or Congressman   Jim Jordan. No. That  was Senator Joe Manchin who said that just today. He is recognizing  that not just West Virginians, but all Americans are feeling the pain  at the pump, at the grocery store, and all across the economy.   It is coming from legislation that our President pushed earlier this  year and that House Democrats helped get behind--the so-called American  Rescue Plan. No less than our President himself said this about public  frustration, ``And people are feeling it. They're feeling it. Did you  ever think you'd be paying this much for a gallon of gas? In some parts  of California, they're paying $4.50 a gallon.   ``That's why it's so important that we do everything in our power to  stabilize the supply chain.''   But what he did through passage of this American Rescue Plan is  actually cause inflation to jump that much further forward, and he  conceded on Wednesday that inflation is at a three-decade high because  people have more money now as a result of the $1.9 trillion stimulus  legislation.   And what has he proposed to do now?   Double down and spend an additional $2 trillion.   What does he think that will do to inflation in this country, Madam  Speaker?   He has already said, ``And the irony is: People have more money now  because of the first major piece of legislation I passed. You all got  checks for $1,400. You got checks for a whole range of things. . . . It  changes people's lives.    ``But what happens if there's nothing to buy and you got more money?  . . . It creates a real problem.''   He did say that, and it did create a real problem. It creates a  problem to the tune of inflation rates at a 30-year high and gas prices  up 61 percent from last year.   So if the President recognizes that his last multitrillion-dollar  bill caused the economics peril we are facing, then why is he proposing  spending an additional $2 trillion on social programs we don't need and  we can't afford--150 new government programs?   Propping up the Green New Deal won't solve the economic crisis.  Weaponizing the IRS against Americans won't lower inflation. Taxing  middle-class families won't put more money in the people's pockets.   Do you know what would actually help get this country's economy back  on track, Madam Speaker?   Fiscal responsibility. Americans want a Thanksgiving meal that won't  be the most expensive in the history of the holiday, not a progressive  wish list that will only make the situation worse.
