 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the  150th birthday of the city of Hutchinson, KS.   In 1871, Clinton Carter ``CC'' Hutchinson got the Atchison Topeka and  Santa Fe Railroad to route through what is now Reno County and  Hutchinson, KS. Upon the arrival of the railroad, Hutchinson was  incorporated as a city in August 1872. At first, the city was a rail  town, using the railroads to help advance the local area's ranching and  farming operations. Upon the discovery of salt, Hutchinson developed  into a mining town as well, quickly earning the moniker of the ``Salt  City.''   Since its incorporation 150 years ago, Hutchinson has grown into an  industrial hub for central Kansas. From Carey Salt and the Cosmosphere,  to Dillons Grocery and the State fair, Hutchinson and its citizens play  an integral role in telling the story of Kansas. Thanks to investments  of both time and money by community members, Hutchinson remains a  vibrant  [[Page S4438]]  community today with a bustling Main Street, a world-class golf course,  and a robust agriculture industry.   On August 18, the city of Hutchinson and its residents celebrated the  town's 150th birthday with a block party down Main Street. I would like  to thank everyone in Hutchinson for the pride they have for their city,  as well as thank everyone who helped organize the sesquicentennial  celebration.   I now ask my colleagues to join the residents of Hutchinson in  celebrating the city's 150th birthday, as well as recognize them all  for their contributions to the city's 150 years of history.                            ____________________
