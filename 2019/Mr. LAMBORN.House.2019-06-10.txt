 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot  be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to  immediately schedule the born-alive bill so we can stand up and protect  the sanctity of human life, and I would ask all of us to join in that  request.
