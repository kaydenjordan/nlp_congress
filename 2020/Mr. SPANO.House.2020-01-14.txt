 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Lakeland Police  Department's finest. Officer Paul Dunn was a United States Marine Corps  veteran and worked in law enforcement  [[Page H224]]  for over 20 years. He started with Lakeland P.D. in 2013 and epitomized  courage and sacrifice.   Officer Dunn sadly passed away following a tragic on-duty traffic  crash on January 9. He leaves behind a devoted wife, who is a detective  with Lakeland P.D. and five children.   This is the second officer Lakeland P.D. has lost over a 5-week  period, and their losses have a wide impact on the surrounding  communities. Yet the thin blue line that Officer Dunn was a part of  continues to serve, continues to protect, and continues to allow us  peace of mind.   I am grateful for him and for all of those who don the uniform with  dignity, fairness, and justice. I thank them from the bottom of my  heart.   Mr. Speaker, our prayers are with the family of Officer Dunn. He was  treasured in our community.                            ____________________
