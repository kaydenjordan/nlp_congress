 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for our vital ally, Israel. The recent rocket attacks launched by Hamas  terrorists against innocent Israelis must be unequivocally condemned,  and our support for Israel's right to defend herself must be crystal  clear.   Between President Biden's weak leadership and anti-Semitic comments  made by Members of this very body, terrorist organizations like Hamas  feel that they can get away with attacking our ally. They have  emboldened them.   The world is watching, and there is no room for silence or  appeasement of terrorists. Congress and the Biden administration must  immediately reaffirm America's longstanding commitment to Israel and  offer any and all support.   Mr. President, wake up. There is only one democracy in the Middle  East, and we must stand with Israel.                            ____________________
