 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mark DeSaulnier for introducing  this bill.   This legislation will allow the Contra Costa Water District to assume  control over the Contra Costa Canal. It will make important safety  improvements by enclosing the waterway to protect against accidental  drownings. As Mr. Gianforte indicated, there have been 81 drownings.   Now, if you look at the canals: It is a hot day. They look  refreshing. It looks safe. It is not. It is very, very dangerous. Even  the best swimmers can drown in those conditions.   It will also improve both the water supply and the land around the  canal for recreational use. Additionally, it will upgrade the fish  screening equipment to better protect endangered species.   Title transfers such as this will reduce the backlog for repairing  and upgrading infrastructure and may reduce duplicative Federal  approvals. These type of water projects are the kind of pragmatic  policymaking that we should be focusing on on a bipartisan basis.   This bill is one of many pieces of legislation that is necessary to  maintain the health of the California delta, which supports the  livelihoods of farmers, businesses, and families in my district.   Above all, we need policies that focus on water efficiency and  resilience. This program will increase the resilience of the canals.  This is forward-thinking legislation that concentrates on mitigating  increasing damage from climate change.
