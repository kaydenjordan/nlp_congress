 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am at a loss for words to describe  what happened yesterday in Helsinki, Finland. I am disappointed, as  well, by the stunning silence of some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle in response to it.   When each of us is elected to serve in Congress--the House and the  Senate--we are asked to take an oath, a very serious oath. In it, we  swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The President of the United  States similarly swears to preserve, protect, and defend the  Constitution of the United States.   Yesterday in Helsinki, Finland, the President of the United States  was engaged in an appalling display. What we saw at that press  conference--standing just several feet away from Vladimir Putin, the  leader of Russia--was the President's decision to turn his back on the  organizations and agencies of the U.S. Government, to question their  credibility, and to affirm, incredibly, that Mr. Putin had given a  powerful denial to what they have found when it comes to the Russian  interference in our last election.   Just days after bullying our key NATO allies and failing to publicly  accept that Russia attacked our country, attacked our democracy, this  administration and its enablers here in Congress are failing that oath.   President Trump refuses to accept the findings of American  intelligence professionals, the Department of Justice, the Department  of Defense, and virtually every agency of our government that is tasked  with keeping us safe and instead accepts Vladimir Putin's absurd, self- serving denials. Many of my colleagues here in Congress refuse to even  speak up to denounce the President's actions.   Consider what happened months before the 2016 election when our  Nation's top intelligence officials came and told key congressional  leaders about the Russian cyber attack on the United States. The  administration at that time, under President Obama, was deeply  concerned. President Obama was looking for a bipartisan response  condemning Putin's efforts in the closing days of the elections so as  to avoid any hint of partisanship in the public announcement and to  present a unified deterrent.   What was the response of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell after  hearing this alarming revelation that Vladimir Putin was actively  interfering in our elections and trying to undermine our democracy?  Senator McConnell's response: No thanks. We are not going to help. And  incredibly, neither the Senator nor his party did.   Is there anyone in the Senate--anyone who took the oath to protect  our Nation against enemies, foreign and domestic--who thinks any of us,  regardless of political party, should receive help from a foreign  adversary to get elected? I hope we all agree that country must come  before party. So then why do so many of my Republican colleagues remain  silent in light of President Trump's open denial of the reality of  Russia's involvement in our election?   Yesterday, we watched in disbelief as the President not only refused  to even acknowledge the act of cyber war against the United States but,  incredibly, blamed America first for our poor relationship with Russia.  We watched our American President refuse to stand up to Vladimir Putin,  a former KGB official, who executed one of the most breathtaking cyber  attacks in history aimed at the United States and aimed at undermining  the Western security alliance and our country's democracy. An American  President stood on the world stage next to a tyrant--a tyrant who  denies that he attacked us--and then the President of the United States  repeatedly agreed with that adversary and dismissed criminal  indictments of Russian Government officials responsible for the attack.  The President closed with a rambling preening about his great election  victory.   We have an American President who seems to be utterly incapable of  saying  [[Page S4975]]  the obvious to Vladimir Putin. The President should say: Don't ever  interfere in U.S. elections again. I don't want your help, and I don't  believe your absurd denials. He refused to say that.   Compare his bizarre and dangerous comments in Helsinki with what  President Ronald Reagan said before the 1988 NATO summit. Instead of  bullying our closest allies, Ronald Reagan said:         Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy       partnership between North America and Europe, for this is the       foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially       depends.    Again, Ronald Reagan said:         Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy       partnership between North America and Europe, for this is the       foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially       depends.    There is at least one Republican Senator who is not silent. My friend  and a great American patriot, John McCain, said this yesterday about  the Helsinki press conference:         Today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most       disgraceful performances by an American President in memory.       The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism,       false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to       calculate. . . . President Trump proved not only unable, but       unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be       speaking from the same script as the President made a       conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair       questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested       platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world.    I could not agree more. It is obvious. We, all of us, Democrats and  Republicans, should agree with what John McCain said.   Despite President Trump's shameful denials of Russian interference at  yesterday's farce of a press conference, the evidence is clear: Russia  did interfere in the 2016 election. Our intelligence agencies and the  bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee have concluded that not only  did Russia interfere in our elections through cyber attacks, but they  did so to harm Hillary Clinton, help elect Donald Trump, and undermine  our democratic process.   When Donald Trump hears those words, it sends him into a rage. He  denies any Russian interference for fear that it might reflect on his  victory in the election. There is no evidence that has been produced to  date that shows that Russian interference changed the outcome of that  election. I am not questioning whether Donald Trump won the Electoral  College and became President, but I don't think he should question  whether the Russians were trying to undermine that process.   During his ongoing investigation into Russian meddling, Special  Counsel Mueller has so far indicted 32 individuals and 3 companies on a  total of 191 criminal charges. This includes the February indictment of  13 Russian trolls who engaged in a multiyear effort to influence our  election, to support the election of Donald Trump by sowing discord and  inflaming social tensions online.   The Mueller investigation includes 12 members of the Russian military  intelligence, specifically named, who were indicted last Friday for  engaging in a sustained operation to hack into the emails, accounts,  and computer networks of the Democratic National Committee, the  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary Clinton's  Presidential campaign.   These Russians also created online personas and worked with WikiLeaks  to publish the stolen documents. To cover their tracks, they committed  identity theft, engaged in money laundering, and at one point leased a  computer in my home State of Illinois to store and move the stolen  documents through encrypted channels.   Additionally, the Russians hacked into the computer networks of  election officials and vendors in order to steal voter data and other  information. The indictment, produced by Special Counsel Mueller,  mentions that the Russians ``hacked the website of a state board of  elections . . . and stole information related to approximately 500,000  voters, including names, addresses, partial social security numbers,  dates of birth, and driver's license numbers.'' This was, presumably,  in reference to the Illinois State Board of Elections, which we already  knew was one of the first victims of a successful Russian cyber  attack--a Russian cyber attack that President Donald Trump refuses to  believe ever happened.    We know that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and we know that we  should be gearing up for Russia to interfere with the 2018 midterm  election as well. Just this past weekend, Director of National  Intelligence Dan Coats, my former Republican Senate colleague from the  State of Indiana and a man for whom I voted for this position and whom  I respect very much, reiterated the ongoing threat that Russia  presents, saying: ``In regard to state actions, Russia has been the  most aggressive foreign actor--no question--and they continue their  efforts to undermine our democracy.''   What a departure from what President Trump said in Helsinki  yesterday. His own Director of National Intelligence has refuted the  statement he made to the world yesterday, agreeing with the ``powerful  statement'' of Vladimir Putin's that he had nothing to do with an  attack on our election. Our President is cozying up to Vladimir Putin  at the expense of the credibility of his own Director of National  Intelligence. Why is this happening?   Instead of condemning President Trump and supporting the Special  Counsel's efforts of getting to the bottom of this, sadly, the vast  majority of congressional Republicans are actively working to undermine  the investigation.   Just last week, Senate Republicans confirmed the nomination of Brian  Benczkowski to serve as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the  Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. They voted for Mr.  Benczkowski to be in charge of 600 Federal prosecutors despite the fact  that Mr. Benczkowski, as a lawyer, has never been in a trial--never. He  has never been in a courtroom and has never been in a trial. He was  named by President Trump to head up the Criminal Division of the  Department of Justice. That may not be the worst part.   Mr. Benczkowski, in his private law practice in Washington, also  chose to represent a Russian bank, the Alfa-Bank, which has deep ties  to Vladimir Putin. This is despite the fact that when he was called on  it, he said he would not commit to recusing himself from this Russia  investigation.   Furthermore, this vote occurred as President Trump and House  Republicans had been looking for an excuse to fire Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein, who is overseeing the Mueller investigation. Should  Rosenstein be fired, Mr. Benczkowski could be easily tasked by the  President to oversee the Russia investigation. That would be an  unmitigated legal disaster.   Enough is enough. Today is the day that, I hope, my colleagues-- Democrat and Republican alike--will step forward and speak up.   The world is still reeling from the comments that were made yesterday  in Helsinki by the President of the United States of America. There are  serious questions from our longtime NATO allies--those who count on the  United States for the safety and security of their republics. There are  serious questions in their minds about who we are, what we stand for,  the relationship between this President and Vladimir Putin--a  relationship which is absolutely inexplicable in that President Trump  would refuse to concede the obvious--that Vladimir Putin is setting out  to undermine our values in the world.   President Trump should stand with the brave men and women of law  enforcement, intelligence, and the Department of Defense who have  warned him about Vladimir Putin, and he should not be so easily swept  away with these meetings he has.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, back in the day when I was a trial lawyer  and we had had a witness come to the stand who had made a big mistake-- who had said something that would hurt your case or, maybe, even decide  it the wrong way or who had misrepresented someone--you went through a  period of rehabilitating the witness, which meant, basically, asking  friendly questions and trying to get that witness back into a credible  position. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.   This afternoon, President Trump attempted to rehabilitate himself for  his performance in Helsinki, Finland.   The President said:         While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts       of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of       Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way--the Fake       News is going Crazy!    I don't think that comment is going to rehabilitate President Trump  from his performance in Helsinki. It was sad, heartbreaking, and, in  many ways, infuriating to think that he stood within a few feet of this  Russian tyrant and said he believed that man, Vladimir Putin, more than  he believed the intelligence agencies--the Department of Defense and  the Department of Justice--of the United States of America. That was  what he said, and it was a moment that will not easily be forgotten. It  is not something he can talk his way out of.   He made similarly incoherent and jarring comments moments ago in an  apparent damage control event. He went so far as to say that our NATO  allies ``were thrilled'' with his recent visit during which he bullied  and belittled them.   In some moments, the President loses touch with reality. He believes  that we are suffering from national amnesia and that we can't remember  what happened yesterday or last week. We remember. The reason we  remember is that it is such a dramatic departure from the conduct of  previous Presidents and that it is such a dramatic departure from the  history of the United States. I think our President's sense of history  reaches back to the day before yesterday and not far beyond.   He does not realize, as President Reagan said so often, that our NATO  alliance is critical to the security of the United States and to our  European friends and to the world. He just doesn't get it. He doesn't  understand why that alliance is so critical. He belittles it. He  bullies the members. He picks some of our strongest allies and decides  to make them spectacles of his performance. That doesn't make it any  easier for them to continue to stand by our side, and it, certainly,  doesn't put them in a position of trusting us in the future if they  desperately need us.   My mother was born in Lithuania, in the Baltics. I have been there  many, many times. They are great little countries--Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania--and next-door, Poland. They have seen a lot over the years.  They have been overrun by Nazis and Communists, and they have seen  their freedoms be eliminated under autocratic rule. They believed, when  they finally restored democracy about 25 or 30 years ago, that their  only chance--their only guarantee of any future--was going to be with  the NATO alliance, with becoming part of Europe--with becoming part of  this great alliance with the United States.   Last night, I was with Gordon Smith, a former Senator from Oregon. We  both  [[Page S4988]]  remembered a visit to Lithuania in 1999 where there was this rally,  this small rally, in one of the public streets in Lithuania. It was a  NATO rally or, as they called it, ``GNAT-OH.'' They were chanting in  Lithuanian how much they wanted to be part of NATO. They understood  then and they understand today that the NATO alliance is Lithuania's  ticket to freedom, that the NATO alliance is its insurance policy. The  NATO alliance gives it hope that there will not be another generation  of Lithuanians who will live in suppression and chains.   When the President belittles this and suggests that, perhaps, the  Baltics are on the table when he talks of Vladimir Putin, it strikes  fear in the hearts of God-fearing people who basically can still  remember what it means to be under the heel of the Communist leadership  of Moscow. The President just doesn't get it. He does not understand  the importance of it. He, certainly, doesn't understand Vladimir Putin.  To think that he would allow Putin to use what he called ``powerful  words'' and deny what we already know to be true says that the  President is very gullible.   What is it about this relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir  Putin? How can you explain this? Why would a President of the United  States be bowing and scraping to this Russian tyrant--to a man who has  a dismal record when it comes to human rights, to a man who led his  troops in the invasion of the nation of Georgia and who invaded Ukraine  and who took over Crimea, to a man who set up a situation in Syria in  which innocent people would die and in which their own tyrant would  succeed, to a man who invaded our election process as he did?   I guess what we are looking for now, as our minority leader, Senator  Schumer, said earlier, is an accounting of what actually happened in  Helsinki. This disastrous meeting between President Trump and Vladimir  Putin needs to be fully explained to the American people. I join with  Senator Schumer in calling for hearings with the President's Helsinki  team--with Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, and with Dan Coats, the  Director of National Intelligence and a man I greatly respect, who  showed a steel spine this last week as he witnessed the President's  turning on him and the intelligence community, and with Mr. Huntsman,  our Ambassador to Moscow. They should all be coming to Washington  quickly to explain what happened and how to repair the damage created  by President Trump.   We need to see a transcript of the one-on-one meeting with President  Trump and Vladimir Putin. If he were so deferential in his public press  conference with Vladimir Putin, what did our President say to Putin  behind closed doors? It is not too much for the American people to ask  for an accounting.   We need to make sure that the Republicans will join us in protecting  the Office of Special Counsel. So far, Robert Mueller's investigation  has led to the indictments of 32 individuals, and 5 have already pled  guilty. The latest included 12 Russian intelligence agents who were  specified by name as being involved in the efforts to undo our  election.   We also need something that is very basic and, I think, that all of  us have now come to realize is essential. President Donald Trump can no  longer refuse to disclose his income tax returns. He did it throughout  the campaign. He has refused to make a disclosure since. We need to  know his financial relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin's  oligarchs. There has to be more to the story than we know today, and it  is time for this President to come clean.   Finally, we need to press for election security legislation. We live  in a dangerous moment. I also agree with former Senator Dan Coats. It  is a moment at which the Russians will try to take advantage of us.   My last plea will be to my colleagues who have not spoken out clearly  on this subject--not to the Presiding Officer, because he has spoken  out, and I respect him so much. We need them to come forward and make  it clear on a bipartisan basis that we stand together when it comes to  foreign policy, the values of this Nation, and the security of the  United States. We understand that Vladimir Putin has been a tyrant who  has really made life miserable and who has killed many innocent people  in his rage against the West and against the United States.   Most of all, we need more Republican Senators who will join with  those in the past who have stepped forward and put country first over  party. I remember reading the history of the Nixon years and the  breaking point. The breaking point finally occurred when people like  Republican Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, stood up and said:  ``There are only so many lies you can take, and now there has been one  too many.'' He joined with several other Republican Senators and went  down to the White House and sat face-to-face with President Richard  Nixon. They sat directly in front of him and explained that enough was  enough.   It will take that. It will take that again for Republican Senators to  have the courage to meet with this President and tell him he has to  stop giving away the heritage, the values, and the legacy of the United  States of America.   Those courageous Americans back in that day were, of course, talking  about lies, corruption, obstruction of justice, and dangers to our  democratic system. They took the oath of office. It is the same one we  have taken to protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and  domestic, and to, certainly, put party second to our obligations to our  Nation.   For their courage, we and history owe them a debt of gratitude. Since  yesterday's fiasco with Putin, only one Republican has spoken  specifically on the Senate floor about this crisis. He was joined by  the most eloquent statement by John McCain, who, because of illness,  could not be physically present. That is it. It is not enough.   I yield the floor.
