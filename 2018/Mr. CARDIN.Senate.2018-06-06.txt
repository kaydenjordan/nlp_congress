 Mr. President, next month will be the 65th anniversary of  the armistice that ended the battles and bloodshed of the Korean war.  As I am sure my colleagues know, the Korean war was never officially  ended. Over the last 65 years, we have seen hostility on the Korean  Peninsula. We have seen North Korea develop nuclear weapons, raising  security concerns, and active in cyber attacks and human rights  violations. The list goes on and on in the context of a formal state of  war between the north and the south.   The United States has made major investments in this region as a  result of our security concerns and our national interests. We helped  rebuild Japan and South Korea, we developed allies that share our  values, which is certainly in our interests, and we created a military  deterrent against a belligerent North Korea. Yet, during this period of  time, the Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea developed a nuclear weapons  program, including delivery systems. It violated international  commitments. The international community, led by the United States--I  must say, empowered by this Congress, which gave the administration the  ability to impose sanctions--with the leadership of the United States,  sanctions had been imposed against North Korea, and those sanctions had  impact.    This year, we saw a breakthrough with there being some hope of  security in the future. With the election of President Moon of South  Korea, the South Koreans have a leader who wants to have a better  relationship with North Korea, and the use of the Winter Olympics  helped to develop confidence between North Korea and South Korea. Now  President Trump is scheduled to meet with Kim Jong Un at the Singapore  summit on June 12, where there will be great opportunities. We hope  this will be an opportunity to end the war between North and South  Korea, create a framework to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and  forge a path toward stability and security for all.   It starts with an acknowledgment by North Korea that it has violated  international norms. That is the reason sanctions have been imposed. It  has an illegal nuclear program; its missile program violates  international norms; and it has created an oppressive regime against  the basic human rights of the North Korean people. Clearly, diplomacy  is our best option. That was the purpose of imposing sanctions--so that  we could get to this moment at which diplomacy actually may lead to  results. We couldn't have gotten here if we had not had a strong  sanctions regime imposed against North Korea.   As I have said all year, Congress gave the administration the tools  with which to do that. In working with our partners around the world,  the United States led in the effort in isolating North Korea in its  continuing down this path. We now have an opportunity for diplomacy.  Diplomacy is our best option. If we have to use the military, the risk  factors are so great as to what could happen that it begs the point  that, really, the only successful option is for diplomacy to work.   This is where we have hope, because there is a common objective  between the principal parties in trying to use diplomacy to end this  crisis. North Korea and China very much want to preserve the Kim Jong  Un regime. China does not want to see a democratic country on its  border. It wants to preserve North Korea's Communist regime. Obviously,  Kim Jong Un is interested in preserving his regime. The United States  and China have a common agenda in that both countries want to see the  Korean Peninsula absent of nuclear weapons.   Secretary of State Pompeo testified before the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee and indicated that the U.S. position is not for  regime change. I think that gave Kim Jong Un the ability to go forward  and say: Look, if the regime can be preserved and we get security  assurances, then we can do that without nuclear weapons. That gave us  the opportunity for diplomacy to succeed.   So where are we in regard to the summit that is scheduled in less  than 1 week?   I was pleased that the Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific, and  International Cybersecurity Policy, which is within the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, held a hearing this week with regard to the status  of the summit--with regard to what we can expect and how we should be  prepared. I appreciate Senator Gardner and Senator Markey, the chair  and ranking member of the subcommittee, for holding that hearing.   Joe Yun, who is the former top American diplomat and one of the  United States' leading experts on North Korea, was one of our  witnesses. Victor Cha, who is the former National Security Adviser for  North Korea, was the other witness. We had two of the top experts in  this country who understand North Korea, who understand Kim Jong Un,  who understand where we are in regard to what we can expect at the  summit that will take place on June 12. Both agreed that we will need  to have a realistic strategy in going into these negotiations.   I asked a specific question of the witnesses: Would Kim Jong Un be  willing to give up his nuclear weapons in going into these  negotiations?   Both agreed that was unlikely--unlikely, in the initial meetings,  that he would agree to give up his nuclear program.   What should we expect? What should the conditions be? We had a robust  discussion about that in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   It was pretty well agreed that it will start with a declaration by  North Korea of its current program. We will need to understand what it  is doing. We will need to know the venues of its nuclear program. We  will need to know exactly from where we will be starting. We will need  to make sure that the commitment to freeze that program will, in fact,  be carried out. We will need international inspectors to make sure  that, in fact, North Korea will not be advancing the program or its  missile program. Then we will need a plan to dismantle its nuclear  weapons program--all aspects of it. We will need to have a roadmap for  getting there. That is the realistic expectation of what we will be  able to achieve on June 12.   It is key for the United States to make it clear that we will not  make  [[Page S3019]]  concessions until we have at least reached that understanding--a  commitment to North Korea's dismantling the program, a freeze in place,  and inspectors in place. We will have to be patient, but we will also  have to be resolved that we will not make unilateral concessions.   This past week, several of my colleagues sent a letter to the  administration that outlined this. It was led by Senators Schumer and  Menendez, along with Senators Durbin, Feinstein, Brown, Leahy, and  Warner. I agree with the letter. Let me just quote some of the  conditions that are spelled out that we should be expecting in these  negotiations.   Ultimately, it should include the dismantling and removal of all  nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from North Korea. The goal  must be the full, complete, and verifiable denuclearization of North  Korea. North Korea must continue its current ballistic missile test  suspension. North Korea must commit to having robust compliance  inspections, including a verification regime. The agreement with North  Korea must be permanent in nature. These are conditions I would hope we  could all agree on.   The letter goes on to read something that is critically important. In  its addressing other critical matters, it includes North Korea's human  rights practices and the need for them to be included in these  discussions. Dr. Cha said it best when he said that a comprehensive  political settlement with North Korea must include its agreement to end  the regime's systematic violation of human rights.   I understand our objective is to make sure we have a denuclearized  Korean Peninsula, and I agree with that. Yet, for long-term stability  in that region, we need a North Korean Government that respects the  rights of its citizens, and those discussions must start taking place  on June 12.   Here is my concern and the reason I am taking this time today.   We have to be prepared for this summit. President Trump needs to be  prepared, but President Trump needs to be prepared by working with  Congress. That is where we know we are the strongest. I have seen no  signs whatsoever of any congressional briefings or consultations from  the Trump administration in leading up to the June 12 summit. We need  to be on the same page in going into these discussions. Yet we have had  absolutely no consultation. Dr. Cha said to consult with Congress given  its role in funding and ratifying an agreement. We need to be involved.   Let me just underscore as to what Secretary Pompeo testified before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I asked him a question as to  what role Congress should play in this. Secretary Pompeo volunteered to  say that he anticipates that this will be a treaty that will be  submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification if they are successful.  If we are going to be called upon to ratify a treaty or if we are going  to be called upon to change the sanctions regime against North Korea,  we will need to be part of the process. We will not have to reinvent  the wheel.   We ran into a similar issue in 2015 with regard to President Obama's  negotiations for an Iran nuclear agreement. At that time, I was the  ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I worked with  our distinguished chairman, Senator Corker, and other members of our  committee, including Senator Kaine and Senator Menendez and others, and  we came up with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. We know how  difficult it is to get consensus in the U.S. Congress on any particular  issue. Yet we passed that Review Act by a 19-to-0 vote in the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. It passed overwhelmingly in the Congress  itself, and it establishes a proper role for Congress in its review of  such an agreement.   It doesn't restrict the President in his negotiations; it strengthens  the President in his negotiations by giving him the power of the  American Government, including the congressional part of our  government. It strengthens the oversight of compliance. It did that  with Iran, and it would do the same thing with regard to North Korea.   Just as with Iran, there is no trust when it comes to North Korea. So  the final agreement must be verifiable, transparent, and make clear  that any violation will result in the strongest possible sanctions. Our  congressional role can complement both the ongoing and forthcoming  negotiations with North Korea. Such legislation will help Congress's  oversight and representative responsibilities to the American people.   As we go to this historic meeting that will take place next week, I  know that every Senator--indeed, every American--will want the  President to be successful in this endeavor to denuclearize the Korean  Peninsula and to bring security and stability to the region. The best  chance for that to happen is with Congress exercising its  responsibility and being in a position to support the efforts and  understand the efforts so that we can act with a united voice in  America. Let us act accordingly.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today we are proceeding to consideration  of the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, which  is fitting: On this day 74 years ago, thousands of American troops,  alongside our allies, executed a bold assault on the beaches of  Normandy. The bravery of those troops on D-Day in their stand against  Nazi tyranny and oppression has been admired by a grateful world ever  since. The Nazi regime upended democratic freedoms and espoused a  system of persistent human rights violations bent on trampling the  existence of minority groups which culminated in the concentration  camps and genocide. The accomplishments of allied forces on D-Day and  thereafter during Operation Overlord led to the defeat of the Adolph  Hitler's Nazi government and its heinous authoritarian, nationalist  ideology.   D-Day remains a sterling example of how international partnerships  and a spirit of collaborative defiance can overcome seemingly  insurmountable odds. It is also a stark reminder of what is required in  the presence of iniquitous leaders. The leaders of the D-Day alliance  and the troops who fought mightily that day on the beaches and in the  French countryside and towns deserve our most sincere thanks and  admiration. It is because of their bravery and hardship that the  western world remains free.   As we remember the courageous actions of those present that ``longest  day,'' I ask that we express our gratitude by carrying on their  example. We must resist the present-day reemergence of nationalist and  racist influences in the Western world and beyond. Concurrently, we  must hold authoritarian regimes accountable for their acts against  humanity. We must expand our diplomatic reach by strengthening our  alliances against authoritarianism. By working together like the daring  souls who fought on D-Day, we can secure a future free from cruelty,  oppression, and persecution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed two pieces  of bipartisan legislation that will increase access to capital for  small businesses and strengthen the Small Business Administration's  oversight of its largest lending program.   First, I want to talk about the Small Business Investment Opportunity  Act. This bill modifies SBA's Small Business Investment Company, SBIC,  program by increasing the amount of capital SBICs with a single fund  can invest in qualifying small businesses.   This legislation will unlock millions in additional capital for small  businesses with high-growth potential, create jobs, ensure the program  keeps pace with inflation, and align the program with changes Congress  made in 2015.   Earlier this year, I introduced the Senate version of this  legislation with Senators Risch and Kennedy as original cosponsors. It  was reported out of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee  in March by a vote of 19-0.   SBICs are privately owned and managed investment funds that use their  own capital--plus funds borrowed with an SBA guaranty--to capitalize  small businesses. The purpose of the SBIC program is to stimulate  investment in America's high-growth small businesses. The investments  are made at no expense to taxpayers.   This bill is straightforward. Under current law, SBA can guarantee up  to $150 million for a single SBIC investment fund. This legislation  increases  [[Page S3028]]  that cap to $175 million. The cap has not been raised since 2009.  Today, adjusted for inflation, the amount should be nearly $170  million. Raising this cap ensures the program keeps up with inflation.   This change also builds upon a bill Senators Risch and Shaheen and I  passed in 2015 that increased the maximum leverage from $225 million to  $350 million for SBICs with more than one fund, commonly referred to as  a ``Family of Funds.''   Aligning the maximum leverage cap for a single SBIC fund with that of  a Family of Funds expands the capacity of SBA and its private-sector  partners to deploy more capital to innovative, fast-growing small  businesses. These are firms that boost local hiring, support our  communities, drive innovation, and help our country maintain its  competitive edge. Last year, SBICs helped more than 1,200 firms,  creating or saving nearly 113,000 jobs.   Some of America's most iconic brands have received investment capital  from SBICs, including Apple, Tesla, Whole Foods, Staples, Intel, FedEx,  and Costco, among others.   Maryland is home to five SBICs, some with multiple funds. I would  like to highlight a few successful small firms that got financing  through a Baltimore-based SBIC called Patriot Capital.   CSS Antenna is based in Edgewood, MD. This firm designs and  manufactures products that support the wireless communications  industry. Patriot Capital invested in CSS Antenna to support new  product development and provide a stable layer of working capital to  nurture company growth. During the life of Patriot's SBIC investment,  CSS Antenna quadrupled its revenue and employee count, from 25 to 100.   Patriot also invested in Advantage Engineers, based in Columbia, MD.  This firm provides engineering services focused on the telecom,  geotechnical, and environmental services markets. Since Patriot's SBIC  investment in 2016, Advantage Engineers' has doubled its revenue and  tripled its employees from 200 to 600. This firm could benefit from  additional SBIC investment once the Small Business Investment  Opportunity Act is implemented.   Finally, for those of you who like to check the weather on your  smartphone, you might be interested to know that WeatherBug is an SBIC  investment. WeatherBug provides desktop and mobile users with real- time, local weather information.   WeatherBug is the product of Earth Networks, based in Germantown, MD.  Patriot Capital has provided various levels of SBIC capital to Earth  Networks to support a series of initiatives, including expansion into  Smart Home technology that allows you to remotely control your home's  lights, locks, and heating and cooling systems.   With passage of this legislation, I am hopeful that more investments  will flow to innovative small businesses in Maryland and throughout the  country.   I also thank my colleagues for supporting the Small Business 7(a)  Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018. The goal of this legislation is  to strengthen SBA's ability to conduct effective oversight of its  largest lending program, the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program, and 7(a)  lenders.   The 7(a) program, through government guaranteed loans made by private  sector lenders, provide small businesses with the capital they need for  a broad range of purposes, from working capital for payroll and  inventory to financing for buildings and equipment. The maximum loan  size is $5 million, the maximum term is 25 years, and the program  operates at zero subsidy, with costs covered by borrower and lender  fees.   Protecting the integrity and stability of the 7(a) program is  important because it is one of the largest sources of long-term capital  available to small businesses in our country. The program's longer  terms reduce the monthly payments for small firms and provide essential  working capital to manage startup and growth.   Last year, the SBA 7(a) loan program helped more than 62,000 small  businesses. Combined, they were approved for more than $25 billion in  loans, which supported more than 571,000 U.S. jobs.   In Maryland, the 7(a) loan program helped 833 firms, which pumped  nearly $300 million into local communities, supporting more than 6,700  jobs.   The Small Business 71(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018  strengthens SBA's oversight of 7(a) lenders in the following ways:  modernizes the definition of and compliance with the Credit Elsewhere  test; creates a streamlined process to prevent a shutdown of the  program with a process by which SBA can request an increase of the 7(a)  lending cap, up to 15 percent, after an appropriate waiting period;  ensures the Director of the Office of Credit Risk Management, OCRM, is  qualified and nonpartisan; improves the quality of lender reviews and  examinations; and strengthens the rights of lenders to get timely  reports of oversight reviews and appeal penalties.   Of the reforms we are enacting, two of the most significant are  modernizing the credit elsewhere test and streamlining the process to  increase the 7(a) program cap.   The credit elsewhere test is the bedrock of the 7(a) program. It was  created to ensure SBA is only backing loans to qualified borrowers who,  but for the guaranty, would not get a loan based on conventional market  standards. This lender oversight bill updates the credit elsewhere  definition to reflect current market gaps, reinforces OCRM's duty to  ensure lenders use the credit elsewhere test for the benefit of the  borrower and not the lender, and strengthens OCRM's authority to  substantiate how lenders determine and document the credit elsewhere  test.   Creating a streamlined process to increase the lending capacity of  SBA's largest loan program will provide needed stability to this  essential source of long-term capital for small businesses. Currently,  if the 7(a) program hits its lending cap, Congress must act  legislatively to raise the program level. Finding a timely legislative  vehicle is difficult and this legislative uncertainty can trigger  market uncertainty and shutdown the program.   To address this problem, this bill establishes a notification-and- wait process by which SBA can notify Congress of its intent to increase  the 7(a) lending cap, up to 15 percent, after a 30-day waiting period.  To prevent abuse of this authority, SBA may only increase the cap once  a year.   I support the 7(a) loan program and these lender oversight reforms. I  look forward to building on this legislation by identifying ways to  increase 7(a) loans to borrowers in unserved markets.                            ____________________
