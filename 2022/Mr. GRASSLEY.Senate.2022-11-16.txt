 Madam President, I want to share some words of wisdom  with my colleagues. These words of wisdom come from 13 former top  civilian and military leaders. I am going to start with the list of  eight former Defense Secretaries: Dr. Ashton Carter, recently deceased;  William Cohen, also a former Senator; Dr. Mark Esper; Dr. Robert Gates;  Charles Hagel, also a former Senator; Gen. James Mattis, besides being  Secretary of Defense; Leon Panetta, also a former Congressman; and Dr.  William Perry. Also added to this list are five former Chairmen of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff: GEN Martin Dempsey; GEN Joseph Dunford, Jr.; ADM  Michael Mullen; GEN Richard Myers; and GEN Peter Pace. They offer some  very sage advice for improving civil-military relations.   Everybody knows where this principle came from of civil control of  our military. It happened December 1783 when GEN George Washington  surrendered his papers to the Continental Congress and gave up being  commander in chief at that particular time.   These words of wisdom appear in an open letter that was published  September 6 in a national security blog, and that blog is entitled  ``War on the Rocks.''   I intended to speak about this letter at the time that I first read  it, but due to our extended recess, I am just now getting to it about 2  months late.   These former leaders warn us about what they call ``extreme strain''  in civil-military relations coming from all directions, and these are  the directions that this strain is coming from, affecting civil- military relations: the pandemic, with social disruption; wars that  ended with unachieved goals; military withdrawal from Afghanistan;  rising great-power rivalries; ``extremely adverse'' political  environment caused by the divisiveness of polarization in our American  society, evidenced here in the Congress of the United States; and  lastly, contested elections and the shaky transfer of power. After  listing these points, these defense leaders then predict rising  tensions.   This is a red flag that we all ought to observe. Civil-military  relations are out of balance.   Although alarming, the open letter is both educational and  reassuring. It offers guidance and remedies. Sixteen what they call  ``core principles and best practices'' are spotlighted for restoring  ``healthy American civil-military relations.'' Most of these remedies  hinge on the all-important principle of civilian control of the  military.   By the way, I spoke on that very subject from a different angle on  July 14 of this year.   The letter that I am referring to views civilian control as I do:  ``the bedrock foundation of American democracy.'' It is ultimately  ``wielded by the will of the American people as expressed through  elections.'' That core constitutional principle keeps our ``powerful  standing military'' from threatening democracy.   ``Healthy civil-military relations''--those four words are in  quotes--``Healthy civil-military relations'' are instrumental to  civilian control. They must rest on a rock-solid foundation of ``mutual  trust.'' Mutual trust and respect between civilian and military leaders  are essential for healthy civil-military relations. They are fostered  in part by honest deliberations over policy choices. According to this  open letter, mutual trust is cultivated when civilian leaders  ``rigorously explore alternatives that are best for the country  regardless of the implications for partisan politics.''   A ``dynamic and iterative process'' for policy development helps  ``civil-military teams build up a reservoir of trust.'' That extra  measure of trust will defuse friction when the military must  ``faithfully implement directives that run counter to their  professional military preference.''   When tensions rise over disagreement with the Commander in Chief's  policy choices, the former Pentagon leaders offer this guidance in  their very own words. And this is a fairly long quote:         Elected (and appointed) civilians have the right to be       wrong, meaning they have the right to insist on a policy or       direction that proves, in hindsight, to have been a mistake.       This right obtains even if other voices warn in advance that       the proposed action is a mistake.        Military officials are required to carry out legal orders       the wisdom of which they doubt. Civilian officials should       provide the military ample opportunity to express their       doubts in appropriate venues . . . members of the military       accept limits on the public expression of their private       views--limits that would be unconstitutional if imposed on       other citizens.        Civilian and military officials should also take care to       properly characterize military advice in public. Civilian       leaders must take responsibility for the consequences of the       actions that they direct.    Now, the advice of these former chiefs of staff and former  secretaries of defense is honest, it is direct, and squares very much  with the Constitution of the United States. The Commander in Chief's  orders must be obeyed. The military must refrain from criticizing the  President in public. And the President is accountable for policy  choices.   On partisan political activities, the former chiefs and secretaries  of defense offer a straightforward piece of advice:         There are significant limits on the public role of military       personnel in partisan politics, as outlined in longstanding       Defense Department policy and regulations . . . military and       civilian leaders must be diligent about keeping military       separate from partisan political activities.    The final best practice that they offer us covers the responsibility  of military leaders during the transfer of power after Presidential  elections. They--meaning the military--have a dual obligation. First,  they must assist  [[Page S6732]]  the incumbent Commander in Chief in the exercise of his or her  constitutional duty. And, second, since the voters choose the new  Commander in Chief, they must prepare to assist whomever the voters  pick.   They carry out their responsibilities regardless of who sits in the  White House. To summarize, this open letter provides sound advice that  could help to moderate civil-military strife. It telegraphs a message  to the top brass: It is time to hit the reset button and rebalance  civil-military relations.   Now, I don't know the motive behind this letter, because there wasn't  any indication of it, but the sum of it may be pointed directly at  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley. My advice to him:  Take their sage advice to heart. A dose of humility burnishes one's  integrity. As the Nation's most senior military officer, General Milley  has a responsibility to set an example of excellence and cease all  partisan political activity. Partisan political activity is harmful to  civil-military relations and has the potential for creating dangerous  divisions within the ranks of the Armed Forces.   Military personnel must stay out of politics. Period. End of story.   I yield the floor.
