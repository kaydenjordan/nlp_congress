 Madam President, today I wish to recognize and  commend MG H. Michael Edwards, who retired on March 31, 2017, after 43  years of exceptional leadership and service to our country, including  36 years in the Colorado Air National Guard. For almost a decade in the  position of the Adjutant General for Colorado, General Edwards was  responsible for the command administration of over 5,300 Army and Air  National Guard members. He also served as the Executive Director of the  Department of Military & Veterans Affairs and was a member of the  Governor's cabinet. He had responsibility for the Colorado National  Guard's primary missions of national defense and State emergency  response. In addition, he was responsible for supporting the missions  of the Civil Air Patrol's Colorado wing.   General Edwards received his commission in 1973, after graduating  from the U.S. Air Force Academy, and earned his pilot wings in 1974 at  Reese Air Force Base, TX.   He served as an F-4 pilot and AT-38 fighter lead-in instructor pilot  at Osan Air Base, Korea, and Holloman Air Force Base, NM, respectively.   General Edwards joined the Colorado Air National Guard in August  1980. He has served in numerous assignments in flying and operations,  as well as command positions at squadron, group, and wing levels-- culminating as the Adjutant General for Colorado. During his tenure as  Adjutant General, more than 6,000 Colorado National Guard citizen- soldiers and citizen-airmen have mobilized in support of overseas  contingency operations.   He also oversaw the Colorado National Guard's record-setting response  to some of the worst natural disasters impacting Colorado, including  the High Park Fire and the Waldo Canyon Fire during 2012, followed by  the Black Forest Fire and historic flooding along the Colorado Front  Range in 2013.   Furthermore, General Edwards was instrumental in bringing a new  National Guard cyber protection team to Colorado, bolstering the  state's cyber defenses. He also diversified the Colorado National Guard  through the appointment of its first female general officer.   Over a period of 10 years, General Edwards significantly grew the  Colorado National Guard's enduring relationships with the Republic of  Slovenia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under the National Guard  State Partnership Program. These military-to-military exchanges have  supported combatant command security cooperation objectives, promoted  regional stability, and increased partner capacity and  interoperability.   General Edwards has also overseen the missions of the Civil Air  Patrol's Colorado wing, consisting of more than 1,600 volunteers. Under  his leadership, the Civil Air Patrol took on a bigger role in State  response, flying fire watch and conducting flood damage surveys.  Colorado's Civil Air Patrol was first to fly support of the U.S. Army's  on-base unmanned aerial systems operations.   General Edwards has flown over 4,600 mishap-free flight hours in a  variety of aircraft to include the AT-38, A-7, C-21, F-4, F-16, T-37,  and T-38. Of note, he has achieved the distinction of the Wing's Top  Gun award on five separate occasions in his decorated flying career.  Major Edwards has received numerous military decorations, including two  Legion of Merit awards and three Meritorious Service medal awards,  along with many others from the State of Colorado.   General Edwards' operational experience, charismatic leadership, and  unyielding patriotism have served him well in a lifetime of military  service, both in the Colorado Air National Guard and abroad. Today we  honor his distinguished service to our Nation as one of the most  accomplished Adjutant  [[Page S3286]]  Generals in Colorado history. We offer our heartfelt appreciation to  his family for their countless sacrifices and selfless support to our  country spanning over four decades.   On behalf of the Senate and a grateful nation, I congratulate MG H.  Michael Edwards on a job well done and wish him the very best as he  begins a hard-earned retirement in the great State of Colorado.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor the  veterans of the Northern Colorado Honor Flight and the organization's  18th trip to Washington, DC. More than 120 veterans from various wars  and generations participated in this flight.   The Northern Colorado Honor Flight recognizes and celebrates the  bravery, fortitude, and selflessness of our Nation's veterans. Twice a  year, veterans are able to travel to Washington, DC, and visit the war  memorials that stand in their honor, free of charge. We are eternally  indebted to those who have served in our Armed Forces and have  protected the United States. These veterans have preserved our rights  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Few words are sufficient to show the gratitude and respect we all  have for the courageous men and women who have fought for our country.  Of the 123 veterans who participated in the most recent honor flight,  11 served in WWII, 24 served in the Korean war, and 88 served in the  Vietnam war.

On July  4, 1917, the Weld County Courthouse opened for business after a mere 28  months of construction. Denver architect William N. Bowman designed the  classical revival-style courthouse, and its original courtrooms remain  intact. This anniversary recognizes the rich history in northern  Colorado and is a reminder of Colorado's unique past.   Greeley, CO is named after Horace Greeley, one of the first  journalists to document his experience in the Wild West. Horace came to  Colorado during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush of 1859 and encouraged his  fellow Americans to ``Go West, young man, and grow up in this  country.'' Horace's words helped put Greeley on the map and ultimately  established the city as an important part of American history. Soon  after Horace explored northern Colorado, the Colorado Legislature  recognized Weld County as one of the first 17 counties in the Colorado  territory.   The Weld County Courthouse was one of the first buildings constructed  in Greeley. The first courthouse, built in 1861, served as a meeting  place for court proceedings and business matters. During this period,  the courthouse was only a one-room log cabin located near Platteville,  CO. The courthouse moved locations four times before the final  courthouse opened for business in 1917.   I would like to congratulate the citizens of Weld County on this  milestone, and I look forward to the future accomplishments of the  entire Weld County community.                            ____________________
