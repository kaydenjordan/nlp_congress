 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Senate floor this  afternoon to talk about a scandal of incredible proportion.   Since President Biden became President of the United States, 300,000  unaccompanied children have been encountered at the border and then  placed with sponsors inside the interior of the United States--300,000.   Ordinarily, there would be a process by which Health and Human  Services would attempt to contact those minor children, in the custody  of those sponsors, for a wellness check 30 days after they were placed  with them. The New York Times has documented that at least 85,000 of  those 300,000 children cannot even be reached--no response to the phone  call or any other outreach.   So under the Biden administration's policies, an untold number of  minor children have been placed with sponsors in the interior of the  United States, and the Biden administration can't tell you where they  are; the administration can't tell you what their condition is, whether  they are being sent to school, whether they are being recruited into  gangs, whether they are being sexually or otherwise physically  assaulted, or whether they are being neglected. They simply don't know.   Now, I know it takes a lot to get people's attention these days  because there is so much competing for our attention--so many different  types of outrage. But the fact that this hasn't been front page news  for a long time now or hasn't motivated the Biden administration to  actually do anything to change this situation leads me to the  conclusion that President Biden simply doesn't care. He doesn't care.  He doesn't care what happens to these children. If he did care, he  would do something about it, but he doesn't, apparently, care.   These are some of the most vulnerable individuals encountered at the  border. They come to the United States, not in the care of their  parents, but in the care of transnational criminal organizations, the  cartels--the coyotes, as they are called--who treat them like a  commodity. They don't treat them like a human being. They treat them  like a commodity because the only thing these cartels care about is  cold, hard cash.   This is a huge cash cow. And it is not just the children. It is the  other 5 million migrants encountered at the border, as well. All of  them pay these criminal organizations to transport them here to the  United States.   I mentioned previously that when I went to Yuma, AZ, with a  bipartisan group of Senators, that Border Patrol sector chief greeted  us by saying: Welcome to the Yuma Sector. It is a sleepy little  agricultural community.   He said: We encounter people from 176 countries, speaking 200  languages.   So people are literally being transported around the world to show up  at our border and claim a right to be admitted, and the Biden  administration continues to roll out the welcome mat and not deter  illegal immigration by people who cannot qualify, whom we know will not  qualify for any legal relief.   The children, particularly, endure a dangerous and long journey to  our country, and they are often exploited en route. We heard from one  of the witnesses in the Judiciary Committee yesterday about them being  particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking, but we know they are  subjected to violence and other forms of exploitation as well.   You would hope that once these children arrive at the border, they  would be safe. I think that is our obligation, to make sure they are  safe.   But over the last few years, we have seen mounting evidence that  shows that tens of thousands of these migrant children who show up at  our border without a parent or legal guardian are placed with sponsors  and are essentially lost by the administration. Again, they don't know  where they are. They don't know what is happening to them.   And, of course, we all should be concerned that they are being taken  advantage of in a multitude of ways and being damaged in ways that we  don't want to even imagine.   In August 2021, Bloomberg reported that Federal law enforcement was  investigating unaccompanied migrant children who had been released to  labor traffickers. This is kind of like modern-day slavery. The  reporting uncovered situations where dozens of children were released  to the same sponsor--dozens of children to the same person. You think  that would have raised some questions, and maybe they tap the brake a  little bit and investigate further--apparently not, because this same  individual then exploited them for labor in poultry processing  facilities. It is impossible for me to understand why the  administration wouldn't see the warning signs.   About a year later, Reuters reported on another deeply concerning  discovery. Federal and local officials were struggling to locate a  dozen migrant children in Houston. They simply lost them. The Health  and Human Services refugee office conducted an emergency review and  found that 57 migrant children had been reported missing in Houston  since the year prior--lost by the Biden administration.   As bad as those two reports are, the story does not get any better.  Recent reporting by the New York Times has  [[Page S2112]]  confirmed that these aren't just the exception. These are part of a  deeply disturbing trend, and it shows what bad things can happen to  innocent children when their own government doesn't even care.   Of course, many of these are migrant children so, technically, I  guess, the United States isn't their government. But we owe them a duty  while they are in our country to protect them from the predators and  the exploiters--the traffickers.   In February, the New York Times published its first story detailing  widespread exploitation of migrant children. It includes countless  stories of unaccompanied migrants who are working dangerous jobs that  violate child labor laws: a 15-year-old girl, for example, who packages  cereal at night in a factory; a 14-year-old boy working on a  construction job; a 13-year-old day laborer; children working at meat  processing plants, commercial bakeries, and suppliers for automakers.  These are not after-school jobs. These are grueling and dangerous full- time jobs that are meant not for children but for adults.    Two months later, the Times published another story that detailed the  extent to which the Biden administration officials knew about these  abuses and chose to ignore them--willful ignorance.   The Health and Human Services Department received warning after  warning that some of these migrant children were at risk. These  warnings came through government staffers, outside contractors, and on  the Department's own hotline established for that purpose. But not only  were whistleblowers ignored, many were silenced, pushed out of their  jobs. They were retaliated against for trying to protect these  vulnerable children. These concerns made their way to the highest  echelons of the Biden administration.   Health and Human Services Secretary Javier Becerra was aware of the  credible reports of trafficking abuse but continued to push for the  expedited placement of migrants with sponsors, with no regard for the  dangers that presented.   At one point, he reportedly told his employees:         If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have       never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an       assembly line.    So here is the highest level government official, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services, a member of President Biden's Cabinet, who  considers placing vulnerable migrant children in a dangerous situation,  as he regards it as an assembly line.   Then-Labor Secretary Marty Walsh was aware of the situation as well.  Last year, the Department's investigators identified major instances of  child labor violations that took place in auto parts factories and  meatpacking plants. Former Secretary Walsh even confirmed that the  Department included details about these situations in its weekly  reports to the White House. So at least Secretary Walsh was appearing  to do his job by reporting this to the top-level officials at the White  House.   Until last month, Susan Rice served as the Director of the White  House Domestic Policy Council, where she oversaw virtually every aspect  of domestic policy matters, including the placement of migrant  children. When the border crisis reached a fever pitch during the  summer of 2021, Ms. Rice's team received a memo from Health and Human  Services managers about possible labor trafficking. Two people  confirmed that Ms. Rice was told about the contents of the memo, but  the White House now disputes that claim.   High-ranking Biden officials saw clear warnings that children were in  danger and chose willful blindness. They did nothing to rescue these  children from a dangerous situation or to prevent more young migrants  from meeting the same fate.   In the wake of these damning reports, we have yet to see a thorough  investigation or explanation of how this happened. How could the  administration fail these children so badly over and over and over  again? How could they not act on credible reports that children were  being exploited?   This is a disgusting failure of leadership, and it is dangerous. We  need to get answers and accountability, and we need to fix it,  something the Biden administration apparently does not care enough to  do. If they did care, they would fix it. But they obviously don't care.   Following the second New York Times report, I wrote a letter to  Chairman Durbin of the Judiciary Committee that was cosigned by every  Republican. We urged him to invite these three Biden administration  leaders who failed to act in the face of these warnings to testify in  front of the Judiciary Committee. That included Secretary Becerra,  former Labor Secretary Walsh, and former White House adviser Susan  Rice.   The Judiciary Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, is  charged with oversight of the Unaccompanied Children Program, and we  have a duty to ensure that these children are treated humanely. We need  to know who made the decision to loosen vetting requirements for  sponsors and why those decisions were made. We need to hear from the  current and former administration officials who knew about the  widespread abuse of migrant children and yet chose not to act. We need  a thorough explanation of how the Department is changing its policies,  assuming it is, to prevent more children from being placed with  dangerous sponsors. And we need to know how those responsible for these  grotesque abuses will be held accountable.   But in the Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, we didn't get any  of that information. None of the officials that I mentioned that we  requested actually testified. They didn't show up. So not only have  they neglected the cries of these vulnerable children to do something-- anything--they didn't even care enough to show up at the Judiciary  Committee yesterday to explain why they failed to act in the face of  these cries for help. We didn't hear from a single current or former  Biden administration official. There was not one witness on the five- person panel who could shed light on the decisions that caused so many  of these migrant children to be exploited.   If our Democratic colleagues are as disturbed as I am about what I  described, I hope they will join Republicans in a bipartisan push to  get Secretary Becerra, Secretary Walsh, former White House domestic  policy adviser Susan Rice to testify under oath before the Judiciary  Committee and before the rest of the country.   These senior administration officials saw the warning signs, and they  chose to ignore them. They continued to press for the rapid placement  of these children with sponsors, and they didn't apparently care enough  to make sure that they could track where these children were and what  was happening to them. Now they need to explain their decisions on  behalf of the Biden administration to the Senate.   I can't imagine the Biden administration doing a worse job responding  to this border crisis than it has.   If you set out to design a system that would fail, it would look  something like the current policies of the Biden administration. By  refusing to secure the border, the administration has allowed criminal  organizations to smuggle fentanyl and other deadly drugs into the  country. It has enabled more than 1.5 million ``got-aways'' to evade  Border Patrol and slip into the United States.   And it has released hundreds of thousands of migrants before we had  sufficient information about who they were, where they were going, and  when they needed to report to court. Migrants in some cities reportedly  wait as long as 10 years to present an asylum claim in front of an  immigration judge. And we know that only maybe 15, max 20 percent of  them will be able to legitimately show a right to asylum.   So the 80 to 85 percent have had to wait in line for 10 years--or the  15 percent or so with valid claims have had to wait in line for 10  years because of the 80 to 85 percent who can't qualify; but they have  gummed up the system so bad by the sheer volume of cases, even people  with legitimate claims can't get heard. And now we are seeing how the  administration looked the other way and allowed migrant children to be  exploited on American soil.   So my question is, how long will we have to go before our colleagues  join us in demanding a change? Because failure to do something is, in  fact, a choice. Are we going to choose to let  [[Page S2113]]  this exploitation of these migrant children continue when the U.S.  government who placed them with these sponsors doesn't even know where  they are, whether they are getting a good education, whether their  healthcare needs are being attended to, or whether they are being  recruited in gangs, sex-trafficked, exploited, neglected?   I started out by saying I don't believe the Biden administration  cares; but I do believe Members of this body care. And it is within our  power to change it. That is a choice, in and of itself.   Now, some of my colleagues like the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee said, yeah, we need to get together and talk about  comprehensive immigration reform, but we have had those conversations  the entire time I have been in the U.S. Senate. We cannot leverage  these innocent children for other unrelated measures.   The same problem with the fentanyl and drugs coming across the  border. People say, well, we need to do something. Well, we can't do it  until we do comprehensive immigration reform. The DACA population, the  Deferred Action on Childhood Arrival, these young people who came here  as children who now are in a box canyon not of their making because  President Obama overreached and created a program without working with  Congress.   Each of those problems, I think, deserves to be addressed on its own  merits. But you can't tell me that you are serious about solving the  problem if you say, well, we can't do this, we can't fix those problems  until we deal with all of the immigration issues as a whole, because I  don't see that happening anytime soon. Meanwhile, these children will  be languishing, being exploited, and worse.   The young people who are uncertain about their future because they  received this Deferred Action on Childhood Arrival, but now it has been  held illegal, unconstitutional by a Federal judge in the Southern  District of Texas--and the families that are grieving because their  loved ones took a pill they thought was relatively innocuous, but it  was contaminated with fentanyl, and their son or daughter lost their  life--do you want to tell these people to keep waiting? Just wait until  we pass a massive immigration reform bill containing other matters. You  wait. They shouldn't have to wait. And we shouldn't let the neglect and  the willful blindness of the Biden administration prevent us from doing  our duty, Republican and Democratic Senators alike. It is within our  power to do it. But doing nothing is a choice too. And I hope that is  not a choice we will make.   I yield the floor.
