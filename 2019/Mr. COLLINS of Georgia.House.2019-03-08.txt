 Madam Speaker, last Congress, the Judiciary  Committee interviewed multiple DOJ and FBI officials about their  actions regarding the 2016 elections.   People anticipate the Mueller report soon. Will he find any so-called  collusion, or was the only collusion among agency personnel who hated  the President and started this investigation?   Our interview transcripts were pertinent to a congressional  investigation; but the 115th Congress ended, the investigation was  closed, and copies were shared with certain Members of Congress.   Out of an abundance of caution, we gave DOJ an opportunity to review  them for information that would endanger national security; but after  many months and little progress, our patience grows thin.   The proposed redactions had nothing to do with national security and  are anathema to our goal of government transparency. I am, therefore,  today making one of those transcripts public.   Madam Speaker, to avoid burdening GPO with a 200-page transcript, I  include in the Record the link www.dougcollins.house.gov/ohr so the  American people can review the transcript of Bruce Ohr.   I intend to make other transcripts public soon. I am willing to  consider any reasonable redactions DOJ makes in a timely manner but  won't allow these transcripts to remain shrouded in secrecy.                            ____________________
