 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my district, the  most important energy district in the country, on behalf of American  energy independence, and on behalf of all Americans who are searching  for a reasonable solution to a looming crisis.   There are approximately, right now, 229 major fossil fuel projects in  the United States currently awaiting permit approval. A recent study  found that $157 billion in energy investment was stuck in the NEPA  pipeline and that simply a 2-year NEPA deadline would spur $67 billion  in energy investment. Killing energy projects by the bureaucratic red  tape nightmare and the slow-walking that we have seen is unacceptable.  No more.   I am extremely proud of the energy reforms, the NEPA reforms, and the  EPA reforms in this bill, the first in over 40 years, which will speed  up over 200 projects to lower costs for consumers and protect our  national security.   No, this bill is not perfect, and arguably, it shouldn't be. A  divided government yields compromise and slows the heavy hand of  government, but saving $2 trillion, lifting families out of poverty,  and defunding IRS agents is worth it. Vote ``yes'' for America's energy  independence.
