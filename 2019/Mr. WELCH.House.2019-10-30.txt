 Madam Speaker, very soon in this House, we will have a  chance to do something that America needs done, America wants done, and  we can do it together, and that is to lower the cost of prescription  drugs in honor of our wonderful Elijah Cummings.   The United States is the only major country where the government of  the people does not protect the people against price gouging by the  pharmaceutical industry. We have got to change that.   Our drug bill will bring down prices over a half a trillion dollars.  That will start to alleviate the pressure on premiums that is coming at  the expense of raises for workers.   The benefit of this approach will not just be for our Medicare and  Medicaid programs--really important programs--but the lower prices will  benefit employer-sponsored healthcare as well.   So, if you are taking medication that is insulin, or if you are  taking medication in an EpiPen, you are going to get a lower price.  But, even if you are fortunate that you don't need the medication, your  premiums are going to go down.   Madam Speaker, let's come together and pass this reduction in  horrible medical expenses.                            ____________________
