 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to honor the lifetime  of achievement of Mr. James Holmes.   Following decades of service to the Culpepper community and 35 years  of service to the Culpepper County Electoral Board, Mr. Holmes is  stepping down as the current chair of the board at the end of this  year.   Growing up in Culpepper, Mr. Holmes attended George Washington Carver  School and was among the first integrated classes at Culpepper High  School.   Mr. Holmes' determination to improve our Commonwealth for future  generations of Virginians brought him back to Culpepper after he  graduated cum laude from Virginia Union University and earned his J.D.  from Howard Law School.  [[Page H194]]    A licensed and ordained Baptist minister who has pastored in  Culpepper for decades, Mr. Holmes has held many positions with the  Wayland Blue Ridge Baptist Association.   From his service on the electoral board to casting an electoral vote  in 2008 for our first Black President, Mr. Holmes has demonstrated a  commitment to civic engagement and elevating the voices of Virginians  within our communities.    Mr. Holmes has touched many lives throughout his career as president  of Culpepper Housing and Shelter Services, president of the Culpepper  County United Way, president of the Culpepper County Equalization  Board, and as a caring member of his community.   Today I stand on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives to thank James Holmes for his commitment to progress,  equality, and community empowerment.                            ____________________
