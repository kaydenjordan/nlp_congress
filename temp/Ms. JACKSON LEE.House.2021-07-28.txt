 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this En Bloc  Amendment to H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations  Act for FY2022, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 15, 16,  and 17.   I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and  State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DeLauro  for including them in this En Bloc Amendment.   Jackson Lee Amendments No. 15 and No. 16 have been approved several  times by the relevant subcommittee, made in order by the Rules  Committee, and adopted by the full House; Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17,  while being offered for the first time, makes a very important  contribution to the health and safety of the global community.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 will designate $1,000,000 to combat the  trafficking of endangered species.   The amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million  focus to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered  species, to confront the transport of the remains of killed endangered  species.   The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being lured off a  protected preserve was an indication that we needed to do more to  protect endangered species at risk of being killed.   At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as  original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endangered and  Threatened Species Act of 2015.   This bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in ,  countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife  countries for protection.   The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is again offered in the same spirit:  to prohibit the taking and transportation of any endangered and  threatened species as a trophy to the United States.   Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect most wildlife  animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise decisions  that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the warning  signs.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is one that the House has strongly  supported in the past because it would bring greater awareness and  protection to these beautiful and vital populations that are too often  taken for granted, by allowing this amendment to address the senseless  trafficking in trophy killings of all endangered and threatened  species.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 provides funds to be allocated for  Global Health Programs to the fight against the practice of Female  Genital Mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York  to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia,  or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.   For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are  mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to  be at risk of FGM/C, annually.   The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 prioritizes funding for foreign  assistance to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an  internationally recognized violation of the human rights of girls and  women comes to an end.   Finally, I thank the Rules Committee for making in order, and  Chairwoman Lee for including in this En Bloc Amendment, Jackson Lee  Amendment No. 17, which increases and decreases the Global Health  Programs fund by $1,000,000 to emphasize the national commitment for  USAID to provide unused vaccines that would otherwise be destroyed to  countries in need around the world.   Increasing the availability to those countries in need of superfluous  but life-saving vaccines is what a great nation does; not only is it  the right thing to do, but it also builds goodwill and rebuilds  important global relations that were ruptured by the previous  Administration.   With the spread of Covid-19 variants on the rise, Jackson Lee  Amendment No. 17 will help our neighbors in this hemisphere, and our  friends and allies around the world cope with this ongoing global  public health crisis.   I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc Amendment and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022.

I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc Amendment and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022.    Mr. Speaker, COVID cases in America are rising. They  are rising in almost 25 States. Texas happens to be one of the States  with the largest number of COVID cases.   The United States has over 31 million cases and, of course, over  600,000 who have died.   Hospitals today in certain areas are full, and the plague or the  impact, tragically, on those who are unvaccinated. But the story goes  on.   As we begin to enter school, children under 12 cannot be vaccinated,  even though research is going on.   Here is my plea: To those in the 18th Congressional District, in  Houston, Texas, in Harris County, in Texas, and in the Nation, the  unvaccinated should get vaccinated. The surge is creating a rise in the  pandemic again.   If we are to get back to normal, find someone that you agree with  that comforts you--your faith leader, your best friend--and talk about  the importance of getting vaccinated.   People are dying. Children will become infected and/or carriers when  they go back to school. Everyone in school should be vaccinated. Yes,  in the schools today, going back, you must be masked. You should wear a  mask, and wear a mask inside, even if you are vaccinated. We are trying  to save lives.   Get vaccinated. It will save lives.                            ____________________
