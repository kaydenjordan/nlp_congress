 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60,000 members  of the Hmong community in Minnesota who recently celebrated their 41st  new year celebration.   My home State is home to one of the largest Hmong communities in the  Nation. They are great neighbors and coworkers, and they have been an  integral part of the fabric of our State and culture since the first  Hmong family arrived in 1975.   Although I was not able to participate in this year's new year's  ceremony, the celebration's theme of ``Embracing the Present, Inspiring  Future Generations'' could not be more appropriate. Minnesota's Hmong  families and leaders have worked hard to embrace everyone in their  surrounding communities and inspire those interested in learning more  about their rich heritage and history.   I thank all the Hmong in our great State of Minnesota for their many  years of friendship with our office and wish everyone a happy and  healthy new year.                            ____________________
