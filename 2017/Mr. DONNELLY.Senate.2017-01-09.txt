 Madam President, I rise today in support of the  amendment Senator Hirono and I are offering to protect Medicare and  Medicaid for the millions of Americans who currently count on these  programs for health coverage.   This week, some of our colleagues are beginning the process of  repealing the health care law. I want to be clear. I don't think it is  a perfect law. In fact, I have long agreed with many of my colleagues  in saying it has work to do, and for years we put forward ideas on ways  we can work together to improve it.   The repeal strategy we are debating this week, however, is not about  improving the health care system. It is about taking people's health  care away. And make no mistake, the consequences are very real. A  repeal strategy, particularly with no alternative, would throw our  health care system into chaos, taking away coverage from nearly 30  million people, increasing premiums on working Hoosiers and families  across this country, and threatening to take us back to a time where  anyone with a preexisting condition could not get coverage.   It doesn't have to be this way. If we are serious about improving  health care in this country, we can do this work together. That is what  the American people expect. Just as Hoosiers go to work every day to  make life better for their families, they expect us to come to work and  do the same thing. At the very least, they expect us to do no harm.  Doctors swear by the Hippocratic Oath, where they pledge first and  foremost to do no harm when they are treating patients. We should  appreciate this. We should approach this debate in the same manner. Do  no harm. That is the basis of the Hirono-Donnelly amendment.   ``Do no harm'' means not cutting Medicare benefits or turning it into  a voucher program. ``Do no harm'' means protecting the health care of  those who use the Medicaid program, many of whom have health care for  the first time.   Here is what we know: Repealing the health care law reduces  Medicare's insolvency by 5 years to 2021. We know that some in  Congress, including the nominee to run the Department of Health and  Human Services, are intent on privatizing Medicare or turning it into a  voucher program, ending the program as we know it.   The Hirono-Donnelly amendment makes it clear that we will not  privatize Medicare. The amendment protects Medicare both for the  seniors who count on the program to age in dignity and for the tens of  millions of Americans who are contributing to the program with the  expectation that it will be there when they retire.   ``Do no harm'' also means we will protect insurance coverage for  those who get their care through the Medicaid program, which, after the  passage of the health care law, enabled millions of our friends and our  neighbors to access affordable coverage for the first time in their  lives. I know this is true because I worked with and supported our  soon-to-be Vice President, Mike Pence, when he used ObamaCare to  establish a program we call the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0. The  innovative plan expanded health care coverage to over 200,000 of my  neighbors in our beloved State and helped reduce the uninsured rate  among Hoosiers by 30 percent. The HIP 2.0 program has been critical in  our ongoing effort to provide treatment to those struggling with opioid  abuse and heroin use in our State. Don't just take my word for it. In  his farewell address as Governor to Hoosiers yesterday, Mr. Pence said:         Our innovative Healthy Indiana Plan is a national model of       how to provide affordable health care coverage to our most       vulnerable citizens. . . . With HIP 2.0, we have also made       great strides expanding treatment for those who struggled in       the grip of drug addiction.    I agree with the Vice President-elect that HIP 2.0 is something we  can be very proud of because it helps Hoosier families across our State  every single day. And it was done by working together, Republicans and  Democrats, using the health care law to provide access to our friends  and neighbors who wouldn't be able to obtain insurance otherwise. That  is a great result.   The repeal plan before us today takes all of this away, including the  very program that Vice President-Elect Pence and I worked to put in  place. The amendment Senator Hirono and I put forth is simple. It says  to seniors and to people participating in HIP 2.0 and Medicaid plans  across the country: We will do no harm.   I am happy to work with anyone to strengthen the health care law, but  we are not going to take away the health care people have come to rely  on. I urge my colleagues to support the Hirono-Donnelly amendment.  Instead of going forward with a plan that creates chaos by repealing  the health care law with no alternative, we should work together to  improve it. That is just common sense. Most of all, we should strive to  do no harm. That should be our guiding principle in the Senate. My  colleagues on both sides of the aisle can demonstrate their commitment  to this principle by supporting our amendment.   I yield the floor.
