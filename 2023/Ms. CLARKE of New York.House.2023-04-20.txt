 Mr. Speaker, I rise on this day after a week  of chaos and confusion following the Supreme Court's decision to allow  mifepristone's status to remain as it has been: approved and  accessible.   Let me be clear. The fight is not over. The Supreme Court needs to do  its job and reject this ridiculous effort to thrust unjustified grudges  into the FDA approval process and further limit access to abortion.   Women deserve safe and fair access to medication when they need it.  Women deserve to have medication without interference from judges and  politicians. Women must be treated as equals and have agency over our  bodies and our lives.   Mr. Speaker, mifepristone's approval is still in jeopardy. The  Supreme Court Justices should keep their bans off our bodies. Access to  this medication must be protected. Our rights must be protected.   This fight is not over, and we will never concede.                            ____________________
