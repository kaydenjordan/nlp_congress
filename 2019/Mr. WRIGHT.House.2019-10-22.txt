 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my outrage over the  ongoing parliamentary inquiry against our President.   Impeachment is the House's most solemn and serious responsibility. It  should not be undertaken haphazardly. Although I strongly believe in  Congress' oversight duties and agree that no public official, including  the President, is above the law, I have serious concerns about the  partisan nature and procedure of this inquiry.  [[Page H8381]]    Beyond the fact that this inquiry was launched before the transcript  of the call to Ukraine was released, the Speaker's decision to launch  an inquiry without a full vote of the House and attempts to restrict  the involvement of Republicans and the American public in the  impeachment proceedings defy precedence.   From the beginning, this effort has been mired by the Democrats'  partisanship and a complete lack of transparency. The American public  deserves the truth. Instead, all they are getting are cherry-picked  leaks in classic Washington fashion.   Madam Speaker, in its current form, this process is an outrage and  counter to our interests and the values of our Republic. I urge my  colleagues to abandon this political charade and adhere to the  Constitution and congressional precedent.                            ____________________
