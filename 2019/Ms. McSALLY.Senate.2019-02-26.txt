 Madam President, in January 1908, President Theodore  Roosevelt famously declared, ``Let this great wonder of nature remain  as it is now. You cannot improve on it.'' He said these words while  designating the Grand Canyon as a national monument. Eleven years  later, it became a National Park, and today marks the centennial of  that designation.   Known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Grand  Canyon is more than history to Arizona, it is a part of who we are.  Millions of visitors come to see this magnificent national park, from  its archeological sites to its one-of-a-kind trails; and for centuries,  this vast array of canyons and mountains has served as a home to many  different peoples, including many Native American tribes.   It was in 1869 that geologist John Wesley Powell first led an  expedition down the hazardous Colorado River, during which he noted the  ancient clues he found hidden in the layers of rock that told the story  of its creation. His expedition led to future explorations further  chartering and mapping the great canyon. By the time it officially  became a National Park in 1919, the Grand Canyon attracted some 44,000  visitors. Today, Arizona hosts more than 6 million visitors each year,  and with a total economic impact of almost $1 billion a year, it is the  greatest attraction in our State.   All Americans, but especially Arizonans, are truly blessed to have  such a natural wonder to visit like the Grand Canyon. I share in Teddy  Roosevelt's amazement, passion, and wonderment of the Grand Canyon, and  I will continue to advocate for this park so that it may last for many  more generations to come.                            ____________________
