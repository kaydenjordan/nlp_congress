 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks.    Madam President, I thank the gentleman, my neighbor  from Oklahoma, for yielding. And I thank the gentleman from Maryland,  our chairman of the Small Business Committee, for his cooperation.   Our amendment will allow farmers and ranchers categorized as a  partnership, including LLPs, S corps, to utilize gross income when  calculating their PPP maximum loan amount.   It is no secret that our Nation's farmers and ranchers have faced  incredible difficulties through the COVID-19 pandemic when we literally  couldn't pay people to come get our cattle and hogs. In December, we  made changes to allow farmers to use gross income in calculating their  PPP loan. Before it passed, the payments were based on farmers' net  income. This net income number is often low or negative because of the  amount of depreciation farmers claim on equipment. These changes were  helpful and provided assistance for much of the agriculture industry.  [[Page S1795]]    Unfortunately, certain farm and ranch partnerships, many of which are  small family partnerships, were left out of changes made in the program  in December. I believe Congress intended to include partnerships;  however, the SBA, interpreting the statute we passed, did not. They  made it crystal clear, short of legislation, they would not include  partnerships under this new interpretation.   My amendment, in a nutshell, would let farmers categorized as a  partnership use gross income rather than net income for the PPP loan. I  encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment and help our  farmers during this difficult time.   I yield back to the gentleman from Oklahoma. Thank you.
