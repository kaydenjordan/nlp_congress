 Mr. Speaker, here is a heartbreaking fact about the  reality of war: Every single day in our country, about 17 veterans die  by suicide. That is 17 families whose lives will never be the same.   I am thinking of one of our mothers in the 12th Congressional  District, Lisa Hicks-Clayton, who mourns her son, Damon, every day.   We must work harder than ever to ensure that no veteran is left  behind and those serving in our military receive the mental health  support that they need to survive.   We know that our servicemembers face mental health crises that are  heightened by their experiences at war. The forever wars, Mr. Speaker,  of the past decades have left behind immense trauma. Far too often, our  own government and this Congress fail to provide our servicemembers and  veterans with the support they need and deserve.   If we cannot provide the necessary care and support for our  servicemembers and veterans, then we should not be sending them off to  war.                                time  1030    The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline offers free confidential  support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for those experiencing a mental  health crisis or contemplating suicide. Veterans can use this new  option by dialing 988 and pressing 1 to contact the Veterans Crisis  Line.   We must break the stigma surrounding mental health issues and create  an environment where our veterans and servicemembers feel supported  asking for help.   My amendment ensures that information about the 988 Suicide and  Crisis Lifeline is posted in commonsense locations to maximize  awareness about this lifesaving resource among our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this amendment.  Suicide prevention should not be a partisan issue.   If you are a veteran or a servicemember in crisis, please reach out  for the support you need. You are not alone.                         Celebrating Heroes' Alliance     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievement and  historic accomplishment of these wonderful young people who are part of  the Heroes' Alliance Vehicle Technology Team. This group of high school  students from our district just won the 2022 National Solar Car  Challenge within their division.   Heroes' Alliance was founded in 2009 by the late Pastor Reggie Lane  who established the organization to engage and create opportunities for  underserved youth in Detroit. This vision now is being led by the  dynamic Anika Smith. Right now, these young people are going to Texas  to drive the vehicle from Texas to California and compete in the 2023  national competition.   The Heroes' Alliance is a STEM program that challenges students to  develop innovative technology focusing on renewable energy and  automotive engineering.   Today, the project serves as a capstone for students who participate  in the Heroes' Alliance Cooperative Learning Center, which utilizes  vehicle technology for the basis of bringing together education,  innovation, and industry as students work together to design and  engineer a solar vehicle.   I am so proud of this hardworking, talented, group of young people  from various schools all across the city of Detroit and want to  congratulate them on their achievements.   Please join me in recognizing them as we also cheer them on to  victory.                 Recognizing Mother Patricia ``Pat'' Braxton     Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mother Patricia ``Pat''  Braxton, as we call her, ``Mother Pat,'' a legacy of our community, as  she celebrates 75 years of life.   In all the years I have known Mother Pat, she has been an active  public servant and advocate. Her passion for our  [[Page H3485]]  local and global community shines through in everything she does.   She is known not only as the matriarch of her family, but also as a  mentor for many women of color serving in public service. She is one of  our legacy legends of the O'Hair Park community, and we absolutely  adore her.   Mother Pat never shies away from a challenge, Mr. Speaker. Her  compassion and kindness toward others have had a lasting impact on  those around her, including myself. We are grateful for her tireless  energy and outstanding example.   Please join me in recognizing Mother Pat Braxton for her advocacy,  hard work, and dedication as we celebrate her 75 years of life.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by thanking Ranking  Member Smith, Mr. McGovern, and their staffs for working with us on  this critically important amendment and for their leadership throughout  this NDAA process.   As we know, Mr. Chair, with war criminals threatening to use nuclear  weapons and serious tensions along NATO's eastern border and in the  South China Sea, today's world is being redefined by escalating  tensions between major nuclear powers.  [[Page H3520]]    We don't have to look far back in history to see the danger here. The  Cold War was full of near misses and numerous crises that could have  gotten out of control and ended in nuclear war.   We are now entering a period of dangerous nuclear competition. As  such, we must remember one of the key lessons that the Cold War taught  us about nukes: We must preserve the ability to quickly step back from  the brink and clearly signal de-escalation when necessary.   Unfortunately, the current draft of the NDAA includes a provision  that prohibits our country from doing just that. Specifically, this  dangerous provision makes it impossible for our country to reduce our  stockpiles of intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, for any  reason, with no exceptions.   This inflexible policy was created and implemented by lawmakers in  promotion of economic considerations and not national security  priorities, Mr. Chair. Making national security decisions with the  potential to end humanity based on so-called economic considerations is  simply ridiculous. It is dangerous.   While we preserve this insanely expensive weapon that is obsolete,  many children in my district go to schools without clean drinking  water.   Maintaining this incredibly large stockpile of these weapons isn't  even necessary in maintaining a credible deterrent. The U.K., France,  India, and China all have very credible nuclear deterrents with much  smaller stockpiles, Mr. Chair.   The shortsighted policy places serious and concerning restraints on  the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the  Department of Defense's ability to consider and modify the role ICBMs  play in our nuclear arsenal and our national defense, and it  unnecessarily wastes taxpayer dollars in the process.   Preserving our ability to reduce our nuclear stockpiles proved key to  reducing tensions, Mr. Chair, and achieving commonsense, planet-saving  arms control agreements during the Cold War.   Just as we have the ability to increase our nuclear defense in times  of crisis, we must have the ability to reduce our nuclear forces when  it is in our interest.   To be clear, Mr. Chair, this amendment does not change the size of  our nuclear forces. It merely allows for reasonable consideration and  debate in the future.   Mr. Chair, as the mother of two who dreams of a world where our  children and families are freed from threat and fear of nuclear war, I  urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, just to be clear, this amendment does not  change the size of our nuclear forces. It merely allows for reasonable  consideration and debate in the future, especially around de- escalation. Again, our history shows during the Cold War, it was  critical.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), my good colleague.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to be clear with my colleagues. This amendment gives our  government more options that could avoid our world ending in nuclear  war. It is that simple. It doesn't reduce. It doesn't increase. It  literally allows for real consideration and debate and allows the  President of the United States and the Department of Defense to make  those decisions.   It is a commonsense amendment. Really, I think it is incredibly  important, especially, again, at a time of watching what is going on in  our world right now and what happened during the Cold War. It is  important for us to be able to de-escalate when needed, for us to be  able to again make more thoughtful decisions, not based on this kind of  scare tactic of let's do more, let's get this out there and everything  without actually considering some of the really important factors that  are around these very dangerous, again, world-ending weapons that we  have that could end in nuclear war in our world.    It is very, very important, again, for all my colleagues to  understand: This is not about reducing. This is about actually having  more options.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
