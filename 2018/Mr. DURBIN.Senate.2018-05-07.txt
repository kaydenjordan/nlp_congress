 I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, last month, Peter G. Peterson passed away  in his home in Manhattan at the age of 91. He was a rare figure in  modern American politics as a true public citizen asking politicians to  be fiscally responsible.   Peter George Peterson was born Peter Petropoulos in Kearney, NE, to a  Greek family. His parents came from southern Greece without any money.  George, his father, took a job as a dishwasher for the Union Pacific  Railroad. His mother made wine in his basement, which she sold to  people. George eventually opened a Greek restaurant in Kearney and  changed the family name to Peterson. At age eight, Peter would work the  register at this place. The family never had much wealth.   Almost everyone knew him as Pete. His family was so frugal that Pete  and his brother took turns using the same bath water on Saturday  nights. The Great Depression taught him lessons that he would message  to the country for the rest of his life: Never spend more than one  earns, even in the worst of times.   Pete developed into a business wonder. He finished top in his class  in high school, attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and  Northwestern University. In the 1950s, Pete was an advertising  executive for the legendary McCann Erickson agency before he was 30.  Within a decade, he became chief executive for Bell and Howell  electronics.   Pete answered the call for service in 1971, becoming the White House  Assistant for International Economic Affairs and, eventually, Commerce  Secretary for a brief period of time for President Nixon, but he was  never a White House insider. Partisans distrusted him because he was  too comfortable with Democrats. He left a year into the post before  scandal engulfed the White House.   He was nearsighted and colorblind, but he had a clear vision of where  he thought the country should go. Pete built a career that made him one  of the few captains of business stretching into public life. He was  chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations for 22 years and led  government commissions and advisory bodies. Pete also helped found the  incredibly successful Blackstone Group and became chairman of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He was a member of President Bill  Clinton's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform as well.   Pete's leadership as a fiscal watchdog might be his greatest  achievement. Since the 1970s, Pete has challenged leaders of both  parties to address the country's dangerous fiscal path. He launched the  Institute for International Economics in 1981, which became the  Peterson Institute for International Economics in 2006. Pete was the  founding president of the bipartisan Concord Coalition, which included  former Democratic Senator Paul Tsongas and former Republican Senator  Warren Rudman in 1992 to advocate for generationally responsible fiscal  policy.   The national debt is not a partisan problem; it is an American  problem. Pete wrote several books challenging both parties to come  together and fix it. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which he founded  in 2006, has kept the conversation alive and pushed put the country on  a sustainable fiscal path. Members of both parties and all walks of  life have come to foundation events to participate in providing  solutions to long-term fiscal challenges. I was at a few of them.   Pete's life is a reminder that we need to work together to serve  future generations. He is survived by his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney; and  five children, John, Jim, David, Holly, and Michael Peterson; a  brother, John; and nine grandchildren.                            ____________________
