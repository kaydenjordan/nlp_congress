 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, the budget before us today sets up a tax plan that would  harm hundreds of thousands of working families in Illinois and millions  across the Nation.   It has been widely reported that this tax plan enables a budget that  would eliminate the State and local tax deduction, also known as the  SALT deduction, S-A-L-T, SALT deduction.   In my home State of Illinois, this SALT deduction represents a  sizeable portion of taxpayers' income, accounting for approximately 6  percent of the average itemizers' average gross income.   Within my district, the SALT deduction allows families in Cook County  to save an average of $4,000 a year. In Kane and DuPage Counties, the  numbers are even greater, $5,000 and $6,600, respectively.   Simply put, Mr. Chair, this SALT deduction prohibits double taxation  on working families. That is why numerous bipartisan and nonpartisan  organizations have spoken out in support of the SALT deduction,  including the National Governors Association and the United States  Conference of Mayors.   If this budget passes, the tax structure it creates will cause a  dramatic increase in the tax burden on working families.   There is no doubt that our Tax Code needs to b updated, but we need  to do so in a way that upholds the President's promise that working  families would not see a tax increase.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this double taxation budget  and this increase in taxes on working families.
