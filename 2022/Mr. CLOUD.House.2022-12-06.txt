 Mr. Speaker, we are going to miss Mr. Gohmert, my fellow  Texan and House colleague.   It has been an honor to get to know you and now to be able to call  you a friend.   I will definitely miss Louie Gohmert hour at the end of every week.  We will miss the ribs that are certainly worth a mention in the  Congressional Record.   I remember the first time I met you. I was a Texan, just grassroots,  and you inspired me. I remember you speaking about the things that you  were working to accomplish up here. A few things were obvious.   One was that you hadn't forgotten who you were working for. It was  obvious to me that you were compelled by your love for the Constitution  and these founding principles our Nation was built upon, and you were  motivated by your deep and abiding faith. Those things resonated with  me, as someone trying to make a difference where I could.   I didn't know I was ultimately going to have the opportunity to be  here and get to know you. It is truly an honor to see and to watch your  service. You have been a happy warrior who stands up, doesn't flinch,  stands for what is right, what is just, and you haven't forgotten why  you are here.   We have all seen people who can kind of get used to it, get  comfortable with what is going on here. You haven't done that. You have  stayed true.   It is an honor to know you. I thank you for being a hero in this  place on behalf of our Nation and on behalf of our State. Thanks so  much. God bless you.                                time  1745
