 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4378, the continuing  resolution. I wish we were here to pass FY20 appropriations bills, but  the fact of the matter is we are delayed.   We need to pass this bill to ensure the government continues to  operate. This is especially important for the critical functions of our  government, such as national defense, homeland security, and serving  our veterans. It will  [[Page H7794]]  also ensure the men and women serving the Nation, including my soldiers  at Fort Hood, are paid on time. This is imperative and by itself is  enough reason to support this bill.   Passage of this bill will give us time to finalize our FY20  appropriations process.   I look forward to working with my friend from Florida, the chairwoman  of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, to finish our bill. I am ready to  go to work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this continuing  resolution.
