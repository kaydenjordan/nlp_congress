 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Hawaiian-born  Sasha Kekauoha, more famously known as Sasha Colby, on being crowned  the winner of ``RuPaul's Drag Race'' Season 15.   I am so proud that a fellow Windward girl, hailing from the  homesteads of Waimanalo, has earned the title of ``America's Next Drag  Superstar.''   From the very beginning of the competition, Sasha, a seasoned drag  legend, drew upon her ethnic heritage and childhood trauma as sources  of inspiration for her performances.   Throughout ``Drag Race,'' she authentically represented her Hawaiian  culture, talking about the legacy she is building for our home State  and about being mahu.   In ancient Hawaiian days, mahu were considered extraordinary  individuals of male and female spirit who brought their healing powers  to Oahu from Tahiti.   Today, trans people are among the most revered members in the  Hawaiian community. Amidst ongoing attacks on our LGBTQ+ rights that  particularly target trans people and drag queens, her win is not only  well deserved, it gives us all hope.   Congratulations to Sasha Colby. She is a leader. She is a proud mahu,  and she is every drag queen's favorite drag queen.                            ____________________
