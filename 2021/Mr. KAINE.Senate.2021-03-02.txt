 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Cost of  Police Misconduct Act. This legislation strives to increase  transparency and accountability, saving taxpayer dollars and  potentially lives by requiring Federal, State, and local law  enforcement agencies to report police misconduct allegations and  related judgments or settlements to the Department of Justice.   Last year, the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and  Ahmaud Arbery made it clear that systemic reform in policing is needed  now more than ever. On top of having to bear the loss of friends and  loved ones, these very communities who suffer from this misconduct have  to foot its bill, yet they are often in the dark on the full size of  that bill. Citizens deserve to know what they are paying for unjust  policing practices.   In the last 10 years, 31 of 50 cities in the Nation with the highest  police-to-civilian ratio spent more than $3 billion to settle police  misconduct lawsuits. These large judgments and settlements paid by  State and local governments are typically paid from liability  insurance, from a general or dedicated municipal fund, or from issuing  bonds. In particular, municipal bonds have become increasingly more  commonplace to cover the cost of large judgments and settlements that  exceed insurer liability coverage or the capacity of dedicated  municipal funds. This often results in passing costs to taxpayers, who  must pay nearly double the cost of the judgment or settlement because  the city or county must pay fees to financial institutions and interest  to investors. This is unacceptable.   Specifically, the Cost of Police Misconduct Act seeks to remedy this  costly and pervasive issue by ensuring the Department of Justice  maintains a comprehensive public database of misconduct data and trends  that have gone largely unreported by Federal, State, and local law  enforcement agencies. Furthermore, this legislation makes certain  important data--such as the type of alleged misconduct, the total  amount of the settlement, and the source of funds used to cover the  cost of any one judgment or settlement--is properly preserved in an  easily accessible manner. Additionally, this legislation directs the  Government Accountability Office to conduct a study of the information  reported to determine the leading cause of judgments and settlements  related to allegations of misconduct and what interventions are  necessary to prevent them.   Police misconduct takes lives, erodes trust, and sparks fear. I am  hopeful the Senate will act upon my legislation this year to shine a  light on the price of police misconduct, ending the secrecy and  hopefully spurring agencies to put a stop to it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Cost of  Police Misconduct Act.
