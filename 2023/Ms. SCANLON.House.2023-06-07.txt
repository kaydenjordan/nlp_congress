 Mr. Speaker, I share with you and with the American  people a conversation I recently had with a group of children's doctors  because it has haunted me ever since.   These busy doctors who work at some of our Nation's finest pediatric  hospitals and practices took the time to travel to D.C. because they  wanted to  [[Page H2769]]  help Members of Congress understand the ever-expanding and  heartbreaking toll that gun violence is taking on children and our  communities every day.   They came to D.C. to beg lawmakers, not for thoughts and prayers, but  to pass commonsense gun safety laws that will help them stop this  epidemic.   We now know that firearm injuries are the leading cause of death for  children and teens, but they see it firsthand.   The stories these doctors shared of the injuries and death that they  have to deal with on a daily basis were shocking, but what really  struck me was the raw pain in their faces and in their voices as they  shared those stories.   Think about it. These doctors have dedicated their lives to caring  for children, and now they are reeling from the trauma of having to  face day in and day out the toll that our Nation's gun violence is  taking on those children, knowing that the lion's share of this pain  and death is preventable if lawmakers only had the courage to act.   The stories these children's doctors told broke my heart. Today, I  share their words with you. One said: ``As a primary care pediatrician  in Philadelphia, my heart stops every time I see on the news that a  young person has been shot and killed. I fear they are my patient. I am  sick that these young people that I watch growing up are being murdered  on the streets by gangs. Something must change.''                                time  1015    Another said: ``I am haunted by the image of a child's shoe. My  patient, a young boy with autism, was at a community July Fourth  celebration with his family when they heard shots. The family ran, and  in the chaos that ensued, his shoe fell off and was lost. For weeks  after the shooting, this child didn't have the words to describe what  he was feeling, but he kept asking: `Where is my shoe?' He was clearly  impacted by the events and was having trouble sleeping. Although this  child and his family were physically unharmed, the question, `Where is  my shoe?' is evidence of a child, family, and community traumatized yet  again by gun violence.''   Another is a neonatologist, a baby doctor. She said: ``You might  think I would never see my patients be impacted by gun violence, but  sadly, I have seen too many families impacted by it. Mothers tell me  about close calls they had with gun-related violence. After all,  pregnant and postpartum women are more, not less, likely to experience  abuse and assault. I have had patients who were born early, delivered  frantically in an attempt to save their lives and those of their shot  mothers. Patients have fathers, siblings, aunts, uncles, and  grandparents who are disabled or dead because they were shot. I should  not see this so often, babies whose lives start shrouded in trauma  because we do not have background checks and red flag policies.''   Another said: ``As a pediatric emergency physician, I face the  effects of gun violence daily. I tell devastated parents that their  toddler has been fatally shot by a sibling playing with a handgun. I  scramble to rapidly transfuse blood into children caught in the  crossfire of gang violence. I exit trauma bays covered in the brain  matter of teenagers who have made the tragically final decision to end  their lives with a gun. And if I am lucky, I find a moment to grieve  these losses before moving on to the next patient in need of my care, a  child struggling with depression after losing a family member to gun  violence. This is my reality. It is heartbreaking, and it must stop.''   Finally, one said: ``I am also a mother, a mother who spends  sleepless nights googling bulletproof backpacks every time an AR-15 has  turned other mothers' children into sitting ducks at their schools. I  should not have to worry that someone with a mental health disorder can  go to a store, buy a weapon of mass destruction, and, that same day,  shoot my little boys as they sit sounding out letters. But because of  our laws, that dull, familiar fear rears its head often when I drop  them off at school. It doesn't have to be this way.''   She is right. They are right. It doesn't have to be this way. It must  stop. We don't have to live this way.   There are laws that could help turn the tide, and this shouldn't be a  partisan issue. Children are being shot every day regardless of their  family's party affiliation.   Mr. Speaker, our communities are begging the Republican majority to  come to the table and find common ground to pass comprehensive,  commonsense, and constitutional legislation that will end this  epidemic.   The American people overwhelmingly support background checks, safe  storage, red flag laws, and limiting access to assault-style weapons  because they understand the Second Amendment is not a suicide pact.                            ____________________
