 Mr. Speaker, what my good friends have not heard is  the outrage and cry of the desperate Federal workers, some sending  their children to relatives because they cannot support them, museums  shut down costing $4 million, TSA officers not able to come to work,  and air traffic controllers suffering.   Today, Democrats did again what they have done over and over again.  The message is: Mr. President, open the government, pay the workers  now, and let us sit down at the table of reconciliation and iron out  the question of border security.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I have voted time  after time as a Democrat for border security--barriers, drones,  technology, jeeps, and laptops. I know what it is. I am from a border  State. I have been to the borders in the daylight and in the dark.   Today, we voted to open up Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, financial  services, environment, Transportation, Housing, and all of the law  enforcement we voted for.   Our simple cry is: Mr. President, understand the pain of America.  Open the government, pay the workers, and let's get down to the  business of negotiating on behalf of the American people.                            ____________________
