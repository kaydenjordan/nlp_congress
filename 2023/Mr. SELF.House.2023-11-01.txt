 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. McCaul's  resolution to declare the policy of the United States that a nuclear  Iran is not acceptable.   I commanded a Green Beret Special Forces detachment that deployed a  tactical nuclear weapon, and I stood strategic nuclear watch for 1  year. I was intimately familiar with the single integrated operations  plan, the strategic nuclear plan. I knew in detail the tens of  thousands of deaths that nuclear war entails.   The United States and our allies, including Israel, must prevent Iran  from obtaining a nuclear weapon by any means necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
