 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the budget  before the House.   As a legislator, but more importantly, as a father and grandfather, I  am seriously concerned about the mountain of debt our Nation is passing  on to our children and grandchildren. Our Nation's total Federal debt  is now bigger than our gross domestic product.   Think about that. As the leader of the free world and the driver of  global innovation and entrepreneurship, over the next 10 years, we  expect to reach a point where annual interest payments to our creditors  will exceed the amount we spend on defending our Nation.   It is imperative that we change this trajectory, and I commend  Chairwoman Black and her colleagues on the Budget Committee for  providing a blueprint for tackling the problem. While Congress has made  many decisions ahead of us to rein in mandatory spending, this budget  is a critical starting point.  [[Page H7798]]    Not only is budgeting a fundamental principle of good governance, it  is essential to our efforts to reform our outdated tax system to ensure  it is simpler and reduces the tax burden for all Americans.   As a CPA with a current license, I look forward to the very real  prospect of fundamental tax reform. This budget is the vehicle that can  make that happen.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this budget.
