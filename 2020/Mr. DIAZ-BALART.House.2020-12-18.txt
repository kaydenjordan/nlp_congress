 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in support of this short-term  continuing resolution. There have been negotiations taking place day  and night for weeks now to reach an agreement on a full-year  appropriations bill and, very importantly, a coronavirus relief bill.   The negotiations are moving forward. We are very close to a final  package, but there is a little bit more time required to get this  legislation finalized and drafted. Passing this CR is simply a very  short-term, stopgap measure to allow those negotiations to finalize.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  this, again, very short-term resolution, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
