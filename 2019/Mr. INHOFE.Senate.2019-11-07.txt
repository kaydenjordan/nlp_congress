 Let us pray.   Almighty God, Creator of all, as we gather here today, we are  grateful for the servicemembers who are deployed in the defense of our  great Nation under God. We ask for Your comfort for the families who  continue their duties at home with the courage to maintain the  homefront in the absence of their loved ones.   Protect our service men and women with the shield of Your strength as  they discharge their sacred mission, and keep them safe from all evil  and harm. May the power of Your love enable them to return home in  safety, that with all who love them, they may ever praise You for Your  loving care.   Assist with Your spirit of counsel and fortitude for the President  and other government leaders of these United States. May they always  seek the ways of righteousness, justice, and mercy. Grant that they may  be enabled by Your powerful protection to lead our country with honesty  and integrity.   Lord, we know all too well our weak and infallible human nature, and  we recognize that the work which lies before us is demanding and  complex. Yet, O God, I thank You for calling us to this difficult and  rewarding work.   Lead our troops and all of us, O Lord, in the way of peace. Unite us  in the spirit of service.   We pray these things in the Name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus  Christ. Amen.                            ____________________
