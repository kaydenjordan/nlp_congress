 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   This legislation--let's explain this very simply--is necessary  because we need to install the guardrails to protect the strategic  reserve.   Before this administration, it was unimaginable that a President  would declare war on American energy. That is why we are bringing this  legislation forward, to ensure that our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is  being used only for emergencies and not to score cheap political  points.   Any plan that uses this reserve outside of a national emergency must  have a corresponding plan to backfill our stores.   It is unacceptable to cancel projects like the Keystone XL pipeline,  strip away American energy jobs, and harass our energy producers while  also using up our emergency supplies.   Americans cannot afford for the White House to play political games.   We need to lower prices at the gas pump for the Pennsylvania families  that I represent. Using our emergency supplies is unsustainable, and  actually, it is reckless.   We cannot afford to waste any more time holding up permits and  creating complicated regulations that only slow down production.   It is time to return to American energy dominance and use the  resources that are under the feet of my constituents.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.
