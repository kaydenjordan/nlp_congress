 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8337, a short-term  continuing resolution through December 11.   The coronavirus pandemic has impacted virtually every aspect of  American life. During this unprecedented time, it is more critical than  ever that the Federal Government remain open and functioning. By  passing this short-term CR, we will provide critical support for  farmers and ranchers, extend the nutrition program that has been a  lifeline during the pandemic for low-income students who are out of  school, ensure critical military operations continue, support vital  transportation programs by extending the FAST Act, extend the National  Flood Insurance Program, ensure that there are no delays in the  Department of Veterans Affairs' electronic health records system, and  allow agencies experiencing operational challenges during the pandemic  to continue functioning.   As an appropriator, it pains me to have to consider anything short of  a full-year appropriations bill for the next fiscal year. But I remain  hopeful that passing this CR will allow the government to continue  operating and give the House and the Senate time to work out our  differences after the election.   The alternative would have been an unnecessary and costly government  shutdown. I think most sides agree that that would be devastating and  disastrous for our economy, our national security, our veterans, and  our public health.   I look forward to passing this bill today, moving it through the  Senate, and sending it to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
