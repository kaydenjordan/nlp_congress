 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  [[Page H5133]]  8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with members of the  Indiana delegation in support of the nomination of Judge Amy Coney  Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. We can think of no one better  qualified to serve on the Nation's highest court than our fellow  Hoosier, Judge Barrett.   Her record as a law professor and appellate judge demonstrates her  first-rate legal mind and her unwavering commitment to constitutional  principles. She graduated summa cum laude and first in her class at  Notre Dame Law School, clerked for Judge Antonin Scalia, and returned  to her alma mater as a highly respected professor.   In 2017, she was confirmed by the Senate on a bipartisan vote as  judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where she currently  serves.   Finally, Judge Barrett is a woman of faith and a dedicated mother of  seven. Given her impeccable credentials, she should be qualified and  confirmed without delay.   Mr. Speaker, we applaud President Trump for fulfilling his promise to  appoint judges who will faithfully uphold the rule of law, defend the  Constitution, and protect the life and liberty of every American.                            ____________________
