 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4634, the Terrorism Risk  Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019.   For the last 17 years, TRIA has provided an important Federal  backstop for businesses that insure against the large-scale devastation  caused by terrorist attacks. This Federal backstop provides much needed  stability for the private terrorism risk insurance market, ensuring  that small and large businesses alike have access to affordable  coverage.   Without Federal involvement, the private market cannot adequately  price for this type of risk, causing insurers to exit the market, and  leaving businesses without coverage. That would be a market failure,  and it necessitates us acting in order to ensure that that market  failure does not persist. That is why we have this important program.   That bipartisanship continues today with Democrats and Republicans  alike agreeing on the need to reauthorize the TRIA program for an  additional 7 years. This long-term extension will give certainty to  insurance markets, businesses and the broader American economy. A wide  range of businesses have come to rely on the protections included in  this act.   From real estate to manufacturing to entertainment, H.R. 4634 will  help these companies insure against acts of terrorism. In addition, the  bill takes the first step in understanding how the TRIA program can be  modernized to meet the advances made by our adversaries in the 21st  century.   When we began our bipartisan conversations regarding the TRIA  reauthorization, I emphasized the need to study how this program would  react in the aftermath of a wide-scale cyberattack. We generally know  what the threats are broadly, but how the threats will evolve over the  next 7 years we need to know. What we do know is that America's public  and private infrastructure is currently under attack every single day.  And so we want to make sure that we are broadly set for this next  generation of attack.    In the aftermath of 9/11, insurance companies and policymakers  quickly became aware of the hidden risks that acts of terrorism could  pose to their balance sheets. It was a hidden risk then. Insurers also  realized that they would be unable to adequately price this risk,  spurring the need for Federal assistance.   What I am concerned about is this: I am concerned a large-scale  cyberattack could pose these same hidden risks to insurers and to the  market, since we don't fully understand the effects of a large-scale  cyberattack and how that would play out today.   Moreover, the digital capabilities of our adversaries only continue  to grow. Just look at Russia. In 2015, a Russian cyberattack shut down  Ukraine's power grid for as long as 6 hours. If it is not Russia, it is  China, Iran, North Korea. State sponsors of terror want to cause as  much damage to the United States as they can. And that is not just the  government's fear or utilities, it is every part of our economy.   It is our duty to make sure that this program is adaptable to respond  to any event that could become a reality.   I appreciate Chairwoman Waters agreeing to this additional language  in the bill, as well as her work for a long-term reauthorization. I  commend her work here to ensure that this is a bipartisan product here  on the House floor. And from time to time we may not agree, but on this  important bill we do see eye to eye. So bipartisanship is not always  dead here in Washington.   I believe this bill, when enacted, will give our economy certainty  and will  [[Page H8934]]  show that we can respond to threats and we can talk across the aisle  and come to rational conclusions.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Chairwoman Waters for engaging in this  bipartisan, collaborative process to reauthorize this important  program.   I am also glad to know the Senate will be marking up a similar  version of the bill this week. That is an encouraging sign. I am  optimistic it will become law once it goes to the President's desk in  short order.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill. This is a constructive  conversation we have had from the Republicans on the Financial Services  Committee and the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee.   This is a priority that Chairwoman Waters set out in our first  conversation about her agenda for the committee this Congress and an  area where I offered to be supportive. So I am grateful that we are, in  this policy set, a year ahead of time. It is a rare circumstance where  Congress has acted so early on a key reauthorization. It is a rare  thing, especially given the import of this Terrorism Risk Insurance  Act.   We are 1 year ahead of schedule in reporting this bill off the House  floor, and I expect a wide bipartisan vote, thankfully. I am grateful  that in the committee markup process, we had great bipartisan support.   The New York delegation, having experienced 9/11, with four key  policymakers from the city and the New York metro area, was very active  in the original construct of this bill.                                time  1815    Mr. Meeks, Mrs. Maloney, and Ms. Velazquez on the Democrat side, and  Mr. King on the Republican side, the combination of their expertise and  also their legislative history, that they were here and helped  construct the original act that we are reauthorizing now, today, is  quite helpful. And their experience in the immediate reaction of the 9/ 11 terrorist attacks on New York City as well as the Pentagon across  the street from us, or across the river from us, here, today, and the  loss in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, that immediate reaction was swift by  Congress and bipartisan.   Today, we are carrying on that legacy, and I am grateful for it. I  think the American people are grateful when we are able to act in that  accord. This  [[Page H8937]]  is a very good day of bipartisanship that has taken months to bring us  to this type of conclusion.   I thank Chairwoman Waters for her willingness. When you are in the  majority, you have got more votes than the minority. That is obvious  with being in the majority. It is not all the time that you reach  across the aisle when you are in the majority; I understand that. But  in this act, Chairwoman Waters said it is imperative that we work  together, and we have.   We have got a good result here today. I think it shows the Financial  Services Committee, when brought together, can do big and important  things. This is certainly a big and important thing that will have a  lasting impact on the American economy.   We are hopeful that we will never have to use this piece of law in  response to a terrorist attack; but, if we are, the work that we have  done on the Financial Services Committee, the expertise that we have  had on the committee, we believe, means that this act will work in  response to some cataclysmic event.   We are hopeful, and we plan to ensure that no further terrorist  attacks happen or befall our country and our people like happened on 9/ 11. However, we are also in the disaster planning business, as well,  and it is important and imperative that Members of Congress are engaged  in that.   So the Financial Services Committee in this House has come to a good  conclusion on a good piece of law, and we have a very good  reauthorization. Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote by all  Members, and I yield back the balance of my time.
