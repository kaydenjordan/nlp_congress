 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for the purposes of propounding a unanimous consent  agreement.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the order of December 21, 2017, and the provisions of  rule XXXI, all uniformed military promotions pending in the Senate  remain in status quo, with the exception of the following: PN765,  PN540, and PN475, and that the following defense civilian nomination  also be returned to the President: PN1096. I further ask consent that  the previous order be modified to reflect that PN1193 should be  returned to the President and PN1316 should remain in status quo.
