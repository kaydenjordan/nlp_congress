SEC. 4. RESCISSIONS.         (a) Rescission of Unobligated Balances in the Department of       Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.--Of the unobligated balances       available under the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture       Fund, $10,000,000 is hereby permanently rescinded.        (b) Authorization to Rescind Future Unobligated Balances in       the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.--There is       authorized to be rescinded from the unobligated balances       available under the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture       Fund $7,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 and $3,000,000 in fiscal       year 2019.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3731, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3731, the Secret  Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by my distinguished  colleague, Mr. Katko, and negotiated between the House Judiciary  Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It  would make small, but significant, changes to the Federal law to ensure  that the men and women of the United States Secret Service are fairly  compensated for performing their duties.   This bill is necessary because, under current law, many Secret  Service agents have hit the lawful cap that restricts overtime pay in  some circumstances. This means that the brave men and women standing  post, for example, at 2 a.m. in the morning are doing so for free. This  is, without question, an untenable situation.   H.R. 3731 makes two important changes to the law to address this  problem.   First, it raises the overtime cap to ensure that these agents are  paid.   Second, it includes a reporting requirement, directing the Government  Accountability Office to study the  [[Page H9634]]  Service's implementation of the recommendations of the Protective  Mission Panel, or PMP. This change is intended to help address the  recruitment and retention issues at the Secret Service.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will ensure that the Secret Service is  able to recruit and retain an elite group of dedicated law enforcement  officers. This is an issue that rises above party affiliation, or  ideology. The protection of the President, the First Family, and others  is something that, obviously, we all should want as American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Katko), my good friend, and sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), who is a member of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other Members to speak on this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H9637]]    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for helping  to bring this bill to the floor today. I congratulate my good friend  from New York, Mr. Katko, on this legislation. It is going to be very  important to our men and women of the Secret Service who put their  lives on the line every day in dedication to their service.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R.  3731, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3317) to amend title 18, United States Code, to increase the  penalty for female genital mutilation, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3317         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Abusive Female       Exploitation Act of 2017'' or the ``SAFE Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INCREASED PENALTY FOR FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.         Section 116 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       striking ``5 years'' each place it appears and inserting ``15       years''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that States should have in       place laws that require health care professionals, teachers,       and other school employees to report to local law enforcement       agencies any instance of suspected female genital mutilation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3317, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3317, the  Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation Act, or the SAFE Act.   This legislation increases the criminal penalty for female genitalia  mutilation of a minor from a maximum of 5 years to a maximum of 15  years. It also encourages States to adopt laws to require certain  professionals who work with children to report suspected mutilation  cases.   Female genitalia mutilation, or FGM, is internationally recognized as  a human rights violation for girls and women. It is an extreme form of  abuse against women and girls, often causing serious and permanent  health complications, including shock and death.   Across at least 30 countries, more than 200 million girls and women  alive today have been subjected to FGM and more than 3 million girls  are estimated to be at risk every year of being subjected to this  procedure even though it is outlawed in 42 countries.   Congress first passed legislation making this horrific practice  illegal in 1996. The Federal Prohibition of Female Genitalia Mutilation  Act made it illegal to perform FGM on girls younger than 18 years of  age in the United States.   In 2013, Congress passed another law, the Transport for Female  Genital Mutilation Act, which amended the 1996 legislation and made it  a crime to knowingly transport a girl out of the United States for the  purpose of FGM, yet the practice still continues. According to some  estimates, the number of girls who have undergone FGM has tripled over  the past 2 decades.   In 2017, after 20 years on the books, the first charges were filed  under the FGM statute against a doctor in Michigan who performed this  disfiguring assault on two 7-year-olds.   By increasing the criminal exposure for this crime, we send a message  that our country will not tolerate the mutilation of our young girls  and women and we will do what we can to prevent that.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Trott from the great State of  Michigan for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would first like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for helping to  manage these two very important bills on the floor today.   I, too, want to congratulate Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Trott on H.R. 3317,  to ban this horrible procedure of FGM and really help to protect the  women and girls of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
