 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember Scott Lay, a  higher education advocate and beloved member of California's public  policymaking community.   I came to know Scott when he was a young staffer at the Community  College League of California. A product of Orange Coast College  himself, Scott exemplified the opportunity that a community college  education avails to millions of Americans. He would himself rise to  lead the Community College League as its CEO after finishing law school  at UC Davis.   He loved politics and technology and was a progenitor of highly read  newsletters such as The Roundup and The Nooner at the beginning of the  online publishing boom.   Scott's death is untimely and heartbreaking. He had an infectious  enthusiasm. I know he would be proud of President Biden's Build Back  Better community college initiative. I know he would want to be here to  make it happen.   I am very sorry for his loss, and I express my condolences to his  family and loved ones.                            ____________________
