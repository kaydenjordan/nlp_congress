 Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer my support  for the Bipartisan Budget Act, which we expect to vote on later today.   This bipartisan agreement includes a number of priorities that will  benefit Americans, including $20 billion in new investment and  infrastructure over the next 2 years, $6 billion to combat the opioid  epidemic, disaster relief assistance for those impacted by recent  hurricanes, funding for community health centers, a permanent repeal of  ObamaCare's Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, and the  creation of two select committees to address pension reform and  Congress's broken budget process.   Most important is that this bipartisan agreement removes the  arbitrary spending caps that have hampered our Armed Forces. For the  first time in years, we prioritize our national security by adequately  funding the military. Of all the positive aspects of this agreement  that will benefit the people of my home State of South Dakota and  American families across the country, the addition of $165 billion in  defense funding over the next 2 years is crucial.   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have been  deeply concerned about the underfunding of our military. If we are  going to adequately recover readiness levels that were lost over the  last 8 years, as well as modernize our Armed Forces in this  increasingly dangerous and complex world, adequately funding our troops  is vital. This is the reason I support the Bipartisan Budget Act.   I had previously expressed my strong displeasure for short-term  funding measures or CRs, but this agreement makes significant progress  toward rebuilding our military, and, finally, after years of  underfunding, provides the Department of Defense with a much needed  spending boost. This will provide the resources to adequately train and  rebuild the Armed Forces at a time of increasing global threats, but  don't just take my word for it. Let me quote Defense Secretary James  Mattis, who testified before the House Armed Services Committee earlier  this week. He said:         Let me be clear: As hard as the last 16 years of war have       been on our military, no enemy in the field has done as much       to harm the readiness of the United States than the combined       impact of the Budget Control Act's defense spending caps,       worsened by operating for 10 of the last 11 years under       continuing resolutions of varied and unpredictable duration.    Secretary Mattis went on to tell the committee that:         The consequences of not providing a budget are clear . . .       should we stumble into a year-long continuing resolution,       your military will not be able to provide pay for our troops       by the end of the fiscal year; will not recruit the 15,000       Army soldiers and 4,000 Air Force airmen required to fill       critical manning shortfalls; we will not maintain our ships       at sea with the proper balance between operations and time in       port for maintenance; we will ground aircraft due to a lack       of maintenance and spare parts; we will deplete the       ammunition, training and manpower required to deter war; and       delay contracts for vital acquisition programs necessary to       modernize the force.    Sadly, we are hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee many of  the Secretary's predictions are already proving true.   Earlier this week, I spoke on this floor about this very issue and  described various readiness issues that our Armed Forces are currently  facing. Some examples I shared include the F/A-18 fleet taking twice as  many man-hours to maintain, with less than 50 percent of the fleet  available. Those are the primary aircraft you will see flying off of  our carriers in harm's way today.  [[Page S806]]    The maintenance backlog of our submarines. Because of the backlog, 15  nuclear attack submarines have been docked for a total of 177 months or  nearly 15 years. That doesn't mean they are being repaired, it means  they are sitting at dock because they are not even licensed to dive  anymore. What a waste of taxpayer money.   The tragic human cost found in the lack of readiness--as F/A-18  Hornet training programs have had dozens of mishaps over the past  several years, some leading to loss of life. We believe some, if not  all, of these mishaps could have been avoided with the additional  training and maintenance that would have been forthcoming with  appropriate funding.   The American people expect us to adequately fund the defense of  America next year and every year to come. Providing for the defense of  our Nation is the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government and of  this Congress. Nothing else matters if we cannot protect ourselves from  our enemies.   I am pleased this agreement finally recognizes the need to eliminate  arbitrary budget caps that have put our national security in jeopardy.   The Bipartisan Budget Act is truly bipartisan. There are parts in  this that I most certainly very strongly agree with, and there are some  areas I would have done differently, but this is a bipartisan agreement  and must meet the standards of both Republicans and Democrats. While I  would have preferred to see an increase in defense funding without  having to pair it with other spending increases, because we need a  bipartisan majority of 60 Senators to agree to this proposal, we  reluctantly accept the increased spending on nondefense discretionary  programs in order to achieve the very necessary and critical increases  in our Defense appropriations.   Perhaps one of the more important aspects of this agreement is that,  for the first time since the Budget Control Act of 2011, we are able to  overcome the demands of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  to match defense spending and nondefense spending on a dollar-for- dollar basis.   Under this agreement, defense spending will receive a larger increase  than discretionary funding--$165 billion for defense over the next 2  years, as compared to $131 for nondefense discretionary spending over  the next 2 years. I would have preferred not to raise discretionary  spending to this level, but not achieving a path forward without the  higher defense limits was simply not an option.   We must still be diligent in addressing our Nation's debt crisis, and  we have already begun to take the steps to do so. Just a couple of  months ago, we passed historic tax reform that is already helping to  unleash the full potential of our economy, thereby bringing in much  needed additional revenues. We have also been working with President  Trump and the administration to reduce burdensome regulations and  streamline Federal programs so we can save taxpayer money by making the  government more efficient. These are positive things that will help to  control our debt.   However, the most important thing we must do to rein in spending is  to control the skyrocketing costs of mandatory payment programs:  Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. In fact, prior to our tax  relief plan, we were warned that without taking action to properly  manage these programs, by the year 2026, when our country turns 250  years old, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and  servicing the national debt would take up 99 percent of all the Federal  revenues generated.   Today, mandatory payments already account for nearly three quarters  of our total Federal spending. This is because Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security have never been properly managed, and Congress does not  exercise appropriate oversight.   These programs run on autopilot. Given that they are our largest  Federal expenditures every year, it is vital for Congress to take an  active role in managing these necessary--I will say that again:  necessary--mandatory programs in order to get our fiscal house in  order. This does not necessarily mean making cuts. It simply means  giving Congress the authority to periodically and consistently review  them to make them as efficient as possible and to make certain they are  available for individuals who need them, both now and in the future.   I am pleased that this agreement creates a joint select committee to  address ways to fix our broken budget process, which is desperately  needed.   At the end of the day, no amount of cuts to defense and other  programs will have a meaningful effect on debt reduction without also  controlling the cost of these necessary mandatory-payment programs.   I will wrap up by thanking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  who support this agreement, for recognizing our country's need to  adequately fund our troops who sacrifice everything to protect our  freedoms. Without a strong military that can deter and defend against  aggression, nothing else really matters.   Maintaining the best, strongest military force in the world is vital  to keeping Americans safe. By increasing funding now, our troops will  be better equipped to do exactly that. We cannot risk a perceived  weakness in our force by our enemies, who may wish to draw us into a  major conflict. A major conflict or war is not only significantly more  costly in terms of dollars, but it has more serious cost in the loss of  human life. No one wants to see that, especially if we can avoid it  now.   This agreement adequately funds our troops. I intend to vote for it,  and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.
