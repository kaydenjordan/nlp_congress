 Mr. Speaker, the only time I hear some of my colleagues  express their concern about the deficit is when this body is  considering policies to let hardworking American families keep more of  their hard-earned money.   This is not the government's money. It is the people's money. They  earned it. If tax revenues to the government are a concern, then  certainly we should pass tax cuts.   After President Kennedy cut tax rates, revenues to the government  increased from $95 billion to $280 billion. After President Reagan cut  tax rates, revenues to the government increased from $600 billion to  $1.35 trillion.   Furthermore, annual GDP growth rates increased into the 4 to 5  percent range following these tax cuts. We are going to witness this  increase in economic growth again under President Trump with a tax bill  this House will consider later this week.   As Ronald Reagan said: ``We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because  we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion-dollar debt because we  spend too much.''                            ____________________
