 Mr. Speaker, I am  Greg Casar, and I represent the heart  of Texas. I rise today to sound the alarm. Extremist Republicans are  using the Texas legislature as a testing ground for their most extreme  policies that they plan to spread across the country.   Right now, top Texas officials are considering new laws to, one,  create vigilante bounty hunter groups to go after immigrant families;  two, defund our public schools; three, bar doctors from providing  healthcare to transgender Texans; four, cap how much renewable energy  our State can create; five, ban books and drag shows; six, block water  breaks for construction workers; seven, ban citizens from Asian  countries from attending public college; eight, they have already  banned abortion and now they are going after emergency contraception.   This vile blueprint may be the Republicans' plan for our State and  our country, but they are not representative of Texas values. Texans  take care of our neighbors, look out for each other. Americans want  decent healthcare, housing they can afford, and a decent future for  their kids.   As public servants, we should lead with love and integrity. After  all, Texas is a native word that means friendship, not cruelty. I may  yield back my time, but not my efforts.                            ____________________
