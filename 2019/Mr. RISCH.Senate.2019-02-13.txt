 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Israel--Namer Armored Personnel Carrier (APC-MT883) Power Packs Less           Transmissions (NPPLT) and Integrated Logistics Support         The Government of Israel has requested to buy two hundred       forty (240) Namer Armored Personnel Carrier (APC-MT883) Power       Packs, Less Transmission (NPPLT) in Full  [[Page S1321]]       Configuration; thirty (30) Namer Armored Personnel Carrier       (APC-MT883) Power Packs, Less Transmission (NPPLT) in Light       Configuration; and one hundred seventy-nine (179) Control and       Diagnostic Systems (CDS). Also included is an Integrated       Logistics Support package that includes: special tools for C-      Level maintenance; oil spray nozzle test bench; preservation       and packaging; containers; configuration management;       technical manuals, spare parts catalogs, other documentation       and publications, and other related elements of logistics and       program support. The total estimated program cost is $238       million.        The United States is committed to the security of Israel,       and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel       to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense       capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those       objectives.        The proposed sale will improve Israel's capability to meet       current and future threats in the defense of its borders.       These upgraded power packs will be used on their Armored       Personnel Carriers (APC-MT883) that were fielded in 2008.       Israel will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into       its armed forces.        The proposed equipment and support will not alter the basic       military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be MTU America, Novi, MI. MTU       America is the North American subsidiary of Rolls Royce Power       Systems. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Israel.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
