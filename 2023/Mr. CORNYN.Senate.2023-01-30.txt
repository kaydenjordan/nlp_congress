 Madam President, the killing of Tyre Nichols has  reignited a national debate about the excessive use of force by police,  and rightfully so. This unarmed 29-year-old was brutally beaten by  Memphis police officers with an egregious, excessive use of force.   Within the Republican conference, Senator Tim Scott from South  Carolina has been our leader on police reform matters, and I have been  proud to work with him on bills to help improve policing in our  communities and public safety. One of those bills was the Law  Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act, which, by the way, was just  signed into law last month.   This new law will ensure that all police officers have the  opportunity to acquire skills to defuse a potentially dangerous  situation like the one we saw in Memphis. Use of force should only come  into play when absolutely necessary, and this legislation will provide  law enforcement officers with the knowledge of what alternatives are  available to them, which invariably will make their lives better and  safer and also protect the life of the individual who is being  detained.   This has the potential to save lives and prevent another senseless  and entirely preventable tragedy like this from reoccurring.   I am glad this legislation is now the law of the land, and the  Department of Justice must implement it as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, last Friday I was in  Austin, my home, and had the opportunity to speak at a conference that  included some of the leading experts in all things dealing with  declassification and government transparency.   It was cohosted by a number of academic institutions in Texas and the  Public Interest Declassification Board, or PIDB.   Most of us had never heard of this group before, but the PIDB leads  incredible work to help advise the President and the executive branch  on ways to modernize the classification and declassification processes  which safeguard our national security but also protect public trust in  our institutions.   I joined an onstage conversation with my friend Will Inboden, who  leads the Clements Center for National Security at the University of  Texas at Austin.   We talked about the circumstances under which classification is  important. Controlling access to certain sensitive information enables  the United States to remain at least one step ahead of our adversaries.  It also protects sources and methods that allow us to collect  clandestine intelligence and protect the lives of those intelligence  professionals who are engaged in collecting that information, as well  as the avenues into those sources that are important to collecting this  intelligence. Obviously, we don't want to jeopardize either the  individuals involved or dissuade anyone from wanting to work with us in  the future or to allow some of our access to dry up because it then  becomes a matter of public knowledge.   But we know classification is not always the right answer. There are  many circumstances in which declassification safeguards our national  security.   One example is the way in which the United States Government  declassified and shared information with our allies in the run-up to  Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.   The decision to declassify some important intelligence gave Ukraine  enough battlefield awareness to push back after the initial attack and  save countless lives. It also unified Western response, leading to  quick condemnation of Russia's attack and resources for Ukrainian  forces.   Declassification is an important tool with which we share information  with our friends and allies around the world, but it is also another  way to show the American people what their government is doing. It  builds trust and transparency. It inspires confidence in the incredible  work that our intelligence professionals are doing, and it equips  scholars with the information they need to conduct academic research  that informs decision making.   Obviously, there is a very delicate balance between transparency,  which drives democratic self-governance, and secrecy, which is  sometimes necessary to protect sources and methods of information that  are important to protect our national security.   Policymakers and scholars have long debated this balance, but it  doesn't often garner much attention in the public square. At least that  was the case until recently.   Over the last several months, law enforcement have uncovered  classified documents in unsecured locations. For example, documents  were discovered at President Trump's home in Florida. They were  uncovered at President Biden's home in Delaware and in his private  office in Washington, DC. And they were found at the home of former  Vice President Pence in Indiana.   All of these discoveries paint a deeply concerning picture, because  those of us with access to classified information know that the only  appropriate place to view classified information is in a secure  setting.   Now, we have no idea--we, as Congress--no idea what these classified  documents contain. We don't know who had access to them. We have no  insight into the possible ramifications for national security. So there  are a lot of unanswered questions that need answers.   This really addresses Congress's unique role, as a coequal branch of  government, to provide oversight of the Federal Government. As elected  representatives, we have the duty to our constituents and to our  country to ensure their government is working for them, and oversight  of the intelligence community is a big part of that job, and it is part  of the system of checks and balances.   Now, in most cases, oversight happens out in the open at  congressional hearings, but this is, obviously, a different sort of  case. We are talking about classified documents that were never meant  for public consumption.   That is why we have the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that  I serve on and the House Committee on Intelligence, both of which were  created after the Church Committee made recommendations about oversight  that needed to be put in place over the intelligence community--both  the police, the community itself, to make sure that those tools were  not abused, but also to restore public confidence that  [[Page S141]]  that oversight was occurring and that abuses were not occurring at the  same time.   The Senate Intelligence Committee is one of the most bipartisan on  Capitol Hill, and I credit our leadership for keeping us above the  political fray.   Chairman Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and Vice Chairman Rubio, a  Republican from Florida, operate arm in arm to lead the kind of  oversight that I believe helps instill confidence in the intelligence  community and in our intelligence professionals.   The committee has a responsibility to examine the facts of these  cases and understand the potential risk it could create for national  security.   Unfortunately, in a hearing we had with the Director of National  Intelligence, we seem to have hit a brick wall, at least initially.  Despite the high profile nature of these discoveries, the Biden  administration will not allow Congress to perform its constitutional  oversight duties.   Back in August, Senator Warner and Senator Rubio sent a letter to the  Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General requesting  the classified documents that were seized at Mar-a-Lago.   Members of the Intelligence Committee are accustomed to reviewing,  handling, and protecting classified information. It is something we do  on virtually a daily basis. This document request was not to make this  public. This was a request for committee members to review the  documents in a classified setting. The administration refused.   In the months since, classified documents have been discovered at  more locations, and, again, the administration has refused to provide  access to this intelligence.   The Justice Department, as we know, has appointed special counsel to  oversee two of these probes, but yet they refuse to share the documents  or any information about them.   Now, it is one thing in an investigation conducted by law enforcement  to say: We are going to protect the person being investigated, and we  are going to protect the integrity of the investigation by not making  that public. We understand that, but this is something far different.   When a current and former President of the United States and a former  Vice President of the United States have classified documents in  unsecured settings, we need to know who had access to it, what the  intelligence reports contain, not because we are curious or we want to  interfere with an investigation by the Justice Department but because  we have an independent constitutional responsibility to protect the  national security of the United States and to protect the intelligence  community from unjustified criticism.   Several years ago, the Intelligence Committee investigated Russia's  efforts to interfere with the 2016 election. This was a case like now,  where special counsel was appointed, but Congress did not have to wait.  It wasn't forced to wait for that inquiry to be completed by former FBI  Director Mueller. Those investigations happened concurrently. The  special counsel's investigation happened at the same time as the Senate  Intelligence Committee's investigation occurred. These investigations-- both that of the Intelligence Committee and that of the Department of  Justice--should happen concurrently now as well.    As I said last week, the Director of National Intelligence, Director  Haines, testified before the Intelligence Committee. I was eager to  learn more in a secure setting, protected from public dissemination,  what was going on with these documents, what they meant, and who  produced them. Were they stale or were they current intelligence? What  sort of access did our adversaries have to them, and what did they  learn if they did get access to them that we need to know about and  prepare for?   I don't think any of our colleagues expected a full analysis of these  documents, but I was alarmed by the complete lack of transparency by  the Director of National Intelligence to the oversight committees in  Congress like the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Without  going into detail, Director Haines essentially said that once the  Department of Justice initiated its investigation, her office stood  down and did not inquire any further as to what these documents  contained. So far, the Department of Justice refuses to share details  of these intelligence products that were discovered at these unsecured  locations.   As I said, we have no idea what is in these documents, who could have  seen them, or how big of a risk it creates for national security, but  we do need the answers to those questions that only a review in a  classified setting in a secure facility by the oversight committees--we  need the answers that only that sort of inquiry will reveal.   We could have a major national security risk on our hands or it could  be a nothing burger, but the Department needs to be expedient and fully  transparent in sharing this information with Congress and the  intelligence community, again, in a classified secure setting, not for  public dissemination.   If you worry about leaks, which are rampant here in Washington, DC, I  must say, the record of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is  pretty darn good when it comes to no leaks.   Senator Rubio and Senator Warner have been clear that the Department  of Justice will not stonewall Congress. This is not a partisan matter.  It is not tenable for the position of the Department of Justice and for  the Biden administration to take that position. As policymakers with an  independent constitutional responsibility, we need to know the full  details so we can conduct the risk assessment and determine how best to  respond. President Biden's Department of Justice cannot stand in the  way of Congress's constitutional oversight role.   Now, many in the press have said: Well, what sort of things might the  Senators on the Intelligence Committee do to compel the cooperation of  the Department of Justice?   Well, I hope we don't have to go there. I hope this produces a  negotiation that will address the concerns both of the Department of  Justice and of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It is well  known what sort of tools are available to Congress--things like  appropriations, things like nominations--but I sincerely hope it  doesn't come to that. But we have a job to do, and we are going to do  it, with the cooperation of the Biden administration or without their  cooperation.   So all options are on the table to ensure not that we get to see what  we want to see for political or other inappropriate reasons but to make  sure our national security is not at risk.   Again, this is a bipartisan desire to see these documents and  evaluate the risk they could pose to our security. It is time for the  administration to cooperate with us in that effort.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on February 4, 2023, the tight-knit  community in Cass County, TX, will gather to solemnly honor the 50th  annual remembrance of the end of the Vietnam war and pay tribute to one  of its heroes, U.S. Air Force Sergeant John O'Neal Rucker.   Sergeant Rucker grew up in Linden, a town nestled deep in the heart  of the piney woods of east Texas. After graduating high school, he  answered the call to serve in the Armed Forces and volunteered for the  U.S. Air Force.   During his basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Sergeant Rucker  volunteered for assignment in Southeast Asia. According to the AC-119  Gunship Association, Sergeant Rucker was initially directed to Nakhon  Phanom, Thailand, in April 1972. In July of that year, he took a  temporary duty assignment to Da Nang, Vietnam, with the 18th Special  Operations Squadron.   After spending leave at home in Linden over Christmas 1972, Sergeant  Rucker returned to Vietnam with the anticipation that his time on the  battlefield would soon come to an end, as the war appeared to be  winding down. On January 27, 1973, the 21-year-old Sergeant Rucker was  off-duty and asleep in his barracks when rockets struck Da Nang Air  Base, instantly taking his life just hours before the Paris Peace  Accords took effect, finally ending the Vietnam war. Sergeant Rucker is  remembered as one of the last American servicemembers who paid the  ultimate sacrifice in Vietnam.   Shortly after his death, a marble plaque to honor Sergeant John  O'Neal Rucker was unveiled at Da Nang Air Base in March 1973. Thousands  of miles away, his hometown of Linden dedicated a monument to him in  November 1973 outside of the Cass County courthouse. Today, Sergeant  Rucker's life and legacy remain forever engraved in the hearts and  minds of his family, friends, and community.   Texas is home to generations of servicemembers and veterans who have  defended our freedoms at home and abroad. Our Nation's rich history has  been strengthened by the dutiful service and sacrifice of our  courageous military women and men, and we owe them our deepest respect  and greatest appreciation. May God bless Sergeant John O'Neal Rucker,  all of our fallen servicemembers, and their families.                            ____________________
