 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act.   These PFAS chemicals, synthetic, manmade chemicals, have now,  according to the science, evolved into a very significant public health  threat, and it is time that Congress act to protect our neighbors back  home, families, communities all across America with the passage of this  bill.   This is a bipartisan bill, and I want to thank my colleagues,  Congresswoman Dingell and Congressman Upton, for leading the charge  here, because what they propose and what we will vote on today will  protect our communities by instituting some new oversight and  regulations of these forever chemicals in PFAS, help us clean up these  chemicals from our drinking water, and protect the public health.   These PFAS chemicals are not regulated in any way right now. They are  often used in firefighting foam, in nonstick surfaces, stain-resistant  surfaces, and food packaging. The Agency for Toxic Substances and  Disease Registry has determined that PFAS exposure is associated with  low birth weight babies, an increased rate of cancer, lower fertility  rates, and developmental issues in young children and infants.   A new study out of the Yale School of Public Health recently found  that exposure increases the risk of miscarriage by 80 to 120 percent in  pregnant women. The CDC also issued a disclosure regarding a potential  intersection between PFAS and COVID-19.   These chemicals now have been detected in communities all across the  country. This bill will help us rely on the science, provide some  safeguards, make sure we are gathering the scientific data we need to  keep our communities safe back home.   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action  Act.
