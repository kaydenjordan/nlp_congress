 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this sham budget  resolution. When I came to Congress, I said I would work with anybody  to get things done and deliver for Iowans. I know there will be  opportunities to do that, and I hope there are across the aisle.   But today, I have to say I am disappointed that we are debating a  hyper-partisan resolution instead. It is a disgrace to taxpayers. It  was crafted in the back rooms. And Iowans' seat at the table was taken  away through this process today.   As a result, this budget resolution will allow major legislation to  move along partisan lines, including President Biden's $1.9 trillion  spending plan.   Mr. Speaker, this plan isn't about COVID relief at all. It is about  jamming through a liberal agenda, including a $15 minimum wage mandate.                                time  1445    This would absolutely decimate our rural economy in Iowa and would  destroy livelihoods across my district.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a $15 minimum wage  would kill at least 1.3 million jobs. So let's talk about the real  people here, the workers, the Iowans who make up these statistics.   Cubs Auto Shop is a small business in Brooklyn, Iowa, in my district.  The owner built his business from the ground up, and he told us that a  $15 Federal minimum wage would make it hard to expand his business at  all.   We need economic growth now more than ever before. He is just one of  my many constituents who have told me they would have to lay off  workers, raise prices, or even shut down permanently if a $15 minimum  wage becomes a reality. This might be right for California and New  York, but one-size-fits-all Federal minimum wage mandates would destroy  small businesses and rural communities in my district.   It is unacceptable that the budget would be used to push this  through. Instead, we should be using it to stop Washington's pork  spending.   So, today, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose  this faux budget resolution and stand up for taxpayers.    Madam Speaker, I rise today as a voice for the  voiceless.   Since Roe v. Wade was enacted by the Supreme Court decision 48 years  ago, 62 million abortions have been performed--62 million. This is a  tragedy. This is definitely something that is devastating to think  about.   We must stand up for the unborn, those who cannot stand up for  themselves. I always will, and I am doing that here tonight.   As a mom of two boys, this issue is close to my heart. While  reflecting on the lives lost is difficult to do, I am inspired here  tonight. I am inspired by the growing pro-life community and movement  in our country. I am hopeful that the next generation will fight for  life, and I am proud to help lead this fight in Congress, standing with  you.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend, the gentleman from  New Jersey, for his leadership on this very important issue, and I am  honored to add my voice to his and many others in the defense of life  here tonight.
