 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  10 outstanding students across Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District who have been awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International  Scholarship.   The Gilman program is named after former Congressman Benjamin A.  Gilman, who served in Congress from 1973 to 2003. He was chair of the  House International Relations Committee and represented Upstate New  York.   Established in 2001, the Gilman program is part of the State  Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. This  scholarship sponsors students to study or intern abroad during the  academic year.   This program is an important part of the Federal Government's effort  to expand and diversify U.S. study abroad and allows Americans to gain  the global competencies that are crucial to our national security and  our economic prosperity.   Since 2001, this program has allowed more than 41,000 Americans from  1,350 U.S. colleges and universities to study or intern in more than  160 countries. The Gilman program advances people-to-people diplomacy  and strengthens America's role in the global marketplace.    The Gilman program continues to expand the American student  population that studies abroad with nearly 70 percent of Gilman  scholars identifying as students of color, 60 percent from small towns  or rural parts of the United States, and nearly 50 percent are first- generation college students.   Congratulations to Rik Bhattacharyya, a student from Penn State  University studying in India; Ashlyn Bird of Lycoming County, a student  at Drexel University studying in the United Kingdom; Deven Dancy of  Union County, a student at Susquehanna University studying in Ghana;  Hannah Dees of Centre County, a student at Juniata College studying in  the United Kingdom; Shawnee Geletka of Venango County, a student at  College for Creative Studies studying in Italy; Saoirse Hopp of Centre  County, a student at University of Pittsburgh studying in Spain;  Kimberly Johnson of Potter County, a student at Drexel University  studying in Italy; Luke Kantz of Snyder County, a student at University  of Pittsburgh studying in India; Rute Pires of Union County, a student  at Bucknell studying in Ireland; and Casey Sennett of Centre County, a  student at Penn State University studying in Italy.   These students are currently studying or interning across the world.   Good luck in your studies, and enjoy your time abroad.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Clara Barton, the founder of the American Red Cross.   Clara is one of the most honored women in American history. From a  young age, she was dedicated to service and helping others.   Clara started her career in Washington, D.C., working in the Federal  Government. She was in D.C. at the start of the Civil War. Clara  recognized the immediate need to help these newly recruited troops.   Clara spent the early days of the war collecting food and supplies  for the Union Army. She would later risk her life heading to the field  hospitals to volunteer and deliver medical services.   More than 140 years later, the Red Cross continues its service  through its strong network of volunteers, donors, and partners. They  continue to serve those in need by mobilizing the power of volunteers  in times of emergencies.   Mr. Speaker, Clara Barton's birthday is on December 25. Her passion  for service is an example to all of us. Her selflessness and  determination to help others continues to inspire us to this day.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman  for her leadership and support.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of my legislation, the  Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, that supports students and dairy  farmers across America.   Milk is an essential building block for a well-rounded and balanced  diet, offering 13 essential nutrients and numerous health benefits.   Out-of-touch Federal regulations have imposed dietary restrictions on  the types of milk students have access to in school meals.   Our ranking member is a dear friend of mine, and we have worked  together. I have been here for 15 years and him a little longer. We  have a great relationship and have had a lot of bipartisan bills  together, like we marked up yesterday.   Mr. Chair, I have to say, the only special interest here is our kids.  It is our kids who have been cheated out of the nutrition that they  need. Case studies have shown that the rate of obesity and being  overweight increased dramatically after access to whole milk and flavor  was taken out of the schools in 2007-2008, which was a baseline. In  2010, a Democrat-led initiative demonized milk fat. In 2020-2021, there  was a study of that same cohort, and obesity has gone up without this  beverage.   Mr. Chairman, regarding my good friend from Louisiana, who just  spoke, everybody is entitled to their own opinion but not their own  facts. The facts are that it is the underlying law that was passed back  in 2010 by a Democratic House and signed by a Democratic President  that, quite frankly, required a physician prescription for health  reasons.   That is a good part of the law, and we didn't touch that. We didn't  address that in this bill, so I am not sure why he is talking about it.  It is not germane to the topic we are talking about today. That is the  underlying law.   The bottom line is that students and parents do have choice. There is  a mechanism to honor that. The only choice they don't have, though, is  access to the most nutritious beverage, which is whole milk-- specifically, whole milk and flavor.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from Louisiana sharing how much  waste there was and what that amounts to in cartons and half pints and  what it amounts to in dollars. That is because of the taste experience.  It is not that these kids are throwing the milk away because it is  unhealthy for them. It is just a terrible taste experience when you are  drinking low-fat or nonfat milk.   Students have been limited to fat-free or reduced-fat milk since the  Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was enacted in 2010.   While some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have argued  that we should not reform individual aspects of child nutrition, it was  that legislation more than a decade ago that singled out milk for  regulation, which is why we are here today.   There are several reasons why these top-down regulations are harmful  to students and school districts that are forced to comply with them.   First, we have seen students opt out of consuming milk altogether if  they don't have access to a variety that they enjoy. According to the  ``Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory  Committee,'' more than two-thirds of school-age children failed to meet  the recommended levels of dairy. No kidding. We took out most nutrition  and most taste and made it inaccessible to them.   Let's face it, the only way to benefit from milk's essential  nutrients is to consume it. We are not force-feeding anybody anything.  This is about choice. When students turn away from milk, they often opt  for far less healthy alternatives that are highly caffeinated, sugar- sweetened, or lack key nutrients.   These regulations also perpetuate baseless claims that milk is bad  for our kids. Research has shown time and time again that whole and 2  percent milk are not responsible for childhood obesity and other health  concerns. In fact, these beverages are so nutritious that research  shows positive health outcomes for kids who consume whole milk.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record academic studies from  researchers around the world, including from top institutions such as  Boston University and Tufts, who have studied the health effects of  full-fat dairy.             [From the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]   Whole Milk Compared With Reduced-Fat Milk and Childhood Overweight: a                    Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis                                 Introduction         Childhood obesity has tripled in the past 40 y, with nearly       1 in 3 North American children now overweight or obese (1-3).       Over the  [[Page H6893]]       same period, consumption of whole-fat cow-milk has halved       (4). The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian       Paediatric Society recommend that children switch from whole-      fat cow-milk (3.25%) to reduced-fat cow-milk (0.1 to 2%) at 2       y of age to limit fat intake and minimize the risk of       childhood obesity (5, 6). European (7), British (8), and       Australian (9) health authorities have provided similar       recommendations. Healthcare providers (10) and families (11)       frequently follow this guideline, and school and child-care       nutrition policies (12-14) often reflect them. Since 1970       whole-cow-milk availability has dropped by 80% in North       America, whereas reduced-fat milk purchases have tripled (15,       16).        Given that cow-milk is consumed daily by 88% of children       aged 1 to 3 y and by 76% of children aged 4 to 8 y in Canada       (17) and is a major dietary source of energy, protein, and       fat for children in North America (17, 18), understanding the       relation between cow-milk fat and risk of overweight or       obesity is important. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on       the relation between total dairy consumption and child       adiposity have had conflicting findings. According to these       studies, higher cow-milk intake in children is associated       with taller height and better bone and dental health (19-21).       Although these studies evaluated total dairy consumption,       they did not consider cow-milk fat specifically. The       objectives of this study were to systematically review and       meta-analyze the relation between whole-fat (3.25%) relative       to reduced-fat (0.1 to 2%) cow-milk and adiposity in       children.                                   Methods         A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was       conducted. The study was designed according to the Preferred       Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses       guidelines (PRISMA-P) (22) and registered as a PROSPERO       systematic review and meta-analysis (registration number:       CRD42018085075).                              inclusion criteria       Types of studies        Studies included in the search were original works       published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Cross-      sectional, cohort, case-control, and longitudinal studies, as       well as intervention trials, both controlled and not       controlled, were included in the search strategy. There were       no restrictions on date or length of follow-up.      Population        Studies that included healthy children aged 1-18 y with       10 human subjects were considered. Studies that       examined undernourished or disease populations (other than       asthma) were excluded.      Exposures        The primary exposure was cow-milk fat, categorized as skim       (0.1% fat), 1% fat, 2% fat, or whole or homogenized (3.25%       fat). Measures of exposure included FFQ, multiday food       record, 24-h food recall, or any other validated or       nonvalidated measurement tool. Dietary pattern analyses were       not included.      Outcomes        The primary outcome was childhood adiposity. These measures       included BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI, weight for age, body fat       mass, lean body mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip       ratio, body fat percentage. skinfold thickness, and       prevalence of overweight or obesity as defined by the WHO       (23), CDC (24), or International Obesity Task Force       (IOTF)(25) cutoffs. When sufficient information was not       available in the full text publication, study authors were       contacted by email to obtain additional data.      Meta-analysis        Meta-analysis included studies that reported the number of       children who consumed whole (3.25%), 2%, 1%, or skim (0.1%)       milk regularly (a priori defined as typically, daily, or       4 times per week), as well as the number of       children from each of these groups who were classified as       either healthy weight, or overweight or obese (overweight and       obese were included as 1 category) assessed using BMI       standardized according to the WHO (23), CDC (24), or IOTF       (25) criteria.                                search methods         A comprehensive search strategy was developed by a research       librarian (NT) with expertise in systematic reviews. From       inception to August 2019, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to       Nursing and Allied Health Literature), MEDLINE, Scopus, and       the Cochrane Library were searched on March 23, 2018 and       updated on August 2, 2019 using Medical Subject Headings       (MeSH) and keywords (see Supplemental Methods for search       strategies).                  Data extraction, management, and analysis       Study selection        To evaluate study eligibility 2 reviewers (MA and SMV)       independently reviewed study titles, abstracts, and full       texts if needed. Both reviewers applied inclusion and       exclusion criteria and differences were examined and resolved       by consensus, which was achieved 100% of the time. Full-text       articles were retrieved for potentially eligible studies and       reviewed. Characteristics of included full-text studies were       summarized.      Data extraction        Two reviewers (MA and SMV) extracted data from eligible       studies using standardized data extraction tables adapted       from the Cochrane Data Extraction Template (26). Differences       were resolved by consensus 100% of the time.      Data management        Covidence (27) software was used to select studies, review       results, and resolve discrepancies between reviewers. All       included study records were kept in spreadsheet format.      Data synthesis        Studies included in the analysis were described according       to a standardized coding system that captured key elements of       each study including descriptors of the study setting,       population size and age (mean and range), exposure or       intervention, comparator group, method of data collection,       outcome measures, type of analysis, and results.                  Risk of bias and study quality assessment         Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale       (NOS) (28) for nonrandomized analyses, which expresses the       risk of bias on a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 9; scores       <7 are considered low risk. (NOS criteria can be found in       Table 2.) The NOS-guided review included an examination of       participant selection, comparability of children consuming       whole or reduced-fat milk, and exposure and outcome measure       ascertainment. To allow sufficient follow-up time for a       meaningful change in adiposity to occur, the minimum       acceptable follow-up time was prespecified as 1 y. Study       comparability, defined as whether studies adjusted for       similar confounding variables, was specified a priori as       studies that adjusted for important characteristics       including: birth weight or baseline weight (for prospective       cohort studies), milk volume consumed, and parent BMI.       Studies that adjusted for each of these factors were awarded       2 points, whereas 1 point was allocated if adjustment was       performed using angle4 other covariates. Reports       were assigned 1 point for ascertainment of exposure only when       structured interviews or medical records were used for data       collection. Risk of bias was assessed by 2 reviewers (MA and       SMV) and consensus was achieved 100% of the time.                             Statistical analysis         For each study, participant information, design, and       results were summarized. We derived crude ORs and extracted       adjusted ORs, whenever available, for overweight or obesity       among children who consumed whole (3.25%) milk, compared with       children who consumed reduced-fat (0.1-2%) milk regularly. A       random effects model based on the restricted maximum       likelihood estimator was decided a priori and used to       separately pool crude and adjusted ORs of overweight or       obesity. Each study was included as a random effect to       account for between-study variation in this model.       Sensitivity analyses were performed using the Knapp-Hartung       method and inverse-variance weights. Because prospective       cohort studies can reveal different relations than cross-      sectional studies, we performed a subgroup analysis according       to study design. Additionally, we analyzed studies in       subgroups according to risk of bias (high compared with low)       and age (1-5 y, 6-11 y, and 12-18 y). Subgroup analyses were       accompanied by tests for interaction between each subgroup       and the main effect from the random-effects metaregression,       by using an interaction term in metaregression models for       study design (cross-sectional compared with prospective       cohort), risk of bias (high compared with low), and age group       (1-5 y, 6-11 y, and 12-18 y). Heterogeneity across included       studies was estimated using the I\2\ statistic. Heterogeneity       was considered low (<40%), moderate (40-60%), or high (>60%).       Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger       test.        Finally, we conducted a dose-response metaregression to       quantify the association between percentage of fat in cow-      milk consumed and the odds of overweight or obesity. Only       studies that reported group-specific odds for       angle3 types of cow-milk fat were included in this       analysis. For the dose-response analysis, we first used a       fixed-effect approach to estimate the dose-response relations       within each study. Then, we used a random-effects approach to       combine across studies the dose-response estimates that were       generated in the first step for each study to obtain       regression coefficients, and their respective standard       errors. R software version 3.2.2 was used for all analyses,       using the ``metafor'' package.                                   Results         The database search identified 5862 potentially eligible       studies. After exclusion of duplicates (n = 1861), 4001       reports underwent title and abstract review. Studies that did       not meet inclusion criteria (n = 3915) were removed resulting       in 86 published studies that underwent full text review.       Reasons for exclusion included wrong exposure, wrong outcome,       wrong patient population, dietary pattern analysis only, or       wrong study design such as case reports or editorials.       Twenty-eight studies met all inclusion criteria. Of these, 20       were cross-sectional and 8 were prospective cohort studies.       No interventional studies were identified. Most studies (n =       23) compared consumption of whole milk (3.25% fat) with       reduced-fat milk (0.1%, 1%, or 2% fat). Four studies (36-39)       compared whole and 2% milk with 1% and skim milk. One study       compared whole milk with 2% milk.        Nineteen studies used zBMI, 4 prospective cohort studies       used percentage body fat change, and 5 studies used       overweight or obesity categories as the primary adiposity       outcome. Three studies used 2008 WHO growth standards, 14       studies used 2000 CDC growth  [[Page H6894]]       standards, 7 used 2000 IOTF growth standards, and 4 studies       either did not specify or used other standards for zBMI       measurement.        Eighteen (36, 38, 39, 41-45, 47-49, 51, 52, 57, 58, 60, 63,       65) studies reported that higher cow-milk fat was associated       with lower child adiposity. Ten studies (37, 40, 46, 50, 53-      56, 59, 61) reported no association between cow-milk fat and       child adiposity.                           Risk-of-bias assessment         Risk of bias assessed using the NOS suggested that 1 of 8       prospective cohort studies and 0 of 20 cross-sectional       studies were low risk of bias. Common limitations that       increased risk of bias included cross-sectional study design,       nonstandardized dietary assessments that were either study       specific or not validated, lack of adjustment for clinically       important covariates (including volume of milk consumed,       parent BMI, and child adiposity assessed prior to the       outcome), and study duration too short to detect a meaningful       change in adiposity (defined a priori as 1 y).       Association between cow-milk fat and child overweight or obesity         Fourteen (38, 42-44, 46, 47, 49, 51, 52, 57, 58, 60, 62,       65) studies met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria; 11 were       cross-sectional and 3 were prospective cohort studies. All       studies included in the meta-analysis compared whole (3.25%       fat) milk with reduced-fat (0.1-2%) milk consumption,       allowing an OR to be calculated. A total of 20,897 healthy       children aged 1-18 y were included in the meta-analysis.       Children were from 7 countries (United States, United       Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Sweden, New Zealand, and Italy).       Anthropometric standards used to determine overweight or       obesity categories included the WHO, CDC, or IOTF growth       standards in 6, 5, and 3 studies respectively.        Crude analysis of all 14 studies revealed that among       children who consumed whole milk compared with reduced-fat       milk, the pooled OR for overweight or obesity was 0.61 (95%       CI: 0.52, 0.72; P < 0.0001). Heterogeneity measured by the       I\2\ statistic was 73.8% (P < 0.0001 ). A sensitivity       analysis using inverse-variance weights did not reveal       different results. Subgroup analysis by study design revealed       no significant interaction between cross-sectional and       prospective cohort studies. For the 11 cross-sectional       studies (n = 9413), the pooled OR of overweight or obesity       was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.69; P = 0.0001), and for the 3       prospective cohort studies (n = 11,484) it was 0.76 (95% CI:       0.63, 0.92; P = 0.006).        Risk of bias (high compared with low) and age group were       also not significant modifiers of the relation between cow-      milk fat and child adiposity. Analyses of 5 studies (49, 51,       52, 57, 58) that reported adjusted ORs did not show       differences between crude and adjusted estimates (adjusted       OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.63; crude OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.46,       0.66). Results of the sensitivity analysis using the Knapp-      Hartung method to pool the 14 studies (crude OR: 0.62; 95%       CI: 0.52, 0.73) were similar to the main results (crude OR:       0.61; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.72)). Publication bias, visualized       using a funnel plot was difficult to ascertain given the high       heterogeneity (I\2\ = 73.8%) and relatively low number of       included studies.        Data were available from 7 studies (38, 39, 44, 52, 57, 58,       65) which included 14,582 children aged 2 to 11 y, and       demonstrated a linear association between higher cowmilk fat       and lower child adiposity. For each 1% higher cowmilk fat       consumed, the overall crude OR for overweight or obesity was       0.75 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.87; P = 0.004; t\2\ = 0.01; I\2\ =       64%).                                  discussion         This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified       that relative to reduced-fat cow-milk, whole-fat cow-milk       consumption was associated with lower odds of childhood       overweight or obesity. The direction of the association was       consistent across a range of study designs, settings, and age       groups and demonstrated a dose effect. Although no clinical       trials were identified, existing observational research       suggests that consumption of whole milk compared with       reduced-fat milk does not adversely affect body weight or       body composition among children and adolescents. To the       contrary, higher milk fat consumption appears to be       associated with lower odds of childhood overweight or       obesity.        Findings from the present study suggest that cow-milk fat,       which has not been examined in previous meta-analyses, could       play a role in the development of childhood overweight or       obesity. Several mechanisms have been proposed that might       explain why higher cow-milk fat consumption could result in       lower childhood adiposity. One theory involves the       replacement of calories from less healthy foods, such as       sugar-sweetened beverages, with cow-milk fat. Consumption of       beverages high in added sugar has been associated with       increased risk of overweight and obesity during childhood.       Other theories involve satiety mechanism such that higher       milk fat consumption might induce satiety through the release       of cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1 thereby       reducing desire for other calorically dense foods. Another       possibility is that lower satiety from reduced-fat milk could       result in increased milk consumption causing higher weight       gain relative to children who consume whole milk, as observed       in the study by Berkey et al.        Cow-milk fat might offer cardiometabolic benefits. The       types of fat found in cow-milk, including trans-palmitoleic       acid, could be metabolically protective. Higher circulating       trans-palmitoleic acid has been associated with lower       adiposity, serum LDL cholesterol and triglyceride       concentrations, and insulin resistance, and higher HDL       cholesterol in several large adult cohort studies. However,       diets that replace dairy fat with unsaturated fatty acids       might also offer cardiometabolic protection.        Confounding by indication and reverse causality are       plausible alternate explanations. Parents of children who       have lower adiposity might choose higher-fat milk to increase       weight gain. Similarly, parents of children who have higher       adiposity might choose lower-fat milk to reduce the risk of       overweight or obesity. The majority of children included in       this systematic review were involved in prospective cohort       studies, in which the potential for reverse causality is       lower than in cross-sectional studies. Results from these       11,484 children were consistent with the overall findings.       Two of the included prospective cohort studies attempted to       address confounding by indication by adjusting for baseline       BMI; 1 of these repeated the statistical analysis only among       participants with normal-weight BMI values, with similar       findings. Clinical trial data would have provided better       evidence for the directionality of this relation; however,       none were available.        This study had a number of strengths. The meta-analysis       included a large, diverse sample of children from around the       world. The number of potentially eligible studies was       maximized by the comprehensive search strategy and contact       with authors to obtain missing data. Also, study selection,       data collection, and risk of bias assessment were performed       by 2 independent reviewers, which improved accuracy and       consistency. All studies included in the meta-analysis used       trained individuals to obtain anthropometric measurements,       and weight status was standardized using growth reference       standards (WHO, CDC, and IOTF). Using metaregression       techniques, differences in study design, risk of bias, and       age group were taken into account. Finally, a dose-response       meta-analysis was conducted, which demonstrated a linear       relation between higher cow-milk fat and lower child       adiposity.        This study had a number of limitations. First, included       studies were all observational. Only 1 study in this analysis       was considered to have low risk of bias, and all studies in       the meta-analysis had high risk of bias. Risk of bias       included cross-sectional designs and lack of adjustment for       clinically important covariates. For example, cow-milk volume       was accounted for in only 11 of 28 studies in the systematic       review, and in 5 of 14 studies in the meta-analysis.       Adjustment for volume in future studies would allow for a       clearer understanding of whether higher cow-milk fat protects       against higher adiposity, or reduced-fat cow-milk increases       adiposity. However, among these studies. comparison of       adjusted compared with crude odds demonstrated consistent       findings. Residual confounding by variables not accounted for       in the individual analyses is also possible; this is a common       limitation for meta-analyses of observational studies.       Heterogeneity was relatively high (I\2\ = 73.8%), which might       have been attributable to a variety of factors including       varied methods of ascertainment of exposure and outcome, and       differences in study design and follow-up duration. Although       subgroup analyses of prospective cohort studies revealed       results comparable to the overall metaregression, these       comparisons might not have had sufficient power to detect       clinically meaningful differences. However, 11,484 children       were involved in prospective cohort studies making large       differences in effect size unlikely. Although only studies       with standardized dietary measurements were included,       measurement error was possible due to recall bias or lack of       validation of dietary assessment tool. Error in adiposity       measurement could also have introduced bias. although weights       and heights were measured by trained individuals and       standardized protocols were used in all studies included in       the meta-analysis. Differences in adiposity measurement       (i.e., body fat percentage, zBMl, BMI), and different growth       standards could have contributed to heterogeneity. For       example, use of the WHO rather than IOTF or CDC standards       could have resulted in a greater proportion of overweight or       obese children being reported. Future studies using WHO       growth standards, which are believed to represent optimal       child growth, would help to minimize heterogeneity and       overcome these limitations. Consideration for relevant       outcomes such as cardiovascular risk should be included in       future analyses to understand other effects of cow-milk fat.       Publication bias was also possible as demonstrated by a       funnel plot and Egger test.        In conclusion, observational evidence supports that       children who consume whole milk compared with reduced-fat       milk have lower odds of overweight or obesity. Given that the       majority of children in North America consume cow-milk on a       daily basis, clinical trial data and well-designed       prospective cohort studies involving large, diverse samples,       using standardized exposure and outcome measurements, and       with long study duration would help determine whether the       observed association between higher milk at consumption and       lower childhood adiposity is causal.

(By Dariush Mozaffarian)         Dairy products are a major component of most diets,       contributing 10% of calories in the United States.       Surprisingly, for such a major share of the food supply,       their health effects remain remarkably uncertain,       insufficiently studied, and controversial. Dietary guidelines       on dairy remain largely based on theoretical considerations       about isolated nutrients (e.g., theorized benefits of calcium       or vitamin D; theorized harms of total fat or saturated fat)       or short-term dietary pattern studies of surrogate markers,       rather than on the mounting evidence on how milk, cheese,       yogurt, butter, and other dairy foods relate to major       clinical endpoints. Such evidence on health outcomes is       crucial, because dairy products appear to be a heterogeneous       class with complex effects dependent upon the interplay of       diverse nutrients and processing characteristics (e.g.       probiotics, fermentation, milk fat globule membrane, and       more).        In this issue of the Journal, 3 new publications report on       dairy consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes or mortality.       Ardisson Korat et al. evaluated estimated dairy fat       consumption and onset of diabetes in 3 cohorts of US health       professionals. After adjustment for other risk factors,       higher dairy fat intake, in comparison with carbohydrate, was       associated with lower diabetes risk in 1 cohort of middle-      aged women, and was not significantly associated with       diabetes in the other 2 cohorts or among all 3 cohorts       combined. In subgroup analyses, dairy fat intake was       associated with lower risk of diabetes at younger ages (<65       y) and in women, the 2 subgroups among whom 70-80% of       diabetes cases occurred--although these interactions by age       and sex did not achieve statistical significance. When dairy       fat was statistically compared with carbohydrate from whole       grains, the latter was associated with lower risk of diabetes       (per 5% energy, 7% lower risk), whereas, compared with other       animal fats (largely form red meat and poultry) or with       carbohydrate from refined grains, dairy fat consumption was       associated with lower risk of diabetes (per 5% energy, 4-17%       lower risk). Dairy fat consumption was not associated with       incident diabetes when compared with vegetable fat,       polyunsaturated fat (total, v	6, or v	3), or monounsaturated       fat from plant sources. Because dairy fat in these cohorts       was associated with several unhealthy lifestyle factors,       including higher BMI, more current smoking, less physcial       activity, fewer fruits and vegetables, and a less healthy       overall dietary pattern, this suggests that residual       confounding, if present--the major limitation of       observational cohorts such as this one--would tend to cause       bias toward dairy fat appearing more harmful (less       beneficial) than it actually may be.        These findings add to a growing body of literature which       call into question the soundness of conventional dietary       recommendations to avoid dairy fat. As noted by Ardisson       Korat et al., dairy fat contains a complex mix of different       SFAs, other unsaturated and conjugated fatty acids, and other       constituents, each with varying biological effects.       Physiologic effects of dairy fat further vary according to       content of milk fat globule membrane, which alters       cholesterol absorption and perhaps skeletal muscle responses       to exercise. Also, cheese, the major source of dairy fat in       most diets, is a fermented food and a rich source of       menoquinones which may improve insulin secretion and       sensitivity through osteocalcin-related pathways. In a recent       pooling project of de novo individual-level analyses from 16       prospective cohort studies across 4 continents (including 2       of the 3 US cohorts evaluated by Ardisson Korat et al.),       objective blood biomarkers of odd-chain saturated fats and       trans-palmitoleic acid, each found in dairy fats, were       associated with significantly lower risk of diabetes.       Together with these prior findings, the new results by       Ardisson Korat et al. provide little support for metabolic       harms of dairy fat, and indeed suggest potential benefits       amoung younger adults, among women, and as a replacement for       other animal fats or refined carbohydrates.        A second report in this issue of the Journal assessed how       changes in dairy foods, assessed using serial questionnaires,       related to incident diabetes in the same 3 US cohorts of       health professionals. After multivariable adjustment,       participants who decreased their total dairy intake by >1       serving/d over a 4-year period experienced 11% higher       incidence of diabetes, compared with stable intake. Among       dairy subtypes, changes in low-fat milk, whole milk, and       cream were not significantly associated with diabetes,       whereas decreases in ice cream, increases in some types of       cheese, and decrease in yogurt were each associated wih       higher risk. Several factors complicate the interpretation of       this analysis. Foremost, none of these findings were       symmetrical for increases compared with decreases in intake:       i.e., when decreased consumption of total dairy or a dairy       subtype was linked to diabetes risk, increased consumption       was not linked in the opposing direction, and vice versa.       This counters expected biology and the important Bradford       Hill criterion of dose-response, which for example has been       evidenced in these cohorts for dietary changes and long-term       weight gain. In addition, results for each of the dairy       subtypes appeared generally inconsistent across the 3       cohorts, with little uniformity (I \2\ values were not       reported). Some of the findings counter expected causal       biology--e.g., that decreasing ice cream increases diabetes--      raising concern for reverse causation. The dietary instrument       was also variably reliable for assessing different dairy       foods: for example, as compared with multiple dietary       records, the FFQ reliably measured consumption of yogurt (r =       0.97), but not hard cheese (r = 0.38). In light of the 26       prior cohort studies which have reported on dairy consumption       and incident diabetes, in sum suggesting lower risk from       total dairy and especially yogurt consumption, the internal       inconsistencies of the present findings for changes in dairy       foods raise more questions than they answer.        In the third publication in this issue, Pala et al.       investigated dairy consumption and death from cancer,       cardiovascular disease, and all causes in a community-based       Italian cohort. After adjustment for other risk factors,       compared with no consumption, moderate milk intake       (200 g or 6.5 ounces per day) was associated with       25% lower mortality, largely owing to 50% lower       cardiovascular mortality, but consumption at higher levels       was not associated with lower risk. Findings were similar for       low-fat comparew with whole-fat milk. Intakes of yogurt,       cheese, and butter were not significantly associated with       mortality. As the authors concluded, the lack of linear dose-      response for milk raises questions about the validity of the       observed benefits, but none of the findings support the       hypothesis that milk, yogurt, cheese, or butter consumption       increases mortality.        The global pandemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes,       together with high rates of cardiovascular disease and       cancer, have stimulated a new popular frenzy around healthier       eating. Although the resulting attention on diet-related       health impacts, economic burdens, and corresponding policy       solutions has been positive, the craze of competing popular       diets and their proponents have simultaneously fueled       confusion, controversy, and skepticism. For example, ignoring       the preponderance of evidence, some popular books and social       media headlines claim that dairy foods are toxic. At the same       time, prevailing dietary guidelines exacerbate the confusion,       remaining mired in outdated conceptual frameworks and       hesitating to acknowledge new paradigms of complexity.        As is always true in science, these 3 new investigations       cannot by themselves definitively eliminate confusion or       answer all questions. Yet, these studies aimed to address       crucial questions on dairy and health in large and well-      designed prospective cohorts. Together, the findings provide       little support that consumption of total dairy, dairy       subtypes, or dairy fat is harmful, and they continue to build       the case for possible benefits. As recently reviewed, the       dizzyingly complex characteristics and molecular effects of       different dairy foods belie any simplistic overall summary or       synopsis. These 3 new studies highlight this complexity and       the urgent need for additional long-term prospective studies,       interventional trials, and mechanistic investigations of       dairy foods and health.     Mr. Chairman, these studies show, among  other things, that full-fat dairy foods have little to no association  with high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,  obesity, blood pressure, or cholesterol.   In fact, several of these studies show that full-fat foods help  improve or lower negative health outcomes for children who drink more  full-fat dairy beverages.    Mr. Chairman, additionally, since whole  milk was removed from school lunchrooms, the childhood obesity rate has  increased, according to the CDC and several case studies. Whole milk is  not the problem.   For our children to excel in the classroom and beyond, they must have  access to more nutritious options, not fewer.   The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will allow schools participating  in the National School Lunch Program to serve all varieties of flavored  and unflavored milk, including whole milk.   It is important to remember that this legislation does not require  any student to drink, or any school to serve, whole milk. Rather, this  legislation simply gives schools the flexibility to serve a broader  variety of milk in the school lunchroom.   Additionally, if students have a documented medical condition or  disability that prohibits them from safely or comfortably consuming  milk, schools are required to offer them an alternative beverage. This  legislation would not change that standard.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to have 134 bipartisan cosponsors from 44  States.  [[Page H6896]]  The bottom line is the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act is about  ensuring students have the necessary nutrients to learn and grow.
