 Mr. President, last night in my home State of  Kentucky, the President called for an end to ObamaCare as Congress  continues working to repeal this disastrous law and replace it with  patient-centered solutions.   In Kentucky, just like across the country, costs are spiking, choices  are dwindling, and insurance markets are edging closer and closer to  collapse. Listen to this wife and small business owner who lives in  Shelby County. She wrote to my office about her problems with  ObamaCare. Here is what she said:         I have seen little or no success where ObamaCare is       concerned. [T]he current insurance available is causing       working class Americans to choose between paying their bills       and getting needed medical care. . . . We need help.    Kentuckians deserve better than ObamaCare. The American people  deserve relief from ObamaCare. The law is failing right in front of us.  It will continue to get worse unless we act. So we have to act. This  week the House will continue working to advance ObamaCare repeal-and- replace legislation. The House has already done some great work on the  bill, and I look forward to taking it up in the Senate soon. We will  have an amendment process here in the Senate. At the end of that  process, we will send a bill to the one person who can sign it into  law, and that is the President of the United States.   But the legislation before the House isn't our only tool to help  stabilize the healthcare marketplace. It is one prong of a three-part  strategy.   The second prong is the administration continuing to use its broad  authority to bring relief. Officials like the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, Tom Price, and the Administrator of the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, are already working to  bring relief to stabilize health markets that ObamaCare has rattled.   The third prong is further legislation to reform the healthcare  market and make it more competitive for consumers. Taken together,  these three prongs aim to restore power to the States and move more  healthcare decisions out of Washington and back to the States. They  also represent the best way to bring relief to Americans who continue  to suffer under ObamaCare. The American people deserve better than this  failing law. We promised we would repeal and replace it for four  straight elections. We are working to fulfill that commitment right  now.                            ____________________     On another matter, Mr. President, yesterday Supreme  Court nominee Neil Gorsuch came before the Judiciary Committee for the  first day of his confirmation hearing. In his opening statement, Judge  Gorsuch showed why so many lawyers and judges strongly support his  nomination as a thoughtful and fairminded judge who understands the  particular role of the Federal courts in our Republic and who has  discharged his judicial office accordingly.   Last week, two of his former colleagues on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals added their voices to this growing chorus. The endorsement of  him was published in the Washington Post. Judge Gorsuch's hearing  continues today with Senators on the committee asking him questions. As  they  [[Page S1858]]  do, we should keep in mind the counsel of his former Tenth Circuit  colleagues--both as to their experience with Judge Gorsuch on the bench  and their view of our role in questioning him now that he is before the  Senate. Judges Deanell Reece Tacha and Robert Henry both served with  Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit. Both were chief judges of that  court, in fact, and both have gone on to careers in academia: Judge  Tacha as dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law and Judge  Henry as president and chief executive of Oklahoma City University.  Judge Tacha was appointed to the circuit court by President Reagan  while Judge Henry was appointed to the circuit court by President  Clinton. They describe themselves as a lifelong Republican and  Democrat, respectively.   They write that ``predictions abound as to how Judge Neil Gorsuch--if  confirmed--would lean or even vote on this or that case. . . . But  these essentially political discussions tend to distort the role of  judges in our government.'' They remind us that the `` `independence of  the judges' is a most sacred tradition in U.S. constitutional law,  requiring all judges to have no obligations to those who nominated or  confirmed them.'' Let me repeat that. They note that the principle of  judicial independence requires judges not to have obligations to those  who nominate them or those who confirm them.   In that regard, Judges Tacha and Henry remind us that ``[d]etailed  discussions during the confirmation process on issues that might come  before a judge are not proper; in fact, they would in all likelihood  require recusals from the cases discussed.'' They point out how the  judicial process is different from the confirmation process. They  observe that ``controversies that go before the court often bring  unique and complicated facts that could completely change a judge's  sincerely espoused view.'' Legal research is ``[a]nother critically  important input into judicial decisions.'' Legal research might reveal  precedent that overrides a judge's ``previously held views or even  logical interpretations of legal text.'' They emphasize that the  judicial process is the collection of ``[t]hese factors--tradition,  independence, precedent and unique facts,'' and that these factors  ``often combine to lead judicial nominees to change their views when  confronted with specific cases.''   By contrast, these factors are not present in the confirmation  process. So it is not realistic or fair to expect a judicial nominee to  state or imply under oath how he or she might rule as a judge. That is  why Justice Ginsburg could not give any hints, forecasts, or previews  of her possible rulings during her Supreme Court nomination hearing.   But we don't have to guess how Judge Gorsuch would conduct himself as  a Justice. We have a 10-year record of his judicial decisions, and we  have the professional experience of those who practiced before him and  those who have served with him. As for the latter, Judges Tacha and  Henry give him the highest marks.   Judge Gorsuch was, they say, ``like most good judges, assiduously  attentive to the facts and the law in each case.'' If he were confirmed  to the Supreme Court, they say that ``other important traits of Gorsuch  that are not likely to change'' are things like ``his fair  consideration of opposing views, his remarkable intelligence, his  wonderful judicial temperament expressed to litigants and his  collegiality toward colleagues.''   They conclude by saying that ``[i]f we seek to confirm to the Supreme  Court a noted intellect, a collegial colleague, and a gifted and  eloquent writer--as well as a person of exhibited judicial  temperament--Gorsuch fits that bill. He represents the best of the  judicial tradition in our country.''   Their endorsement tracks with so many others we have heard, and I am  confident Judge Gorsuch will show the country today and tomorrow why so  many people are so proud to support him to be our next Supreme Court  Justice.                            ____________________     As to another well-qualified judge whose nomination is  currently being considered by the Senate, today, we will consider the  nomination of U.S. District Court Judge Danny Reeves to serve on the  U.S. Sentencing Commission. He is a great choice to serve on the  Commission, and I look forward to the Senate confirming him.   Among its responsibilities, the Commission is tasked with setting  sentencing policy in our Federal judicial system. While I don't always  agree with the policy outcomes, I appreciate the important role it  plays in trying to ensure fairness in our Federal courts. Judge Reeves  is well prepared for the task ahead. I am confident he will do great  work on the Commission.   His legal career began in Northern Kentucky University's Salmon P.  Chase College of Law, where he graduated with honors in 1981. After  graduation, he clerked with Judge Eugene Siler, then a district court  judge in the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky. Upon finishing  his clerkship, Judge Reeves entered private practice at what was then  known as Greenebaum Doll & McDonald. He became a partner there in 1988.   In 2001, I had the first of many indepth discussions with Judge  Reeves. I was so impressed by him that I recommended him to then- President George W. Bush and that he appoint Judge Reeves as a Federal  district court judge in Kentucky. The Senate confirmed him without a  dissenting vote, and he served with distinction on the Federal bench.   Judge Reeves has been lauded for his steady devotion to the rule of  law, for his commitment to fair rulings predicated on the facts and  law--rather than his own political beliefs--and for his evenhanded  approach to all who enter his courtroom. Because of his demonstrated  appreciation for these precepts, Judge Reeves will be a significant  asset to the Commission and an advocate for sound and sober  decisionmaking.   As many of you know, the Commission has been operating, to the extent  it can, without a quorum. Not only does Judge Reeves' appointment stand  as validation of his distinguished career as a respected jurist, but,  along with the reappointment of U.S. District Court Judge Charles  Breyer, it represents a return to an operational agency. Now the  Commission can get back to the business for which it was designed,  establishing uniform sentencing practices and policies that will be  utilized in Federal courts all across the country.   So I look forward to supporting and congratulating Judge Danny  Reeves, as well as his wife Cindy and their sons Adam and Joe and their  families, on his confirmation to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, over the past  several weeks, the Senate has been working to bring much needed relief  from the regulatory onslaught of the last 8 years. Using the  Congressional Review Act, or CRA, we have already taken action to end  regulations that threaten jobs, weaken our economy, and undermine  States' authority. Today we will continue to move forward with our  efforts to block more unnecessary regulations that hold our country  back in a number of ways. The CRA resolution that we will consider  today will end regulation that undercuts Alaska's ability to manage its  fish and wildlife resources. As a coalition of hunters, fishing  enthusiasts, and conservationists recently wrote me, ``Congress  promised that the citizens of Alaska, working through their Department  of Fish and Game would be able to manage their own fish and wildlife,  as do the other 49 states.''   Passing this CRA resolution will roll back the administration's  overreach and restore the State-Federal balance that Congress  originally intended. Our colleagues from Alaska, Senator Murkowski and  Senator Sullivan, are the sponsors of this resolution we will consider  today. They know the damage this regulation would do to their home  State. They have been working to do something about it.   They have also been quick to point out the concerning precedent this  rule would mean for the rest of the States. I appreciate their  leadership on this issue and look forward to joining them in  overturning this harmful Obama administration regulation as soon as  possible.  [[Page S1859]]    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 69.
