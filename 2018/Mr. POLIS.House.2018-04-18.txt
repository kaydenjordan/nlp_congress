 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of my colleague,  Louise McIntosh Slaughter.   For my entire time of service in the House of Representatives, she  was my ranking member of the Rules Committee. I sat just a couple of  seats down from somebody who truly was inspirational and a fearless  advocate for progressive values and a woman who, despite her advancing  years, always remained ahead of the curve and future oriented.   Louise had an internal energy, an internal fire that is rare in this  body and, frankly, rare across our country. She long stood for an  inclusive vision of America. She embraced LGBTQ families before it was  popular. She always stood for women's rights despite opposition on both  sides of the aisle.   I already miss and continue to miss somebody who, to me, was a friend  and a mentor in this institution. I express my sincere condolences to  the family of Louise McIntosh Slaughter.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for H.R. 5444 and H.R.  5445. I support the underlying bills, but the problem is these rules  don't allow any amendments.   We suggest an open process. I offered three amendments myself to  these bills. My colleague Mr. Sherman offered an amendment to improve  the bill. Unfortunately, we have been denied a vote, and instead this  body is having a debate on, frankly, issues, just like yesterday, there  doesn't even need to be that much debate on. I would think these bills,  like the one yesterday, could have been put on something called the  suspension calendar, which means they are not too controversial.   Usually the reason we do a rule is we allow amendments. That is why  we do that, and yet all the amendments that were offered were rejected.  So we are kind of drawing out the time it takes to pass these  bipartisan bills instead of spending the time on issues that the  American public want us to address.   Members on both sides of the aisle, myself included, are clamoring  for debate around what is called an AUMF, an authorized use of military  force, bill to address the authority of the President with regard to  Syria, with regard to ISIS and other operations.   We are now 4 months into 2018. The House still has not considered a  bill to protect our Dreamers, our young aspiring Americans.   So inaction, inaction, inaction. And even where we are moving forward  with a bipartisan bill, we are shutting out ideas from Republicans and  Democrats that could actually make the bill better.   I, as I mentioned, offered a couple of those to this bill, and the  majority blocked those amendments on a party-line vote. One of my  amendments would have provided clarity to consumers and the IRS around  providing a window for immunity on filings for use of cryptocurrency, a  bipartisan bill with Mr. Schweikert. Another amendment would have  provided tax relief for kombucha manufacturers, a bipartisan bill with  Mr. Tipton. Another would have eased tax burdens on small businesses in  States that have legalized marijuana.   All three have bipartisan support. The Rules Committee could have  granted the necessary waivers, as they do on many amendments when they  choose to, and allowed them.   Mr. Sherman's amendment was actually germane to the underlying bill.  There wouldn't have needed to be any additional waivers that were  granted. We simply could have advanced it to the floor to debate.   So, again, these bills are largely noncontroversial. What is  controversial is why won't the Republican leadership allow Democrats  and Republicans to amend and improve these bills? And two, why we are  wiling away our time on bills that we could have done Monday on a  suspension voice vote instead of really working on a bipartisan  Authorization for Use of Military Force or the other prescient issues  our country faces?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), whose amendment was rejected in a party-line  vote by the Rules Committee and not even allowed to be debated for a  moment on the floor of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on tax day, the White House made  an announcement about President Trump's taxes, but it wasn't the  announcement that Americans were waiting for.   Instead of releasing his returns, President Trump was actually just  requesting an extension to file his 2017 income tax return, which still  would not be made public if or when he files it. It is a good reminder  that President Trump has broken with decades of tradition when, as a  Presidential candidate, he did not disclose his tax returns.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.R. 305, the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act, which would require Presidential  nominees to disclose their last 3 years of tax returns.   To discuss our proposal, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), our final speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I ask is the gentleman prepared to close?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity here to defeat the previous  question and call up a bill to increase transparency with regard to the  President. We also have an opportunity to reject a rule that excludes  good ideas, where Members of Congress, in good faith, offered  amendments to improve the bill and they were denied.   Of course, the two underlying bills are fine bills. What is broken is  the process, a process that doesn't allow a meaningful floor debate on  improvements to a bill and a process that doesn't allow any floor time  for an Authorization for Use of Military Force or addressing the needs  of our Dreamers. Unfortunately, these bills are brought to the floor  under a closed rule.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
