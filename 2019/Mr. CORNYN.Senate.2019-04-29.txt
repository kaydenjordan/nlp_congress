 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, with the 2-week hiatus we have had here in  Washington, DC, so we could be back home visiting with our  constituents, some things have not changed; they are just the way they  were when we left, and that would include the heart-breaking stories  that illustrate the situation along our southwest border.   I have talked, as you might imagine coming from Texas, with a lot of  Border Patrol personnel who found migrants crammed in parts of cars  that you didn't even know exist. I visited the unmarked graves of those  who have been abandoned by their human smugglers in essentially desert  conditions and left to die. I have seen the disgusting stash houses,  where dozens of migrants are held at a time to avoid being caught  before they are transported up through the Interstate Highway System to  distant locations.   I could fill a book with all of the sights I have seen and the  stories I have heard over the years, and I am sure, with the stories  compiled by the Border Patrol agents and officers, we could fill an  entire library.   The story, though, really is about how ruthless and inhumane and  completely reckless and thoughtless with regard to human life these  criminal organizations truly are.   One headline, though, during this recess period, stopped me in my  tracks. Even this, I thought, could not be the case. It read:         A 3-year-old was found alone in a field by Border Patrol       agents. His name and phone numbers were [written] on his       shoes.    A toddler, not even old enough to talk to the agents who found him,  was abandoned.   Customs and Border Protection believes the boy was part of a larger  group trying to enter the United States with their human smugglers.  When the group encountered Border Patrol agents, the adults ran into  the Rio Grande River and back to Mexico, leaving the little boy all by  himself.   He was, as the Border Patrol does in every instance, taken into  custody and treated well. He was taken to a hospital for a medical  evaluation, and, miraculously, he was found to be in good condition.   While the agents tried to track down the boy's family, one  supervisory patrol agent purchased clothing for him out of his own  pocket; other personnel entertained the little boy, watching movies and  playing games.   These agents aren't just patrolling the border to catch illegal  crossers; they are now being forced, because of the crisis at the  border, to act as caregivers for some of the most vulnerable  individuals they come across. Unfortunately, what that means is, they  are also diverted from their No. 1 job, which is law enforcement and to  protect the security and safety of the American people along our  borders. They are now diverted from that mission, as well as their  counterdrug mission, essentially handing out diapers and juice boxes  for little boys and little girls.  [[Page S2472]]    I think this should be a reminder for some of our colleagues who seem  to think that the status quo along the border is just hunky-dory that  it is far from humane. Many of our colleagues have said: Well, we need  to abolish ICE because somehow that is inhumane; enforcing the laws  passed by Congress and signed into law by the President, that somehow  is beyond the pale.   Enforcing the law isn't inhumane. Apprehending people who try to  illegally enter into the United States or import their poison so it can  be used by Americans who then overdose and lose their lives due to  consuming those drugs, that is inhumane. What is inhumane and lacks  simple compassion is doing nothing to stop this practice. Leaving  security gaps that are exploited by smugglers, traffickers, and  criminal organizations who have zero regard for human life is inhumane.  These people, the drugs, the contraband are mere commodities to these  criminal organizations. They don't care anything about them.   Giving people an opportunity to smuggle an innocent child across our  border alone and leaving him to die in the desert is not humane. Making  criminal cartels rich by exploiting our porous border is inexcusable.   To be clear, the criminal organizations perpetuating this cycle are  the bad guys, not our law enforcement personnel who work to protect our  border at substantial risk to themselves and who take compassionate  care of those in their custody.   I think one of the reasons this story garnered so much attention is  because that is not what the average person imagines the Border Patrol  encounters at the border, but increasingly it is. The Border Patrol  encounters unaccompanied children and families consisting of one adult  and one or more children along the border because the criminal  organizations that smuggle them to the border are exploiting gaps and  vulnerabilities in our asylum laws.   Many people believe the typical migrant is an adult traveling alone,  but more likely than not, that is not the case, and, in fact, it is  becoming less and less common.   In fact, according to the most recent statics, there is no new net  migration from Mexico. Almost all of the migration into the United  States, either by people who illegally enter or asylum seekers, is from  countries other than Mexico, most notably Central America, but,  literally, those could be merely the transit points for people coming  from all over the world, up through Mexico, into the United States.    From October 2018 to March 2019, a 6-month period, more than 360,000  people--360,000 people--were apprehended along the southwest border.  That is a remarkably high number for this point in the year, based on  historical statistics. Only about one-third of them were single adults,  more than half were traveling as a family unit, and the rest were  unaccompanied children, like this 3-year-old little boy. He was found  by agents in the Rio Grande Valley, far and away the busiest Border  Patrol sector in the country. In fact, more than 40 percent of all  unaccompanied children are apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley sector.   These numbers are far from normal. Unsurprisingly, our Border Patrol  and Customs and Border Protection agents, our local communities, the  nongovernmental organizations, the churches, and others who try to lend  a helping hand to these migrants coming across the border are not  equipped to handle this huge surge of humanity.   Customs agents are being pulled off inspection duty to help process  the apprehended migrants. Security checkpoints are being shut down. The  flow of legitimate trade and travel is being impacted. Individuals are  then being released because there is simply not enough space to hold  them, even though they violated our laws or have not yet proven their  right to an immigration benefit under our asylum system.   I had a group of manufacturers come see me before the latest break.  They told me that from Juarez to El Paso, which is right across the Rio  Grande River--that because commerce was backed up, the truck traffic  that was transporting car parts as part of a just-in-time inventory  program to manufacturers on the American side, they literally had to  hire an airplane to fly 11 minutes from Juarez to El Paso. Car  manufacturers that operate in Texas, Missouri, and other parts of the  country, depend on this cross-border supply chain for their products.  Eventually, if we don't do something about this flood of humanity and  the blockage it is creating to legitimate trade and commerce across our  ports of entry, we are going to see Americans lose their jobs because  it simply was uncontemplated by anybody in that business that they  would have to suffer those kinds of delays. Instead of a 1-hour delay  coming across the ports of entry carrying manufactured goods that can  be assembled in the United States or otherwise used in products made  here, some are taking as much as 24 hours to get across. People are  literally sleeping in their truck because they can't get through the  ports of entry, in part, because the Customs and Border agents are  being diverted, like I said earlier, handing out juice boxes, handing  out diapers, taking care of this huge flood of humanity coming across  our border.   Don't just take my word for it. I remember when President Obama made  comments talking about a humanitarian crisis. He called it a  humanitarian and security crisis back in June of 2014. At that time, we  saw as many as 135,000 during the month of May and June 2014  apprehended at the border. Just to put that in context, in February and  March of this year, 180,000 people were detained at the border--back  when President Obama called it a humanitarian and security crisis,  135,000; February and March 2019, 180,000.   Simply put, this is a manmade disaster, and the only one that can fix  it is the U.S. Congress, and it is going to get nothing but worse.   All of the pull factors, the things that attract people to come  across the border to take advantage of these gaps in our asylum laws,  are going to do nothing but attract more and more and more people.   Certainly, we all understand, as a matter of simple human compassion,  why people would want to leave if they can't get a job, if they can't  provide for their families where they live, but we simply cannot  continue to accept the tens of thousands. Now, indeed, in a 2-month  period of time, 180,000 new people have been coming into the country  essentially jumping in line ahead of others who are trying to legally  immigrate to the United States. It is overwhelming for our communities  and our Border Patrol and our Customs agents.   We know many of these migrants pay smugglers to lead them on this  dangerous journey north or have to pay others a tax to pass through  territories along the way, including the so-called plazas which are  adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border. So while migrants and vulnerable  children are being left for dead in the desert, and we are struggling  to manage a devastating humanitarian crisis, these criminal  organizations are getting richer and richer. This is part of how they  do business.   While it is hard to know exactly how much money these groups are  making, a recent study by RAND estimated that revenues to smugglers  moving migrants from Northern Triangle countries--that is in Central  America--range from about $200 million to about $2.3 billion in 2017  alone. These are the same people, again, who are commodity agnostic,  who care nothing about human life. They will move migrants for economic  purposes. They will move people who are being sex trafficked, and they  will move drugs, some of which contributed to the 70,000 Americans who  died of drug overdoses last year, since Mexico is responsible for about  90 percent of the heroin and much of the fentanyl that comes across our  southwestern border.   Of course, all of this is tax-free. You better believe these networks  and their operations will only continue to get richer and richer and  more and more ruthless and more and more dangerous.   If you think these problems are going to go away on their own, you  are wrong. The number of children and family units found along our  border is already climbing at an appalling pace, and we need to take  action to alleviate the strain on our personnel on the southern border  and to eliminate the clogs and delays in legitimate trading commerce  that is the lifeblood of our Nation, as well as our counterparts in  Mexico.   Unfortunately, rather than trying to put out the fire, many folks  here in  [[Page S2473]]  Washington would rather fan the flames. The topic of border security  has become a hot button, a zero-sum game that people seem to be willing  to talk about more than look for solutions.   As we all know, that is not how to get things done around here. We  need to work together to try to come up with solutions to change our  asylum laws in a way that is both compassionate and one that respects  the rule of law and allows us to control this vast flood of humanity  seeking to enter our country and take advantage of our asylum laws.   I have been speaking with our colleagues here in the Senate, as well  as those in the House, on both sides of the aisle, about commonsense  reforms, what they might look like, and where we might find common  ground. We can't wait to do comprehensive immigration reform in order  to fix this particular problem where children and families turn  themselves in at the border because of these flaws in our asylum laws.  We need to address that and to do what we can, but once we accomplish  that, we need to move on to do other things that we know we need to do  in the best interest of our country and in the best interest of the  rule of law.   I think it is amazing what you can accomplish when you talk to other  Members of Congress instead of just the news cameras, but that seems to  be solely where the conversation is occurring--for the benefit of news  cameras. We have had some productive discussions about how we can  provide our frontline officers and agents with the resources they  need--staffing, authorities, infrastructure, and technology.   I, for one, am here and ready to talk to anyone who is willing to  work in good faith to provide relief for the humanitarian crisis  occurring on our southern border. That is what President Obama called  it, and it has gotten much worse. It doesn't help to be labeling this  some sort of fake emergency, as some of our colleagues on the other  side of the Capitol have. To deny reality is a pretty big impediment to  trying to solve the problem.   I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle can take stock of  the situation, accept the facts, and muster the courage to put politics  aside and work together to create a much needed and long-overdue reform  of our immigration policies because this problem is not going away.  There were 76,000 people detained at the border in February and 103,000  detained at the border in March. There is no good reason why the  103,000 will not grow to 150,000, to 200,000, or to 250,000.   All of the same pieces are in place and all of the same flaws are  being exploited by these transnational criminal organizations to move  people into the country, where they can essentially circumvent our  immigration enforcement and border security measures. It is going to do  nothing but get worse when it comes to impediments getting in place of  lawful commerce and trade, which are so important to our economy and  the economy of Mexico and our common border.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
