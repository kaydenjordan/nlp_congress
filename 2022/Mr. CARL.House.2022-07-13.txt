 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7900, the NDAA  2023.   We have worked across the aisle on this bill, and I take great pride  in it. We have successfully fought back against the President's cut in  our defense budget, obviously due to inflation.   For example, it gets the Navy back on track to build a large enough  fleet to counter threats like China, with 355 ships. This includes  much-needed ships that will be built by Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama,  and we are very proud of that.   It also takes care of our servicemen and their families by giving a  4.6 percent pay raise to counter Bidenflation. I encourage my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support the bill because it  is critical to the defense of this country.                                time  1530
