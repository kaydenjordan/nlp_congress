 I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the  Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.  Schatz) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia  and support his amendment. It is a good amendment for West Virginia and  a good one for America, and I look forward to voting for it.   I ask unanimous consent at this point to enter a colloquy with my  friend, the senior Senator from Iowa.    Madam President, have you heard of a drug pricing  proposal that is supported by both Democratic and Republican Senators,  the American Association of Retired Persons, the American Medical  Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, America's health  insurance plans, 76 percent of the American people, President Donald  Trump, and the Department of Health and Human Services? What kind of  idea can this be that has that kind of support, bipartisan support in  Congress, as well as in the White House?   Well, Senator Grassley and I have a simple amendment to the spending  bill that is before us which provides $1 million--small change by any  Federal standard--for the Health and Human Services Department to issue  rules regarding pricetags on direct-to-consumer ads for prescription  drugs.   While this underlying bill includes many important provisions that I  support, it doesn't do anything to tackle prescription drug costs. And  we know, American families know across the board, that it is time for  us to act.   If I ask you whether you have seen any commercials for prescription  drugs on television and you answer no, then I know one thing for sure:  You don't own a television, because they broadcast an average of nine  drug ads that each of us see every single day--nine a day. You know  what I am talking about. It is the ads with those unpronounceable names  of drugs and then that long, mumbling ``Don't take it if you are  allergic to it; this may kill you''--all the warnings they give you at  the end of the ad, over and over and over again.   The pharmaceutical industry spends $6 billion a year so that we get a  steady diet of these drug ads.   How many countries in the world have television advertising for  prescription drugs? Two--the United States of America and New Zealand.   Each year, $6 billion is being spent for one purpose: so that  finally, after watching an ad for the 45th time, you can spell  ``XARELTO'' and walk into the doctor's office and ask if you can have  XARELTO blood thinner rather than Warfarin or some other version. The  difference, of course, is that the XARELTO prescription drug costs $560  a month, and it may not be any better for you than the generic version  that is a lot cheaper.   Do you know what the No. 1 drug is that is advertised on television  and sold in the United States of America? When I tell you, you will nod  yes.   Here it is: HUMIRA--HUMIRA. It was designed to help people with  rheumatoid arthritis, and that is a terrible disease, and the people  needed a helping hand. Then they discovered it had a positive impact on  psoriasis. Well, psoriasis can be a terrible thing to suffer from, but  there are a lot of us who just have a little red patch on our elbow who  technically have psoriasis.   What I showed you here you don't see on television, incidentally. How  much does HUMIRA cost? It costs $5,500 a month--a month. Do you wonder  why the cost of healthcare is spiraling out of control--$5,500 a month?  Sadly, many of these high-priced prescription drugs are being  prescribed by doctors when it is not necessary, and that drives up the  cost of healthcare. It is why a major health insurance company in my  State has told me they spend more money each year on high-cost  prescription drugs than they spend on inpatient hospital care. Think  about that--more money. It is going through the roof, and there is  nothing to contain it.    So the Senator from Iowa, with his Midwestern commonsense approach to  legislation, has joined with the Senator from Illinois, who hopes to  aspire to the same goal, to come up with a basic idea: If you are going  to run a drug ad, put the price of the product on the ad. We will then  know what it really costs, and we will also know when they start  raising it again and again and again.   Well, the pharmaceutical industry hates this bill and this amendment  like the devil hates holy water. They don't want to tell you what it is  going to cost. They want you to go into the doctor's office and say: I  just have to have Humira. I have this little patch on my elbow, and I  absolutely have to have it.   Too many doctors write the prescriptions. So what Senator Grassley  and I are trying to do is to give the American people more information  about drugs and, particularly, their costs. We are trying to make sure  that information gives transparency to the transaction, and we are  trying our very best to give the American consumers a break and perhaps  to start to slow down the cost of prescription drugs.   This is a simple amendment--$1 million to the Department of HHS to  issue rules requiring pricetags on ads. One Senator opposes this--one.  We are trying our best to convince him not to oppose us. We think it is  a good idea to move forward on this.   I yield the floor to my friend, my colleague, and cosponsor to this  measure, Senator Chuck Grassley.    I thank my colleague from Iowa. Patience certainly is an  important part of this job, but the American people are impatient. They  want to know why they elected us to office and we don't solve problems.  This is a problem that Senator Grassley and I want to start solving:  informing consumers about the actual costs of prescription drugs--what  a radical idea.   The first time you realize what a drug costs is when you stand in  front of the cash register with your mouth wide open saying: You have  to be kidding me. Instead, people ought to know going into this  conversation what these drugs cost. That is not an unreasonable  request. We do it for cars, for gas, for so many things. Why don't we  do it for this?   The American people want to get it. We want to get it. I hope we can  convince one Senator who is holding us up to give us a chance to inform  the American people on a bipartisan basis of something that will help,  in a small way, perhaps, but it will help to bring the costs of  healthcare down in this country.   I thank the Senator from Iowa.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Kaine, Senator Wicker and  Senator Warner for raising this issue. Plans for procurement of Ford- class carriers will be debated in the upcoming conference on the  defense appropriations bill. I look forward to the Department of  Defense and the Navy providing more information on the proposal, and I  will keep Senator Kaine's comments in mind as the discussion continues.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, December 14, 2017.      Hon. James Mattis,      Secretary of Defense,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Mattis: As you continue preparation of the       Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request for the Department of       Defense, we write to express our support for the block buy of       Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. It is our       understanding that the Navy and industry have been evaluating       the feasibility of block-buy for CVN-80 and CVN-81, as well       as the potential cost savings from such a procurement       strategy. We applaud the Department of Defense's efforts to       examine smarter and more efficient acquisition approaches and       would actively support the Department's pursuit of a block       buy of Ford-class aircraft carriers in Fiscal Year 2019.        Previous block-buys have yielded savings of several percent       of the total cost of the ships when compared to annual       procurements, which could be in excess of $1 billion for two       Ford-class carriers. Total savings could grow to something       closer to $2 billion if the procurement intervals between the       ships are additionally shortened from five-year centers to       three- or four-year centers, which would be consistent with       the Navy's goal of achieving and maintaining the 12-carrier       force called for in the Navy's 355-ship requirement.        In light of the increased budgetary demands placed on the       Department, we believe that revisiting a proven acquisition       method, one that could be executed without reducing funding       for other vital shipbuilding programs, is not only warranted,       but a sound investment.        As recent events in the Pacific have shown, our nation's       carrier fleet is under considerable demand, with 3 of 11       deployed and 7 of 11 carriers underway in recent weeks. A       block-buy of Ford-class will help the Navy achieve its       objective of 12 carriers that better meets combatant       commander requirements and readiness goals to sustain       worldwide operations. Additionally, a block-buy would       continue to signal to the shipbuilding industrial base about       our nation's resolve to field a 355 ship fleet. Over the past       25 years, our shipbuilding industrial base has undergone a       massive consolidation. The community, which used to tap into       more than 17,000 suppliers now relies on fewer than 3,000       across the country. These remaining suppliers would       significantly benefit from the predictability and stability       of a known future workload. We believe the stability offered       by a block-buy approach would enable suppliers to develop       greater efficiencies and invest in their own businesses which       would further benefit other Navy shipbuilding programs as       well.        At the forefront of today's Navy is the Nimitz class       carrier and Virginia-class submarine, both of which are       successful products of block-buy type initiatives. As we look       to the next 50 years, we believe a wise investment of our       precious defense dollars would be in the time-proven       acquisition method of block-buy for our next generation of       aircraft carrier. Thank you for your consideration and       service to our country.            Sincerely,          Roger F. Wicker, U.S. Senator; Tammy Baldwin, U.S.             Senator; Cory Gardner, U.S. Senator; James M. Inhofe,             U.S. Senator; Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator; Luther             Strange, U.S. Senator; Sherrod Brown, U.S. Senator; Tim             Kaine, U.S. Senator; Tom Cotton, U.S. Senator; Mazie K.             Hirono, U.S. Senator; Bill Nelson, U.S. Senator; Jeanne             Shaheen, U.S. Senator; Mark R. Warner, U.S. Senator;             Thom Tillis, U.S. Senator; Patty Murray, U.S. Senator;             Tim Scott, U.S. Senator; Maria Cantwell, U.S. Senator.     Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, at the  outset, the issue of abortion is a divisive issue in America. Many  people have different and strongly held beliefs on this particular  issue.   We have a law on the books now--and have for decades--that no Federal  funds may be spent for the performance of abortion procedures,  including at Planned Parenthood. Yet Planned Parenthood does much more  than that. Planned Parenthood provides healthcare for millions of women  across the United States, and Planned Parenthood provides family  planning so that these women can avoid unplanned pregnancies, which,  sadly, in many cases, lead to abortion. Regardless of your position on  abortion, the position of Planned Parenthood is to counsel families so  they can control the number of children they have and avoid unplanned  pregnancies and the likelihood of abortion procedures to follow.   It is for this reason that I have consistently voted against Senator  Paul when he has stood here to defund Planned Parenthood, and I will  today. Yet I am about to make a modification request in the hopes that  we can have the vote that he just asked for, the vote on Planned  Parenthood, as long as we can also have a Democratic vote--one of  each--on an amendment that is being offered by Senator Joe Manchin of  West Virginia, which basically states that we in the U.S. Senate will  join in an effort to preserve those portions of the Affordable Care Act  that protect families who have members with preexisting conditions.  That is basically it.   Time and again, we have heard Republicans say they don't want there  to be discrimination against families because there is a child who is a  cancer survivor or because there is a spouse who has diabetes. They do  not want them discriminated against and to be charged more for health  insurance. That is all Senator Manchin is asking for.   So we will have a vote on the Paul amendment on Planned Parenthood  and on the Manchin amendment, which goes to the heart of the Affordable  Care Act's preexisting condition protection. Those two amendments can  bring us to a close on this debate. I think that is a fair, bipartisan  conclusion. I agree with what Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has said in  that this is the right way to end this debate--with a Republican  amendment and a Democratic amendment.   I move to modify Senator Paul's request. I ask unanimous consent that  the following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number:  Paul No. 3967 and Manchin No. 3865. I further ask consent that at 4  p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed  and that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the  amendments prior to the votes and that each amendment be subject to a  60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. I further ask consent that  following the disposition of the Paul amendment, the managers' package,  which is at the desk, be agreed to--a bipartisan package--and that all  postcloture time be yielded back.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would  like some explanation as to where we are on the floor at this moment.    I object.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have  agreed that the Republican Senator from Kentucky is to offer an  amendment to defund Planned Parenthood. I will be opposing that, but I  believe he is entitled to a vote. On the Democratic side, we are asking  to have an amendment, in a bipartisan nature, so that the Democratic  amendment can be offered, which may be opposed by both of the  Republican Senators. With that, there would be a real debate in the  Senate, which we rarely have.   Because Senator Paul and I agree that there should be both  amendments--the Democratic and Republican amendments--and that we  should move forward to close down debate on the overall bill, I will  object until we get Senator Cornyn's agreement.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the  Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.  Schatz) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the  Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.  Schatz) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the  Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.  Schatz), are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, this year marks an important milestone for  a true treasure in Illinois. The Lincoln Park Zoo, located in the heart  of Chicago, is celebrating its 150th anniversary.   From its inauspicious beginnings with the gift of two pairs of swans  from Central Park in New York City, the Lincoln Park Zoo has grown to  be a destination for Chicago residents and visitors alike. The zoo is  visited by 3.7 million people annually.   Visitors to the zoo appreciate its central location; it is close to  cultural and shopping attractions in Chicago. But what everyone loves  about the zoo is that there is no admission fee in order to enjoy the  zoo's exhibits. That is right; admission to the Lincoln Park Zoo is  free. In 1878, 20 years after those swans arrived from Central Park, it  was resolved that the Zoo would always be free and open to the public.  Today, Lincoln Park Zoo remains the Nation's only privately managed,  free-admission zoo in the country.   When people visit the zoo, they not only experience the seals,  gorillas, polar bears, giraffes, the big cats at the Kovler Lion House,  and a pygmy hippopotamus, they also are introduced to farm animals,  equipment, and practices that reflect the importance of agriculture to  my home State. For many urban children, the zoo allows an introduction  to nature and agriculture in a way they may not otherwise experience.   Generations of Chicagoans have fond memories of spending summer days  at Lincoln Park Zoo with their families. Many can tell you that it is  worth braving the blustery Chicago weather for a visit to Lincoln Park  Zoo during Zoo Lights, their annual winter celebration.   I have always considered Lincoln Park Zoo to be a hallmark of a  Chicago childhood. It is a place I wanted to share with my twin  grandchildren, now age 7, when they come to visit. Hopping on the 151  CTA bus and wandering the zoo grounds in summer and winter has always  been a great adventure for my family.   I want to join the community in celebrating the 150th anniversary of  the Lincoln Park Zoo. The staff and volunteers of the zoo should be  proud of their efforts to preserve and foster this Chicago treasure,  ensuring future generations have the opportunity to create memories as  I have done with my family.                            ____________________
