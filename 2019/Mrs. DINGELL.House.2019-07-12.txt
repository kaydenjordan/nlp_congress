 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I would like to first thank Chairman Smith and the House  Armed Services Committee for all their good work crafting the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   This is a strong bill. It includes many top priorities that will care  for our servicemembers and keep the United States well defended,  including serious provisions to address PFAS chemical contamination,  which is a serious threat at too many of our military bases. PFAS  chemicals are manmade and harmful to human health and our environment.   Developed in the 1940s, PFAS can be found across multiple industries  and all around us in many of our communities. PFAS contamination is  widespread. It is in red States; it is in blue States, in small water  systems, in large ones, on military sites, and in residential  communities.   Recently, experts with the Environmental Working Group have  identified 712 sites in 49 States that have some level of PFAS  contamination, and most are not being cleaned up. These sites are  associated with drinking water systems serving about 19 million people,  and the number of sites is expected to grow across the country because  States are just beginning to test for these chemicals.   The Environmental Working Group has also identified 219 military- specific sites that have PFAS contamination because--and, at the time,  it is what existed--PFAS firefighting foams were used. Yet, in many  States--my home State of Michigan included--cleanup of these sites is  not happening.   Unfortunately, the military is part of that problem. They are arguing  that, in these communities, they don't have to clean up the PFAS  contamination because the Superfund law does not require them to do so.   In May of 2018, the then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt proudly  announced that EPA would propose designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous  substances under the Superfund law. Under EPA Administrator Wheeler's  leadership, EPA hasn't even issued a proposed rulemaking, let alone  finalized an action. At this rate, it will be at least another year--at  least--and probably longer before this vital step is taken.   Americans deserve better. Congress needs to act, and this amendment  would be a meaningful step forward.   It is clear. PFAS chemicals are hazardous, and it is time these  chemicals are properly designated as hazardous substances.   Our amendment would simply require the EPA to list PFAS chemicals-- including PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other harmful chemicals--as  hazardous substances under the EPA's Superfund cleanup program within 1  year.                                time  0945    Designating this will jump-start the cleanup process at military  facilities, which is needed, and in communities across this country;  and that is why it is imperative that this amendment be included.   I am proud to have offered this amendment, and I thank all who have  supported this approach and make this possible for us to consider  today.   Today, we have a real opportunity to help accelerate the cleanup  process wherever PFAS contamination exists and protect the health of  all Americans, and our servicemen and women, and the environment, now  and for future generations. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee), who I have been proud to work with on this.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
