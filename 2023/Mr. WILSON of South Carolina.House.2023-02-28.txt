 Mr. Speaker, since Biden has been in  office, his irresponsible decisions, supported by the Democrat-led  Congress, have left American families in financial stress.   Inflation, at a 40-year high, has increased the cost of everyday  items. We have destruction of jobs. These policies have cost the  typical household $10,000. Additionally, year-to-year wage growth has  been negative for 22 months.   Bidenflation is a tax on all Americans. At an inflation rate of 6.4  percent in January, we have an outrageous situation with rising prices.  Eggs are up an astronomical 70 percent, butter up 33 percent, fuel oil  up 28 percent, flour up 28 percent, lettuce up 17 percent, bread up 15  percent, and milk up 11 percent.   The newly elected House Republican majority, led by Speaker Kevin  McCarthy, is committed to fighting inflation, lowering the cost of  living, and creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
