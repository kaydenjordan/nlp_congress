 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General  Mark Berry, commander of the Arkansas National Guard. After a long  career of dedicated service, Major General Berry is retiring on August  10, 2019.   He first assumed duties as the adjutant general of the Arkansas  National Guard on January 13, 2015. Prior to this post, Major General  Berry was the A-4 assistant to the director of the Air National Guard  in Arlington, Virginia.   In addition to his highly decorated career, Major General Berry is a  man who goes out of his way to protect and to serve his fellow  countrymen. Most recently, Major Berry provided critical immediate  assistance when flooding devastated many parts of Arkansas.   I had the opportunity to work side by side with him during flood  relief efforts and saw how he worked around the clock to save lives and  to protect homes and businesses. He is a great leader, a great friend,  and, above all, a great American.   I thank Major General Berry for his service and wish him all the best  in retirement.                            ____________________
