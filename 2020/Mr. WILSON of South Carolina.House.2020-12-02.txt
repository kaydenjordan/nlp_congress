 Mr. Speaker, the defeated Democrat  candidate for Senate acknowledged South Carolina Republicans swept to  remarkable victories on the local, State, and Federal levels due to the  coattails of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence,  providing the largest Republican majorities at every level in 140  years.   Despite biased fake news, our citizens appreciate the lowest  unemployment in history for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian  Americans, with the highest employment ever for women and youth.   Peace through strength has been maintained with rebuilding the  military, and Promises Made Promises Kept, the American Embassy is now  in Jerusalem.   Out-of-State contributions of unlimited millions to Democrats  enriched political consultants as Democrats lost, while outspending  every Republican.   Senator Lindsey Graham survived the over $150 million onslaught in  America's most expensive Senate race.   The most expensive House race ever led to Congresswoman-elect Nancy  Mace becoming the first female Republican Federal official in history.   My opponent spent 15 times more than my prior opponent to receive the  exact vote of 42 percent.   We appreciate the voters.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
