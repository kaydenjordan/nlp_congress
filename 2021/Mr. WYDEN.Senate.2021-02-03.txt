 Mr. President, today I am introducing the River Democracy  Act of 2021, to add 4,702 miles of rivers and streams in Oregon to the  national Wild and Scenic Rivers system to protect the recreational  opportunities, clean drinking water, fish, and wildlife  [[Page S320]]  habitat that they provide from harmful activities.   Oregon's 110,994 miles of rivers and streams are an invaluable part  of Oregon's livability and an irreplaceable resource that must remain  intact for future generations. Currently, Oregon has only protected 2%  (2,173 miles) of rivers and streams under the national Wild and Scenic  Rivers system--including gems like the Rogue and Deschutes Rivers and  many other iconic salmon and steelhead streams.   Our rivers and streams are Oregon's lifeblood--they provide clean  drinking water to millions of Oregonians, sustain our thriving outdoor  recreation economy, nurture the salmon and steelhead that fuel our  important commercial and recreational fishing industries, and help  maintain the quality of life that brings new investments, businesses,  and jobs to our state. Oregon's outdoor recreation industry is an  economic engine in Oregon. According to the Outdoor Recreation  Industry, it supports 224,000 jobs and generates $15.6 billion in  economic activity. Healthy rivers are the foundation for Oregon's  outdoor recreation economy.   With the climate crisis worsening, access to clean and safe drinking  water has perhaps never been more important. America's Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act aims to protect and preserve the character of our nation's  most important rivers while balancing recreation, multiple use,  habitat, and conservation. It encourages public participation in  developing goals for river protection, and helps safeguard important  waterways as a legacy for future generations.   While I am proud that Oregon has 2,173 miles of protected Wild and  Scenic Rivers, it is still a small fraction of Oregon's total river  mileage.   On October 2, 2019, I began a public process to solicit  recommendations from Oregonians on rivers and streams that deserve  protection under the national Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. I held  several open-to-all public meetings specifically to hear from  Oregonians and gather feedback. The topic has also come up at most  townhalls I've since held. Since then, nearly 2,500 Oregonians  submitted over 15,000 nominations.   I called on Oregonians to help me develop new legislation to protect  Oregon's rivers and they, clearly and loudly, responded. Whether they  were a whitewater rafter, a brewer, an elementary school science  student, an angler or simply an Oregonian who believes strongly in  protecting rivers or streams that provide safe drinking water to their  community, they had the chance to speak up for their favorite rivers  and highlight the outstanding values that make each river worthy of  protection.   Today, I am continuing the effort to protect rivers and streams,  drinking water, recreation opportunities, and fish and wildlife  habitat. The River Democracy Act represents the best of the Oregon  Way--when every Oregonian had the chance to nominate their favorite  river or stream worthy of protection under America's Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act. Ultimately, this is the starting point for future  conversations about river conservation in Oregon.   Based on the suggestions of Oregonians, the River Democracy Act would  add 4,702 miles of rivers and streams in Oregon to the national Wild  and Scenic Rivers system with the goals of creating a flexible land  management tool that expands recreation access, protects drinking  water, reduces wildfire threats, maintains cultural and historic land  management practices, and sustains endangered fish and wildlife  species.   The bill requires federal land managers to assess wildfire risks in  Wild and Scenic River corridors, implement a plan to reduce wildfire  risks to homes and businesses near Wild and Scenic Rivers, assist local  governments to mitigate wildfire risks, and restore water quality  should a fire strike near a Wild and Scenic River.   The River Democracy Act encourages Federal land managers to develop  river management plans in collaboration with Native American tribes,  and ensures Tribes have a say in how rivers are managed.   The bill ensures that only Federal lands are affected by Wild and  Scenic designations, while protecting private property rights, water  rights, and existing permits and rights of way on Federal lands.   It is important to note that each river segment in this bill was  selected for specific outstanding remarkable values. A chart that shows  the specific outstanding remarkable values for each one can be found at  https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ORVs%20chart%202-2-2l.pdf.   Oregonians know their rivers provide more than just electricity. They  are the spawning grounds for some of the nation's richest runs of  salmon and steelhead. They provide extraordinary trout fishing and  unparalleled recreation. They are the source of safe, clean and  delicious drinking water. Oregon's rivers are, most of all, an  important part of our very special quality of life that needs to be  preserved for future generations of Oregonians.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Ernst,          Mr. Grassley, Mr. Rounds, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 193.
