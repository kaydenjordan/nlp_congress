 Mr. President, this evening, President Trump will  deliver his first State of the Union Address. As tens of millions of  Americans tune in, he will continue a time-honored tradition by taking  stock of the past year and laying out his vision for the future.   For anyone who has been reading the headlines over the last year and  paying attention to the issues that directly impact middle-class  families, the state of our Union will not come as a surprise.   Unemployment is low and consumer confidence is high. The news is  packed with all the pay raises, special bonuses, expanded benefits, and  new investments that are flowing into American households and  communities because of a landmark tax reform law that Congress passed  and the President signed in December.   Hundreds of companies have announced that a more competitive tax code  is allowing them to quickly ramp up the amount they can invest in their  own American workers. This includes some of our country's largest  employers.   Walmart is increasing its starting wage for all hourly associates,  expanding maternity and parental leave, and giving $1,000 bonuses to  its own employees. Disney, AT&T, and Bank of America are giving $1,000  tax reform bonuses to more than 100,000 workers each. The list goes on.  It is not just the big guys who are benefiting.   Yesterday afternoon, here on the floor, I talked about Verst  Logistics in Walton, KY, which paid its full-time workers bonuses as a  result of tax reform. I shared the story of a woman who works for  Verst. She fought back tears as she explained what this bonus would do  for her family. Money had gotten tight around the holidays, but while  she and her husband had saved enough to give their five children a  merry Christmas, mom and dad were planning to go without gifts of their  own. But because Congress seized this opportunity to modernize our Tax  Code, she got her very own tax reform bonus. With that extra money she  and her husband were able to buy each other Christmas presents after  all and enjoy a nice dinner out, to boot.   I can share these stories all day. I am so proud that Congress and  the President teamed up to take money out of Washington's pocket and  put it back in the pockets of hard-working Americans who earned it.   Some of our Democratic colleagues don't seem to feel that way. They  all voted against a law that would raise take-home pay for American  families, who have spent a decade struggling not just to get ahead but  oftentimes to simply stay afloat. Several have made news in recent days  by scoffing at these bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits.   My friends the Democratic leaders in both the Senate and the House  have both used the word ``crumbs''--``crumbs.'' One of their  colleagues, the former chair of the DNC, said she doesn't think $1,000  ``goes very far for almost anyone.'' So $1,000 doesn't go far for  almost anyone? That might be true in New York or San Francisco, but it  sure isn't true in Kentucky. I think taking that argument to most  kitchen tables would get you laughed out of the room.   Of course, the immediate raises, bonuses, and worker benefits are far  from the whole story. Tax reform will also deliver direct relief to  middle-class families across America by cutting our tax rates and  doubling the standard deduction.   A typical family of four earning a median income will get to keep  more than $2,000 of their own money that they would have otherwise sent  to the IRS next year.   Furthermore, the law repeals ObamaCare's punitive individual mandate  tax, and soon many Americans are likely to see lower utility rates as  utility companies pass along their savings to consumers.   Just yesterday, two major Kentucky utilities asked the Kentucky  Public Service Commission for permission to pass $180 million in tax  reform savings on to their customers, which could lower their bills  this year. That is particularly important to low-income families,  because paying their utility  [[Page S558]]  bill is a big percentage of any of their take-home pay.   We are already seeing early signs that tax reform will create an  environment where wages will be higher and opportunity will be more  abundant for years, even decades, to come.   President Trump and Republicans in Congress understand that when you  make America a more attractive place to invest and create jobs, you are  helping American families and communities.   We understand that the myth of an ``us versus them'' economy, where  employers must lose for workers to win, is nothing more than a divisive  political talking point with no basis in economics. That is why we  seized this generational opportunity to provide a 21st century tax code  that will give our country a fairer fight with our competitors  overseas. We are already seeing new factories announced and new  investments pouring into our country as a result.   Tax reform is far from the only way this President and this Congress  have gone to bat for the future of our country. We have taken a machete  to the forest of redtape that the Obama administration left behind.   To name just three examples, Congress and the White House have teamed  up to roll back regulations that threatened hundreds of thousands of  coal jobs, required States to give grants to Planned Parenthood, and  had needlessly blocked oil exploration in a small portion of Federal  land in Alaska.   After the Senate confirmed President Trump's Cabinet, from Secretary  Mattis at the Pentagon to Administrator Pruitt at the EPA, these fine  officials have notched achievement after achievement for the American  people, laying the groundwork for a stronger and safer nation.   We have made major progress for American veterans, like Cpl Matthew  Bradford of Central Kentucky, a true American hero who will be  attending tonight as a guest of the First Lady.   Congress has passed and the President has signed laws that will help  our veterans access the healthcare options they need and the employment  training programs they deserve. We have much more to do for our heroes,  but these first steps are indeed promising.   We have taken big steps in the war against addiction and the scourge  of opioids, an issue that is deeply personal for far, far too many  American families.   In just his first year in office, the President has begun to  transform the Federal judiciary. President Trump had more new circuit  court judges confirmed in his first year than any prior President, a  testimony to the fine quality of the nominees he sends here to the  Senate, and we will vote to confirm another excellent judge later  today. And the President rose to the occasion of a Supreme Court  vacancy by filling it with a brilliant and experienced jurist in  Justice Gorsuch.   On all of these fronts--from middle-class Americans' pocketbooks to  the ongoing fight against ISIL--there is more good news than I can  begin to recite this morning.   I very much look forward to attending the State of the Union tonight  and hearing from our President. On behalf of all the Americans we  represent--men and women from coast to coast who are seeing the economy  turn around and their country grow stronger before their eyes--I am  glad there will be so much to applaud.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
