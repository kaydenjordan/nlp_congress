 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate the life of Bill Cooper. Bill was a leader, innovator,  philanthropist, and a friend, and he lived the American Dream.   He grew up in Detroit, where he worked as a police officer while  earning a degree in accounting. His career in banking brought him to  Minnesota in 1985, when he became CEO of Twin Cities Federal. He  transformed this small savings and loan into a thriving national bank.   Bill worked to ensure that all children also had access to a quality  education by founding the Friends of Education, which sponsors 15  schools and serves more than 9,000 children.   Bill was a defining force as well in Minnesota politics. He always  stood up for conservative principles and served as chairman of the  State Republican Party from 1997 to 1999.   Bill Cooper left his mark on Minnesota, and he will be deeply missed  by all of us who knew him.                            ____________________
