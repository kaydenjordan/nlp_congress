 Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to recognize  the achievement of Henry Halgren from Fort Collins, Colorado. Henry is  a sixth grader at Liberty Common School, a middle school, a public  charter school that is very high-performing in my district. He is the  victor from all of Colorado in the National Geographic Bee this last  week.   He competed against over 100 kids at the University of Denver, and he  was able to answer as a sixth grader the following question: Altamira  Cave, known for its prehistoric paintings, is found in the province of  Cantabria in the north part of what European country?   Henry knew that the answer was Spain. He got it right. He won a  $30,000 scholarship to CU, some prize money, and an atlas.   I am proud to say he will be coming here to Washington, D.C., to  represent the Second Congressional District of Colorado in May. And if  he is able to win against the competitors from other States, the prize  for that is a $50,000 scholarship and a family tour to the Galapagos  Islands.   Congratulations not only to Henry, but to all the participants who  showed such a keen interest in learning about the world around them and  about our planet.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Henry and his family and  everybody who participates in furthering the knowledge about geography.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, one that provides for  consideration of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act.   I strongly support the underlying legislation. I wish it had been  brought forward to the floor under an open rule that allowed Democrats  and Republicans to freely offer amendments that could be adopted by a  simple majority vote.   Before we get to the specifics of the bill, I want to talk about the  importance of employee ownership. I join my friend and colleague from  my neighboring district in Colorado in extolling the virtues of  employee stock ownership, of ensuring that employees in the company are  stakeholders and able to benefit from the value that is being created.   You know, we have different stakeholders in our economy, and when you  look at a company, you have different stakeholders that that company is  responsible to and caters to: You have the shareholders, you have the  employees, and you have the customers. In running a company, as I have  done, it is always a constant balancing act to make sure that you are  able to satisfy the legitimate demands of all those various  stakeholders.   Now, one of the things that has been out of whack in our economy the  last few decades is that a disproportionate share of the value creation  has gone to the shareholders and the customers, often to the detriment  of the employees.   Now, everybody has benefited as consumers and as customers with  revolutions in prices and consumer technology. It is so exciting to see  people, you know, where a flat screen television used to be out of  reach, you now see them in nearly every home; and, in many cases, they  cost less than a television would have cost that was significantly  smaller 10 years ago--not to mention the remarkable mobile computing  devices that middle class families and working families carry in their  pockets with them that contains more processing power than a $3,000  computer did just a decade ago.   Consumers have benefited and shareholders have benefited. There has  been an unprecedented increase in private equity markets, in stocks, a  huge amount of value creation in the American economy, both on the  balance sheet as well as in the market valuation of companies.   Now, the issue is that, while all of this has happened, wages have  largely stagnated. A lot of the increases in efficiency and economic  growth have gone to benefit consumers and shareholders. Employees and  workers have felt, legitimately so, that they haven't seen their share  of value creation.   Now, there are a number of reasons for that. One of those has been  the weakening of the union movement that gave workers a collective  voice. But if you look at what some of the remedies are, really none  can make a bigger impact than employee stock ownership. This bill  doesn't change the ball on that. It is a positive step.   There are a lot of other ideas that I hope we can talk about in a  bipartisan way. Fundamentally, we need to create an economy that works  for everyone, one in which employees and workers can directly benefit  from the increase in value of the firm that they helped create. And  what better way to do that than employee stock ownership in a variety  of models and options for that. This bill deals with one; but we have  ESOPs, we have co-ops, we have employee stock option plans, to name a  few.   Companies find that it is in their interest to help improve morale  and maintain a stable employee base to align the incentives of  employees with shareholders and, of course, to help align the success  of our economy with the success of all the stakeholders in our economy.   H.R. 1343 is a bipartisan bill. It was passed last year; it will pass  again overwhelmingly this year. It sends a strong statement that  Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives want to make  employee stock ownership easier. Hopefully, this is a starting point  rather than an ending point.   The two other bills the Chamber is considering are also bipartisan,  and I am hopeful that they can move forward expeditiously.   Now, that stands in stark contrast to some of the other actions of  this Chamber, for instance, the 15 Congressional Review Act resolutions  which simply sought to undo some of the positive steps that President  Obama took rather than put forward a proactive agenda of where  Republicans actually want to lead the Nation.   We also spent countless hours debating healthcare legislation that,  thankfully, didn't go anywhere because it would have left 24 million  Americans without health insurance and increased premiums by 15 to 20  percent for those who were lucky enough not to lose their insurance  altogether.   I am glad that we have been able to move past that towards a more  bipartisan discussion here that will fundamentally help American  innovators and entrepreneurs and help lead to a fair economy that works  better for everybody, that shows that Democrats and Republicans can  work together to create a real solution that addresses a real problem  and takes a first step towards creating an economy that works for  workers, consumers, and shareholders.   I am hopeful that we can continue this trend after the district work  period and move forward on bipartisan legislation that will simplify  our complex Tax Code and realign incentives in  [[Page H2643]]  a positive way, fix our broken immigration system, and make sure that  we have the infrastructure we need for our country to succeed in the  21st century. I hope that my colleagues are encouraged by the strong  bipartisan show of support for H.R. 1343 and we can work together to  bring more bipartisan legislation to the floor instead of divisive  bills that make problems even larger.   This bill, very simply, updates an SEC rule from 1999 that will allow  private companies to offer employees a greater stake in the place they  work without requiring additional paperwork or regulation--a simple and  good idea.   Currently, a private company that offers over $5 million in  securities through compensation for employees is required to provide  additional disclosures which can, A, often serve as a detriment to  going over the $5 million in compensatory stock for their employees,  and, B, take up costs, administrative overhead, should they choose to  proceed. H.R. 1343 simply raises that threshold from $5 million to $10  million, and this legislation gives a private company more flexibility  to reward and retain employees of all levels.   Employee ownership of various structures has benefits to both the  company, the employees, and the overall economy. It helps align the  interests. It results in more productivity, higher employee retention.  It can help make a business more profitable and more sustainable. It  helps make the American economy and the amazing value that is created  work for everybody rather than just one of the stakeholder groups.   For many startups and small businesses, giving employees a stake in  the business is a great way to provide an additional benefit, an  incentive. It gives companies flexibility to attract new employees when  they are starting up, to retain talent as a company grows and matures.   Providing workers stakes in their company helps strengthen their  retirement savings. Employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, are a  type of retirement plan that offers employees an ownership stake  without upfront costs. In Colorado, there are 118 businesses that use  employee-owned ESOPs as a way to promote employee ownership.   A good example of an ESOP is Fire Safety Services. The owner, Jeff,  wanted to offer his employees a stake in the business. He converted his  business to an ESOP, an employee-owned company, that allowed him to  create a succession plan so the business can stay locally owned by the  people who worked to create the value. Jeff noted that, after the  conversion, employee morale was up and sales were up.   One of our most famous examples of employee-owned companies is in my  district in Fort Collins, Colorado: New Belgium Brewing. From the  perspective of the employees, New Belgium has a very strong corporate  culture of personal and collective growth. The employee owners are  concerned about their own professional development and that of their  colleagues. They have a vested stake in the management, economic  health, and stability of the company.    This bill is a commonsense approach and makes it easier for companies  to give their employees ownership opportunities. It is a small first  step towards encouraging an economy that works for everybody.   Now, I want to make sure that this legislation helps employees at all  income levels have access to ownership opportunities and that workers'  retirement savings are not put in jeopardy by an overconcentration in  company stock. That is why I offered an amendment requiring GAO to do a  study on the impact of this legislation on employee participation and  ownership and the effect this legislation has on securities held by  retirement plans that are governed by ERISA.   I very much look forward and am grateful that the rule has made in  order my amendment. This study will give us important information on  how these changes impacting employee ownership also affect retirement.  It will give this body information that we need to move forward.   The example of my amendment is an example of the many great ideas  that Democrats and Republicans could have brought forward had this been  brought forward under an open rule. What better bill to bring forward  under an open rule than this kind of bipartisan bill where there is  nobody in this body who is trying to undermine or sabotage this bill?   There may be some Members who vote against it on both sides, I don't  know, but the overwhelming majority are for it. I think there are  Democrats and Republicans with great ideas who would love the  opportunity to take 10 or 15 minutes--10 minutes as I am afforded under  this rule. How many other Republicans and Democrats would love that  same opportunity to offer amendments to improve this bill to make it  even better?   The good news is employee ownership is not a partisan issue. Employee  ownership strengthens our economy, helps small and medium-sized and  large businesses across our entire economic spectrum create and retain  jobs, and promotes an increased retirement savings for the middle  class. These companies are often anchor businesses in our communities  that go beyond offering jobs but are involved with sponsoring Little  League or being involved with community nonprofits by giving back, by  helping local charities and helping support an ecosystem of  entrepreneurship by helping other entrepreneurs get off the ground  through mentorship networks and angel funding networks.   I am a strong supporter of this bill and, of course, want to point  out that it is simply a starting place. We have a long way to go with  encouraging employee ownership in all of its forms--ESOPs, co-ops,  stock options, outright stock grants--and any other ways that we can  come up with or that the private sector can come up with that allow a  stake in the company and in the value being created to reside with the  employees, aligning their incentive, making our economy work for  everybody, and ensuring that stakeholders have balanced benefits from  our overall growth.   I support this bill. I wish it had been brought to the floor under an  open rule. I oppose the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   You know, the beauty of an open rule, which we did see when the  Democrats had the majority and we have not seen since the Republicans  took the majority, is it allows the floor debate to inspire good ideas.  It allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward amendments,  subject to germaneness, that can be considered and voted upon.   Frankly, it seems like the Republicans didn't have much for us to do  this week. This would have been a perfect week to try an open rule; and  I know that Democrats and Republicans would have, consistent with the  spirit of an open rule, brought forth good ideas and offered them. Good  ideas would have been included in the bill.   But most importantly, we could have set a precedent that open rules  work and an open process that values our contributions as legislators  and as representatives of 750,000 Americans who would be able to work  to improve legislation. So I think that we need to move in that  direction. Let the debate on the floor and the back-and-forth inspire  new collaboration between Democrats and Republicans, new ideas, new  ways of working together.   Here you have a concept that Democrats and Republicans join together  in support of. How can we reduce the costs or the red tape around  administering employee ownership? We would love to remove barriers to  employee ownership that exist across all forms of employee ownership.   We would love to see an economy that works for everybody, one that  values employees and workers as stakeholders that share in the economic  growth that they helped create. That is a big part of the answer to the  discrepancies in our economy and the simple fact--yes, fact--that the  majority of the benefit of our economic growth has resided with a few  and, generally, with shareholders and executives rather than workers.   So at the same time we can continue to move forward with conveying  value to consumers, I think we can also find a way to make sure that  workers are able to participate in the value that is created in our  economy. But to be able to do so, we should have an open process that  allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward germane amendments  that improve the bill, to create an even better and more comprehensive  effort to encourage employee ownership.   Employee ownership ultimately touches a number of different  committees. There are issues around employee ownership that affect  government procurement. There are issues that would reside in the Ways  and Means Committee under taxes. There are issues that reside in the  Judiciary Committee, and, yes, Financial Services and regulator issues  as well.   I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans can work together to  create a comprehensive omnibus approach to improving access to employee  ownership for firms across our country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to convene several  roundtables in my district featuring employee-owned businesses, and it  has been great to hear their stories, whether it is New Belgium  Brewing, talking to employee owners who are excited to spend their time  building value for themselves and creating stability in their own job  and bringing a wonderful craft brew product to people in all the States  in which they distribute, or medical care companies and so many others  that have different variations of employee ownership.  [[Page H2645]]    As a private sector entrepreneur before I came to Congress, I founded  several companies in the technology sector. My companies used stock  options for every employee, ranging from entry-level front desk and  telephone all the way to executive positions; and, frankly, Mr.  Speaker, that has become the standard in the tech industry.   So many venture-backed companies and technology companies provide  stock options across the board such that people who participate in  building that value are able to also participate in sharing the value  that is created. That is one of the great aspects of the technology  sector, in particular, and the startup sector that I hope can export to  other sectors.   On the margins, this bill will make it a little bit easier for small  and mid-sized companies to provide equity compensation to employees.  But again, we need to do a lot more. We need to do a lot more  culturally to make this the norm. We need to do a lot more from a tax  perspective and from a regulatory perspective to make it easier for  companies to share ownership with employees so that employees can  benefit from the value that is being created.   It is considered the cultural norm and the best practice within the  technology entrepreneurship sector, and I hope that that can carry  across to other sectors as well. It is very important to have an  economy that works for everybody, and employee ownership is a critical  linchpin of that effort.   Mr. Speaker, we are debating on a rule and a bill that makes it  easier for companies to offer employee stock as part of their  compensation; but, unfortunately, the backdrop to this discussion is  that there continues to be an enduring wage gap in which women are  simply not paid the same as men for doing the same job. Any efforts by  us to strengthen compensation packages continue to remain hollow for 51  percent of the country--women.   Today is Equal Pay Day. I wish you, Mr. Speaker, a happy Equal Pay  Day, and it is time that we do something to address pay and equity in  our country.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Representative DeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act in  addition to the legislation we have been debating, H.R. 1343. So what  that means is I will still bring forward this legislation. I will just  also bring forward the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I am a proud  cosponsor of.   Sometimes when we move the previous question, we bring forward a  piece of legislation in lieu of the legislation that we bring to the  floor under the rule. In this case, once we defeat the previous  question, I will offer both of those bills: this employee stock  ownership bill and the bill to address paycheck inequity, the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro) may be joining us on the floor in a few minutes to talk about  her proposal.   I have an article written by Ms. DeLauro that I include in the  Record.                     [From Cosmopolitan, Apr. 4, 2017]                    We Will Win the Fight for Equal Pay                             (By Rosa DeLauro)         Think about 20 cents. It doesn't feel very significant--      there isn't much you could buy with it. But over a lifetime,       those 20 cents add up in a major way.        Today, we have reached yet another Equal Pay Day--the day       on which the average woman's earnings finally catch up to       what the average man made last year. This year's Equal Pay       Day falls 94 days into 2017--94 days too late.        Women are nearly half the workforce--yet they still only       earn about 80 cents on average, to a man's dollar. The gap       widens even further when you consider women of color--      African-American women make 63 cents on the dollar, while       Latinas make only 54 cents on average, compared with what       white men earn. This is unacceptable.        The National Women's Law Center found that based on today's       wage gap, a woman starting her career now will lose $418,800       over a 40-vear career. For African-Americans, the losses are       $840,040. And for Latinas, the lifetime gap is over $1       million.        These disparities exist at all levels of education and       occupation--even at the very top. The world champion U.S.       women's soccer team is fighting for pay equality, as are       Academy-Award winning actresses from Emma Stone to Viola       Davis and Patricia Arquette, who have used their platforms to       call for equal pay in Hollywood.        Men and women in the same job should have the same pay.       Period. Wage discrimination takes place not just on the       soccer field or the silver screen, but in the board room, on       the factory floor, and in countless other workplaces across       the country. That is why I am fighting for equal pay--for all       women.        I am fighting for AnnMarie in Massachusetts, who found out,       years into her job, that the university she worked for was       paying men more for the same work. I am fighting for Terri in       Tennessee, who only discovered she was making less than she       deserved because her husband held the exact same job and was       paid more! And I am fighting for ReShonda in Iowa, who       discovered that her own father was paying women less when she       went to work in the family business. Pay discrimination in       the workplace is real--and it is happening everywhere.        Pay inequity does not just affect women--it affects       children, families, and our economy as a whole. That is       because women in this country are the sole or co-breadwinner       in half of families with children. The biggest problem facing       our country today is that families are not making enough to       live on--and closing the wage gap would help address that       problem.        Over 50 years ago, Congress came together--in a bipartisan       fashion--to pass the Equal Pay Act and end what President       John F. Kennedy called ``the serious and endemic problem'' of       unequal wages. The Equal Pay Act made it illegal for       employers to pay men and women differently for substantially       equal work. Yet we still have so far to go to close the wage       gap.        In 2009, we took a critical step forward with the passage       of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which kept the       courthouse door open to sue for pay discrimination. But we       must continue the fight and finish the job by passing into       law the Paycheck Fairness Act.        I first introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act on June 24,       1997--almost 20 years ago. The Paycheck Fairness Act will       mean real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender wage       gap and help families. The act ensures that employers who try       to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job       must show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and       necessary. It prohibits employers from retaliating against       employees who discuss or disclose salary information with       their coworkers. The bill would also allow women to join       together in class-action lawsuits where there are allegations       of sex-based pay discrimination.        The bill actually passed the House twice, with bipartisan       support. Yet it has never made it to the president's desk--      despite the fact that this is an issue that affects every       single state in this country. In the last session of       Congress, I was proud to have every single Democratic member       of Congress signed onto the Paycheck Fairness Act--and even       one Republican!        But we need to keep fighting. When women raise their       voices, we get results. Take the recent victory for the U.S.       women's national hockey team who were able to negotiate a       historic new contract to address pay inequality. They spoke       up--even threatening to boycott the International Ice Hockey       Federation World Championship games--and their voices were       heard.        In January, I attended the Wonnen's March in Washington.       The organic energy--the real, tangible power of the people--      was unlike anything I have ever seen. It was a stark reminder       of what we can achieve together, when we speak with one voice       and demand what we deserve.        When I looked out at the sea of pink hats and powerful,       handmade signs, I thought of my mother. When she was born,       women could not even vote. Yet today, her daughter is a       congresswoman. When we fight for equal pay for equal work, we       carry on the legacy of all the women who have fought before       us. And when we finally succeed, we will create a better       future for all the women who will follow us.        Equal pay is an idea whose time has come--in fact, it is       long overdue. But we have the power. We have the momentum.       And I believe that we will win.     Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman DeLauro's article from  Cosmopolitan magazine, dated April 4, 2017, today, talks about how,  over a lifetime, the 20 cents that women are missing every paycheck on  a dollar earned by men adds up. In fact, the National Women's Law  Center found that a woman starting her career now will lose over  $400,000 over a 40-year career. That could be a house. That could be  college for two kids or three kids. That could be a family vacation  every year. That means a lot, which is why we need to defeat the  previous question and move forward on both of these worthy bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and  [[Page H2646]]  say to the gentleman that I do have one other speaker on the way.   Mr. Speaker, this bill under consideration is a small but significant  step to help companies increase worker ownership to help improve the  overall equity of our economy. I hope that this bill, along with the  other two coming to the floor later this week, are the start of  something. I hope they are a sign that this body will actually consider  meaningful, bipartisan, practical, and commonsense legislation to  address the issues the American people sent us to Washington to fix:  creating jobs, growing our economy, reforming our Tax Code, and fixing  our broken immigration system.   I hope my colleagues support the underlying legislation, H.R. 1343,  oppose the rule, and defeat the previous question so I can bring  forward not only the employee stock ownership rule, but also the  Paycheck Fairness Act here on Equal Pay Day across America so that we  can make sure as we are talking about making sure that women receive  the same cash and ownership in recognition of their efforts as  employees across the country.   This bill will hopefully pass overwhelmingly. I just wish it could be  an example of how we could work under an open rule and give Democrats  and Republicans a chance to build upon and improve legislation. There  have been zero open rules under Speaker Ryan since he has taken over  the Speaker's gavel promising, ironically, a more open process. It is  about time.   If not this bill, what bill, Mr. Speaker? If not a bill with strong  bipartisan support that Democratic and Republican leaders are committed  to bringing across the finish line, when can we have an open process  that allows us as legislators to bring forward our amendments in  response to debate on the floor in realtime?   I wish that this would have been that bill. And I hope that by  defeating this rule, we can send a message back to the Rules Committee  that we should consider open rules for these kinds of bipartisan  legislation.   Promoting employee stock ownership is incredibly important. To have a  multistakeholder economy that works for everybody will help address a  lot of the legitimate concerns that Americans have, that workers and  employees have not shared, and the great amount of value that has been  created.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) to further discuss our proposal on the  previous question on Equal Pay Day and the Paycheck Fairness Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank Ms. DeLauro for her tireless advocacy on behalf of  equal pay. I would also encourage my colleagues to join me in  cosponsoring the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It is  about time. Today, on Equal Pay Day, let's enshrine equality between  men and women into the U.S. Constitution.   If we can defeat the previous question, we will bring forward H.R.  1343, the employee stock ownership bill, but we will also bring forward  the Paycheck Fairness Act so that we can do a little more work of the  people's work here in the House of Representatives and help make sure  that we can look ourselves in the mirror knowing that men and women  will both benefit equally from a hard day's work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule to  defeat the previous question and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1343 as a  first step to encouraging an economy that works for everybody and  employee stock ownership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.   Various measurements of the economy have shown economic growth and an  increase in the stock market. The frustration that I hear from so many  of my constituents is that: With all of this economic growth, why  haven't my prospects improved? Why has there been wage stagnation? Why  aren't my family and I earning any more than I was?   It is true, because a lot of the benefits of this economic growth  have gone to shareholders and consumers rather than workers. We are all  consumers, and we have all benefited from that. And do you know what?  We are all shareholders through pensions and through retirement  accounts, public and private. Many people also put food on their table  and pay their rent, wearing their hat as an employee or a worker.   One of the things that we can do not just by passing this bill, but  by passing a whole host of legal changes both in the tax framework and  in the regulatory framework to make it easier for employees to own  companies, is allow employees and workers to share in the value that is  being created on the shareholder side of the ledger. Then, and only  then, can we have an economy that works for more people rather than  just a few.   This bill is a small step in that direction. It can reduce the cost  and remove a detriment that small to midsize companies have from  aggressively pursuing employee stock ownership. But it is just a first  step.   There is a lot of work that we need to do to reorient the economy  around a shareholder economy that aligns the incentives of workers with  those of shareholders. It is good for sustainable profits, it is good  for long-term economic growth, it is good for stability. It is a better  way to make sure that of this vast value that is being created, we all  can partake in it on both sides of the ledger, as shareholders and as  workers.   That is why I rise today in support of the bill, and that is why I  call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this as but a  modest first step towards a shareholder economy that works for every  worker.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment would require GAO to do a study on the  impact of this legislation on employee ownership. When employees are  offered the opportunity to have an ownership stake in the place they  work, there are benefits for both workers and businesses in our entire  economy.   Many studies have shown that employee ownership increases  productivity, promotes employee retention and stability, and has long- term growth benefits for the business. I believe that the underlying  legislation is an important first step to increase employee ownership  opportunities, but we should want to make sure that opportunities for  participation are widely available to employees at different income  levels.   The amendment also requests the GAO to see the effect of this  legislation on the diversification of securities held in ERISA-governed  retirement plans. As we all know, diversification in any type of  financial portfolio can help weather dramatic fluctuations in the  economy and limit financial risk for retirees.   By requesting the GAO study, we will be able to understand this  legislation's full impact on employee ownership and make necessary  changes and improvements in the future.   I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) for the purpose  of a colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hultgren), and I take the gentleman at his word. I look forward to  working with him on this important issue in coordination with GAO.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
