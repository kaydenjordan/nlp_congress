 Mr. Speaker, as we come to the final days of  this session, I rise to celebrate the remarkable accomplishments House  Democrats delivered for the American people during the 117th Congress.   While there are too many wins to mention, I would like to make sure  everyone knows that we have always put people over politics.   Democrats will save 13 million Americans an average of $800 a year on  their health insurance premiums. Democrats helped create a total of  10.3 million jobs. Democrats lowered the national unemployment rate to  3.7 percent, which is nearly a 50-year low. Democrats delivered the  largest 1-year reduction to the Federal deficit in American history, a  reduction of $1.5 trillion this year alone. Democrats passed many pro- woman bills--like the Women's Health Protection Act, which protects the  woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions.   House Democrats did all this because we always put people over  politics--we always have, and we always will.                            ____________________
