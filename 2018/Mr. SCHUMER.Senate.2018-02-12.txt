Address at the McConnell Center     Mr. President, before I begin, I thank my friend the  Republican leader for his gracious invitation to address the McConnell  Center at the University of Louisville this morning. I learned today  that you don't say, as we say in New York, ``Lewey-ville.'' It is  pronounced ``Lou-a-ville.'' It was a great pleasure to speak to  hundreds of bright Kentucky students who are interested in the future  of this great country. Seeing these kids gives you faith in the future  of America despite all the ``sturm und drang'' we witness here in this  city.   It was my distinct pleasure to give the Republican leader a bottle of  Brooklyn bourbon as a thank-you for his invitation. I assured him that  it was not a challenge to Kentucky's pride but, rather, to suggest that  maybe Kentucky and New York were not so different at all. Our craft  distilling industry is booming, and we have very good bourbon that is  made in no place other than Brooklyn, NY. By the way, as long as it is  made in America, it can be called bourbon. I am not sure if it can be  called Kentucky bourbon, but it can be called bourbon.   Mr. President, now on to the business of the day. On the heels of  passing a significant, bipartisan budget deal, the Senate returns this  week to grapple with one of the most contentious of issues-- immigration.   Leader McConnell, to his credit, has promised a debate on a neutral  bill with an amendment process that will be fair to both sides.  Democrats and Republicans are working hard to find a bill to protect  the Dreamers and provide border security that will garner 60 votes--no  easy task. It is like threading a needle. I am sure we will have the  opportunity to vote on a few ways to do it, but the key is to find a  consensus bill that is largely acceptable to a significant number of  Members in both parties. The purpose here is not to make a point, as  the Republican leader just said. That is easy. The purpose is to get  something done. That is hard, but it really is so important. It will  not be easy, but it is, certainly, achievable.   Democrats are fully committed to protecting Dreamers, and we have  long supported effective border security. Many Republicans are in the  same boat. The only enemy here is overreach. Now is not the time or the  place to reform the entire legal immigration system. Rather, this is  the moment for a narrow bill, and every ounce of our energy is going  into finding one that can pass.   Just like on the budget, this is an opportunity for the Senate to  lead the Nation. Let the same spirit of bipartisanship and compromise  that generated the budget deal carry forward this week as we debate the  fate of the Dreamers.                  Infrastructure and the President's Budget    Mr. President, on infrastructure, the Trump administration, today,  released its infrastructure plan. Democrats released our own plan over  a year ago and have waited just as long to see this plan, because  infrastructure is an issue on which we thought we could find some  common ground.   Unfortunately, despite a glaring need, the President's proposal would  do very little to make our ailing infrastructure better. Instead of  proposing direct Federal investments to help all parts of the country,  the Trump infrastructure plan relies on private parties or States and  localities to put up the lion's share of the money. In turn, those  entities would have to either charge local taxpayers new tolls or raise  taxes and other fees to pay for the new infrastructure. So a word that  describes so much of the President's bill--probably about 80 percent of  it--is ``Trump tolls.''   The Trump infrastructure plan is like a Hollywood facade. It may look  real from afar, but, in truth, it is a flat mirage. The Trump plan has  the skin of an infrastructure plan, but it lacks the guts. The lack of  direct investment would leave out large parts of America, particularly  rural America, where local governments don't have the money or the  traffic to attract private sector investment. Small towns and cities  throughout the heartland have waited too long for upgrades to their  schools, roads, and water systems, as well as access to high-speed  internet.   Just as Franklin Roosevelt said that every rural home should have  electricity in the 1930s, Democrats believe every rural home should  have access to high-speed internet in the 21st century. Roosevelt  called for the REA in the 1930s, and soon enough--it took a lot--every  rural home had electricity.   We Democrats are calling for the 21st century version of Roosevelt's  vision. Every rural home should have access to high-speed internet, and  that ought to be one of our goals in the 21st century. Very little  could do more to revitalize rural America than that plan, which, by the  way, we got a start on in our budget because we Democrats insisted on a  certain amount of money being allocated for that. It was not enough to  get the job done, but it was a start.   The administration's infrastructure would also result in tolls--Trump  tolls--across America. Wealthy investors and large banks will only  invest in projects that generate a profit. How do they get the profit?  They charge middle-class Americans hundreds of dollars a year in tolls.  In fact, it is written into page 20 in the plan. Page 20 of the Trump  infrastructure proposal has a section entitled ``Providing States  Tolling Flexibility.'' So the middle class need not ask for whom this  bill tolls; it tolls for thee.   The middle class is already struggling with the ever-rising costs of  healthcare, childcare, college tuition, and prescription drugs. They  don't need higher local taxes. They don't need Trump tolls on top of  all of that. This is the kind of plan that you would  [[Page S857]]  expect from a President who surrounds himself with bankers and  financiers and wealthy people who don't mind paying a $20 toll every  time they go to work. It is a plan that is designed to reward rich  developers, large banks, and the President's political allies, not to  rebuild the country.   It would put unsustainable burdens on local governments, which are  hurting right now, and it would lead to Trump tolls all over the  country, particularly in middle-sized cities, small cities, and rural  America. No investor is going to invest in a bridge in Springfield or  Hannibal, MO--to pick a couple of places--because they don't have the  revenue to repay it. So those folks will be stuck, as will be much of  America.   At the same time, the Trump proposal undermines important  protections, like ``Buy American.'' We believe, if we are going to put  some real investment into this, this stuff--the steel, the pipes, the  concrete, and everything else--ought to be made in America and employ  Americans. They left that out of the bill, unfortunately.   Democrats want to work in a bipartisan way to improve our  infrastructure, which is why we put forward a real plan that would  expand access to high-speed internet across the country, rebuild our  roads and bridges, and modernize our electric grid, while creating  millions and millions of good-paying, middle-class construction jobs.  Unfortunately, the President's plan falls short on all of these fronts.   I would remind my Republican colleagues that the Federal Government  has invested in infrastructure and road building for a very long time.   Henry Clay, from the great State of Kentucky, called for internal  improvements--I believe it was in the mid-1800s--because he wanted and  knew the economic benefits of connecting places that were called the  Far West in those days--Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio--with all of the  people who lived on the eastern seaboard. Henry Clay was not a  Republican. He was a Whig. That was the predecessor party of the  Republicans. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican President in the 1950s,  started the interstate highway program, which has benefited so much of  America for so many decades. Ronald Reagan never cut back on  infrastructure even though he cut back on lots of other programs.   It is brand new that President Trump is about the first President, in  a long, long line of Democrats and Republicans, who doesn't really  believe that the Federal Government should be at the forefront of  building our infrastructure--whether it is highways, roads, bridges,  water, sewer, the power grid, or high-speed internet.   I hope Democrats and Republicans can do what we did on the budget-- sort of ignore President Trump, because he is way off base on this, and  come together ourselves, because people on both sides of the aisle have  always believed in investing in infrastructure.   Mr. President, I have one final word on the President's budget  request. We have now already dealt with this year's budget request, but  he put in a budget request for next year, which was just sent to  Congress. We just passed a 2-year budget on Friday. So the Trump  administration should have no illusions about its budget becoming law.  It will not become law. Yet Presidential budgets are still important as  a statement of an administration's priorities.   Unfortunately, the President's priorities are so far away from what  the American people want in terms of how he portrays his budget. The  President's budget request, just 6 weeks after slashing taxes on the  wealthiest and biggest corporations, after creating a massive deficit-- who does the President ask to pay for this? Middle-class and older  Americans. He slashes education, environmental protection, and Medicare  and Medicaid, while corporations reap billions in tax giveaways. Older  Americans now have to worry about the Trump administration cutting  Medicare and Medicaid in his budget. Many others, including children  and working families, would be hurt by the budget as well.   If Americans want a picture of whom President Trump works for, the  combination of the tax bill and this budget he proposed today makes it  crystal clear: He is for the rich and powerful at the expense of the  middle class.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
