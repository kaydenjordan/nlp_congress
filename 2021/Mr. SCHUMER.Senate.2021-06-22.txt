 Mr. President, Act 77 was passed in 2019 by the  Pennsylvania State legislature when Republicans held the majority in  both houses. Among other voting reforms, the bill provided for no- excuse absentee voting and extended registration deadlines.   At the time, Republicans in the State legislature were operating  under the assumption that mail-in voting would boost participation  among seniors, who tend to lean Republican. Every single Republican  State senator voted for the bill. In the State house, 105 Pennsylvania  Republicans voted for the bill and 2 voted no. That was 2019.   Fast forward to 1 year later. Donald Trump, fresh off a resounding  loss from the 2020 Presidential election, cried foul and lied--lied-- that the election was stolen from him, like a petulant child. One of  his favorite bugaboos, as we all know, was mail-in voting.    So a little over a year after 132 Pennsylvania Republicans voted for  Act 77 with only two against, they introduced a bill to, you guessed  it, repeal Act 77, a law that Republicans passed while they were in the  majority just a year before.   There is a rot--a rot--at the center of the modern Republican Party.  Donald Trump's Big Lie has spread like a cancer and threatens to  envelope one of America's major political parties. Even worse, it has  poisoned our democracy and eroded faith in our elections, which is so  detrimental to the future faith people need to have in this democracy.  And, of course, it became the match that lit a wildfire of Republican  voter suppression laws sweeping across the country. Because of one  man's lie, Republicans are now doing the dastardly act of taking away  voting from millions of Americans--millions of Americans--and making it  much harder for them to vote, and many, many, many will not.   From Georgia to Montana, from Florida to Iowa, in 14 different  States, through 22 different laws, Republican State legislatures are  conducting the most coordinated voter suppression effort in 80 years.  And as the example of Act 77 in Pennsylvania goes to show, there is no  principle behind these laws: not fraud, not election integrity, not  security, not better election administration. The only principle is  blatant partisan electoral advantage aimed at  [[Page S4662]]  people of color, young people, urban people, and people who vote  Democratic. It has nothing to do with fraud. They haven't pointed out  that there is more fraud in those areas than in other areas. It is just  blatant, blatant partisan advantage.   Whatever voting changes Republicans think are good for them, they  will make them, even if it means resorting to the awful and un-American  act of voter suppression. So in State after State--State after State-- Republicans are reducing polling hours and locations and the number of  drop boxes so that Americans of all parties, but particularly aimed at  Democratic voters, people of color, young people, poor people, have a  harder time finding the time, place, and manner to vote.   They are limiting the kind of IDs you can use, like student IDs,  while at the same time removing requirements of any form of licensing  to own a firearm. Has any study shown that there is less fraud among  firearm owners than students? There is probably very little among  either, but they pick one group and not the other, and we know why.   Republican legislatures are making it easier to own a gun than to  vote. Republican legislatures are making it harder to vote early,  harder to vote by mail, and harder to vote after work. They are making  it a crime to give food or water to voters waiting in long lines. They  are trying to make it harder for Black churchgoers to vote on Sunday.  And they are actually making it easier for unelected judges and  partisan election boards to overturn the results of an election,  opening the door for some demagogue, a Trumpian-type demagogue--maybe  he himself--to try and subvert our elections in the very same way that  Trump tried to do it in 2020.   Republicans say these laws are about ``election integrity.'' They  claim they are only trying to ``secure the vote.'' Some of my friends  here in Washington have resorted to the old refrain that election laws  are best left to the States, ignoring the fact that for generations,  we, in Congress, have passed Federal election laws and constitutional  amendments to prevent exactly this kind of discrimination and voter  suppression.   We all know what these laws are about. I daresay my Republican  colleagues know. They are not stupid. When the State of Texas proposes  to limit voting hours on Sunday to only a few hours in the evening, do  they really believe that is about preventing fraud? Do my Senate  friends want to back up that kind of thing, prevent it from even being  talked about here on the floor of the Senate? When Georgia Republicans  say it is a crime to give a voter some water or food as they wait in  line on a hot day, do they really think they are preventing voter fraud  by denying them a snack? Give me a break. Give me a break.   Republicans across the country are deliberately targeting all the  ways that younger, poorer, non-White, and typically Democratic voters  access the ballot. Republicans claim they are making it easier to vote  and harder to cheat in an election. In reality, they are making it  harder to vote and easier to cheat in an election, and we all know it.   And all we want to do here is debate it in regular order--regular  order--which colleagues on both sides of the aisle have asked for. That  is what we are asking for here, just to debate these things, and they  won't even do that because they are so afraid of what that debate will  show: that this is not election integrity; that this is voter  suppression and voter suppression directed at only one group of voters.   Well, we are going to see what happens today. Later today, the entire  country will see whether our Republican friends are willing to even  debate this issue in broad daylight. This afternoon, the U.S. Senate  will vote on a motion to proceed to voting rights legislation. We all  know what a motion to proceed is around here, but let me explain it.  All it says is let's go forward with debate. Let's debate something,  and this is among the most important things we could ever debate, the  right to vote--what our soldiers have died for and what peaceful  marchers have been bloodied for, the right to vote.   It takes 60 votes to start that debate. Everyone knows you still need  60 votes to end the debate on a bill. So even if the Republicans don't  like the legislation at the end of the process, let them vote against  it then. But, no, they don't even want to debate it. They don't even  want to debate it because they are afraid. They want to deny the right  to vote, make it harder to vote for so many Americans, and then they  don't want to talk about it, sweep it under the rug, and hope that  Americans don't hear about it.   But Americans will hear about it. We are going to make sure of that,  and millions in the country who are rightly and correctly outraged by  what is happening will let everyone know what has happened.   Now, only by starting the process can Senators offer amendments,  change the bill, forge compromise. Only then can Senators engage in a  full-throated debate about what this Chamber should do about the  assault on voting rights in this country. Obviously, there are  arguments about what should be done to protect voting rights and  safeguard our democracy. Obviously, there are arguments about which  policies are the most effective. But shouldn't we at least agree to  debate the issue?   That is the only question for the U.S. Senate today. Do my Republican  colleagues believe that voting rights, the most fundamental in a  democracy, the right that generations of Americans have marched for and  protested to achieve, that generations of American soldiers have fought  and died to secure, is that worthy of debate? Of course it is.   Should the U.S. Senate even debate how to protect the voting rights  of our citizens? There is only one correct answer. We will see if our  Republican colleagues choose it this afternoon.   This is not simply a partisan issue, as partisan as the Republican  side and the State legislatures and now here in the Senate seem to make  it. It is about the fundamental values in this country. It is about  what we are all about.   When the Constitution was started in most States, you had to be a  White male Protestant property owner to vote. There has been an  inexorable march to expand that right to vote and allow more and more  Americans to have that right to vote. This is a giant step backward.  Obviously, it is a partisan issue to the Republicans, but it is a much  deeper issue than that.   Will our colleagues stand up for what generations of Americans have  fought for, marched for, and died for or will they just slink away and  say we are not even going to debate this?   I yield the floor.    Madam President, first, let me thank so many of my  colleagues, including our chair of Rules, the Senator from Minnesota;  our lead sponsor on this bill, Senator Merkley; and so many others who  have done so much on this legislation.   Now, what makes a democracy a democracy? It is the right of citizens  to choose their own leader; to forge their own destiny, rather than  have it decided for them; the right to vote; the right that generations  of Americans have marched and protested to achieve; women who reached  for the ballot; and marchers who were bloodied on a bridge in Selma;  the right that generations of American soldiers fought and died to  defend, buried now in patriot graves from Normandy to Gettysburg.   And, right now, it is a fact--a fact--that voting rights are under  assault in America in a way that we have not seen in many, many  decades. Republican State legislatures are limiting polling hours,  locations, and ballot  [[Page S4685]]  drop boxes, raising new ID barriers for students, making it a crime to  give food and water to voters in line, and in States like Texas, trying  to move Sunday voting hours so it is harder for Black churchgoers to go  to the polls after services.   It is the most sweeping voter suppression effort in at least 80  years, targeting all the ways that historically disenfranchised  voters--Black and Brown Americans, students, the working poor--access  the ballot.   We can disagree about solutions to this problem, about which policies  might be more effective, but we should all agree this is a problem. We  should all agree that protecting voting rights is worthy of debate, and  that is what this next vote is about. Should the U.S. Senate even  debate--even debate--how to protect the voting rights of our citizens?   The story of American democracy is full of contradictions and halting  progress. At the time of our Constitution's ratification, you had to  be, in most States, a White, male, Protestant landowner to vote. How  many in this Chamber--how many of us would have been able to  participate in those first elections?   The truth is, many of us, particularly on our side of the aisle,  would not have been able to vote. But ever since the early days of the  Republic, Americans launched mighty movements, fought a bloody civil  war, and, yes, passed Federal election laws to expand the franchise  until there were no more boundaries.   Are we in a backslide here in the 21st century? Are we going to let  reactionary State legislatures drag us back into the muck of voter  suppression? Are we going to let the most dishonest President in  history continue to poison our democracy from the inside or will we  stand up to defend what generations of Americans have organized,  marched for, and died for--the sacred, sacred right to vote, the thing  that makes a democracy a democracy.   I plead with my Republican colleagues. Stand up, my Republican  colleagues. Stand up to a man who has lied. We all know he has lied.  You know he has lied about our elections. Do not let this man lead you  around by the nose and do permanent damage to our democracy. At least  have the decency and honor to let this Chamber debate. I urge my  colleagues to vote yes.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the  Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The bill clerk read as follows                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       proceed to Calendar No. 77, S. 2093, a bill to expand       Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of       big money in politics, strengthen ethics rules for public       servants, and implement other anti-corruption measures for       the purpose of fortifying our democracy, and for other       purposes.

The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to proceed on S. 2093, a bill to expand Americans' access to the  ballot box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, strengthen  ethics rules for public servants, and implement other anti-corruption  measures for the purpose of fortifying our democracy, and for other  purposes, shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 246 Leg.]                                  YEAS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--50       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young   The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are 50.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.    Madam President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Mr. Majority Leader.    Madam President, I want to be clear about what just  happened on the Senate floor. Every single Senate Republican just voted  against starting debate--starting debate--on legislation to protect  Americans' voting rights. Once again, the Senate Republican minority  has launched a partisan blockade of a pressing issue here in the U.S.  Senate, an issue no less fundamental than the right to vote.   I have laid out the facts for weeks. Republican State legislatures  across the country are engaged in the most sweeping voter suppression  in 80 years, capitalizing on and catalyzed by Donald Trump's Big Lie.  These State governments are making it harder for younger, poorer,  urban, and non-White Americans to vote.   Earlier today, the Republican leader told reporters that ``regardless  of what may be happening in some States, there's no rationale for  Federal intervention.'' The Republican leader flatly stated that no  matter what the States do to undermine our democracy--voter suppression  laws, phony audits, partisan takeovers of the local election boards-- the Senate should not act.   My colleagues, if Senators 60 years ago held that the Federal  Government should never intervene to protect voting rights, this body  would have never passed the Voting Rights Act. The Republican leader  uses the language and the logic of the southern Senators in the 1960s  who defended States' rights, and it is an indefensible position for any  Senator--any Senator--let alone the minority leader, to hold. Yet that  was the reason given for why Republicans voted in lockstep today:  Regardless of what may be happening in some States, there is no  rationale for Federal intervention.   That is both ridiculous and awful. All we wanted to do here on the  floor was to bring up the issue of voting rights and debate how to  combat these vicious, oftentimes discriminatory voting restrictions,  and today, every single Democratic Senator stood together in the fight  to protect the right to vote in America. The Democratic Party in the  Senate will always stand united to defend our democracy.   I spoke with President Biden earlier this afternoon as well. He has  been unshakeable in his support of S. 1, and I want to thank the  President and the Vice President for their efforts. But regrettably-- regrettably--our efforts were met by the unanimous opposition of the  Senate minority.   Once again, Senate Republicans have signed their names in the ledger  of history alongside Donald Trump, the Big Lie, and voter suppression,  to their enduring disgrace. This vote, I am ashamed to say, is further  evidence that voter suppression has become part of the official  platform of the Republican Party.   Now, Republican Senators may have prevented us from having a debate  on voting rights today, but I want to be very clear about one thing:  The fight to protect voting rights is not over, by no means. In the  fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish  line. Let me say that again. In the fight for voting rights, this vote  was the starting gun, not the finish line.   As many have noted, including my friend Senator Warnock this morning,  [[Page S4686]]  when John Lewis was about to cross that bridge in Selma, he didn't know  what waited for him on the other side. He didn't know how long his  march would be, and his ultimate success was never guaranteed, but he  started down that bridge anyway. Today, Democrats started our march to  defend the voting rights of all Americans. It could be a long march,  but it is one we are going to make.   Today, we made progress. For the first time in this Congress, we got  all 50 Democrats unified behind moving forward on a strong and  comprehensive voting rights bill. And make no mistake about it, it will  not be the last time that voting rights comes up for a debate in the  Senate.   Republicans may want to avoid the topic, hoping that their party's  efforts to suppress votes and defend the Big Lie will go unnoticed.  Democrats will not allow that. Democrats will never let this voter  suppression be swept under the rug.   We have several serious options for how to reconsider this issue and  advance legislation to combat voter suppression. We are going to  explore every last one of our options. We have to. Voting rights are  too important, too fundamental. This concerns the very core of our  democracy and what we are about as a nation, so we will not let it go.  We will not let it die. This voter suppression cannot stand, and we are  going to work tirelessly to see that it does not stand.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
