 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Madam Speaker I rise today in support of this emergency spending  package. I believe this legislation moves us a step closer to my vision  of making America's greatness accessible and affordable for all.   The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the inequities in our healthcare  system that are having dramatic negative impacts on health outcomes in  minority communities.   Martin Luther King, Jr., observed back in 1966: ``Of all the forms of  inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most  inhuman because it often results in physical death.'' How prescient.   To know the full extent of how this virus is ravaging communities of  color, we must test, test, test. That is why I am pleased there is $25  billion in this package for testing, which allows for my advocacy of  mobile testing.   We must make testing accessible and affordable for rural and  persistent-poverty communities facing obstacles due to a lack of  transportation.   This pandemic has also laid bare the inequities in our financial  system. The first round of funding through the Paycheck Protection  Program went to businesses with long-term banking relationships. Many  small family and minority-owned businesses and nonprofit organizations  were shut out. That is why Democrats insisted that $60 billion be  reserved in this package for community-based lenders, such as community  development, financial institutions, minority depository institutions,  and credit unions.   This legislation is not perfect, but it is a step towards making some  much-needed relief accessible and affordable.
