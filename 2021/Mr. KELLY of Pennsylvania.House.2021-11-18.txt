 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I think a lot of us go out and actually do our own  shopping.  [[Page H6590]]  And I know now when I go out to shop, I not only look at the front of  the box, I look to the back to see what is in it.   So we have here the Biden build back better sauce. Here it is. It is  flavored with SALT tax, by the way, so don't worry about your sodium  content. And trust them. ``It is in there.''   What is in there; 150 new government programs. How about this? This  is a great bargain for the hardworking American taxpayer. Now, they're  saying it is only going to cost you $1.7 trillion, and only in  Washington would they say ``only''.   The cost per American, $53,000 apiece; $550 billion for the Green New  Deal; $412 billion in small business taxes; $80 billion for those  wonderful guys from the IRS that are coming to tear you apart; $7.8  billion on environmental justice; massive electric vehicle subsidies  for the very wealthy; government paid leave for high-priced CEOs;  subsidies for wealthy families; a SALT tax break for millionaires; and  the Tree Equity Program.   Who in the world would not buy this package? They will if they turn  around and look at the back and understand that it is on sale right now  in this House for $4 trillion. Hurry up, American taxpayers, before we  run out of money.
