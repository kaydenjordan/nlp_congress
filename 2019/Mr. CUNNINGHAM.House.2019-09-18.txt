 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  General Robert P. Carson, the beloved bulldog mascot of The Citadel,  who passed away this Friday.   The General came from a distinguished lineage, and his relatives  include former mascots of the University of Georgia, the United States  Marine Corps, and Mississippi State University.   The General's caretaker, Dr. John Bradford, reported that on game  days, he would often find the bulldog waiting in the corner of his  backyard, facing the stadium. He just couldn't wait to fire those  cannons, and his spirit helped his fellow Bulldogs pull off an  incredible upset this past Saturday.   The General was with his fellow mascot, Boo X, when he passed away.  The two were the pride of The Citadel campus and cherished members of  the institution.   Anyone with a pet knows how deeply they impact our lives, and I offer  my sincere condolences to the entire Citadel community.   Go `Dogs.
