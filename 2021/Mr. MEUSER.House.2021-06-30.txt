 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Graves for yielding and for so  strongly and well leading this important debate.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, the roads to  revitalization amendment, which would increase the Federal share for  infrastructure projects in areas of persistent poverty from 80 percent  to 85 percent. Levelling up the Federal contribution to these projects  could reduce the burden on local governments, enabling long overdue  projects to proceed sooner.   Many low-income communities have infrastructure needs that have been  deferred for far too long, imperiling public safety and compounding the  project's costs. My amendment reduces the burden on State and local  governments to drive infrastructure investments in distressed areas,  paving the way for broader economic development and revitalization of  countless great American neighborhoods.   Infrastructure investment, as we all know, can be a game changer for  many of the communities I represent, as we all do. This simple policy  change will help these communities, Madam Speaker, make the up-front  investment they need to revitalize Main Street, attract private-sector  investment, and become even better places to live and to work.
