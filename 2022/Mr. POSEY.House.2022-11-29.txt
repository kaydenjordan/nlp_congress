 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Protecting Firefighters From  Adverse Substances Act. It has been a pleasure to work across the aisle  on proposals to address the dangers posed by PFAS not just to  firefighters but also to our environment.   It has been a pleasure to cosponsor the House companion to this bill  and support its passage.   This bill will direct the Department of Homeland Security to provide  training designed to reduce and eliminate exposure to PFAS from  firefighting foam and personal protective equipment, to prevent PFAS  from firefighting foam from being released into the environment, and to  give firefighters and other emergency responders information on  alternatives that do not contain PFAS.   This bill is another step we are taking together in a bipartisan  spirit to address the consequences that we have learned far too late.   The firefighters' motto is ``Be Ready,'' and this bill helps better  prepare our firefighters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  important legislation.
