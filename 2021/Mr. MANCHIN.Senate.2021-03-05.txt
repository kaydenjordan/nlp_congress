 Mr. President, I also proudly rise with my colleague on  this piece of legislation.   There is not one of us in this room who doesn't have rising  homelessness for our children in your State, not one of us. We are all  experiencing that right now. We are 10,000 in the State of West  Virginia alone.   These are children--basically, if you look at it, it is estimated  that there are one in four homeless children. That is about 420,000  kids who are potentially unidentified and not even connected with a  school system, not even connected. They are couch surfing. It is  horrible what is going on.   I am so proud. This is such a bipartisan piece of legislation. Less  than 1 percent, $800 million, is all we asked for to use for this, and  everyone supported it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1233
