 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for authoring  this bill alongside our good friend Ranking Member Eliot Engel, the  dynamic duo of Foreign Affairs. I want to thank them for their  leadership and their continued effort in holding Iran accountable.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is called the Iran Ballistic  Missile and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, authored by our  chairman and ranking member. It is a strong and important bill. It  sanctions Iranian and foreign persons and entities that support, that  facilitate, that finance Iran's ballistic missile program. It is a  necessary measure because, as we know, Iran has felt emboldened to  continue advancing its missile program since the P5+1 and Iran  concluded the weak nuclear deal.   Tehran has taken advantage of this deal and the U.N. Security Council  resolution that endorsed the agreement. Despite language that prohibits  Iran's ballistic missile testing in U.N. Resolution 2231, Iran has  actually increased its missile activities, violating both the spirit  and the letter of the resolution.    With the President having made his determination 2 weeks ago that  Iran is not in compliance with its commitments under the Iran Nuclear  Agreement Review Act, we now have an opportunity to address the  weakness in the nuclear deal and also Iran's illicit activity.   We must continue to press forward on a dual track. We must continue  to hold Iran accountable for its nonnuclear illicit activity, while  also looking to address our concerns with the nuclear deal. They are  not mutually exclusive, Mr. Speaker. Both are extremely important for  our national security. This is an important step.   I thank the Members for their great leadership. I support passage of  Chairman Royce and Eliot Engel's measure.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our dynamic duo once again for  this wonderful legislation and for bringing this bill before us this  afternoon. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3342, Sanctioning  Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act,  authored by our friends, Congressmen Gallagher and Suozzi. I thank the  gentleman for their leadership.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I applaud  our effort here in the House to take up several measures, as you have  heard, that address a variety of threats that Iran and its proxies pose  to our national security and the security of those in the region.   The use of human shields is unconscionable, morally unacceptable, and  a clear violation of human rights. Yet for terrorist groups such as  Iran proxies, Hezbollah, and Hamas, the use of human shields is an  acceptable tactic. It is a tactic used because they engage in terror  activity and asymmetric warfare. They don't have the same beliefs and  morals of the United States or Israel.                                time  1530    It is an attempt to cause innocents to be dragged into their conflict  and to cause as many casualties as they can with no regard whatsoever  for human life.   Iran and Hezbollah know that if they engage in hostilities with  Israel, the world will be quick to blame Israel for civilian deaths  despite the great precautions Israel takes to not only save human  lives, but to only go against belligerents.   Responsible nations must condemn this tactic by Hezbollah and by all  of its state sponsors of terrorism. We must take action to hold anyone  who engages in such actions accountable.   Iran and Hezbollah will continue to take advantage of our morality-- what they perceive to be a weakness on our part--and they will continue  to employ the use of human shields during armed conflicts until the  world sends a strong and unified message, and that is what this bill  does.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce from  California, and the ranking member, Mr. Engel from New York, once again  for their leadership. They are the dynamic duo of the Foreign Affairs  Committee on this issue. This is a very important day, in terms of  sanctioning evildoers in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the bill promoted by Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, H.R. 3329, the Hizballah  International Financing Prevention Amendments Act. This is yet another  strong, bipartisan bill that they have authored and brought to the  floor, aimed at holding Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, accountable for  their illicit activity.   I was pleased that my amendment to this bill was included to ensure  that we identify those Hezbollah parliamentarians and cabinet officials  who are subject to the sanctions in this bill and the underlying bill  that it amends.   This is important, Mr. Speaker, because Hezbollah members have  prominent positions in Lebanon's Government, and we want to ensure that  they cannot use government funds to divert to Hezbollah's terror  activity, and, if they do, those institutions that help facilitate such  activity are held to account.   I was also pleased to see other provisions approved that would allow  us to identify and track individuals and entities that are being used  by Iran to supply Hezbollah with arms or support for its missile  production facilities in Syria.   We know that Iran uses commercial civilian aircraft to fly weapons,  arms, and fighters to Syria in support of Hezbollah. We cannot allow  Iran to use these civilian aircraft for such activity. This is the  first step toward making sure that, once these aircraft are identified,  responsible nations will think twice about allowing these Iranian  planes to land in their countries.   This bill also addresses Iran's and Hezbollah's ability to finance  their illicit activities, which is so important, Mr. Speaker. We must  go after those individuals and those institutions that provide  financial safe havens to these terror groups, and we have got to  disrupt their financial networks.   That is why this bill is so important, and I urge my colleagues to  support Chairman Royce's and Ranking Member Engel's measure before us  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   For 30 years, Hezbollah has remained Iran's proxy and Iran remains  Hezbollah's primary source of financial support--a cozy relationship.   In April 2015, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted that, even under  sanctions, Iran still funds Hezbollah's terror. He anticipated that ``a  rich and powerful Iran, which will be open to the world'' will be able  to do even more.   The Iran nuclear agreement has made it possible for Iran to provide  Hezbollah with a windfall. But Tehran is not Hezbollah's only source of  income. Since its inception, Hezbollah has developed a broad criminal  network involved in a range of illicit activities, from drug  trafficking to cigarette smuggling, to money laundering to  counterfeiting.   These global terrorists double as global criminals. This is why we  must employ a combination of law enforcement, financial, criminal,  civil, and regulatory tools to deter, disrupt, and publicly illuminate  the global illicit Hezbollah network.                                time  1600    I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for closely  collaborating and developing this critical legislation, as well as  Senator Rubio and Senator Shaheen in the Senate that have taken the  lead on this effort in the Senate. I look forward to continuing to work  with them to get this critical legislation signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree  to the resolution (H. Res. 359) urging the European Union to designate  Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization and increase  pressure on it and its members, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 359         Whereas in July 2012 a Hizballah terror attack in Bulgaria       killed five Israeli tourists and one Bulgarian;        Whereas in March 2013 a Hizballah operative in Cyprus was       convicted of planning terror attacks after admitting he was a       member of Hizballah, was trained in the use of weapons, and       used a dual Swedish-Lebanese passport to travel around Europe       on missions as a courier and scout for Hizballah;        Whereas though such Hizballah operative was convicted on       criminal-related charges, authorities had to drop terrorism       charges against him because Hizballah was not listed as a       terrorist organization;        Whereas the European Union (EU) in July 2013 designated       Hizballah's so-called ``military wing''--but not the       organization as a whole--as a terrorist organization;        Whereas despite restrictions put on Hizballah since the       designation of its military wing, the group continues to       conduct illicit narco-trafficking, money laundering, and       weapons trafficking throughout Europe;        Whereas EU designation of Hizballah's military wing has       enabled substantial and important cooperation between United       States and European authorities aimed at uncovering and       thwarting Hizballah's international criminal activities, such       as drug trafficking and money laundering, the proceeds of       which are used to purchase weapons and advance Hizballah's       terrorist aims;        Whereas in December 2015 the Hizballah International       Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) was       signed into law  [[Page H8192]]       in the United States, broadening financial sector sanctions       against Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to       refrain from supporting the terrorist group;        Whereas in February 2016 the United States Drug Enforcement       Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection       partnered with counterparts in France, Germany, Italy, and       Belgium to arrest top leaders of the European cell of       Hizballah's External Security Organization Business Affairs       Component--a cell that engages in international money       laundering and drug trafficking to support Hizballah's terror       activities;        Whereas for many years, the Governments of Iran and Syria       have been the prime sponsors of Hizballah, harboring,       financing, training, and arming the group;        Whereas Department of Defense officials estimate that Iran       provides as much as $200,000,000 per year to Hizballah in the       form of financial and logistical support, weapons, and       training;        Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately       150,000 missiles and rockets, many of which can reach deep       into Israel, at a time when Hizballah Secretary General       Hassan Nasrallah is threatening to attack and invade Israel;        Whereas Hizballah fighters have been supporting the Assad       regime in Syria, often leading operations in the conflict       which has left more than 465,000 dead;        Whereas Russia has established fusion centers in Syria to       coordinate with Iran, the Assad regime, and Hizballah, and       Russian air cover has given Hizballah an advantage on the       battlefield against Syria rebels;        Whereas Hizballah's destabilizing actions in the conflict       in Syria has fueled a migrant crisis that has brought nearly       400,000 migrants and refugees to Europe in 2016 and 2017       alone;        Whereas Lebanon continues to be plagued by instability and       violence;        Whereas due to Hizballah's actions in Syria, the Islamic       State of Iraq and the Levant has carried out retaliatory       terrorist attacks in Beirut;        Whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate security       establishment of the country as set forth in United Nations       Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), are struggling to       control the flow of weapons and Hizballah fighters at its       borders;        Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for Shiite       militias in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region       and perpetuating violence in those countries;        Whereas in October 2012 Hizballah Deputy Secretary General       Naim Qassem stated that ``[Hizballah does not] have a       military wing and a political one . . . Every element of       Hizballah, from commanders to members as well as our various       capabilities, are in the service of the resistance'';        Whereas the United States, Canada, Israel, and the       Netherlands have designated Hizballah in its entirety as a       terror organization, while Australia and New Zealand have       applied the designation to the organization's so-called       military wing;        Whereas in March 2016 the Gulf Cooperation Council, the       bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, formally branded Hizballah, in       its entirety, a terrorist organization, and the League of       Arab States shortly thereafter adopted the same designation;        Whereas in April 2016 the Organization of Islamic       Cooperation, denounced Hizballah's ``terrorist acts'' in the       Middle East;        Whereas Hizballah Secretary General Nasrallah said in May       2017 that the conflict in Syria had entered a ``new and       critical phase'' in which Damascus, Moscow, Tehran, and       Hezbollah were ``in more harmony politically and militarily       than at any time'';        Whereas the United States has designated Hizballah's       Foreign Relations Department, which has representatives       around the world, as a Specially Designated National, subject       to United States primary and secondary sanctions;        Whereas the Department of the Treasury has diligently added       persons and entities to the list of Specially Designated       Global Terrorists who have provided material support to the       Hizballah terrorist organization, thereby hampering its       financing and logistical capabilities; and        Whereas in May 2017 the United States and Saudi Arabia       sanctioned Hashem Saffiedine, a member of Hizballah's       executive council which oversees the organization's       political, organizational, social and educational activities,       for his involvement in terrorist activity: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses appreciation to the European Union (EU) for       the progress made in countering Hizballah since the EU       designated Hizballah's military wing as a terrorist       organization;        (2) applauds and expresses support for the continued,       increased cooperation between the United States and the EU in       thwarting Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities;        (3) supports transcontinental efforts within Europe to       share intelligence information among police and security       services to facilitate greater cooperation in tracking,       apprehending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign fighters,       and potential offenders;        (4) encourages the EU to, whenever possible and applicable       with due process standards, implement sanctions against       Hizballah-affiliated terrorists in tandem with the United       States; and        (5) urges the EU to designate Hizballah in its entirety as       a terrorist organization and increase pressure on the group,       including through--        (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation between EU       members in combating Hizballah;        (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active       supporters of Hizballah;        (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, including those       masquerading as charities; and        (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of       Hizballah.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and Chairman Royce, as well as  Congressman Engel, the ranking member, for their help in bringing this  important resolution to the floor.   I also want to say how proud our committee is of the great work of  Ranking Member Ted Deutch of the Middle East and North Africa  Subcommittee, and our Florida colleague, Gus Bilirakis, who are the  authors of H. Res. 359, urging the European Union to designate  Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization. I thank Mr.  Deutch for his leadership on this.   This notion, Mr. Speaker, that there can be separate wings of a  terrorist organization is as absurd as the notion that Iran can be a  responsible member of the international community. There is no  distinction between Hezbollah members. Anyone who pledges allegiance to  this terror group must be labeled accordingly.   One needn't look further than Hezbollah's activities in Syria or its  terror attacks against Israel or even the statements coming out of  Iran, its patron, and Hezbollah itself to know that if you are  Hezbollah, you support terror activities. Iran is a state sponsor of  terrorism, and Hezbollah is its proxy.   There is simply no justification at all for our European friends to  try to differentiate between a military wing and a political wing of a  terrorist organization. They may justify it by saying it will upset the  delicate balance in Lebanon and they worry about the fallout, but the  sad reality is that it comes down to money.   They will not take any action against Iran, as we have seen since the  JCPOA, because members of the EU have signed lucrative business deals  with Iran, and they don't want to damage their economic opportunities.  It is as simple as that, because even our Gulf allies have labeled  Hezbollah, in its entirety, as a terrorist organization.   The European Union needs to wake up, and we must urge it and its  member states to designate the whole of Hezbollah as the terrorists  that they are, and it must realize that doing so would be in their best  interest and in the best interest of Israel, a nation that shares their  values and their ideals, unlike Iran, a regime that benefits by the  lack of a full designation of Hezbollah.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time,  so I will wait for Mr. Deutch to close on his time. Mr. Speaker, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida, Ranking Member  Deutch, for authoring this resolution and bringing it to the floor  today.   Hezbollah has a single leadership, fungible finances, and a single  hostile mission. All branches and operations serve its terrorist  activities, and it is a deadly mistake to attempt to distinguish among  its arms.   I again want to thank Mr. Deutch, Chairman Royce, Ranking Member  Engel for their work on this important resolution, which calls for our  European allies to designate all branches of Hezbollah as a terrorist  organization. This is a critical step that our partners across the  Atlantic must take to protect our citizens and allies from a highly  organized, capable, and increasingly battle-trained terror group that  operates networks in countries around the world.   We must work together to deprive this organization of its support. I,  therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.  I thank the gentleman from Florida for his authorship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot), the chairman of the House Committee on Small Business and a  senior member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, with that, I also yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as we continue to shed light on  domestic violence during this month of October, I would like to  highlight a bill, H.R. 909, the Pet and Women Safety Act.   This necessary bipartisan legislation introduced by my friend  Representative Katherine Clark and I will establish a Federal grant  program to provide a safe haven for the companion animals of domestic  violence victims.   Studies show that almost half of domestic violence survivors do not  leave their abusive relationships out of fear of what would happen to  their beloved pets. When less than 5 percent of domestic violence  shelters are able to house pets, it is no wonder why so many victims  choose to stay in these relationships for as long as they do.   Our bill empowers these victims and gives them the necessary  resources to help them step out of the shadow of fear and uncertainty.  [[Page H8212]]    Mr. Speaker, the Pet and Women Safety Act now enjoys the bipartisan  support of 237 of our colleagues. I encourage every Member of Congress  to add their name to this legislation, and I ask our leadership to  bring H.R. 909 for a vote.                            ____________________
