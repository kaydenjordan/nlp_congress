 Madam President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing John Laird of Liberty County. John embodies the American  dream and exhibits strong Montana values.   In 1887, John's ancestors came to America from Scotland looking for a  better life. John's ancestors homesteaded in the Sweet Grass Hills  region that surrounds present day Chester, MT. They built a large sheep  farm and broke horses for the Canadian Guards. Farming is hard work and  not for the faint of heart, but John's family persevered.   The land was passed down from generation to generation. John is a  proud wheat farmer of those hills today, moving the same rocks as his  great-great-grandfathers did. John and his wife, Rita, raised their  three children, Cory, Heather, and Mitchell, on this land. All three of  their children attended Montana schools and universities and have gone  on to start families of their own.   The Laird family story highlights the agricultural history of  Montana, and the tenacity and legacy of those who immigrated to the  United States seeking to create a better life. It is my honor to  recognize John Laird as a successful farmer and father and for leading  a life that represents everything Montanans hold dear.                            ____________________
