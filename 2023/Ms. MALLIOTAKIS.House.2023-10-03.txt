 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of Alan Bernikow, whose generosity impacted thousands of Staten  Islanders.   Alan was a mentor and a dear friend of mine. He was a compassionate  community leader, entrepreneur, and philanthropist looking to make a  difference in the lives of those around him.   He climbed to the top of the corporate ladder. He was the inaugural  chairman of the Heart Institute at Staten Island University Hospital;  he served on the board of directors of the Richmond University Medical  Center; and he was the former President of the Richmond County Country  Club and the Jewish Community Center. He also founded the JCC's annual  golf and bocce classic which funds scholarships for local children.   He and his wife, Joan, were married for over 50 years and they  donated their time, their energy, and their resources to Staten  Island's flagship JCC, which bears their name.   Today, on Staten Island, there is a celebration of Alan's life, and I  send my deepest condolences to his family and friends and our community  during this difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, I offer this tribute of Alan's life for the official  Congressional Record.                            ____________________
