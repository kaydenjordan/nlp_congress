 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the newly announced  tariffs on Mexico by this administration.   Hardworking Texans cannot be asked to bear the brunt of a costly and  unnecessary trade war that would not solve our problems or address our  broken immigration system.   Our economy in Texas is powered by trade with Mexico. Texas is the  number one State in the Nation for trade with Mexico.   Last year alone, we imported $107 billion in goods from Mexico; and  these tariffs, if taken to their natural end, could cost us $27 billion  in Texas alone.   I have met with Lennox, a heating and air-conditioning company,  headquartered in my district in Richardson, Texas. They employ 8,000  Americans, and they rely on subcomponents made in Mexico to manufacture  products here in the U.S. Their business is put at risk by these  tariffs.   Toyota, another great company that is headquartered in north Texas,  has said that these tariffs will cost them and their suppliers as much  as $1 billion.   I have heard from countless constituents about their concerns about  what this will do to the Texas economy. This is unacceptable.   I commend my colleagues in the Senate for contemplating action to  stop these tariffs and plan to join them and support them in the House.                            ____________________
