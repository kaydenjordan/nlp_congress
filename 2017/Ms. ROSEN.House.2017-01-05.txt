 ``. . . the President of the Senate shall, in the presence  of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates  and the votes shall then be counted;--the person having the greatest  number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number  be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if no  person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest  numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as  President, . . .''    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle today in support of this resolution and to lend  my name as a cosponsor. The United States alliance with Israel is  absolutely critical, and this is not the time to sow uncertainty about  the state of our relationship.   This resolution does a number of important things, but the most  important is that it reaffirms Congress' longstanding support for a  bilateral settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and objects to  the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334. Paragraph 5 of  that resolution is reminiscent of a recent U.N. Human Rights  [[Page H152]]  Council resolution that established a database of companies in the  settlements, facilitating a boycott.   The UNSC resolution does nothing to advance the cause of peace and  is, in fact, an obstacle to it. Strongly ensuring the security of  Israel is the only pathway to a lasting settlement.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of  this resolution.
