 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave men and  women of Highland Park.   Independence Day in Highland Park, as it is in so many other places  around our country, is a special day. Today families gather--whether it  be at a barbecue or a park or wherever it might be--and they celebrate  the birth of our country and the ideals of who we are as a nation and  all that we aspire to be.   The Highland Park parade is a very, very important centerpiece of our  community. Prior to COVID, families would gather, putting their chairs  out sometimes the day of or even 2 days before planning exactly where  they would sit to have the best view knowing that their kids or maybe  grandkids, their classmates, and members of their church or synagogue  or their service organization would be marching in the parade, and they  would want to be able to look, wave, and say hello.   This year was different though. This year was the first parade since  2019 because in 2020 and 2021 the parade was canceled due to COVID.   There was a special excitement, and there was a special feeling in  anticipation of the parade this year. Finally, we were back together as  a community.   Highland Park is a special community. It is a city of roughly 30,000  people but with a small-town feel. Neighbors look after each other.  People know each other. The restaurants in the community are frequented  by the locals. Everyone has their favorite, and you are seeing old  friends every time you go in.   This year the parade was going to be special. At 10 o'clock, the time  the parade starts every year, the excitement swells. Groups start  walking along the path up St. Johns Avenue and up the hill to Central  where everyone takes a left turn. They walk across the train tracks,  proceed past 1st Street, then 2nd, all the way through the downtown to  Green Bay, and then down the hill toward the Post Office reaching  Sunset, and turning into Sunset Park at the end of the parade.   The parade started on time at 10 o'clock. The first groups walked up  the hill and made that left turn. People were cheering, celebrating,  and smiling. The first groups made the left turn, crossed 1st, crossed  2nd. The second group passed, the third, and the fourth.   At 10:14 everything changed. What initially sounded like  firecrackers--and sure, why not? it is the Fourth of July--people  quickly realized it was a different sound altogether. Those who were  right there at the corner of 2nd and Central looked and saw that people  were falling and people were bleeding.   At 10:14 a.m. on July 4th, 2022, the Independence Day parade was  shattered when a monster with a high-powered military-style assault  weapon, having climbed a roof dressed as a woman to hide himself as he  would leave, leaned over the edge and fired 83 shots in 1 minute.  Eighty-three shots struck the parade goers below killing seven,  wounding dozens, and changing a community forever.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my community. I rise today to  talk about those who were murdered, to talk about the survivors, and to  share their stories. It is important to share their stories, and it is  important that these stories are told and are heard.   Let me begin by talking about the seven wonderful people, the  precious lives that we lost: Stephen Straus, Katherine Goldstein,  Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, Jackie Sundheim, Eduardo Uvaldo, Irina  McCarthy, and Kevin McCarthy.   Stephen Straus, an 88-year-old longtime resident of Highland Park,  still commuted by train to work in downtown Chicago to his office 5  days a week working as a financial adviser. His niece described him as  ``a big, big oak tree, an umbrella of well-being for all of us.''                                time  1530    Stephen is survived by his wife, Linda, with whom he had been married  for almost 60 years, 60 wonderful years. He leaves his brother, his two  sons, his four grandchildren.   On that tragic day, Stephen's son was in San Francisco. He had called  to wish him a happy Fourth of July, but Stephen didn't answer the  phone. Of course, as the news from Highland Park started coming out,  his son soon realized that his father would not be calling him back.   Katherine Goldstein was the best mom in the world to her daughters.  Neighbors described her as a welcoming and lovely person, bringing them  baked goods during the holidays.   On July Fourth, Katherine and one of her two daughters decided to  leave the house and have fun because Katherine had been mourning the  recent passing of her mother.   As the bullets started raining down, her daughter turned and said to  run. But Katherine fell to the ground. Her daughter Cassie shared this  on the news in an interview. She turned to her mother, saw that her  mother was gone. She knelt down beside her mother and said good-bye,  but, Mom, I have to keep running, as the bullets continued to fly.   Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza was a 76-year-old retiree from Morelos,  Mexico. He spent many years in the Chicagoland area. He had returned to  [[Page H6673]]  the United States to spend time with his family before fulfilling his  desire to rest in his beloved homeland of Morelos.   Nicolas was a loving father to eight children and 25 grandchildren.   On the day of the parade, Nicolas was smiling in his wheelchair as  horses marched down the street when his family began to live a  nightmare with sounds of gunshots. Nicolas was suddenly struck and  killed. Members of his family were also wounded.   Now, Nicolas' family looks to him as a guardian angel as they work  together to hold their family united in their grief.   Jackie Sundheim was 63 years old. She loved to rescue dogs and was a  lifelong employee, member, and centerpiece of North Shore Congregation  Israel. Her kindness and work touched everyone in her congregation and  even those beyond.   She was the events coordinator. She worked with everyone in the  congregation who celebrated bar and bat mitzvahs, weddings, events that  were celebrations to bring family together. But she also worked with  the caterers and the florists, many of whom came to her funeral.   Jackie never lacked a smile or a hug for anybody. In fact, she was  there for everybody.   She is survived by her husband, her daughter, and an entire community  devastated at the loss of such a caring person.   Eduardo Uvaldo is survived by his wife, Maria, 4 daughters, 12  grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren. Actually, I think he has 13  grandchildren.   He was born in Mexico and was loved as a jovial bowling champion. I  talked to his kids about his love for bowling.   Eduardo happily attended the parade with his children and  grandchildren. Later that day, after the shooting, his daughters were  pleading with the entire community on social media to join them in  prayer as Eduardo fought valiantly to survive. The family began to pray  for strength. The community prayed with them.   Eduardo was incredibly affectionate with everyone in his family but  especially his grandchildren. He loved seeing and spending time on  these special occasions and would take a photo with his grandson every  year. On that Monday, that fateful Monday, his daughter couldn't take a  photo, and now she believes that God did not want her to have a  reminder of that day.   Irina and Kevin McCarthy met while working together. They married  about 5 years ago and moved to Highland Park in 2018. The couple had a  2-year-old son named Aiden, whom Irina and her husband, Kevin, were  obsessed with.   On July Fourth, they joined together and went to the parade. They  were right at the corner. When the gunshots started, Kevin and Irina  did what all parents do; they covered Aiden's body to protect him. In  defending their son, they sacrificed themselves.   Aiden was found wandering the area, covered in blood after the  gunfire. The Ring family took Aiden to their home. He played with their  2-year-old daughter after they cleaned him up and watched TV with the  Ring grandfather.   Eventually, Aiden was reunited with his grandfather, of course,  because Aiden was now an orphan. His parents had been murdered. When  Aiden's grandfather picked him up, Aiden had a single question: Are  mommy and daddy coming soon?   Irina was 35 years old. Kevin was 37. They were deprived of the most  precious thing, being parents to their child, being able to raise him,  to celebrate his birthdays, his adulthood, wedding, and maybe children  of his own.   The community is united behind Aiden. The community struggles to  fathom how this is possible.   Aiden will now grow up having only the memory of his parents, not the  hugs and not the love that he deserves.   Aiden is not the only innocent child whose life has been changed.  Many have been injured and wounded. Among them, most grievously, is  Cooper Roberts, a vibrant, beautiful 8-year-old boy who, as I speak, is  fighting for his life in the hospital.   Cooper was at the parade with his family, his twin brother, his  parents. His mother was also shot. His brother was wounded. When his  mother learned, after her surgery, that Cooper's spinal cord had been  severed, she demanded to be immediately released from the hospital so  she could be by his side, as every mother would do.   Cooper's injuries, besides the severed spinal cord, continue. He has  had a torn esophagus, infections, and a collapsed lung. Already, Cooper  has had seven surgeries and is kept sedated because of the pain.   During a brief moment of consciousness, Cooper asked to see his twin  brother and his dog. The family continues to keep the community  updated, and our entire community and I are praying for Cooper's  recovery.    Cooper's life and the lives of many others have been saved because of  the work of emergency medics, police, firefighters, nurses, and  doctors, who have gone to extraordinary lengths to meet the needs of  our community. I would like to take some time to reflect on and  celebrate some of those heroes.   I mentioned the parade had just started. Many groups had gone by. One  of the groups that had just crossed over Second Street were the  firefighters on the truck celebrating. Because in Highland Park, as I  mentioned, we are, like everywhere around the country, a small town  where it is home for so many people, the fire truck wasn't just the  firefighters on the truck. It was their families, their wives, and  their kids because they are all a part of our community.   As the shots rang out, firefighters realized what was going on.  Concerned for their kids, they rushed the truck ahead to keep their  kids safe. But those firefighters, without hesitation of a second,  turned around and ran back to the corner into the fire to make sure  that everyone was safe.   The Highland Park Fire Department transported 24 patients and  administered CPR to many more. Highland Park Fire Chief Joe Schrage  recalls one man, on his own, tied 15 tourniquets that day--one man, 15  tourniquets.   It is more than just the firefighters. I will come back to the police  in a second. These are trained professionals. They behaved the way they  were trained, and they were extraordinary.   There are also many people who may have been medically trained, but  not for a situation like this. They responded as true American heroes  do.   Bobby Shapiro is a tech salesman. In fact, he has no medical  training. But suddenly, in the flash of a moment, he became a first  responder and began doing whatever he could to help.   He found an elderly man with a gunshot wound to his thigh and  abdomen. Bobby and another bystander gave the man chest compressions.  They applied pressure to his wounds as Dr. Wendy Rush, an  anesthesiologist at the parade, helped the man to breathe. After 30  minutes, Bobby boarded an ambulance with the elderly man and stayed by  his side all the way to the hospital. The man Bobby stood by was  Stephen Straus, one of the seven victims that day.   Bobby wasn't alone, though. Police Commander Gerry Cameron also  attended to Stephen Straus. He made sure that Stephen Straus wouldn't  be alone because, as I said, Highland Park is a community that many of  us call home, and we treat each other as if they are family.   David Baum, Dr. David Baum, a fixture of Highland Park, who has been  there so long--I shouldn't say ``so long.'' Dr. Baum delivered our two  sons, nearly 30 years ago, our oldest son, and then less than 2 years  later, our younger son.   I have seen Dr. Baum under pressure. I have seen Dr. Baum perform  with care and compassion.   Dr. Baum, after the shooting, after sheltering initially behind a  bench with David Saleck, rushed to treat bodies he could only describe  as having wartime injuries. He didn't know where the shooter was. He  didn't know if the shooting had finished. In fact, he didn't know that  the shooter wouldn't be caught for 8 hours. But he knew he had to help,  and that is what he did.   Lake County Sheriff John Idleburg was waiting to start the parade. I  walk in many parades with John. I know him as a wonderful person. My  group was in the same location, and as soon as the firing started, the  people who were waiting all immediately cleared out of the area. Not  John Idleburg.   John Idleburg, as he stepped onto the parade route, saw a group of  people  [[Page H6674]]  running toward him in the wrong direction, shouting: Shots fired, shots  fired. Instinctively, as the marine and longtime law enforcement  officer that he is, he ran the other direction, toward the gunshots,  unarmed.   Sheriff Idleburg remembers seeing a lot of blood on the sidewalks and  street when they arrived at the corner of Central and Second. He  immediately, with the assistance of another officer, ordered all  available resources to the scene.   As he watched victims being attended to, he noticed a woman on her  stomach with blood coming from her back. Sheriff Idleburg immediately  began to apply pressure to her wound with gauze that was provided by an  emergency worker. As he applied the pressure, the sheriff comforted the  woman. ``I am here for you,'' he said. ``I am not going anywhere,'' he  told her.   He stayed with that woman for 30 minutes as they waited for an  ambulance while her husband coordinated care of her daughter who they  had brought along.   These are the stories of my community, of my friends. I mentioned the  police and fire departments. I mentioned that the police or the fire  department transported 24 patients, administered CPR, and applied  tourniquets. The police, who were also a part of the parade, were there  in the blink of an eye. Without hesitation, relying on their training  and instinct, they immediately responded to the needs of our community.   An incredible story is Highland Park Officer Ginger Stokes. Officer  Stokes had been with the police department since 1997, working in the  Juvenile Investigation Unit, the Patrol Division, the Crisis  Intervention Team.                                time  1545    During the attack, Officer Stokes had in her car--in addition to her  vest she wears every day that would not stop a rifle round, she grabbed  her rifle-rated vest, a second vest.   As she saw the injured, she saw one in particular, an injured woman,  she took off that rifle-rated vest and put it over the woman. Then,  despite not having that protective vest, she ran back into the line of  fire.   Officer Stokes' astounding heroism, Commander Gerry Cameron's  astounding heroism, in fact, the heroism of all the first responders,  police and fire, in Highland Park, is nothing short of amazing.   There are no words I or the community can fully express to convey the  appreciation and gratitude we have for them. Without the immense work  taken on by first responders that day, I fear that the tragedy could  have been far, far worse.   The first responders and the civilians who went to help, I thank and  praise all of these people and am grateful for them, and I pray for  their well-being. I ask you to keep them in your prayers as well.   Our community is in pain as we think about the loss we have  experienced, the members of our community who are gone. Our first  responders share that grief with us.   The pace of their work doesn't slow down. In fact, for an entire  week, the blocks around the shooting were cordoned off as a crime  scene. The police were searching the area, collecting evidence. Other  police officers were making sure that it stayed secure, protecting the  area.   If you looked at the police cars or the names on the police cars, it  didn't say Highland Park. It said Glencoe, Deerfield, Niles, Morton  Grove, Prospect Heights, and so many more because first responders from  the entire area around Highland Park came to help us.   It wasn't just in the days after, keeping the area safe and secure;  it was at the immediate time of the event. First responders from around  our community as well as the State Police and Federal agencies, FBI,  ATF, all descended immediately onto Highland Park.   I had a chance later in the day to see the command center where they  were focused. With incredible professionalism, incredible focus, and  amazingly swift action, they identified the shooter, located the  shooter, and apprehended him. If not for all these people, their work,  their diligence, their professionalism, their excellence, I don't know  that the shooter would be captured today.   Following the shooting, the community has united in an extraordinary  way. Others have come to help.   This is my community. These were my neighbors. All of the people at  the parade who experienced this shooting, who will be forever affected  by this shooting, are the people I live with and I see every day.   I know their grief, their struggle, their anger, and that is one of  the reasons why I am so grateful for all of the people from areas  around who have come to support us.   One example is at the high school. They set up a response center to  provide counseling services for anybody who might need it. I believe  there are 800 counselors that have come already to the high school to  talk to residents, anyone who stops by.   Already, in just a matter of 10 days, more than 3,000 people have  received comfort and counsel, trying to get through a very difficult  time.   There are other stories. After the shooting, as the police gathered  and the first responders, food trucks started serving meals to the  responders for free. Soon, customers made donations to cover the costs  of those meals. A generous family called the owners of the food truck  and said they would pay for every meal provided to first responders on  Friday.   Highland Park is strong. Highland Park will get through this time, in  no small part because of the care, love, and compassion expressed by  our friends and neighbors.   We will lean on each other. We will lift each other up. We couldn't  do it without the love that came into our community. But as Rabbi Wendi  Geffen said at the funeral for Jacki Sundheim, we shouldn't have to be  here. We shouldn't have to be here.   No one should be able to get a weapon of war, a gun designed for one  purpose, to kill human beings with extreme efficiency, ultimate  devastation, to kill others as quickly and rapidly as possible.   I hope that no one ever has to come back to this podium and share  stories of a mass shooting in their community like I have today, like  what we saw in Uvalde or in Buffalo. That is why I have called for a  ban on assault weapons.   Gun violence is a scourge in our country that takes many forms. Every  day, 111 people die from gun violence, whether from shootings in the  street, gang violence, or domestic violence.   Two-thirds of the deaths by gun violence in this country are  suicides. There are far too many accidental shootings, of guns left  carelessly on a coffee table or some other accident that would be so  easy to avoid.   I hope my colleagues will work to try to reduce the gun violence we  have in this country, which is unlike anything in any other country in  the world.   But today, today, I stand to honor the memories and lives of the  loved ones we lost, people who truly were the center of the universe  for their families and pillars of strength in their community; to honor  people like Bobby Shapiro, Sheriff Idleburg, Officer Stokes, Commander  Cameron, and it is moving to hear the stories of so many others.   I express my sincerest thanks to all those who played a role in  saving lives on July 4, but also thanks to the many people who have  spoken up and shared their stories, people at the vigils in churches  and synagogues in Highland Park, at Sunset Park.   On Wednesday night, people gathered together in a moment of silence-- as we did here in this very body at the same time--at City Hall in  Highland Park.   The people who came to Washington with March Fourth, a group that, on  Wednesday, rallied for changes in our gun laws to make a difference in  lives and fight to make sure no other community experiences what we  have in Highland Park, in Uvalde, Buffalo, El Paso, Las Vegas,  Pittsburgh, Orlando, Denver. The list just goes on and on.    We can't wait any longer to take meaningful action on this violence.  Our grandkids can't afford to wait. Our kids shouldn't be made to wait.  Our entire country deserves better.   Madam Speaker, I close by saying this: The last 11 days have been  incredibly painful for my community. Highland Park will recover. We  have experienced something that no other community should ever  experience and too many communities suffer from each and every day.   It breaks my heart to realize that in all likelihood, I will not be  the last  [[Page H6675]]  Member of Congress giving this speech. It is possible--it is possible-- that, in fact, this may not be the last time I have to give a speech  like this.   Enough is enough. I hope the Members of this body will find the  courage to take action and save lives. Let's start by getting the  assault weapons ban in place, these military weapons of war designed to  kill and devastate off our streets.   Let's always honor the memory of those who should be with us here  today but were murdered in the primes of their lives. May their  memories and the memories of all lost to gun violence forever be a  blessing.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
