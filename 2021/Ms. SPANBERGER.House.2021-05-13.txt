 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week  to honor the service of the law enforcement officers who protected  Members of Congress, Capitol employees, and staff on January 6.   On that day the U.S. Capitol Police and the Washington Metropolitan  Police repelled an attack on our democracy. Bear spray, American  flagpoles, fire extinguishers, and their own riot shields and Tasers  were used against them. More than 100 police officers were injured that  day--their eyes gouged, their ribs cracked, and their spinal disks were  shattered; and countless more are grappling with terrible trauma.   In the wake of the attack, these men and women have faced increased  pressure, scrutiny, and threats. But, Mr. Speaker, if you walk out of  this Chamber, you will see them standing strong--staying committed to  their duty, their country, and their fellow Americans.   On behalf of the people of central Virginia, and on behalf of a  grateful Nation, I thank the Capitol Police and the Washington  Metropolitan Police for their heroism and their bravery. I honor the  lives and the legacies of those we have lost: Officer Brian Sicknick,  Officer Howard Liebengood, Officer Billy Evans, and Officer Jeffrey  Smith.                            ____________________
