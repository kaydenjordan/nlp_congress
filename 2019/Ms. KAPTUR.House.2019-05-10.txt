 Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding, and I  thank her and Ranking Member Granger for bringing this bill to the  floor.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2157, the Supplemental  Appropriations Act for 2019.   Natural disasters across our Nation have been devastating the lives  of millions of Americans. This map shows just some of the areas and  families that have been stricken and have waited and waited and waited  months for Federal support.   The Missouri and Mississippi River systems are absolutely clogged  from the Canadian border all the way down to the mouth at New Orleans.  The devastation is understood by Americans who watch the news.   We have waited months and months and months for Federal support. The  failure of this body to act faster is shameful, so I welcome this  moment this morning on behalf of all those who have been harmed.   It is the top responsibility of Congress to provide these hard-hit  communities with strength, hope, and support to recover.   Imagine looking out your window and seeing this in your backyard.  That has happened to thousands and thousands of families.   This supplemental will finally provide aid to these ailing people and  communities damaged by hurricanes, typhoons, volcanic activities,  tornadoes, floods, snowstorms, and wildfires.   From our energy and water accounts, $2 billion is provided to fix  damaged Army Corps projects, with an additional $1.5 billion in Army  Corps funding for the devastation wreaked by the flooding in the  Midwest.   We are at a 125-year high in the amount of rainfall coming down  between the Rockies and the Appalachians--a 125-year high in this  country.   Many communities have been flooded like this one, but, also, we have  very high water levels even in the Great Lakes region, where land is  just soaked and farmers, business owners, and homeowners are so  concerned about what is going to happen.   Many of these communities are still underwater, but here we provide  an initial downpayment.   The bill also contains $775 million to accelerate projects to  mitigate future disaster damages.                                time  0930    The bill comprehensively aids devastated communities with nutrition  and Medicaid assistance, crop and livestock aid to farmers, and aid to  upended rural populations.   It rebuilds devastated military and Coast Guard installations so our  servicemembers can focus on protecting our national security. Imagine  Camp Lejeune asking us for more help.   It funds resiliency of our Nation's drinking water, wastewater, and  electrical grid systems, and provides communities help to rebuild  businesses and local public infrastructure.   Importantly, it includes significant help to rebuild Puerto Rico,  which suffered complete devastation from Hurricanes Irma and Maria.  This is deeply personal to my constituents, and to me. The President's  refusal to recognize Puerto Ricans as the American citizens they are is  unconscionable. The Senate Republicans back this position and find it  reprehensible.    This is the second time this House has voted on  supplemental funding this year. It is time the Senate take up this  legislation and  [[Page H3689]]  give some peace to American communities and our citizens living in  devastation. I urge swift passage of this act.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of every American  who has ever struggled with mental illness.   With May being National Mental Health Awareness Month as well as  National Nurses Month, we recommit ourselves to:   Building better futures for those struggling with a mental health  condition;   Supporting research into diagnoses and treatment;   Erasing the stigma around seeking help; and   Removing barriers to high-quality and timely mental healthcare by  educating and training doctors, nurses, and behavioral specialists  dedicated to these disabling conditions.   Our Nation is also battling an epidemic of veteran suicide.  Tragically, over 7,000 veterans die by suicide every year, more than  the total number of American servicemembers killed in action during the  entire Global War on Terrorism.   It is no coincidence that our Nation is short 100,000  neuropsychiatrists and 500,000 advance practice nurses in these fields.  At the VA alone, today, there are nearly 50,000 medical vacancies.   If we are to make progress, then our country, our Nation, must  support investments in educating these physicians and nurses to treat  those who, every day, look for a better way of life.   I look forward to partnering with Members of Congress to help America  treat these illnesses and create a more humane society for all.                            ____________________
