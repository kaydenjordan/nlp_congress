 Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the last day  of Filipino American Heritage Month, to honor the Fil Bake Shop in  Delano, California, and to congratulate them on becoming the Delano  Business of the Year.   Owner Tessie Patricio, or Aunty Tess, and workers of the Fil Bake  Shop have been dedicated to hard work and unconditional love for their  business for nearly 30 years. As a result, Fil Bake Shop has become a  staple of the Delano community and a personal favorite of mine.   One-third of the 52,000 residents of Delano are Filipino, and Fil  Bake Shop has been a steadfast supporter of our community in Delano and  across the Pacific.   When the Philippines are struck by natural disasters, Fil Bake Shop  sends care to the islands. They collect donations in times of disaster  to support families back in the Philippines, while still providing the  hardworking farmworkers and families of Delano with their delicious  sweetbreads.   As this local gem is honored as Business of the Year by the Delano  Filipino community, I am proud to represent such a tremendous place in  the 21st District of California.                            ____________________
