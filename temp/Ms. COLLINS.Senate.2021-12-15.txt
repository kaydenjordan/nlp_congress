 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the STEM Education in  Accounting Act with my colleague Senator Rosen. Our bill would  recognize accounting as part of a well-rounded STEM education and allow  school districts to use their Federal education  [[Page S9215]]  block grant resources to develop and improve instruction in accounting.  It also aims to introduce more students to accounting and improve  career awareness and workforce diversity in the field. In today's  rapidly changing world, improving students' access to a STEM-based  curriculum is increasingly vital to ensure they are prepared to succeed  in the 21st-century workforce.   Mathematics--the ``M'' in ``STEM''--is a critical skill that can help  students unlock countless doors to high-paying, in-demand fields. One  of those doors leads to the accounting profession, whose work has a  direct impact on employers, employees, retirees, investors, and the  global economy. Certified professional accountants, or CPAs, play a key  role in providing capital markets with confidence in financial  reporting. Modern accounting increasingly requires cutting-edge math  and technology skills, including IT auditing, artificial intelligence,  data analytics, and cyber security, to keep up with the market's needs.   Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, which is current law, school  districts may use funds from the Student Support and Academic  Enrichment Program to support a host of curricular and extracurricular  activities that deliver a well-rounded education to students in all  grade levels. Specifically, the STEM Education in Accounting Act would  add ``activities to promote the development, implementation, and  strengthening of programs to teach accounting'' to the list of courses  and activities supported by this flexible block grant. Our bill would  also promote high-quality accounting instruction for members of groups  underrepresented in the accounting profession.   Encouraging a robust pipeline of future accounting professionals is  paramount. I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill  to promote accounting education, improve students' finance skills, and  strengthen the pipeline of future accountants, who play such a vital  role in our financial system.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the STEM Education in  Accounting Act with my colleague Senator Rosen.
