 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize one of America's  greatest allies, the State of Israel.   Tomorrow, Israel will celebrate its 75th anniversary. As a  Representative of New York's 17th Congressional District, which is home  to one of the largest Jewish populations in the country, I stand here  with a deep sense of pride and honor for all that Israel has  accomplished.   Israel is a beacon of freedom, liberty, and hope, and its success is  testament to the resilience of its citizens. For 75 years, the State of  Israel has stood strong, overcoming countless challenges and emerging  as a leader in technology, science, and diplomacy.   As a staunch supporter of Israel, I am proud to stand with this great  nation and its people. I have seen firsthand the impact that Israel has  had on the world, from its many contributions to medical research to  its efforts to promote peace in the Middle East.   Israel's story is one of courage, determination, and hope. I look  forward to joining Speaker McCarthy in Israel as we celebrate the  momentous occasion of their 75th anniversary later this week.    Let us never forget that Israel's strength lies in its people, a  people who have overcome adversity time and time again.                            ____________________
