 Mr. Speaker, this bill is soft on war crimes. The  massacres in Mariupol, Bucha, and the kidnapping of Ukrainian children,  similar to what happened in Israel, are all crimes against humanity.  Like the Holocaust, there is no ``other side'' justifying these crimes.  All of these criminals must be held accountable.   Yet, because of Trump affection for Putin and his little helpers here  in Congress, this bill offers absolutely nothing to help fight Russian  terrorists and nothing to stop Hamas terrorists, unless well-connected  Republican tax cheats get help first.   Nor does defeating Hamas require encouraging collective punishment of  the children of Gaza by denying them food, medicine, and water.  Immediate Senate correction of the many failings in this bill can  produce a balanced bill that I and many others will join in supporting.   A humanitarian pause now, stopping disproportionate responses,  represents no surrender to Hamas--rather, it offers the chance to  secure the hostages, avoid a wider war, and achieve long-term security.
