 Madam President, a number of our congressional  interns this summer have greatly profited from a program conducted by  the Stennis Center for Public Service. The Stennis Program for  Congressional Interns is designed to enhance the internship experience  for exceptional future leaders, giving them an inside look at how  Congress works and enabling them to learn from senior staffers across  both parties. These bipartisan relationships will serve them well  throughout their future careers supporting Congress.   Interns are selected based on their employment experience, college  course load, and prospective service to Congress. This summer, 18  interns were chosen for this prestigious opportunity. These interns  serve us on both sides of the aisle, working for Democrats and  Republicans in both the House and Senate.   I congratulate the interns on completing this distinguished program.  I also thank the Stennis Center and their Senior Stennis Congressional  Staff Fellows for providing a meaningful experience and promoting  bipartisan work.   I ask that the names of the 2022 Summer Stennis Congressional Interns  and the offices in which they serve be printed in the Record.   The material follows:         Jack Behan, Office of U.S. Senator Sam Peters; Courtney       Cochran, House Committee on Natural Resources; Carmen Evans,       Office  [[Page S3307]]       of U.S. Representative Lizzie Fletcher; Jacob Feit, House       Committee on Homeland Security; Dory Finney, Senate Special       Committee on Aging; Chanidu Gamage, Office of U.S.       Representative Matt Rosendale; Christian Gentile, Office of       U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville; Jagaar Halverson, Office of       U.S. Representative Randy Feenstra; Zach Jewkes, Office of       U.S. Senator James Risch; Kenny Johnson, Office of U.S.       Representative Fred Upton; Erin Kavanagh, Office of U.S.       Representative Kevin Brady; Eslie King, Office of U.S.       Senator James Risch; Sophie Laurence, Office of U.S. Senator       Angus King; Clara Smith, Senate Committee on Agriculture,       Nutrition and Forestry; Peyton Witt, Office of U.S.       Representative Fred Upton; Ana Worthington, Office of U.S.       Senator Tommy Tuberville; Hasan Zai, Office of U.S. Senator       Gary Peters; Grace Zehner, Office of U.S. Representative       Michael Turner.                            ____________________
