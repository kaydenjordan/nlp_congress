 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Super Bowl  champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. Last Sunday night in Minneapolis,  the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the vaunted New England Patriots by a  score of 41 to 33 in one of the most amazing Super Bowls ever--one of  the most amazing NFL games ever. It was really an extraordinary night.  In so doing, the Eagles captured their first Super Bowl title ever and  the franchise's first national championship since 1960.   The Eagles' arguably improbable Super Bowl run came despite many  serious injuries and a whole lot of doubt from naysayers and pundits  and oddsmakers. The oddsmakers, by the way, had the Eagles as underdogs  in every playoff game they played, but, of course, they won every one  of them.   It is a team led by Doug Pederson, a coach who, himself, entering the  season, was often doubted and sometimes dismissed by the punditry and  the talking heads. Not only did Coach Pederson make his critics look  silly, but, in winning the Super Bowl, he beat a man who is arguably  considered one of the best coaches in NFL history. Pederson did it by  deploying one of the greatest offensive game plans I think the NFL has  ever seen.   The group of men who comprise the Eagles' roster embody the city of  Philadelphia. They are brash, gritty, and talented, with a never-say- die attitude. They are led by stalwarts like Malcolm Jenkins, Fletcher  Cox, Carson Wentz, and Alshon Jeffery. The Eagles' ``next man up''  mentality was incredible to witness.   Think about what they had to overcome. Over the course of the regular  season, the Eagles lost a Hall of Fame left tackle, their amazing  middle linebacker, arguably the best pound-for-pound player in all of  football, and they still steamrolled through to a 13-to-3 record in the  regular season.   For all of that, maybe the greatest example of the ``next man up''  mentality in NFL history was the way that Nick Foles took over for  Carson Wentz at quarterback when Wentz was lost to a serious injury  late in the season. The fact is, Wentz was, I think, the leading  candidate for the league's MVP at the time of his injury. I think he  still should be considered a leading candidate for MVP for the season.  The fact that Nick Foles was able to step in and guide the team not  just into the playoffs, not just through the playoffs, but all the way  to the Super Bowl and to a Super Bowl victory against the New England  Patriots is what legends are made of.   The Philadelphia Eagles are a historic franchise. Some of the best  players in the history of the game have worn the green and white. Names  like Van Brocklin, Bednarik, White, and Dawkins come to mind. This  Super Bowl is also for all of these great players who put on the Eagles  jersey over the years.   I will conclude with this. If you listen to sports radio in  Philadelphia or most of Eastern Pennsylvania, you learn that the  passion of the fan base is really extraordinary. This is because the  Eagles, in many ways, are more than a football team to their fans. The  Eagles are a part of Pennsylvania culture. They are a part of the  region's culture. The mood of the region is affected every weekend that  they are playing. Other cities have certainly celebrated Super Bowl  victories in the past. Somebody gets to do that every year. But this  Thursday afternoon in Philadelphia, get ready for a party like you have  never seen because the most passionate fans in the country are finally  getting a parade down Broad Street with the Lombardi trophy.   Go Birds. Fly, Eagles, fly.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.                                  Tax Reform     Mr. President, I wish to address the Chamber on a topic  that I have been speaking on once a week--or thereabouts--since we  passed the historic tax reform late last year. Last Friday, I had the  chance to visit JED Pool Tools/Northeastern Plastics in Scranton, PA.  It is a company owned by Cindi and Alan Heyen and employs about 30  people. JED Pool Tools makes swimming pool accessories. They make the  skimmers and water test kits and other devices that people use in their  pools. Northeastern Plastics is the sister company, and they make  custom plastic products like locker handles, barber supplies, and all  kinds of special order products.  [[Page S685]]    This is a great example of tax reform in action, tax reform that is  working for this small business and this employer in Northeastern  Pennsylvania. They, like other small businesses, get to discount by 20  percent their net income and pay tax only on the other 80 percent. That  frees up cash flow for this business and businesses all across America  to go out and purchase new equipment, invest in their employees, grow  their business, hire more workers, raise wages. That is exactly what is  happening. It is happening at JED Pools, but it is also happening  across the country.   In less than 2 months since our legislation passed, over 300  businesses employing over 3 million workers have announced bonuses,  wage increases, expanded benefits, contributions to pension plans, and  increased investment in charitable contributions. The list goes on and  on. These are the ones that cite tax reform as the reason they were  able to do these things for their workers, for their business.   In Pennsylvania alone, we have had some recent announcements. Thermo  Fisher employs 2,600 people in Pennsylvania. It is a biotech  development company. They announced $50 million in additional  investments, $34 million in the form of bonuses they are going to pay  to each of the company's 68,000 nonexecutive employees. They also  announced $16 million in additional research and development programs  and support for STEM education. They cited that they are doing this as  a direct result of the tax reform that was passed.   Cigna is a big, global health service company. It has 5,900 employees  in Pennsylvania. Again, citing our tax reform, they have announced that  they are going to increase the minimum wage they pay throughout the  company to $16 an hour. That will be the lowest wage anyone at an entry  level, starting level, makes at Cigna. They are going to provide an  additional $15 million in salary raises to people who are already  working there. They are also going to put $30 million more into 401(k)  savings programs that their employees participate in--all attributable  directly to tax reform.   Take the case of UPS. UPS employees 19,000 Pennsylvanians, and they  announced that due to the ``favorable tax law impact''--those are their  words--they are committing an additional $7 billion in capital spending  over 3 years to build and renovate facilities, to acquire new aircraft  and ground fleet vehicles, to enhance their technical platforms. They  announced that they are going to contribute an additional $5 billion to  their employees' pension plans as well. That comes to about $13,000 per  participant. That is a tremendous amount of money for each of their  employees.   There are small companies that are sharing the benefits as well. Noah  Bank in Elkins Park, PA, said that thanks to the passage of the new tax  legislation, this Pennsylvania charter community bank is awarding  $1,500 bonuses to all of its employees.   We are seeing it up and down the country, certainly all across  Pennsylvania--large firms, small firms, financial firms,  manufacturers--across the board. Workers are already benefiting from  the tax reform that we passed in December.   Another important indicator that the benefits are likely to grow is  in the optimism that workers and businesses have because of the  environment they are operating in. It is a really important driver.   UBS does research on investor and business optimism. It recently did  a survey of business owners. It asked several questions. One of them  was: Is your economic outlook positive? In the fourth quarter of last  year, outlook was pretty positive as 65 percent said, yes, their  outlook for the economy was positive. This year, it is up to 83  percent.   It asked the question: Is the business outlook stronger now than it  was in the past? In the fourth quarter of last year, 77 percent said,  yes, it was stronger. In the first quarter of this year, 87 percent  said, yes, the business outlook was stronger.   It asked business owners about their plans for hiring and investing.  Thirty-six percent plan to hire more workers, and forty-four percent  plan to invest more.   This is really important because it is optimism about the future that  is a necessary precondition for more investment. After all, that  investment depends on a strong economy in going forward to make it  worthwhile. That investment is reaching new highs because of the  combination of a lighter regulatory touch and much more pro-growth tax  reform.   I think it is also important to stress that this tax reform is not  some kind of short-term sugar high of let's throw money at people and  then hope it goes well. It is not that at all. It is a set of different  incentives that will lead to a structural change in the economy and,  specifically, in a greater productive capacity on the part of our  economy by encouraging more investment, by lowering the cost of making  that investment, by allowing businesses to retain more of their  earnings so that they have more to invest. All of that expands our  economy and expands our productive capacity. It creates more of a  demand for workers. More of a demand for workers puts upward pressure  on workers' wages. What did we see just last week? We saw a major--in  fact, the largest increase in average workers' wages that we have seen  in many, many years.   I am thrilled that our tax reform is having such a beneficial impact  all across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and so quickly. I expected  upward pressure on wages. I expected more job opportunities. I expected  a higher standard of living. I didn't quite expect it to happen this  quickly, but I am thrilled that it has, and I am convinced that this is  just the beginning.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).
