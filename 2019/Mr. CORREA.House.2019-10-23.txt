 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the city of  Santa Ana's 150th birthday.  [[Page H8450]]    My hometown was founded on October 27, 1869, on just 70 acres of land  in Orange County; and today, Santa Ana is the second largest city in  Orange County.   It is home to veterans of World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam  war, and the last few conflicts.   It is also home to the largest Hispanic population, percentagewise,  in the country. It is essentially the new Ellis Island of the United  States.   Congratulations to the city of Santa Ana on their 150 years.  Congratulations to their constituents and to the council and to the  mayor.                            ____________________
