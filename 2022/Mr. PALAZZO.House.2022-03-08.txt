 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address President Biden's  attack on American energy independence.   From day one, the Biden administration has opposed domestic energy  production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore. The drastic reduction in  domestic energy production has made the U.S. even more reliant on  foreign energy.   Since President Biden took office, the U.S. has imported around 228  million barrels of oil from Russia alone. That adds up to $17.5 billion  in 2021 to help fuel Putin's war on Ukraine and jeopardize our national  security.   Instead of increasing the amount of domestic energy production to  help ease the high fuel price, the President is now looking to  Venezuela and Iran to help supply the U.S. with even more foreign oil  and gas. We cannot allow the United States to cut funding from one  tyrant to hand it out to another.   The United States has the world's largest oil and gas reserves. We  can produce energy resources more cleanly and efficiently than anywhere  else in the world, and we should produce them.   As a former offshore oil worker, and now a Member of Congress, an  energy-independent United States is one of my top priorities in  Congress. Our country must cut back its reliance on foreign oil.  American oil, natural gas, or clean coal, the method is flexible, but  the reason is not. We must increase our domestic production of energy.  Our national security depends on it.                            ____________________
