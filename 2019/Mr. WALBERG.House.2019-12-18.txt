 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  these baseless Articles of Impeachment.   Our Founding Fathers never intended impeachment to be a one-sided  political weapon. Sadly, the majority has reduced this serious  constitutional action to a purely partisan tactic to take down  President Trump.   History will not be kind to the vote today. It will be remembered as  a rushed process that lacks credibility or transparency with a  predetermined outcome that puts a premium on political theater instead  of facts. By any objective standard, the Democrats' impeachment case is  the thinnest imaginable. There is no impeachable offense before us  today. It is a complete and total sham.   I close, not by quoting a President from the past, but rather from  the duly elected President Donald Trump: ``You are the ones interfering  in America's election. You are the ones subverting America's democracy.  You are the ones obstructing justice. You are the ones bringing pain  and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political,  and partisan gain.'' These are hard words I know, but that is the sad  reality of this entire process.   I will proudly vote ``no'' today, a vote that upholds our  Constitution, defends our President, and preserves the pillars of our  Nation's democracy.
