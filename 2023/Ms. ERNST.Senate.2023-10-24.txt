 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Secret Serenity Salon and Spa of Harlan, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week during National Women's Small Business Month.   Founded by Tami Kloewer in 2007, Secret Serenity Salon and Spa is a  full-service salon serving customers in western Iowa communities.  Secret Serenity Salon and Spa offers hair, nail, and skin care  services, as well as a spa and retail store in their shop. Secret  Serenity Salon and Spa started with Tami as the only employee but has  grown to now employ 21 full- and part-time employees. In addition to  their in-store services, their retail store offers a variety of beauty  care products for all types of skin and hair needs. In 2023, Secret  Serenity Salon and Spa celebrated its 16th business anniversary.   In addition to providing beauty services, Secret Serenity Salon and  Spa is also actively involved in the Harlan community. In February  2022, Secret Serenity Salon and Spa participated in a Women's Health  Night event hosted by Myrtue Medical Center in Harlan. The event  provided local women with routine health screenings while Secret  Serenity Salon and Spa offered free chair massages to participants. The  team has also supported philanthropies to help the local schools,  retirement centers, and hospital. Secret Serenity Salon and Spa is a  member of the Shelby County Chamber of Commerce and Industry and has  hosted the chamber's annual Holiday Open House. Owner Tami Kloewer is  also involved in the Iowa community. In 2020, Tami Kloewer was  nominated to serve on the Iowa Board of Cosmetology Arts and Sciences  by Gov. Kim Reynolds and served on the board until 2023.   Secret Serenity Salon and Spa's commitment to providing beauty care  in  [[Page S5140]]  Harlan, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate Tami Kloewer and the  entire team at Secret Serenity Salon and Spa for their continued  dedication to providing beauty care to Iowans. I look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
