 Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous  consent request?    Will the Senator yield for a moment for a unanimous  consent request?    Mr. President, I ask to propound a unanimous consent  request.    Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized for 1 minute.  No, I don't. I ask that I be recognized at the conclusion of this vote  to explain why the Paul amendment would be damaging to our national  security. That is my unanimous consent request.    Mr. President, would it be appropriate at this time for  me to ask for 1 minute prior to the vote?    Thank you very much.   I know the intentions are good; we have voted on the same thing for  the last 5 years. I can tell you right now what the vote result is  going to be because it has been the same for the last 5 years.   No one has had a more consistently conservative record than I have,  but I would have to say that this would undo a lot of what we have  accomplished with the last vote to allow us to start rebuilding our  systems. We got in a position where we didn't have brigade combat teams  that were adequately prepared to go to battle. Sixty percent of our F- 18s were not flying. We are trying to recover from all of these things.  We have now started that recovery.   My concern is--and I think Senator Graham said it very well--in the  event that we pass this--if it did pass; it won't, but if it did--that  is going to be a problem and a problem that we can't overcome.   Right now, our No. 1 concern should be defending this Nation. This is  the opportunity to at least let people know that there is a legitimate  vote for conservatives to vote for a strong national defense.   I don't want to send a signal to our kids overseas--our kids in  battles and in harm's way--that we are not going to take care of their  needs, as we just started just a year ago to do. We have to continue  that.   For the sake of our national security, I suggest that we vote against  the Paul proposal.    Madam President, will the Senator yield?  [[Page S2748]]         Madam President, I thank the Senator, and I appreciate  that very much.   I just want to make a brief statement about the vote that just took  place. I tried to communicate this, and there wasn't time before the  vote. Right now, we have more threats than we have ever had in the  history of this country. I think we all realize that.   General Dunford said that we are losing our qualitative and  quantitative advantage over our adversaries. He was talking about  Russia and China, in this case. We have adversaries out there that are  actually ahead of us in terms of their capabilities in artillery and  other areas.   Here we are, and, quite frankly, we knew how this vote was going to  come out. I have a list of the same vote that has taken place for the  last 5 years, and it came out the same way it did before. The point  here is that even though it wasn't going to pass, the problem is, it is  sending a message to our kids who are out there in harm's way.   We look and we see that we have started our road to recovery, and it  has been an exciting thing because we came so close to being in a  position where one-third of our brigade combat teams didn't work. The  F-35s in the field--the Marines could use less than half of them. All  of these things were going on because of what has happened to our  military.   Finally, we turned the corner. We turned the corner on the last  vote--not the one we took today but the one we took a few months ago-- and we now are rebuilding our military.   I had breakfast this morning with the Secretary of the Army and with  the Chief of the Army, and really good things are happening. I can't  think of anything worse than to send a message to our kids in the field  that we are going to go back and undo the positive things that have  pulled us up into a competitive position.   For the sake of our military, for the sake of defending America, the  vote there was to vote against sending the wrong message to our kids in  harm's way.   I thank Senator Warner for yielding.                            ____________________
