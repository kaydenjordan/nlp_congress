 Mr. Speaker, 41 million Americans and over 1 million  North Carolinians' ability to put food on the table hangs in the  balance this week, as House Republicans push to pass their farm bill  with over $23 billion in cuts to the SNAP program. These cuts, Mr.  Speaker, quite frankly, could mean food taken off of the table of  hungry children--that is no exaggeration--seniors, and veterans.   Despite these benefits averaging only $1.40 per person per meal, this  program is a lifeline for tens of millions of Americans. It serves as  an effective tool for ensuring long-term health and well-being,  especially for vulnerable children.   The farm bill, as it is currently written, includes detrimental  changes to SNAP that would make it harder for many people to remain in  the program. Over 400,000 households nationwide, and at least 133,000  individuals in North Carolina, would lose SNAP benefits if this  legislation becomes law.   Even more disturbing is that my Republican colleagues understand what  these cuts would do but remain unfazed in their assault on these  families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2: too bad,  too long for our children.                            ____________________
