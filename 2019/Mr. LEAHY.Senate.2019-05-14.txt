 Madam President, I would like to take a moment to pay  tribute to a remarkable and unique person, Vermont Supreme Court  Justice Marilyn Skoglund, who will soon be retiring after serving 25  years with the Vermont judiciary.   Justice Skoglund is what we all want to see in a jurist and public  servant. She is dedicated, personable, and highly committed to the rule  of law, but her path to the Vermont Supreme Court was anything but  typical. As a single mother working hard to get by in the 1970s, law  school was not an option. Instead, she took advantage of Vermont's  ``Reading the Law'' approach that allowed her to study while serving as  an apprentice of sorts with the Vermont Attorney General's office.  After being admitted to the Vermont Bar, she would go on to serve as  chief of the civil law and public protection divisions in the AG's  office before being appointed to the bench in 1994 by then-Governor  Howard Dean. She would be elevated to the supreme court just 3 years  later. At the time, she was only the second woman to serve on Vermont's  highest court. Today, women make up the majority of its five justices.   I have had the pleasure of knowing Justice Skoglund during her many  years of living and working in my hometown of Montpelier. Her personal  story was so compelling that she was my first choice in 2008 to keynote  Vermont's Women's Economic Opportunity Conference, an annual event I  have now hosted for 23 years.   But no tribute to Justice Skoglund would be complete if it did not  mention her keen sense of humor. Perhaps it is this trait that has so  deftly served her these many years, for as serious as the supreme court  must be in delivering justice, Marilyn Skoglund has demonstrated time  and again the benefit of  [[Page S2807]]  laughter in our lives. She finds the time to appreciate what some might  only see as mundane; she cherishes her friendships, and she mentors  those who will succeed us. By her own account, she has led a full life.   I ask unanimous consent that these excerpts of the May 1 Seven Days  profile of Justice Skoglund be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From Seven Days, May 1, 2019]    Justice Served: Marilyn Skoglund to Retire From the Vermont Supreme                                   Court                              (By Paul Heintz)         On her way out the door of her Montpelier home last Friday,       Vermont Supreme Court Justice Marilyn Skoglund rolled up her       right sleeve to show off her latest tattoo.        ``I waited until my youngest daughter's wedding,'' the       justice said with a sneaky smile. ``I knew she wouldn't want       me to get it.''        Written in a simple black cursive on the inside of her arm       were the words, ``Jag ar matt,'' a Swedish expression often       uttered in her childhood home at the conclusion of a family       meal. ``I am satisfied,'' she translated. ``I am full.''        The 72-year-old jurist reflected for a moment--perhaps on a       life rich in family, friends, dogs and the law--and declared,       ``I am satisfied! I mean, what else can you say? I'm very       lucky. I am satisfied.''        This week, Skoglund plans to inform Gov. Phil Scott that,       after 22 years on the state's highest court, she intends to       resign effective September 1.        Skoglund's retirement brings to a close one of the most       remarkable and least likely careers in the Vermont       judiciary--that of a struggling single mother who passed the       bar without a day of law school and worked her way up to       become the second female justice in state history.        Now, the famously irreverent attorney is looking for a new       challenge, be it the beginning Spanish class she plans to       take this fall or the online bartender course she's long       contemplated. ``I just need to take a chance and see what       else I can do before I drop dead,'' she said, letting loose       her trademark cackle.        Skoglund's sense of humor has long served as the       ``collegiality glue'' on the court of five, according to       retired justice John Dooley. In her decades on the bench, she       has made it her mission to draw colleagues and staff members       out of their casework and into the world--through court       poetry slams, end-of-term parties and art openings at the       Supreme Court gallery she founded and oversees.        ``I would describe her as a unifier,'' said Victoria       Westgate, a Burlington attorney who clerked with her from       2013 to 2014. The justice has also served as a role model to       a generation of young women in the law, Westgate said.        Though Skoglund may be best known for her larger-than-life       personality, colleagues describe her as a deeply serious       jurist with an unmatched work ethic.        ``Of all the justices I've worked with, I think she       probably put . . . more effort into preparing and       understanding a case than any,'' said Dooley, who served       alongside Skoglund for two of his three decades on the court       . . .        Born in Chicago and raised in St. Louis, Skoglund had what       she describes as an ``idyllic childhood,'' replete with a       picket fence and parents who were ``the Swedish equivalent of       Ozzie and Harriet.'' Her father managed a steel treatment       plant and her mother, a former hairdresser and math tutor,       raised the future justice and her sister.        Skoglund spent seven years meandering her way through       Southern Illinois University--a fine arts major and ``hippie       folk singer'' who worked, for a time, as a graphic designer       for the inventor and futurist Buckminster Fuller. She finally       earned her diploma after getting married and becoming       pregnant with her first daughter.        The young family moved to Vermont in 1973 so that       Skoglund's husband could take a job teaching painting and       printmaking at Goddard College. They rented a small,       uninsulated cottage on a 500-acre dairy farm in Plainfield.       Skoglund learned to milk cows, taught photography and worked       as an editor at Goddard. The marriage didn't last, though,       and soon she was raising her daughter on her own.        Skoglund found herself relying upon the generosity of       Walter Smith, the 68-year-old dairy farmer who served as her       landlord and her ``very own personal version of welfare.'' He       provided firewood when she needed it and let her dip raw milk       from the bulk tank. When she and her daughter were low on       food, they would join Smith for cans of chicken noodle soup       and mayonnaise sandwiches.        ``He saw me through it,'' she said.        Skoglund's experience with poverty later informed her work       on the bench and, she said, gave her ``a very good       understanding of desperation and frustration and what it       causes people to do.'' ``I think I'm the only justice that's       ever been poor,'' she said.        After completing a six-month paralegal class, Skoglund       landed a clerkship in the Vermont Attorney General's Office       and began reading for the law--an alternative route to the       bar that enables aspiring attorneys to bypass law school       through independent study. It was a solitary, self-motivated       education, but I am disciplined,'' she wrote in a recent       essay about her unconventional path. ``In the central office       of the attorney general, I was the only student with about 50       `teachers.' ''        Skoglund spent four years clerking for Louis Peck, then the       chief assistant attorney general and later a Supreme Court       justice. She would run lines for Peck, an amateur actor, and       he would school her in the law. Skoglund credits him with       informing her ``legally conservative'' approach. ``I don't       take liberties with the language, and I don't read myself       into it,'' she said. ``It's not about you, Marilyn.''        Skoglund spent 17 years in the Attorney General's Office,       eventually serving as chief of its civil law division and       then its public protection division. She was appointed to the       Superior Court in 1994 and to the Supreme Court in 1997.        ``It's like candy,'' Skoglund said of her current gig. ``I       have never been bored.''        The pace of the job wouldn't allow it. The supremes hear an       average of 120 full cases a year, plus many more appeals on       the so-called ``rocket docket.'' They're also consumed by the       myriad unseen administrative duties of the judicial branch,       such as divvying up its ``shoestring'' budget and managing       the lower courts.        ``This all takes hours when all I want to be doing is       reading cases,'' Skoglund said. . . .        According to Skoglund, her acid prose occasionally gives       her law clerks ``panic attacks.'' But members of her tight       fraternity of former clerks praise her ``dedication to       raising a new generation'' of lawyers, as Todd Daloz put it.        ``She has a real energy and a real humor and a real joy of       life,'' said Daloz, who clerked for Skoglund from 2009 to       2011 and now serves as associate general counsel for the       Vermont State Colleges System.        ``When I hire [clerks], I explain that I'm hiring my best       friend for the next year,'' Skoglund said. ``I have to be       able to come in and vent and bitch and moan and get solace       from them.''. . .        For the past 35 years, Skoglund has lived in a tall, brown-       and green-shingled house perched above the Statehouse on the       southern boundary of Hubbard Park. The place is crammed with       books and artwork and features a ``wall of dogs'' consisting       of canine paintings she's collected. ``It's kind of a magical       place for me,'' she said of her home, where she does much of       her off-the bench legal work. ``It's just a sanctuary.''        Skoglund's two grown daughters, an obstetrician and a       neuropsychologist, have long since moved out. Her current       roommates include a 4-year-old goldendoodle named Johnny and,       during Vermont's four-month legislative session, Senate       Majority Leader Becca Balint (D-Windham). ``I always say I       have the best roommate,'' Balint said. ``Sometimes it's seven       o'clock in the morning and we're both crying because we're       laughing so hard.'' . . .        Last Friday morning, after showing off her tattoo, Skoglund       wrapped an unused dog leash around her waist and commenced       her three-block commute down the hill and past the Statehouse       to the Supreme Court. Johnny pranced along in front of her,       relishing his freedom.        Skoglund gushed about her daughters and 9-year-old       granddaughter, with whom she had spent the previous weekend.        ``They're not thrilled with this tattoo--at least, the       younger one isn't,'' she conceded. ``But that's the way it       goes, ladies. Mom's gotta do what Mom's gotta do.''        Skoglund entered the court through a side door and showed       off one of her most concrete contributions to the       institution: an art gallery in the lobby of the building that       she's curated for the past 20 years.        ``When I first got here, it was the hall of dead       justices,'' she said, referring to the oil paintings of her       predecessors, now relegated to the stairways and upper       floors. In their place was a series of mixed-media pieces by       the artist Janet Van Fleet consisting of red buttons and       plastic animals. Johnny led Skoglund up to her third-floor       office, which features a smiling boar's head mounted to a       wall. ``Behind you is Emmet, my amanuensis,'' she said,       gesturing at the hairy creature. ``A lot of those wild boar       things look scary and vicious. He's just sweet.''        Skoglund took a seat behind her cluttered desk and said,       with a resigned tone of voice, ``I've been here for 22 years.       It's time to go.''        Asked how she hoped people would remember her, Skoglund       answered without hesitation. ``I worked hard,'' she said. ``I       took my position very seriously. I never cut corners. I       understood the responsibility. That's what I hope.''                            ____________________     Madam President, today, I am honored to recognize the  president of the University of Vermont, UVM, Thomas Sullivan, who is  stepping down this June after 7 years as a remarkable leader for the  university.   Tom's tenure as the 26th president of the University of Vermont came  during a tumultuous time in higher education. Despite demographic  declines and reduced public investments in higher education, Tom made  quality, affordable education and investment in scholarship his top  priorities.   Tom expanded UVM's course offerings, oversaw 20 building projects,  and  [[Page S2808]]  helped increase the value of UVM's endowment by 80 percent. When  appointed in 2012, Tom was given the responsibility of heading UVM's  Move Mountains fundraising campaign with the goal of raising $500  million by 2020. Because of Tom's personality, passion, and, at times,  persuasion, the University hit its fundraising goal a year ahead of  schedule, a very impressive accomplishment considering the economic  hardship that has defined the last decade. The success of this campaign  increased scholarships for students, invested in top-tier faculty, and  made capital investments to improve the student experience.   While the university has continued to evolve, under Tom's leadership,  UVM has managed to stay true to its founding as a Land Grant  university. Tom has worked tirelessly during his tenure to expand UVM's  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--STEM--offerings  including the 4-year construction of a $104 million STEM Complex. Tom  shares the belief that income should not be a barrier to a good  education. Because of his dedication to the education of all students,  Tom was instrumental in developing UVM's Catamount Commitment, which  promises Pell Grant-eligible Vermonters that the reminder of their  tuition will be covered, either through grants or waived by the  university entirely.   Tom's tenure at UVM tops off a long and distinguished professional  experience in the field of academia. Tom taught at the law schools of  the University of Missouri, Washington University in St. Louis, MO, and  was appointed to be a dean and professor of law at the University of  Arizona College of Law. Following his time at the University of  Arizona, he began his 17-year tenure at the University of Minnesota,  where he eventually was appointed to become its senior vice president  and provost.   Calling Tom a prolific academic and legal scholar would be an  understatement. He has written 11 books and over 50 articles primarily  in the field of antitrust litigation. In addition to his writings, in  2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee had the honor and privilege of  obtaining Tom's advice and consultation on the confirmation of then- Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. The lasting impact of  Tom's work in the field of legal studies is no small feat and will be  felt for generations to come.   It is rare to find Tom's unparalleled selfless dedication to academia  and the needs of students across the country as well as throughout the  world. Over the course of his 7-year tenure, Marcelle and I have had  the pleasure on multiple occasions to enjoy the company of Tom and his  wife Leslie. They are wonderful people who care about nothing more than  giving the next generation the opportunity to succeed through  academics. Tom's charming and caring presence will surely be missed on  campus, but we look forward to having Tom and Leslie as Vermont  residents for some time. Marcelle and I thank Tom for his service, and  we wish him and Leslie all the best in the next chapter of his  distinguished career.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to speak briefly about the  courageous environmental activism of Alfred Brownell, a native of  Liberia now living in exile in Boston.   Mr. Brownell is an environmental and human rights lawyer and the  executive director of Green Advocates, a Liberian organization that he  founded to promote environmental justice for indigenous communities.  Like so many environmental activists around the world, he has been  repeatedly harassed and threatened. He was forced to flee his country  with his family due to fear of reprisal for his outspoken and tireless  work to protect the traditional land rights of his countrymen and  against the sale, without their consent, of vast areas of forest to  Golden Veroleum Liberia, a Southeast Asian-based company that produces  palm oil. Now a visiting scholar and teacher at Northeastern  University, Mr. Brownell continues to conduct research and classes on  the issues that have come to define his life.   Mr. Brownell was recently recognized by the international community  for his perseverance in protecting Liberia's forests on which thousands  of Liberian families and many endangered species of wildlife depend. He  was honored in San Francisco and Washington as one of six recipients of  the prestigious 2019 Goldman Environmental Prize. It is important that  we not only pay tribute to Mr. Brownell for his extraordinary  contribution to his people and his country but that we be aware that  despite this international recognition, he continues to fear returning  to his native country.   I have long supported U.S. assistance to help Liberia overcome years  of a brutal armed conflict, and I will continue to do so. But I regret  that the Liberian Government has sided with the palm oil company and  against their own local farmers. Unable to intimidate Mr. Brownell,  government officials tried to silence him by offering him government  jobs in return for his cooperation. When that failed, they put his  house and his family under police surveillance, publicly accused him of  sedition and economic sabotage, accused his organization and other  environmental rights organizations of undermining Liberia's  sovereignty, and lied about him to incite an assassination attempt.  Since December 2016, he has been living in exile, with no indication  from Liberian officials that their hostility toward him and his cause  has diminished.   Government intimidation of civil society activists and scholars is  antithetical to open and accountable democratic societies. It is what  we have come to expect of shortsighted or, even worse, corrupt  officials and the outsized influence of corporate interests.   If the Liberian Government is serious about attracting foreign  investment for job creation and sustainable economic development--goals  we all support--it should recognize that Mr. Brownell is a patriot of  whom all Liberians can be proud. Liberian officials should encourage  him and his family to return to Liberia, and point to him as an example  of how one courageous and determined individual can make a positive  difference for the country.   Rather than benefiting a foreign corporation producing a monocrop for  export, the Liberian Government should be protecting its biologically  diverse forests and wildlife, not destroying them and polluting the  rivers on which local inhabitants depend and displacing people who have  lived there for generations.   Alfred Brownell should be a source of pride and an inspiration for  all Liberians. I hope the international recognition he has received  will convince the Liberian Government that it is people like him who  deserve our admiration and our thanks.                            ____________________
