 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Gavin Christopher Deal,  a native of Alexander County in the Fifth District.   Gavin has served over a decade in the military and is currently a  Surface to Air Ballistic Missile Specialist on the USS Fitzgerald.   Recently, he joined 12 other Petty Officers in representing the  United States in the Milan 2022 Multinational Naval Exercise, and the  International City Parade.   He also successfully launched two harpoon ballistic missiles in the  previous war games near the Philippines. These are terrific  accomplishments indeed.   Gavin, thank you for your continued service to both North Carolina's  Fifth District and our great country. You are a shining example of the  best that the Fifth District has to offer.                       Recognizing Maura Schaffer-Greer     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Maura Schaffer-Greer, a  social studies teacher, assistant swim  [[Page H4580]]  coach, and percussion instructor at South Caldwell High School. As you  can tell, she is a true renaissance woman.   Recently, her class participated in a project where class members  wrote letters to me about different pieces of legislation and asked for  my thoughts. In doing so, her students learned a truly invaluable  lesson: becoming an informed citizen is one of the most important  duties we have as Americans.   Madam Speaker, after talking with Mrs. Schaffer-Greer and learning  about her love of teaching, it is clear to me that she leaves an  indelible mark on the lives of her students. May she continue to do so  for many years in the future.                     outhern Border Catastrophe Continues     Madam Speaker, our southern border is under siege and  President Biden is asleep at the wheel.   Over 40 illegal aliens on the terror watch list have been arrested at  the southern border since President Biden took office.   In March of this year, 220,000 illegal aliens were encountered at the  southern border, and 62,000 of them evaded Border Patrol agents.   Madam Speaker, that averages out to roughly 2,000 people per day  escaping into our country.   So who did Border Patrol agents not catch? Who else is on the terror  watch list that escaped into our country?   Madam Speaker, border security is national security, and it is clear  that this administration fails to recognize that most basic fact and do  its duty.                            ____________________
