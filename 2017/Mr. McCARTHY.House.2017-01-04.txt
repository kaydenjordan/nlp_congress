 Mr. Speaker, our Constitution lists few, if specific,  qualifications for the office we now hold. Article I, section 2 states  that we must be at least 25 years old, we must have been a citizen for  the past 7 years, and we must live in the State we represent.   In ``The Federalist Papers,'' Alexander Hamilton and James Madison  wrote that ``Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part  of the federal government is open to merit of every description,  whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to  poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious  faith.''   In a phrase, our body is to represent the American people in all of  its opinions, complexities, and riches; and I believe we do. For in a  free nation such as ours, no single person can represent the people as  a whole. In this body, I proudly work with colleagues on the left and  the right, from every region and State, people who profess different  faiths, have had different careers, and embody the experiences of the  American people. No gathering in this Nation is more like its people  than in this House. We are joined together in representing not only our  constituents but our country.   Mr. Speaker, we now have a high and honorable task set before us.  First, we must take our practical principles that we have built up by  the hard experience of generations who have come before us, and we must  apply them to a changing future. Our mission is not to return to the  past, nor to destroy it, but rather to build upon it.   And then we must direct the desires of the people into action.  Millions of Americans long ignored have rejected a future of limits and  slow decline. We have heard their voices. But history will not judge us  by how well we hear but how well we act.   The unemployment rate has steadily declined and ticked down to 4.9  percent, but what is more important is that our labor participation  rate is only 62.7 percent. Outside of the Obama years, that is the  lowest labor force participation rate since 1978.   The reason our unemployment rate is dropping isn't because people are  finding jobs. They have no prospects for stable and meaningful work.  The American people have unrivaled talent and ability, but it is not  being used. If we are looking for a reason behind the message that the  American people sent us in November, this is a good place to start.   And for so many who have work, things aren't much better. Millions of  Americans, especially those in the heartland and struggling  neighborhoods in our big cities, aren't sharing in America's  prosperity. In fact, the bottom half of the economic distribution in  America hasn't felt any of the economic growth from the 1970s on. These  people spend their whole lives working and never have the chance to  move up.   We have had the wisdom to listen to all of the American people,  especially those being left behind. Now let us have the courage to  lead. Let us have the courage to define the people's desires in law.  And as we go about our daily business, Mr. Speaker, we should remember  not only that we have great purpose, but we also have great power  loaned to us directly from the American people.   Our Republic, and the liberties we hold dear at this time, are  threatened by bureaucracies, subject to no authority but their own  will. They cannot be controlled by the people and are increasingly  unrestrained by the people's representatives. This is not a partisan  concern. Congress has a duty to act as a unified body in defense of our  Article I powers because, unlike the bureaucracy, we are accountable to  the people.   That is why I have scheduled this House to tackle this problem  starting today through a two-step approach. First, as I have long said,  structure dictates behavior. We need to fix the structure in Washington  that deprives the people of their power.   Second, we will repeal specific regulations that are harmful to the  American people, costing us time, money, and, most importantly, jobs.  To begin to get to the root of this problem, we will pass the REINS Act  that will require Congress to approve every major regulation produced  by the administrative state. And unlike the bureaucracy, if the people  don't like what they see, they can vote us out of office.   Then next week, we will take a look at the Regulatory Accountability  Act, which will require agencies to choose the least costly option  available and will end judicial deference to agencies, which puts the  American people at a disadvantage in the courtroom.   But it is not just how rules are made. It is what rules are made too.  The President continues to unilaterally impose regulations on his way  out the door. So while we haven't yet determined what needs to be  repealed first, I expect to start with swift action on at least the  stream protection rule and methane emissions standards, both of which  limit our energy production.   This process won't be completed quickly, but as we remove harmful  regulations and change the structure of Washington, draining the  bureaucratic swamp that undermines the will of the people, we can  rebuild trust between the people and their government again. And not  only that, within the renewed and responsive structure of a truly  representative government, we can restore that hope held by so many  generations before, that hope that has defined America's character  since before our Nation was founded. It is the American Dream so that  we and our children can find more meaning, security, purpose, and  success than those who have come before us.   Restoring that dream is the purpose of this body in the 115th  Congress. The American people expect this country to be great again.  Here and now, we will move us toward that greatness.                            ____________________
