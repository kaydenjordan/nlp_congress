 Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, the Senate has just invoked cloture on the nomination  of David Zatezalo, of West Virginia, to be the Assistant Secretary for  Mine Safety and Health. Mr. Zatezalo is uniquely qualified to lead the  U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration  because he knows the industry inside out. He has spent his career in  mining, starting as a miner. He is a member of a union. He worked his  way up to general superintendent in Southern Ohio Coal and was a  general manager at AEP.   The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee approved his  nomination on October 18, and I am glad the Senate will have the  opportunity to vote on his confirmation.
