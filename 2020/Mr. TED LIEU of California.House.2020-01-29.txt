 Mr. Speaker, this morning, Donald Trump  wrote on Twitter: ``Remember Republicans, the Democrats already had 17  witnesses. We were given none. Witnesses are up to the House, not up to  the Senate.''   Both of his statements are false. In the House, there were multiple  Republican-requested witnesses that testified under oath, some of them  on national TV, and they were cross-examined by both Democrat and  Republican committee members.   In addition, under our Constitution, it is the Senate that runs  trials. And Americans understand that in a trial you have witnesses and  documents. In fact, a recent poll showed that 75 percent of Americans  want the U.S. Senate to call in witnesses, witnesses like John Bolton.   You know who runs trials without witnesses? Saudi Arabia.   So my message to the U.S. Senate, controlled by Republicans, is very  simple: Be like America. Don't be like Saudi Arabia.                            ____________________
