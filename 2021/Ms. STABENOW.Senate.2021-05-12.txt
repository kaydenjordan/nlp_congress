 Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to  the veterans throughout Michigan's history who have given their lives  while serving our country. Whether they served in the Civil War or the  Korean war, in the Middle East or the South Pacific, we owe these  heroes so much.   Aleda E. Lutz is one of those heroes. She grew up in a large family;  she was the youngest of 10 children--and her parents were immigrants  from Germany. She graduated from Arthur Hill High School in Saginaw and  the Saginaw General Hospital School of Nursing. When World War II broke  out, Lutz felt called to serve her Nation.   She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps in 1942 and began working as a  general duty nurse at Selfridge Field. When she had the opportunity to  become a flight nurse, she signed up. It wasn't easy; it required a lot  of training. But Lutz, known as ``Lutzy'' to her friends, was smart,  determined, and extraordinarily brave. She made the cut and joined the  elite 2 percent of World War II nurses qualified as flight nurses. She  was promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to the 802nd Medical  Air Evacuation Transport Squadron, which soon deployed to North Africa.   Lutz transported more than 3,500 patients from the frontlines while  earning six battle stars. She was known for her professional skill and  her courage under fire. During her 196th mission, her C-47 plane  crashed while carrying 15 wounded soldiers. There were no survivors.  Lutz is known to be the first military woman to die in a combat zone  during World War II.   Lutz is one of the most highly decorated women in American military  history. She was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal  with four Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Purple Heart. An 800-patient  hospital ship was named in her honor, as was a C-47 cargo plane. And in  1990, the Saginaw veterans hospital, long known by her name, was  officially rededicated as the Aleda E. Lutz Department of Veterans  Affairs Medical Center. It remains a fitting memorial to honor a nurse  who gave her life while serving her country.   Not all veterans have had to give as much for their country as Aleda  Lutz did, but all of them are willing to. It is what sets them apart.  It is what makes them heroes.   This Memorial Day, we honor 1LT. Aleda E. Lutz and all of the  Michigan  [[Page S2482]]  veterans who gave their lives in service to our country, and we thank  our veterans who are still with us, as well as their families. Their  courage, selflessness, and sacrifice bring honor to our State and our  Nation.                            ____________________
