 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the HEALS Act.   As we continue to confront this coronavirus pandemic, we have to  ensure that our schools and our employers can safely reopen. Our  healthcare providers must also have the resources they need to continue  to provide essential care to all Americans to fight this virus and to  help this Nation return to some semblance of normalcy as quickly as  possible. We have to also provide liability protection for those  schools, businesses, and healthcare providers while they do their very  best to operate safely during this unusual, once-in-a-generation, once- in-multiple-generations pandemic. The HEALS Act will help to provide  these protections.   The HEALS Act also includes several provisions that I have been  championing, including legislation to address unemployment insurance  system reform.   We note that there have been a lot of challenges associated with the  legacy computer systems, and we should never ever have to endure this  again.   Financial assistance to help childcare providers reopen has also been  another priority of mine. I recognize that our childcare providers play  an essential role in not just caring for our children and ensuring they  remain educated and in a safe environment when their parents aren't  around but in also being critical to our broader economy. If your kids  aren't taken care of, you can't go to work, and Hoosiers want to go to  work.   Finally, we have telehealth legislation that has been included in  this HEALS Act that will lead to greater affordability and access,  especially as many of these authorities are made permanent in the  future. This is a way to bend the cost curve down and provide a higher  value for each of those healthcare dollars in our moving forward.   It also includes the TRUST Act, which is something that I helped to  introduce in order to establish a bipartisan national plan to finally  begin tackling the long-term drivers of our national debt once we get  through this coronavirus pandemic. I have been talking about this and  have sometimes been criticized for talking about fiscal responsibility  and the largest drivers of our long-term national debt. I am  unapologetic every time I talk about it. This TRUST Act would establish  a bipartisan national plan to finally begin tackling this, and I hope  it will remain in the package as negotiations continue.  [[Page S4570]]    Most importantly, I am glad the HEALS Act includes some really  important features of my RESTART Act, which is a bipartisan piece of  legislation that I introduced with Senator Bennet. We now have  somewhere north of 42, 44 bipartisan cosponsors. We have 50 national  groups--and growing--that are supportive of this legislation. It is  very important that these features remain in the HEALS Act.   Like my RESTART Act, the HEALS Act recognizes the need for having  long-term working capital loans and targeting that relief toward  businesses that have suffered significant revenue decline. We don't  want more examples of businesses that are doing just fine in the wake  of the pandemic getting access to moneys that, frankly, they don't  need. Instead, we want to target our resources toward the hardest hit  businesses that will not survive this pandemic. That is what the  RESTART Act does, and I am proud of those features that were included.  However, I have to say, in order to truly assist the hardest hit small-  and medium-sized enterprises that have fallen through the gaps of  previous programs, more of the RESTART Act is going to have to be  included throughout this negotiation process.   Last night, I received a text from a longtime friend of mine. Her  name is Sheila. Sheila is a resident of Dearborn County, IN. Gosh,  Sheila is an incredibly hard-working person, and she texted me the  following:         Todd, I saw you on C-SPAN today. I really appreciate how       you bring up the Hoosiers. When you are writing this next       bill, please consider small businesses like my husband and I       have. Pat is the lone legal owner of our catering business.       We invested all of the revenue made over the few years into       our business, buying equipment, et cetera. Because of this       investment, we had an impressive schedule of events this past       spring, summer, and fall lined up. This time of year gives       our barbecue business our greatest exposure and opportunity       for financial gain. We were ineligible for a PPP loan because       we did not show a profit. When composing the next PPP, please       consider single-person business owners like our barbecue and       catering business. God bless you.    Well, God bless you, Sheila. It is hard-working people and couples  and partnering Americans who help build this country. It is innovators  and entrepreneurs and doers and dreamers and workers like Sheila.   If we don't provide this much needed relief now, I am really  concerned that we are going to be in a far worse position in the weeks  and months to come.   As more businesses close permanently, they go bankrupt; they are no  longer paying payroll taxes. Then there is greater damage done to the  economy and to our Nation's balance sheet.   I am also concerned about our ability as a country to fully recover  once there is a vaccine available. It is our small and medium-sized  enterprises, which you disproportionately find in States like Indiana,  the heartland of the country, where so much innovation occurs. It is  not always in these large businesses; it is the smaller enterprises  where the innovation occurs. Then, ultimately, it is the big businesses  that acquire these innovative businesses.   So we want these engines--these incubators of innovation, these small  businesses, medium-sized businesses that are innovative and  entrepreneurial--to survive this difficult time.   They are also pillars, frankly, of Main Street, America. We take  pride in our small businesses, many of which have been so hard hit. We  don't want to hollow out Main Street America on the back end of this.  The most fiscally irresponsible thing we could do here at the Federal  level of government is to fail to respond to the needs of these small  and medium-sized enterprises.   So the additional assistance that I am calling for is critical to,  for example, the more than 500,000 manufacturing employees in the State  of Indiana, the most manufacturing-intensive State in the country.   It is also critical to the 200,000 Hoosier restaurant employees laid  off or furloughed since March. We have been able to provide them some  short-term assistance, but this virus and the challenges associated  with it have lingered on much longer than all of us had hoped, and we  are going to have to help out these employers so that they have a place  to go back to work once we figure this thing out.   This assistance is critical to the small music venues that enrich our  local communities throughout the State of Indiana and across our  country, which are facing permanent closure, too, and the countless  restaurants, gyms, salons, boutiques, hotels, retailers, and other  small businesses that are essential pillars of our community.   I grew up in a small business family. We had our up years; we had our  down years. We had some rough Christmases. My dad, my mom--they took  great pride in that family business. They made it. They worked hard.  But they saw nothing like this virus. We need to help these businesses.  These businesses are in dire straits not because any bad business  decisions were made, but, instead, because this virus came from  overseas, disrupted our lives, and in the interest of public health,  our employees had to stay home. People stopped buying the same things  they were buying. Our shopping patterns changed.   At some point we will resume some semblance of normalcy. We are  getting there. But in the meantime, we need a bridge to the other side  of this virus. We need to make sure that all of the provisions of the  RESTART Act make it into the HEALS Act.   Since Senator Bennet and I introduced the RESTART Act in May, our  legislation has received support from more than 40 bipartisan Senators.  I am proud of that. There is a lot of hard work going on in the U.S.  House of Representatives to get Members of the House to sign up as  well. It has also been endorsed by roughly 50 national organizations  and more than 50 Indiana businesses, and these are prominent national  organizations, including, for example, the National Association of  Manufacturers.   Given the widespread support for the RESTART Act, I will continue to  work with my colleagues to ensure that more of it is included in the  final coronavirus package. I hope we get all of it included. We have to  ensure that we are caring for those who have suffered the most.   To Sheila and to Pat, you have my word--you have my word, as you did  the first day we met, that I would do everything I could to fight for  the people of Indiana, to fight for what is right, to fight tirelessly  on behalf of my customers--you and the millions of Hoosiers I  represent--answering only to my ultimate bosses: God and the  Constitution.   I will fulfill that pledge and continue fighting for all of you  during this difficult time.
