 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about Khalil Maatouk,  who is the executive director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies  and  [[Page H375]]  Research, and the head of the Syrian Center for the Defense of  Detainees.   On October 2 of 2012, 6 years ago, Mr. Maatouk was being driven to  work by a friend, and that was the last time anyone was able to reach  him. It is very possible that he was illegally detained at a security  checkpoint by the Syrian Government. Even though a released detainee at  the State Security detention facility in Damascus said he saw Khalil  there, the Syrian general prosecutor has still denied his whereabouts.   Six years is long enough, Madam Speaker. It is time for the Syrian  Government to release Khalil. He has dedicated his life to the defense  of human rights, and it is past time that he gets to return to his  family.                            ____________________     Thank you, as a friend and Congresswoman from Missouri, for  yielding and holding such an important and timely Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, President Trump went to the American people  and rightfully made the case for the border security proposal he has  submitted to Congress, and it is a proposal that I fully support.   This plan, which was developed by border security and law enforcement  professionals, takes necessary steps to secure our border, protect our  communities, and it ends the plague of crimes that were committed by  illegal aliens against American citizens.   The truth is America is at a decision point. It is time to decide  what kind of country, exactly, we want to be: a country founded on the  rule of law or on lawlessness.   We have seen States across the country declare themselves a sanctuary  for illegal immigrants, willing to put the lives of U.S. citizens at  risk for political purposes. We have lawmakers here in this Chamber who  are intent on eliminating our Immigration and Customs Enforcement  agency, ICE, which is tasked with enforcing our immigration laws.   We know that the vast majority of immigrants are great people, and it  would be foolish to even think otherwise. In fact, legal immigration-- that is legal, with an L--historically has been beneficial  economically, socially, and culturally to the United States, and I have  no doubt that we are going to continue to invite and welcome legal  immigrants with open arms to our country every day. We do that for  about 1 million a year. We are a very welcoming and generous country.  But to ignore the crisis at our southern border is also dangerous.   Throughout 2018, Customs and Border Patrol seized 1.7 million pounds  of narcotics. We have seen a 38 percent increase in methamphetamines  and a 73 percent increase in fentanyl coming across our borders. These  drugs are taking the lives of tens of thousands of our people every  year--I think we heard the number 72,000 last year, including many of  those from my home State of North Carolina. For those who are living  with addiction, these drugs steal their dignity, and they steal their  self-worth.   The trafficking of women and children across our southern border is  equally as egregious. In his address to the Nation the other night, the  President called this a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.   The Department of Homeland Security has also been very clear  regarding the national security implications that come with having a  border that can be easily accessed by those who want to cause us harm.   To conclude, I will say that, right now, the government is in a  shutdown because President Trump requested funding for a border wall  that Democrats once supported when there was a different President.   To be frank, the current shutdown isn't due to policy difference; it  is due to politics. So let's put politics aside, and let's do what is  right for our constituents and for our country.
