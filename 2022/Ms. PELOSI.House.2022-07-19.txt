 Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to see you presiding over  this very important legislation. And I thank the gentleman for yielding  and for the leadership of bringing this important legislation to the  floor. Mr. Nadler has been in the lead on this for decades.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the Respect for  Marriage Act, bipartisan and bicameral legislation to enshrine into law  a fundamental freedom, the right to marry whomever you choose.   As radical justices and rightwing politicians continue their assault  on our basic rights, Democrats believe that the government has no place  between you and the person you love.   Let us salute Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler for his persistent  leadership on this issue. It was 13 years ago, Chairman Nadler,  alongside then-Representative, now-Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator  Dianne Feinstein, and others introduced a bill by the same name to  repeal the Defense of Marriage Act.   Defense of marriage; proposed by somebody who had been married three  times. We don't know which marriage he was defending.   And today, we will finally achieve that long-held goal.   I really don't care how many times somebody is married. I care about  how they try to impose their hypocrisy on others.   Thank you also to the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus Chair    David Cicilline, and all of the members of the Caucus, for being  tireless voices in the fight for full equality.   Mr. Speaker, we are here because just 3 weeks ago, the Republican- controlled Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ripping away a woman's  freedom over her most intimate health decisions.   These radical Justices took a wrecking ball to precedent of the court  and privacy in the Constitution and placed even more of our cherished  freedoms on the chopping block.   Don't take it from me. Indeed, as Associate Justice Clarence Thomas  declared in his concurrence, this is what he said. These are his words:  `` . . . in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's  substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and  Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is  `demonstrably erroneous,' we have a duty to `correct the error'  established by those precedents.''   In total defiance of the precedents of the Supreme Court; in total  defiance of what some of the candidates for Justice on the Supreme  Court testified  [[Page H6725]]  that they supported, precedent. And they voted against it. And now,  they want to go after other rights of privacy.   Make no mistake: While his legal reasoning is twisted and unsound, it  is crucial that we take Justice Thomas and the extremist movement  behind him at their word. This is what they intend to do.   Indeed, just yesterday, a Republican Senator declared that the  Obergefell decision was clearly wrong, plainly suggesting rightwing  interest in taking aim at marriage equality.   We must act now to defend same-sex and interracial marriages from  this bigotry and extremism.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, with marriage rights now squarely  in Republican crosshairs, Democrats are ferociously fighting back.   With the landmark Respect for Marriage Act, we ensure that marriage  equality remains the law of the land, now and for generations to come.  Importantly, this legislation will repeal the unconstitutional and  discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.   The Republicans knew that the Defense of Marriage Act was  unconstitutional when they passed it. You know how I know that? Because  shortly thereafter, they introduced a bill to overturn--to make sure  that the Defense of Marriage Act was not subjected to judicial review.  Some of them proclaimed at that time that Marbury v. Madison, which  established the principle of judicial review was wrongly decided, and  they wanted to rid the process of judicial review from the Defense of  Marriage Act, recognizing, admitting that they knew it cannot withstand  judicial review.    So while it was sent to--the Defense of Marriage--to the dustbin of  history with United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges, our  bill finally takes it off the books for good. That way, no future  administration or majority in Congress can wield this appalling policy  as a weapon against our LGBTQ loved ones.   This legislation also guarantees that no married couple can be denied  equal protection under Federal law. This is really very important--from  tax provisions to Social Security benefits, and more--even if the Court  were to erase marriage freedom, God forbid.   Finally, this legislation blocks States from denying recognition to  valid, out-of-state marriages, even if a State were to enact heinous  restrictions.   By passing the Respect for Marriage Act today, House Democrats, in a  bipartisan, bicameral--and I salute the Chairman for that announcement  that he made--take another step to defend freedom for the American  people.                                time  1300    Last week, our proud pro-choice, pro-women Democratic majority passed  two major bills to restore and protect health freedom.   Our Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act will ensure  that the fundamental right to travel and obtain needed healthcare  remains in the hands of the American people, not in those of extreme  rightwing politicians which is the future House Republicans' desire.   Our Women's Health Protection Act will, once again, make the  protections of Roe v. Wade the law of the land.   Later this week, the House will pass the Right to Contraception Act  so that every couple may determine the size and timing of their  families as protected by Griswold v. Connecticut.   Not just couples; people. Contraception. Contraception. Can you  believe they are going after contraception? Well, believe it because  they have been going after contraception for decades in the Congress.   Now the Associate Justices have given us clear warning that this is  in their sights.   The contrast could not be clearer: While Democrats work to protect  and expand freedom in our country, Republicans seek to punish and  control our most intimate personal decisions.   Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous and unconscionable that today, a  radical Republican Party seeks to wind back the clock on decades of  hard-fought progress.   As we pass this landmark legislation today, we salute the generations  of activists and advocates, organizers and mobilizers, who fought  relentlessly to advance the all-American ideal of full equality for  all.   I say often that our inside maneuvering can just go so far. The  outside mobilization produces the best possible results.   Personally, it is with some emotion that I think about my close  friends, the iconic Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin of San Francisco. They  were an inspiration to so many of us in San Francisco, in California-- indeed, the country--teaching us that equality is not about tolerance.  It is about respect. It is about taking pride.   This bill makes crystal clear that every couple and their children-- imagine if you are the children of a marriage equality or an  interracial couple, and you see the Congress of the United States and  the Supreme Court of the United States making an assault on your  parents' marriage, how damaging that can be.   This bill makes crystal clear that every couple and their children  have the fundamental freedom to take pride in their marriage and have  their marriage respected under the law.   With that, I urge a strong--hopefully a strongly bipartisan vote for  the Respect of Marriage Act. I, again, salute the chairman for his  great work.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I thank  her for her unsurpassed leadership as chair of the Appropriations  Committee, for  [[Page H6738]]  reflecting the values of our country, based on her leadership in terms  of listening to the American people and meeting their kitchen-table  needs, and, again, advancing us into the future.   We said about many of these initiatives: When we pass this, we will  be making history. Not only that, we will be making progress, thanks to  the leadership of Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, chair of the committee. It  is a source of great joy to me because I served on the committee with  her, saw her leadership then and now as chair.   Let me just describe--people say: What is a minibus?   A minibus is a minibus. It is not an omnibus. Sometimes we would have  a bill that contained all of the appropriations bills. Omni, all.  Omnibus. This is a minibus, which contains six of the bills--six very  important pieces of legislation--and hopefully we will move soon to  pass the others.   With these bills, our Democratic majority advances many of our  Nation's cherished principles and priorities, including job creation,  expanding opportunity, and protecting health and well-being.   Let us salute the masterful Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, a maestro of the  appropriations process, who is a constant source of inspiration,  leadership, and strategic thinking for all of us.   I also thank our cardinals for their hard work in carefully crafting  each of these six very important bills contained in this minibus. You  are called a cardinal if you rise to be a chair of one of the  subcommittees of Appropriations. It is a great honor.   Mr. Chair, I do want to acknowledge the work of Chairman Sanford  Bishop. We just heard from him about food, agriculture, rural  development, et cetera.   Chairwoman Marcy Kaptur, Energy and Water Development.   Chairman   Mike Quigley, Financial Services and General Government.   Chairwoman Chellie Pingree, Interior-Environment.   Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs.   Chairman   David Price, Transportation, and Housing and Urban  Development. Mr. Price will be leaving us at the end of this term, but  his legacy will be with our country for a long time to come.    Mr. Chair, I thank our colleague on the other side of the aisle for  acknowledging Mr. Price's work, and naming a portion of the  Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development bill in his name. Mr.  Diaz-Balart, I thank you for that beautiful recognition of Chairman  Price. He certainly is revered on our side of the aisle, and we  appreciate the bipartisan recognition of his leadership.   Mr. Chair, the House's Appropriations minibus will have an immediate  impact on people's lives because it puts working families first.   This package defends health and well-being: improving the safety and  security of our Nation's food supply. A vote for this bill is a vote  for the safety of our Nation's food supply. A vote against it is a vote  against the safety of our Nation's food supply.   The bill supports the WIC program--Women, Infants, and Children--food  stamps, and other initiatives that keep our families fed.   This package strengthens economic security with strong investments to  expand access to safe, affordable housing--thank you, Mr. Price-- support small business growth, and protect the interests of American  consumers.   In doing so, these bills advance President Biden's commitment to  putting justice and equity front and center, moving to close economic  disparities weighing heaviest on communities of color and low-income  families.   At the same time, this package will further power Democrats' mission  to rebuild our Nation while reinvigorating the middle class.   Our bipartisan infrastructure law that was bipartisan and passed last  year was a monumental step forward. Now, this legislation builds on  that bipartisan progress: creating good-paying American jobs,  rehabilitating our crumbling infrastructure; securing critical funding  for roads, bridges, ports and rail, transit and aviation, and more; and  improving the strength and resilience of our water systems.   This is a health issue in addition to a commerce issue. These  investments lay a crucial economic foundation, better equipping our  Nation to compete and win in the 21st century economy.   This package is also about protecting and preserving our planet--a  responsibility we owe our children and grandchildren and future  generations.   The investments in this legislation, Mr. Chair, are another strong  step toward independent, affordable, clean energy jobs for the future:  whether spurring innovation in new, sustainable technologies;  strengthening community resilience to mitigate climate disaster; or  conserving our cherished public lands.   Anyone who watches the news these days sees the impact on the climate  crisis on our planet.                                time  1415    Throughout Europe, there are record heat waves. In our own country,  we have had scores of our hottest record days, scores of them in our  own country. The climate crisis is a real one. There is a short fuse on  it. We must act. We cannot ignore the signs or the governance and the  protections that go with it.   Preserving clean air and clean water for our children is a public  health issue. The air they breathe and the water they drink is an  immediate health issue. It is an economic necessity, creating good- paying jobs in the industries of the future while staving off  catastrophic costs of inaction.   A matter of national security is preventing violent conflicts over  resources and habitat. You have droughts; you have rising sea levels;  you have encroachment of deserts; and you have change in the thermal  management of the planet, Mr. Chair. All of this contributes to  competition for habitats and resources, and our National Security  Advisors tell us that that can be a cause of conflict, in addition to  the toll it takes on people.   For many of us, it is a moral issue if you believe as I do that this  is God's creation and that we have a moral responsibility to be good  stewards of it. That is one purpose. But if you don't share that view,  you do understand that we have a moral responsibility to our children  to pass on the planet in a responsible way for future generations. This  is one of the Democratic majority's top priorities, and we will never  stop fighting for the climate action that we need.   Finally, and importantly--one of my favorite subjects--this package  honors our Nation's sacred duty to our veterans, their families, and  their caregivers. A vote for this bill is a vote for our veterans,  their families, and their caregivers with robust support for veterans'  healthcare, which covers more than 7 million patients, with more  resources to build essential VA infrastructure, and with increased  funding to address mental health, substance abuse disorder, the scourge  of veteran homelessness, and much more.   As we do so, we honor the truth when the military says that, on the  battlefield, we leave no soldier behind, and when they come home, we  leave no veteran behind.   Mr. Chair, Democrats believe that governance is a powerful force for  good when we invest in what we value most as a nation--protection of  our people, their health, their safety, the planet, the air they  breathe, the water they drink, and security for our country. Today, our  Democratic majority advances appropriations legislation that furthers  that mission with funding that will meet the needs of American families  in every corner of our country, and we take an important step to  advance President Biden's inspiring vision of building a better America  for all with liberty and equity for all.   Mr. Chair, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this minibus package.  I salute our cardinals for their great leadership, and I again pay  homage to the chair of the committee, Madam Chair Rosa DeLauro, for her  extraordinary leadership.
