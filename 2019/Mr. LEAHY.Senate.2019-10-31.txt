 Madam President, I see my friend, the senior Senator from  Alabama, on the floor. I want to offer my praise for him because we are  going to vote on final passage of the fiscal year 2020 Senate Commerce,  Justice, and Science appropriations bill, the Agriculture  appropriations bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. I  urge all Members to vote aye.   These are good, bipartisan bills. They show that despite whatever  political atmosphere we operate in, the Appropriations Committee can  put partisan politics aside and do our work on behalf of the American  people.   These bills make responsible investments that build on what we were  able to accomplish in fiscal year 2019 while strongly rejecting the  shortsighted cuts the Trump administration proposed. They back up our  commitment to invest in rural communities and farms, law enforcement,  and the environment.   We have reached this point because we worked together quietly during  evenings and weekends to get it done. I want to thank the chairs and  the ranking members of the subcommittees for their work: Senators  Hoeven and Merkley, Senators Murkowski and Udall, Senators Collins and  Reed, and Senators Moran and Shaheen.   I have often said that Senators are merely constitutional impediments  to their staff, and Senator Shelby and I are lucky to have such a  staff. They have worked very long days and nights.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the  staff, both Republicans and Democrats, who deserve our thanks.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:     Vice Chairman Leahy List for H.R. 3055 (Minibus #2) Staff for the                                   Record         Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay       Tilton, Hannah Chauvin, Olivia Matthews, Dianne Nellor, Jean       Toal Eisen, Rachael Taylor, Dabney Hegg, Adrienne       Wojciechowski, Bob Ross, Teri Curtin, Jennifer Eskra, Blaise       Sheridan, Elisabeth Coats, Ryan Hunt, Melissa Zimmerman,       Faisal Amin, Jessi Axe, Christina Monroe, Shannon Hines,       Jonathan Graffeo, David Adkins, Margaret Pritchard, Morgan       Ulmer, Hamilton Bloom, Emy Lesofski, Clare Doherty, Patrick       Carroll, Elizabeth Dent, Anna Lanier Fischer, Amber Beck,       Allen Cutler, Matt Womble, Sydney Crawford, Lucas Agnew, Nona       McCoy, Gus Maples, Rajat Mathur, LaShawnda Smith, Jason       Woolwine, Courtney Young, Valerie Hutton, Elmer Barnes, Penny       Myles, Karin Thames, Bob Putnam, Jenny Winkler, Christy       Greene, George Castro    I yield the floor, and I urge an aye vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today, the Senate is going to vote on  whether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to a package of  appropriations bills that will include the Senate Defense  appropriations bill, and the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services,  and Education (Labor-HHS) appropriations bill.   There are many things in these bills that I support, but I am going  to strongly urge all Senators to vote no. I am disappointed that the  majority leadership has taken this step. They bowed to demands by  President Trump, and that is continuing to delay funding for our  troops.   They insist on including in this bill authority for President Trump  to raid American tax dollars from our military and their families.  President Trump wants to raid that money to pay for his wall, after he  had given his solemn word that Mexico would pay for it, and that is not  acceptable. Because he cannot keep his word, he has already raided $6.2  billion from the Department of Defense this year alone for his border  wall.   He did all of that without congressional approval of either  Republicans or Democrats. He diverted $2.6 billion from the fiscal year  2019 Defense Appropriations Act. Then he took another $3.6 billion from  military construction projects for his southern border wall.   That money came from projects that would have improved the lives of  our troops and their families: military schools, childcare centers, and  improved training facilities, many of which have been damaged by  hurricanes and other natural disasters.   On this side, we oppose this bill because we are fighting to protect  funds that are meant for the women and men of our military and their  families. We oppose this bill because we stand with those patriotic  Americans, and we refuse to place the President's failed campaign  promises on their backs.   That alone should convince every Member of this Chamber to oppose  this package. Yet the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that is tied to  this Defense bill also shortchanges the domestic priorities of the  American people by stealing even more money to pay for President  Trump's vanity wall.  [[Page S6325]]    If all things were equal, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill--our  largest domestic funding bill--would receive a 3-percent increase in  fiscal year 2020, but the Republican bill provides less than a 1- percent increase for Labor-HHS, while the Department of Homeland  Security's appropriations bill receives a 7-percent increase to cover  the cost of the President's demand for his wall. It doesn't add up to  me, and it doesn't add up to most Americans, who broadly oppose  President Trump's wall.   If, in the House and Senate, we were to have an up-or-down vote on  the wall, I suspect it would fail. So now, they are trying to do it  through a backdoor way--a shortsighted cash grab directed by President  Trump. This is a bill that fails to cover even the annual costs of  inflation in public health, Head Start, childcare, special education,  veterans' training grants, and dozens of other programs that are relied  upon by the American people. He will cut the veterans programs and he  will cut the childcare programs to pay for this wall.   I am also disappointed by the willful spread of misinformation by  President Trump and the Republican leadership regarding our opposition  to this bill. They have baselessly accused the Democrats of blocking a  3.1-percent pay raise for our troops by our opposing this package. That  is ridiculous.   Regardless of the action we take in this Chamber, the men and women  of our military will see a raise in January. No matter what we do, they  are going to get that raise. This well-deserved raise is based on a  statutory formula that does not need to be authorized by the  legislation before us. In fact, neither the House nor the Senate  Defense appropriations bills contain any provision that is related to a  pay raise. Reaching a bipartisan-bicameral consensus on a $693 billion  Defense appropriations bill is hard enough without there being the  willful and irresponsible spreading of misinformation.   This campaign of misinformation does not stop there. The Republican  leadership has even accused the Senate Democrats of holding up aid to  Ukraine. That would be laughable if it were not for the real-world  consequences we are seeing play out in Ukraine today. It is the  Republicans who are holding both military funding and Ukraine aid  hostage to President Trump's vanity wall. It is the Republicans who  refuse to bring a bill to the floor unless Congress enables President  Trump to continue stealing funds from our troops and our military  families to pay for the wall that he gave his solemn word that Mexico  would pay for.   The Senate Democrats have long advocated for aid to Ukraine. We  insisted it be included in the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills,  and we will continue to do so because it is the right thing to do.  Since 2015, I have personally supported more than $3.3 billion in aid  for Ukraine. That is a level that far exceeds the President's request.   These baseless accusations are merely attempts to distract from why  the Senate Democrats are actually opposing this package. We will not  stand idly by as President Trump continues to rob our military  families--using them as his personal piggy bank--for a failed campaign  promise that he cannot keep. We will not stand idly by as the domestic  priorities of the American people are shortchanged to pay for some  unnecessary monument to the President's ego along our southern border.   We have been down this road before. Just last month, the Republican  leadership failed to get the votes that were necessary to move these  bills, but I think it is prudent to remind everyone that this entire  strategy has been tried before. It failed before, and it will fail  again--that strategy being the wall over everything, that strategy  being the wall at all costs no matter how much damage it does to our  veterans, no matter how much damage it does to our military families,  and no matter how much damage it does to American children. It is a  strategy of a wall and a campaign promise over the American people.   That same strategy drove the country into the longest government  shutdown in American history earlier this year that cost the taxpayers  billions of dollars, and they got absolutely nothing in return.  Incidentally, that was when the Republicans controlled both Chambers of  Congress, and they still allowed this shutdown. So, if you think this  failed Republican strategy will work on the second go-around, I have a  fence for you to paint back at my home in Vermont.   Everyone here knows there is only one real path forward to our  reaching agreement on bipartisan bills, and I believe it is time we  reached that agreement. I have tremendous respect for my good friend  Chairman Shelby. Look at the bills we just passed overwhelmingly. That  is because Senator Shelby and I were able to sit down and work on these  bills, put them together, and do them in a bipartisan way. I have told  the Secretary of Defense and others that we still have time to do that  on the Defense appropriations bill. We can do it.   When we come back next week, we should try again. Let the grownups in  both parties in this body work on it. We will get it done, but the  clock is ticking. It is really time to stop the political maneuverings  and to stop the sloganeering. Let's do real work.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am proud to honor the contributions  of farm to school programs around the country by introducing a  resolution that designates October as ``National Farm to School  Month.'' I am glad Senators Collins, Brown, and Perdue joined me in  introducing this resolution.   Under a provision I authored in the 2010 Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids  Act, farm to school programs across the country have thrived. Grants  have been awarded in all 50 States and the District of Columbia to  support programs in more than 43,000 schools. We have learned that one  of the best ways to help students make healthy choices is to teach them  about their food and how it is grown. Making that connection makes a  difference.   We all know that hungry children cannot learn. Studies have shown  that healthy nutrition in a young person's diet is crucial to cognitive  ability and better health in the long run. Food insecurity and obesity  rates are still too high in this country, resulting in poor health and  learning and behavioral difficulties at school. The school meal program  has made tremendous strides in recent years to ensure not only that  children have access to meals throughout the school day but that those  meals are nutritious. The Farm to School Program has given children and  schools across the country the tools to craft farm-fresh, healthy, and  delicious meals that students enjoy.   In Vermont, I have seen firsthand how farm to school efforts have  better connected children with the food in their cafeteria. Students  participate in school gardens, sustainability projects, and taste tests  for new school menu items. Earlier this month, I was glad to visit St.  Albans, VT, to announce grants that will enhance classroom curriculum  to help children become familiar with local food and how to eat  healthfully.   Ensuring children have enough food to eat is an issue that unites us  all. There is simply no excuse that in the wealthiest, most powerful  Nation on Earth, people go hungry. Small changes in eating habits by  children  [[Page S6358]]  will result in lifelong health benefits for generations to come. The  Farm to School Program empowers children and their families to make  healthy choices now and in the future. I am glad all Senators joined us  in recognizing the importance of this program and recognizing October  2019 as National Farm to School Month.
