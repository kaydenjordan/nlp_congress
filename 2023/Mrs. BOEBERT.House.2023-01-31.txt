 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  have not literally lit this place on fire.   At midnight Tuesday, January 24, 2023, ``Newsmax'' was removed from  DIRECTV, DIRECTV STREAM, and U-verse, denying 13 million customers this  highly rated news channel.   This is not the first time that we have seen this, and I am afraid  that it won't be the last time that we are seeing this here in our  great country. OAN was deplatformed by DIRECTV in April of 2022.   So what is next? FOX News? Will The Weather Channel be canceled next  if they refuse to bow to the left's altar of climate change? What about  The History Channel? We see on a regular basis the left wants to erase  history and deny truth. How about TBN? There has definitely been an  increase in disdain and intolerance by many liberals for Christian  beliefs, simply by saying we love Jesus. So is TBN next?   Americans are tired of cancel culture. Conservatives are not being  treated fairly. We are the ones who are censored by Big Tech. We are  the ones targeted and called domestic terrorists when moms and dads  show up at school board meetings.   We are the ones targeted by the IRS because our organizations have  the word ``patriot'' in their name.                                time  1915    Mr. Speaker, if you are a conservative pastor, the government  persecutes you. If you are a liberal pastor, Joe Biden shows up to your  church, whether he realizes he is there or not.   Yet, now we are faced with Newsmax, a conservative news organization  followed and watched, again, by millions of Americans, and it has been  removed from DIRECTV. Newsmax is the fourth most watched news channel,  but they have been removed for hyperpolitical reasons.   What can be done? I have been asked time and time again: What do we  do to rein in the censorship and the oppression of conservatives  because free and open speech is worth fighting for?   The First Amendment in our Constitution defends our freedom of  speech. That is something that we will continue to pursue, to preserve,  and to never let the left take away from us entirely. So, here is where  we will start.   AT&T: As long as you continue to censor conservatives and attack the  press, I will make it my personal mission to strip the wasteful,  ridiculous Federal subsidies you receive.   To AT&T, DIRECTV, and all the woke corporations: This isn't a threat.  It is absolutely a promise. If you continue to stifle free speech in  this great country and muzzle the press corps, Congress will have no  choice but to hold you accountable. I promise you that my colleagues  and I are happy to take you on to preserve free speech for all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Buck for organizing this tonight. I  thank the gentleman for being a defender of free speech from the  censorship that is going on. I thank the gentleman for fighting against  that.
