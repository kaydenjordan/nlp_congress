 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today as Israel is at war. They are  at war in response to a genocidal assault by the Iran terrorist group  Hamas, an assault against Israel and against America and against the  citizens of dozens of other countries.   The numbers are staggering: over 1,400 Israelis killed, thousands  more wounded and tortured, over 199 kidnapped--alongside them, 30  Americans killed and about a dozen kidnapped, by far one of the  deadliest attacks against Americans in history. And so our Israeli  allies are rightly going to war to eradicate Hamas.   We often hear that Israel and the United States share the same  interests and the same enemies, that when Israel fights for its own  security, they are also fighting for ours. Rarely in history has that  been so explicitly, horribly true.   And let us be clear about what they are fighting against. What we saw  on October 7, in the early hours of Saturday, October 7, was pure evil  unleashed, genocidal, exterminationist violence, Nazi tactics in  pursuit of Nazi aims. Entire Israeli families were murdered in door-to- door horrors. Israeli babies were brutally slaughtered, burned, and  decapitated. Women and young girls were systematically raped.   In some homes, children were shot right in front of their parents. In  other homes, parents were shot right in front of their children, and  then the children were kidnapped--husbands and wives murdered in front  of each other, holocaust survivors massacred. In one home, Israelis  found the burned remains of an adult and a child who died hugging each  other in terror as they were murdered. They were burned to death,  clutching each other in their home. And throughout these atrocities,  Hamas terrorists gleefully filmed themselves in ecstatic joy. There are  harrowing videos of Israeli babies and toddlers in the hands of Hamas  terrorists after they were kidnapped.   Why were these crimes committed? Because the victims were Jews in  Israel, because Hamas and the Iranian regime--which arms, funds, and  controls Hamas--because both are committed to the eradication of Jews.  It was the biggest mass murder of the Jewish people in a single day  since the Holocaust.   At the Supernova music festival--which was billed as a celebration of  friends, love, and infinite freedom--young Israelis were dancing when  Hamas assassins paraglided in, raining terror from the skies. They shot  at defenseless Israelis, murdering 260 of them. They systematically  raped survivors. They shot those who were too brutalized to be moved,  and they kidnapped others.    At kibbutz Be'eri, 120 people were murdered. Hamas terrorists  infiltrated the kibbutz from several directions, and they went home by  home murdering people.   One of the victims was Tom Hand's 8-year-old daughter Emily, who was  at a sleepover with her friends. Tom is a single father. His wife,  Emily's mom, had passed away earlier from cancer. On that Saturday  morning when Hamas invaded the kibbutz, Tom, thankfully, was able to  get out alive. Emily was murdered.   In another kibbutz, 16-year-old Rotem Matias was with his parents  Deborah and Shlomi when Hamas terrorists came into their home. The  terrorists shot Shlomi in the arm, blowing his arm off. Deborah,  heroically, shielded Rotem with her body to save him. Both of Rotem's  parents were murdered.   At kibbutz Nir Oz, Yarden and Shiri Bibas, along with their 3-year- old son and their 9-month-old son, were all hiding in their home when  Hamas terrorists entered. They took Shiri and her sons, and they  kidnapped them. No one has heard from Yarden. Shiri and her sons are  now hostages in Gaza as well as Shiri's parents.   These were all by design. We know from documents discovered on  terrorists' bodies that their goals were to ``kill as many as  possible'' and ``capture hostages.'' We know they sought out  specifically children, and they went specifically to children's rooms.   In the face of this evil, Israel must and Israel will defend herself.   America's policy should be absolutely unequivocal: to ensure that  Israel has the military and the diplomatic support to utterly eradicate  Hamas, for as long as it takes.   I want to repeat that last part: for as long as it takes.   I give you my word that I will do everything in my power and ability  and use every resource at my disposal to ensure that that is indeed  America's policy.   So what do we do immediately? We know what Israel needs in the short  term. Our Israeli allies need air defenses, and they need weapons. We  must make sure together that they get them.   If we can get those things from prepositioned weapons we keep on  their soil, the war reserve stock, that is where they will get them  from. If it needs to be shipped to them, we will ship it to them. And  if the President needs more authorization or more money, Congress must  find a way to give it to him.   Over the last week, we have heard objections from various parts of  Capitol Hill about arming Israel. There have instead been calls for  withholding support and pressuring Israel into an immediate ceasefire.  These people draw a moral equivalency between our Israeli allies and  these Hamas terrorists.   This is a battle between good and evil. Anyone who draws a moral  equivalency between Hamas and Israel is shamefully lying.   This is an existential fight for Israel. As Golda Meir once said,  ``If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more  violence. If the Jews put down their weapons, there would be no more  Israel.''   That is as true today as it was when she said it.   Hamas uses human shields as standard practice. Israel does everything  it can to minimize civilian casualties. They are polar opposites.   The Israeli Government asks innocent civilians to get out of harm's  way. They go so far as to send texts to Palestinians warning them to  evacuate. They do things like if they are going to bomb a building  where they know Hamas rockets are stored or they have terrorists  hiding, they will send a text to every person in that building and even  drop a dud bomb on top of the building that lands with a thud that  doesn't explode--designed to warn the civilians to evacuate the  building because the next bomb to take out the weapons or take out the  terrorists is going to explode. And then, no doubt, they will level the  building because they are trying to get rid of murderers. No other  military on Earth goes to such extraordinary lengths to avoid civilian  casualties. And there is no moral equivalency here--zero--between  Israeli soldiers protecting civilians and Hamas monsters targeting  babies. Much more needs to be done and can be done to counter the use  of human shields by Hamas and other Iran-controlled terrorist  organizations.   In 2014, I was proud to author a resolution in the Senate,  cosponsored by Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York,  condemning the use of human shields by Hamas as a war crime. That  bipartisan resolution passed the Senate 100 to nothing.   Later, in 2019, I wrote and passed language that imposes sanctions on  Hamas, on Hezbollah, on any other terrorist group that uses human  shields. Now, that was a much tougher fight because sanctions always  are, but by working in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion, we passed  that law as well. Since 2019, there are new groups that are using human  shields that need to be added, especially the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, and the law itself needs to be extended and strengthened. I  intend to work in a bipartisan way to do exactly that in this Congress.    Unequivocal support from the United States is critical. We are  already seeing pressure from across the world and from far too many  places here in Washington for our Israeli allies to stand  [[Page S5081]]  down. It is, unfortunately, well known--predictable--that as soon as  Israel begins to defend itself from terrorists, from the very  beginning, a clock starts ticking until pressure on them to stand down  becomes immense. It is a surreal, disquieting, and shameful spectacle.  This time, the calls for Israel to stand down began while Hamas  terrorists were still on Israeli territory as the attack was ongoing.   And I am saddened to say, they came, among other places, from within  the Biden administration itself.   As the Hamas invasion was becoming horrifically public, as the first  reports of atrocities were being published, here is what the Biden  State Department tweeted out:         We unequivocally condemn the attack of Hamas terrorists and       the loss of life that has incurred. We urge all sides to       refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks. Terror and       violence solve nothing.    Now, to be clear, that was a message to the Israelis from the U.S.  Department of State: Refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks.  Terror and violence solve nothing, so do nothing against the terrorists  who were then murdering over 1,000 Israelis. That was from the U.S.  Office of Palestinian Affairs of the U.S. State Department.   They sent this tweet out at 3 a.m., DC time, literally as these  murders, as these rapes, as these brutal assaults were happening. I  caught it within about an hour, and it was obvious what they were  trying to do. So I made it clear what I intended to do, and I publicly  responded to that tweet by saying:         This is disgraceful, and every . . . person involved in       drafting and approving this tweet should be immediately       expelled from the U.S. government.    So their first instinct was to tell Israel: Your country is being  invaded, terrorists are murdering your civilians, your citizens are  being kidnapped, infants and children are being murdered, and the  position of the U.S. State Department is, Israel, please do nothing. Do  not engage in retaliatory strikes. Just sit there and allow the  terrorists to murder your citizens.   Within the hour, the State Department deleted their tweet. Later that  day, they apologized. They said the tweet was unauthorized, and it  didn't reflect their policy--except they weren't done.   A few hours later, the Twitter account of the Secretary of State  Antony Blinken posted a note saying the Secretary of State was  encouraging an immediate ceasefire. Understand the word ``ceasefire''  is not directed at the terrorists; it is directed at Israel. They are  saying: Israel, do not defend yourself. Do not kill the Hamas  terrorists.   I, likewise, denounced that tweet, and for the second time in 24  hours the Department of State had to delete yet another tweet. That is  in the first day that this attack proceeded.   This is not a time for partisan disagreements. We should be standing  together with Israel. And I will be the first to admit that much of  what President Biden has said himself since then has been welcome. His  first major speech on this crisis was very strong in parts.   The problem is that this administration--this White House, this  Department of State--is filled with passionate opponents of Israel, and  every time President Biden has spoken in support of Israel, he has been  undercut by staffers before and after.   The President just traveled to Israel yesterday in what was an  unprecedented trip. I am glad the President went to Israel. That was a  strong statement for him to be physically there on the ground during  this war. But on the way there, literally on the plane, a White House  spokesperson said the purpose of the trip was to have the President ask  the Israelis ``tough questions.'' Even on the night before his speech  last week, Biden's Deputy National Security Advisor had gone on MSNBC  and warned the Israelis that ``[i]t is our advice that this war be  conducted based on the principles of international law.''   (Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)   Madam President, what does that mean?   Has Israel ever not fought its wars based on the principles of  international law? Why is that something they are publicly lecturing  Israel on? And even if it did come up in discussions with Israel, why  lecture them publicly?   I remember well September 11, the horror of the greatest attack on  the United States in American history. And I don't recall any American  ally publicly lecturing America: Follow international law. I don't  recall any foreign heads of state traveling here to ask us the tough  questions: Are you going to dare retaliate against the terrorists?  Instead, our friends said: We stand with you. Period.   After President Biden's speech at the White House, the White House  officials stated:         We support Israel taking necessary and proportionate       action.    Understand that word ``proportionate.'' You are going to hear it  again. You are going to hear again from the enemies of Israel who are  already preparing to attack and undermine each and every step Israel  takes to eradicate the Hamas terrorists. They are going to say: It is  not proportionate.   What is a proportionate response to the beheading of babies? What is  a proportionate response to the systematic murder of entire families?  For that matter, what is a proportionate response to a genocidal  campaign?   The Biden administration's ideological, partisan reaction day after  day to all of this is tragic. They see these terrorist attacks, and  their immediate reaction is: I hope Israel doesn't respond by killing  the terrorists too much.   Why? Well, because I think at least some in the Biden administration  feel a need to appeal to the radical leftwing base, which includes BLM,  which includes the Democratic Socialists of America, which includes the  anti-Semitic Squad in the House, as well as the woke university  students at Harvard and other so-called elite universities.   At Harvard, 35 student groups, in the aftermath of Hamas's attack,  blamed Israel. These organizations and these elite universities, sadly,  have become venomous pits of anti-Semitism and hatred for Israel. The  35 student groups at Harvard put out a joint statement by the Harvard  Palestinian Solidarity Group, and I want the American people to know  what they said.   They said:         We the undersigned student organizations hold the Israeli       regime entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence.    That is the opening sentence of their statement. They believe it is  Israel's fault that Hamas terrorists are raping women and young girls  in the street. They believe it is Israel's fault that Hamas is  mutilating babies and kidnapping them and holding them hostage. They  believe it is Israel's fault that Hamas is using toddlers as human  shields. They believe it is Israel's fault that Hamas is targeting and  murdering civilians, indiscriminately going house by house by house.  That sentiment is sick and twisted and wrong.   Now, I also worry that, in addition to the knee-jerk, partisan,  ideological reaction, the Biden administration also has a very real  interest in dampening Israel's response, because every day that the war  goes on, people will ask: Where does Hamas get the resources to keep  fighting?   The answer is obvious. This massacre--this horrific assault on  Israel--was funded by Iran. Hamas and Hezbollah are both Iranian  proxies. They work for Iran; they work under the direction of Iran; and  they are funded by Iran. Without Iran, there would be no Hamas.   When it was first reported that these attacks had been planned or  signed off on by the Iranian Government, the usual Iran echo chamber  went to work defending the regime. They said there was no evidence. The  administration and an awful lot of congressional Democrats said they  weren't sure either. But do you know what no one denies? Do you know  what makes these denials so strange? No one denies that Hamas is armed  and funded and directed by Iran.   The game these people are playing is, they say: Well, we can't be  sure. We don't have video evidence. We don't have an audio recording of  the Ayatollah looking at a map and telling Hamas where to breach the  border fence. So we can't be sure. We have to look into it more.   What utter nonsense.   Why are they so defensive? Well, because, since President Biden took  office, this White House has been responsible for nearly $100 billion  flowing to  [[Page S5082]]  Iran, and much of that money has gone directly to Hamas and directly to  Hezbollah.   You know, now everyone acknowledges the $6 billion in ransom money  that Joe Biden paid to get five Americans out of Iranian custody. I am  glad that now Democrats have joined what I and many others said was a  tragic mistake that put a bounty on Americans. It set a price: $1.2  billion is what the Biden administration will pay you if you kidnap  Americans. At the time, I said more Americans will be kidnapped, and  Iran will kidnap more Americans. I am very sorry to say that prediction  came true in just a matter of weeks.   My Democratic colleagues would not stand with us to cut off that $6  billion when it was paid initially. Now we have Democrats willing to do  so. That is a step in the right direction. But understand the $6  billion is only the tip of the iceberg. It is only a tiny portion of  the money that this administration, the Biden administration, has  flooded Iran with.   A few weeks before the $6 billion deal, Biden made available $10  billion related to electricity that Iraq bought from Iran, and both of  those--the $16 billion--pales in comparison to the tens of billions of  dollars--as much as $80 billion--that Iran has made from illicit oil  sales under Biden. Understand, when Joe Biden came into office, the  Iranian regime was on its knees. The economy was in shambles. Why?  Because the Ayatollah gets its principal revenue from selling oil.   When Donald Trump was President, I spent much of the Presidency  urging President Trump to vigorously enforce the oil sanctions, to  cripple their oil sales. Iran had been selling a million barrels a day  of oil. President Trump agreed with me and vigorously enforced the  sanctions. Those oil sales were crushed, and the Iranian economy  collapsed. That is what President Biden inherited--an Iran in shambles  economically.   And what did the Biden administration do immediately? It ceased  enforcing oil sanctions. It said, in effect: Sell all of the oil you  can. And do you know what? The Ayatollah heard him, because, right now,  Iran is selling 2 million barrels a day of oil--the same level they  were selling before the sanctions ever passed, more than double what  they had been selling before the vigorous enforcement of the oil  sanctions under President Trump.    Why is it that so many Democratic politicians hate oil and gas  production in the United States and are willing to kill jobs here at  home, but when it comes to theocratic, homicidal, genocidal maniacs,  they are perfectly happy with letting them reap $80 billion by selling  2 million barrels a day of oil primarily to communist China? That is  madness.   So let me say, I am glad the President gives speeches saying: We are  standing with Israel. That is great, but actions speak louder than  words. If the President wants to stand with Israel, stand up tomorrow  and say: We are vigorously enforcing oil sanctions, and we are going to  end these oil sales.   To the Democrats in this body who are giving speeches saying we stand  with Israel, great. Then join me in saying: We are going to take away  the billions of dollars that are flooding into Iran; that are funding  Hamas; that are funding the death squads; that are funding the rockets;  that are funding the murders of Israelis.   But it wasn't just money to Iran that went to Hamas. The Biden  administration also poured money into Hamas areas directly. As soon as  they came into office, the Biden administration began flooding money  into the Gaza Strip. At the time, I led a coalition of 19 Senators in  urging the Biden administration: Do not send money to Gaza. Why?  Because Hamas controls Gaza, and if you send hundreds of millions of  dollars to Gaza, Hamas will use it to commit acts of terrorism against  Israelis and Americans.   At the same time that 19 of us urged the administration ``don't fund  Gaza because it will fund Hamas terrorism,'' 145 House Democrats sent a  letter to the Biden administration, saying: Do fund Gaza even though it  will fund Hamas terrorism.   And what did the Biden administration do with these dueling letters  from Congress? We now know because the internal government documents of  the Biden administration are now public; and the Biden Treasury  Department determined there was a ``high risk'' that Hamas would  potentially derive benefit from the money they were sending.   Now, ordinarily, that would end the matter because, in their existing  U.S. anti-terrorism sanctions, the laws say, if you know there is a  high risk it is going to terrorism, you can't send money to do it. Did  the Biden administration take that step? No. Instead, they exempted  themselves from American laws against funding terrorism. They wanted,  as a political matter, to send the cash so much that they were willing  to look the other way to, in their own words, the ``high risk'' that  that money would go to Hamas to carry out acts of terrorism.   Here is the full quote from the Biden administration document:         Due to its overall strength and level of control over Gaza,       we assess there is a high risk that Hamas could potentially       derive indirect, unintentional benefit from U.S. assistance       to Gaza.    These atrocities in Israel were the direct result of political  decisions made by the White House to dismantle pressure and to pour  money into Iran and into territories controlled by Iranian terrorists.  When you send billions of dollars to people who hate us and want to  murder us, we should not be surprised when they use those billions of  dollars to murder us.   Not to support Israel in this time of need--not to support them fully  for as long as it takes--would be a grave moral failure. This fight is  civilization against barbarism. It is good versus evil. The differences  between the two sides are as stark as light and darkness. The light and  goodness, I believe, will prevail if we stand with Israel.   I want to say something also.   In the last 2 weeks, I have spoken with many of my friends, in  particular, many of my Jewish friends. It has been astonishing the  number of my Jewish friends in Texas and all across America who have  family members or who have close friends in Israel. It has been truly  breathtaking the number of American Jews I know well who either lost a  loved one in these terrorist attacks or who have relatives or close  friends who have been called up to the IDF, who are facing the most  significant war in Israel in the last 50 years.   I have spent much of the last 2 weeks reaching out to those friends  and just telling them: Heidi and I are praying for you. We are lifting  you up. We are lifting your family up. We are lifting the people of  Israel up, encouraging them. This has been a frightening time for every  Israeli and for a great many Americans.   I hope that, in the face of evil, we see the same solidarity we saw  in the wake of September 11. Just as the world rallied to our side when  radical Islamic terrorists committed a grotesque act of terror against  the United States, now is the time for the world to rally to Israel's  side, and now is the time for this body to come together.   There have been policy differences in the past, with some Members of  this body and leaders of this administration believing that it is a  good idea to send tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to Iran.  That policy has been proven catastrophically wrong.   So I hope that we come together and that we stand as one, united, to  tell the people of Israel: America stands with Israel for as long as it  takes.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
