 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment in en bloc  No. 5.   My amendment prohibits funds made available by this act to be used to  promulgate, implement, administer, or enforce President Biden's radical  abortion executive order number 14076.   In this executive order, the Biden administration chose to focus its  attention on protecting the abortion industry at the expense of women  and their unborn children. This is totally unacceptable.   This executive order is also ruled by executive fiat, and my  amendment rightfully defunds it. The executive order is also a great  example of disinformation. The Biden administration tried to create the  Disinformation Governance Board, and it didn't do so well. Now we have  it in an executive order--disinformation.   Let me be very clear. Miscarriage management and the treatment of  ectopic pregnancies are not abortions. The Biden administration's  executive order simply creates fear and confusion by spreading this  misinformation.   Finally, nothing in the Constitution grants the Federal Government  the authority to expand access to abortion. This is a State's rights  issue and must be resolved at the State level.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment to  defund this Biden executive order promoting abortion.    Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago, I introduced my landmark  legislation, the RETURN our Constitutional Rights Act, which eliminates  the Federal excise tax on firearms and ammunition because no American  should be taxed on their enumerated constitutional rights.   Since this unconstitutional tax funds Pittman-Robertson conservation  programs, my legislation replaces this revenue stream with a more  stable source of funding by redirecting unallocated lease revenue  generated by onshore and offshore energy development on Federal lands.  Replacing this revenue is crucial to ensure Pittman-Robertson programs  stay alive and well.   While the firearm tax revenue fluctuates annually based on firearms  sales, it is also subject to the left's radical gun control agenda. You  see, if we allow anti-Second Amendment lawmakers to achieve their  dangerous dream of an unarmed America, there will be no firearms sold,  so Pittman-Robertson funding will cease to exist, threatening wildlife  conservation programs.   Therefore, the RETURN Act accomplishes both protecting Americans'  Second Amendment rights and preserving Pittman-Robertson programs. We  can and must do both.                            ____________________
