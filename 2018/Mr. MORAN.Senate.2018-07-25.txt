 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3433.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, before I make remarks on this amendment, I  express my gratitude to my colleagues from New Mexico, to Senator Reed,  who is the ranking member, and to Senator Collins, the chair of the  appropriate Appropriations subcommittee, for working so closely with me  and my colleagues in regard to rail service, the Southwest Chief, from  Chicago to Los Angeles, which transports people through Kansas and  through Colorado and through New Mexico. We have had a bipartisan  effort from the Senators of those three States to make certain that  service continues into the future. I am very grateful for their  support.   I ask my colleagues, the other Senators, to support the Moran-Udall  amendment.                              Amendment No. 3433    Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support my amendment  to force the USDA to continue honoring its existing agreement between  grain handling facilities and official inspection services.  [[Page S5340]]    Following the passage of legislation to reauthorize the U.S. Grain  Standards Act, the Department of Agriculture amended its regulations  and changed the treatment of grain facilities using inspection services  located outside their defined, designated geographic areas.   The USDA's decision to alter the way it had been doing business has  disrupted existing agreements and longstanding working relationships  between grain handlers and grain inspectors. Also, the change has  decreased the efficiency of inspections and reduced grain elevator  operators' flexibility to coordinate with inspection services.   This amendment would not allow the USDA to revoke any additional  agreements that are currently in place. To be clear, these grain  elevators are still using USDA-sanctioned, official inspection  agencies. The inspection agencies in question have agreed to perform  inspections outside of the designated geographic areas.   The question we will soon be voting on is whether USDA ought to honor  those exceptions already made to grain facilities and their inspectors.  This is a commonsense amendment to make certain USDA does so--honors  its commitments--and that grain facilities are afforded the best  possible service from the Department of Agriculture.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. President, I want to speak this evening for a few  moments about trade and tariffs. They certainly have been in the news  for a long time. They are in the news today. I want to highlight the  importance of trade and exports to Kansas, my constituents, and express  my concerns about tariffs and an escalating trade war.   A global trade war will raise the price of goods for American  consumers; result in retaliation against farmers, ranchers, and  manufacturers who depend upon exports; and weaken our ability to work  with our allies to challenge China's unfair trade practices.   Kansans are already feeling the effects of tariffs. Approximately  $361 million worth of Kansas exports are being targeted by the emerging  trade war, including soybeans and sorghum exports to China, aerospace  exports to Canada, and beef and corn exports to Mexico. Moving forward  with another $200 billion to $500 billion in tariffs against China or  new section 232 tariffs on automobiles for supposed national security  concerns will only increase the negative impact upon my folks at home.   With 95 percent of consumers living outside our country's border, the  ability for Kansas farmers and rancher to earn a living is directly  tied to our ability to sell food, fuel, and fiber. The food, fuel, and  fiber we grow in Kansas must be exported to people around the world.   Since March, uncertainty in trade has contributed to the price of  soybeans falling by $2 a bushel. A $2 drop in soybean prices equates to  Kansas farmers and grain handlers losing out about $378 million of  possible revenue solely on soybeans--one crop.   The significant harm the trade war is causing to farmers and ranchers  is no doubt the reason the administration is proposing $12 billion in  disaster relief for agriculture. Unfortunately, it is only a short-term  fix to a long-term problem and will not make up for the lost markets  for farmers.   China and Mexico, two of our largest markets in Kansas for  agriculture producers--Mexico is No. 1, and China is No. 2--have  already started to increase purchases of ag commodities from Brazil and  Argentina instead of from U.S. producers, including those in Kansas. I  am concerned that once we lose those markets, it will take years, if  ever, for us to regain those markets.   This hit could not come at a worse time for ag producers. Farm  revenue has already fallen by over 50 percent since 2013. Low commodity  prices have pushed many producers to limits of financial viability.   I wrote an op-ed this spring arguing that Kansas farmers and ranchers  can't afford a trade war. With fall harvest around the corner, many  farmers will be faced with the reality of selling grain at or below the  cost of production just to be able to pay off this year's operating  loans.   The impact of the downturn in the ag economy cannot be solely  quantified on a balance sheet. I am concerned that reduced economic  opportunity in agriculture will result in fewer young people returning  to rural America. One of my goals is to see that the sons and daughters  of farmers and ranchers in Kansas have the opportunity to continue  another generation of agriculture production in our State. When they  cannot reach a price that is profitable, when they cannot obtain a  price that is profitable, the likelihood of those young men and women  remaining or returning to Kansas farms and ranches disappears because  when agricultural struggles, so do our rural communities.   As the average age of a farmer nears 60 years old, it is critical  that our policies increase the likelihood that a  [[Page S5356]]  young person is able to return to take over the family farm or ranch. I  fear the trade war and tariffs will unfortunately have the opposite  effect. Fewer markets to sell meat and grain will make it more  difficult for the next generation to earn a living in rural America.   If farmers in Kansas are not producing a crop and selling it, then it  means their communities also suffer. The ability to keep a grocery  store in town or a grain elevator or a hardware store is diminished  when farm income is as it is today.    It is not just an agricultural issue. In fact, Kansas manufacturers  are also dealing with the negative impact of recently imposed tariffs.   Users of steel and aluminum are frequent in Kansas. Ours is an  automobile and aviation manufacturing State, and they are facing  increased costs of materials, regardless of whether they utilize  domestic or imported steel and aluminum.   Chanute Manufacturing in Chanute, KS, is an example of the steel and  aluminum tariffs harming a small company and its workers. The company,  which employs about 130 Kansans, is a domestic manufacturer of steel- based components for the power generation market. Due to tariffs,  Chanute's cost for raw materials has increased by about 8 percent.   However, when the same powerplant equipment is manufactured overseas,  it can be imported here tariff-free. The actual unintended consequence  of the steel tariff has been to incentivize foreign manufacturing of  power equipment currently made in my home State.   Chanute Manufacturing has also missed opportunities to compete on  projects in other countries due to the tariffs. Last year, the company  built and shipped equipment they manufactured in Kansas to Morocco.  However, when a duplicate project came available in Morocco again this  year, Chanute wasn't even considered because the steel tariffs have  raised their production costs, making them less competitive than  cheaper foreign manufacturers.   China is important. The President is right to try to change the  behavior of China. Tariffs are not the only tool to make certain that  other countries follow international trade rules and treat American  exporters and workers fairly.   I support efforts to hold China accountable for unfair trade  practices and the theft of trade secrets and intellectual property  rights from American companies. I applauded the United States for  filing a challenge to China's domestic agricultural support levels at  the World Trade Organization. When China unfairly subsidizes its  producers or limits market access to U.S. wheat, corn, and rice, the  United States is right to contest them and to contest them strongly and  firmly. While I remain unconvinced that tariffs are the best tool to  change China's behavior, it does not mean we should not pursue strong  enforcement of global trade rules.   I am also concerned that picking a fight on trade with the rest of  the world reduces our ability to win the fight with China, the country  that is most deserving of strong trade actions by the United States. By  attempting to take the whole world on at once, the United States risks  spreading our resources thin and reducing our focus on changing China's  practices.   The United States is not the only country with complaints about  China's trade practices. Yet, instead of working with our allies to  influence China and change their behavior, we have forced  confrontations with other countries that ought to be by our side in  dealing with China.   I believe that by strengthening our trade and economic relations with  our allies, the United States will be better able to continue directing  sound trade policies on the global stage. This includes successfully  concluding a NAFTA renegotiation with Canada and Mexico and reengaging  in the Trans-Pacific Partnership--TPP--negotiations or pursuing  bilateral agreements with countries in the TPP, such as Japan.   This week, in fact tomorrow, Ambassador Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade  Representative, will be testifying before the Appropriations  subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and  Science. That subcommittee oversees the funding for the Office of the  U.S. Trade Representative. The hearing will be an opportunity for the  subcommittee members to hear firsthand from Ambassador Lighthizer on  USTR's trade efforts and to express concerns about the impact the  tariffs have had and will continue to have on our constituents. I hope  to learn more about the USTR strategy and the end goal in threatening  more tariffs, progress to conclusion of NAFTA negotiations, and efforts  to fill the President's call for a new bilateral trade agreement.   Again, recently imposed tariffs are having immediate impacts upon  farmers and ranchers and manufacturers, but the long-term implications  of disrupting supply chains and losing market share that took decades  to build up is perhaps even more concerning. It is time to inject more  certainty into our trade policies. We ought to start by reaching an  agreement on a modernized NAFTA and ending the threat of an escalating  trade war.   I look forward to conversations with Ambassador Lighthizer this week  and making certain that the administration understands the importance  of getting trade policy right for Kansas and for America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
