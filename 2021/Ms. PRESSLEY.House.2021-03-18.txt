 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the tragic events of this week underscore both our  responsibility and the urgency we must move to legislate our values and  to stand on the side of justice.   I represent Massachusetts Seventh, a district which is 40 percent  immigrants. I rise today in solidarity with them.   H.R. 6 is a critical step towards citizenship for Dreamers, TPS, and  DED holders. However, the criminal bar provisions added to this bill  further entangles our racist criminal legal system in the citizenship  process.   I thank Congressman Garcia and partners for leading the fight to  eliminate this language. There is more work to be done, but this bill  moves us in the right direction of a more just America, one which  values the lives of immigrants and not just their labor.
