 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to  take a moment to talk about how we got to this point and why I am  hopeful that, despite the Republican leader's decision to once again  scuttle bipartisan negotiations on health stabilization, we can return  to the table and work together to do what patients and families want;  that is, to strengthen healthcare and lower the premiums next year.   Chairman Alexander had said that in September every Democrat in the  Senate was ready to pass the original Alexander-Murray legislation, and  he is right. We wanted to work with Republicans to undo as much of  President Trump's healthcare sabotage as possible because of how it is  hurting families and forcing them to pay more for care. Unfortunately,  Senator McConnell blocked our bipartisan agreement because he wanted to  pressure his caucus into supporting yet another harmful Republican  repeal bill. That TrumpCare bill failed, and I was again hopeful that  after it did, we could make progress on our bipartisan legislation.  Instead, Senate Republican leaders opted to do the exact opposite. They  jammed through a terrible tax bill that actually raises families'  premiums to pay for tax cuts for massive corporations. Even after that,  I and Democrats were still at the table and ready to do what we could  to stabilize markets and lower families' healthcare costs.   Imagine my frustration when, at the very last minute--just days ago-- Republicans leaders once again made clear that they didn't want to  lower families' premiums. They didn't want to stabilize a healthcare  system that, as one House Republican said, they never supported anyway.  Senate Republicans opted, instead, to surprise Democrats with a new,  last-minute partisan proposal, the so-called stabilization bill, which  included poison pills that Republicans knew Democrats would never agree  to.   The partisan bill that Republicans surprised us with would undermine  access to care for people with preexisting conditions by writing  President Trump's junk plans rule into law and by taking away  protections included in our original agreement with Chairman Alexander  to make sure that the sickest patients don't find themselves in a  dramatically more expensive market.    This partisan bill also pulled the most worn page out of the  Republicans' ideological playbook--making extreme, political attacks on  women's healthcare. This partisan bill would take huge steps beyond  current law, making it so women can't even buy abortion coverage using  their own money.   From the start of negotiations last fall, I made it abundantly clear  I will not allow women's reproductive freedoms to become a political  football in these conversations. I also made clear that I understood,  like it or not, that current prohibitions on taxpayer funding for  abortion services would apply to our agreement. But that is not what  this is--not at all.   I think that was made pretty clear when Republicans surprised us with  this last-minute change in a press release without inviting any  Democrats to join. I believe, and I think most people would agree, that  the massive expansion of restrictions on women's access to safe, legal  abortion we see in this partisan bill has nothing to do with lowering  families' premiums or making healthcare work better in our country.  That is not something that was in our original deal that had bipartisan  support, and it is not something that should be in this bill now.   I am extremely disappointed that we have reached this point, but it  does not mean I am giving up on getting this done. I know many  Republicans have said that this is the end of the road for bipartisan  negotiations on healthcare, but it is only if they choose that route.  [[Page S1919]]    Today I am laying out what I hope Republicans and Democrats will  ultimately be able to agree on. This is legislation that includes  current law prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion--what Senate  Democrats and Republicans agreed was acceptable months ago. It would  take strong steps to lower premiums and make healthcare more affordable  for patients. It would hold protections for people with preexisting  conditions, as so many Republicans and Democrats have said we need to  do.   We are frustratingly close to an agreement, and I still do believe we  can get there. This shouldn't be about the blame game. It should not be  about pointing fingers. This has to be about getting results.   I hope Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting the  amendment I am offering today, and even if they don't, I hope we can  get back to the table and resume talks. I truly believe there are  Republicans who want to do the right thing for patients and families,  even if their leadership is determined to avoid a real debate and vote  on the so-called ObamaCare bailout. Our work last fall showed that we  can reach an agreement when we put aside partisan politics and focus on  what is best for our families. I am ready to get back to work to get  that done.   I object to the pending unanimous consent request.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1625    I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to the  consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 1625, the omnibus  appropriations bill, the Murray amendment that is now at the desk be  considered and agreed to.    Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, the chairman  of our committee, the Senator from Tennessee, through the Chair, that I  greatly respect the rapport I have with him, the working ability we  have shown time and again through issues like Cures and ESSA and all  the bills we have worked on and will continue to work on. I have that  respect and admiration for him, and I want him to know I will continue  to do that because I believe in legislating, and I know he does as  well. I share that respect.   To the Senator from Maine, through the Chair, I would also say I have  a lot  [[Page S1922]]  of respect for the Senator from Maine and her passions and her goals on  this as well. I say to both of them, this is an issue I care about  deeply. I would not have sat down with any one of them to work on a  bipartisan solution to the dilemma we found ourselves in throughout the  last year as repeated decisions were made that undermine the security  of people in terms of their ability to afford quality healthcare and a  marketplace that was increasingly seeing uncertainty. I believe in  those goals, and I know they do as well.   I remain committed to getting this done. I agree timing is  everything, and we have been working on this since September. I regret  the actions that were taken that we were not able to put this forward  in September or December, and we are here now at this point.   I will state, as to the language that has been added, obviously and  clearly, there is a real divide on how it is read, how it is  interpreted, and how it could be applicable. That is our objection. I  say to my colleague, my chairman, through the Chair as well, that we  had offered him language on Friday that did indeed deal with the Hyde  amendment. No one here said we cannot have that, but we have language  that exceeds, in my opinion--I know that is not shared on the other  side--but in my opinion extends well beyond into the private  marketplace, where I think there is a line the people would not  support, and I certainly can't myself.   In addition to the other language dealing with people's ability to  protect their preexisting conditions, we clearly have a divide on how  that is interpreted, but that does not preclude our ability, if we  agree on the goal of stabilizing the marketplace and ensuring that we  can do the CSR payments, that we can do the reinsurance program the  Senator from Maine has championed, and rightfully so--and I hope we can  all agree that moving on from here, we would return to that bipartisan  proposal, not partisan proposals, and move to get this done.   I thank the Chair.   I yield the floor.
