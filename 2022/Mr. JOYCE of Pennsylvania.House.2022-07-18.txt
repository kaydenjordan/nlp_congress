 Madam Speaker, as temperatures rise, our  energy grid has been left unprepared to keep up with the power demands  to keep up with this intense summer heat.   Instead of investing in the coal, natural gas, and Marcellus shale  that is under the feet of my constituents in Pennsylvania, President  Biden has turned his back on my communities in  [[Page H6684]]  order to enact Green New Deal policies that fail to meet our energy  needs, fail to meet the needs that, right now, in the heat of July, are  expanding.   It has become abundantly clear that solar panels and windmills cannot  produce the power needed to keep the lights on and keep the air- conditioners humming.   This failed pivot to radical energy policies that could lead to  rolling blackouts and has led to skyrocketing electric bills across the  country needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed right now.   It is time for the Biden administration to protect our energy grid,  and it is time to ensure that we are using the resources that we have  right here at home to serve the American people. It is not time to turn  to OPEC for additional support when we have the resources right here in  America. It is time that we come together and serve the American people  with the resources that are right here in America.                            ____________________
