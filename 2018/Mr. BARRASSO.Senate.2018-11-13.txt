 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Kay  Bjorklund, Wyoming AARP's 2018 Andrus Award honoree.   Since 2001, the Wyoming chapter of AARP continues to make a positive  difference in the lives of senior citizens  [[Page S6912]]  and their communities, serving out their vision of ``a society in which  all people live with dignity and purpose, and fulfill their goals and  dreams.'' The Andrus Award, named after AARP founder Dr. Ethel Percy  Andrus, is awarded each year to one person or couple in every State.  This award recognizes outstanding individuals who share their  experience, talents, and skills to enrich the lives of others.   On November 8, 2018, the AARP of Wyoming hosted its Annual Volunteer  Recognition Banquet in Casper, honoring Kay Bjorklund of Thermopolis.  Kay is an ideal choice for this award. She dedicates her life to  serving her family, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens of  Thermopolis and Hot Springs County.   Kay grew up in Newcastle, WY, where she met her husband, Guy  Bjorklund. Before they could marry, Guy left to serve our country in  WWII as a U.S. marine. Kay eagerly waited for Guy's return. Once Guy  was home, the two moved to Billings, MT, to marry and start a family.  Guy began a career at JC Penney, and in 1955, a company transfer took  the family to Thermopolis. Kay had the demanding job of full-time  mother to their three children. Gary and Kay were active members of the  Community Church where Kay continues to serve on the visitation  committee.   Once her children started school, Kay worked in banking and became  more involved in service to others. Kay raised her family with the  strong principal of giving back to the community. Through her own  example, she taught her family to put others first, to ask what they  might do to help their friends and neighbors.   Guy continued to work for JC Penney until he was presented with the  opportunity to open the Thermopolis Hardware store. Guy and Kay  successfully ran the store until retirement in 1986. They sold  Thermopolis Hardware to their daughter and son-in-law, Karen and Dennis  Sinclair, who continue to run the business today. Retirement in 1986  allowed Guy and Kay to do what they enjoyed doing together: serving  others.   Kay will tell you how important it is to stay active if you want to  be healthy and happy. Taking her own advice to heart, Kay is an active  member of the Kiwanis club and chamber of commerce. Every Wednesday,  she volunteers at the hospital gift shop. Kay turns 95 next month and  drives for Meals on Wheels, delivering dozens of meals and hugs to  community seniors. Kay volunteers at the Pioneer Home, an assisted  living facility and also plays bridge. She is the highest selling  fundraiser for the PEO chapter in Thermopolis.   Kay Bjorklund truly represents the Wyoming values of generosity and  selflessness. She is a devoted volunteer, loving mother, and generous  friend to all. Kay and her late husband, Guy, have three children, Gary  and his wife Dorothy Bjorklund, Karen and her husband Dennis Sinclair,  and Eric and his wife Terrie Bjorklund, along with eight grandchildren  and 13 great-grandchildren. Thermopolis is blessed to have this amazing  woman and her family call Hot Springs County home.   It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional Wyoming  lady. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratulations to Kay  Bjorklund for receiving this special award from the AARP of Wyoming.                            ____________________
