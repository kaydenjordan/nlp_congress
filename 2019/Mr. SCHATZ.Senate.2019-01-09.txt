 Mr. President, today, we remember the 400 American and  Allied prisoners of war who died 74 years ago from friendly fire aboard  the Japanese hell ship Enoura Maru docked in Takeo Harbor, Formosa-- modern-day Taiwan.   Among the dead were men who left their homes in America, Australia,  Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Czechoslovakia to  fight an enemy they did not know, in places few of them had heard of,  all in pursuit of a common cause: freedom, justice, and equality. These  heroes were part of the infamous 45-day odyssey of the last transport  of prisoners of war from the Philippines to Japan--captive since the  American territory fell to Imperial Japan in the spring of 1942 after  fighting to defend the Philippines.   On the morning of January 9, 1945, dive bombers from the USS Hornet  attacked the unmarked freighter holding 1,300 prisoners of war docked  in the Japanese colony's harbor. Two hundred died instantly. Nearly  everyone else was wounded. For 2 days, the men were left in the  floating wreckage before the Japanese permitted the dead to be removed.  Their remains were buried ashore in mass graves.   After the war, the 400 victims of the bombing of the Enoura Maru were  exhumed and eventually brought to the National Memorial Cemetery of the  Pacific in Hawaii. They rest in 20 mass graves marked only as  ``Unknowns January 9, 1945.'' Their families did not learn the final  fate of their loved ones until 2001.   This past August, we remembered these brave men with a memorial stone  on the Memorial Walk at the Cemetery honoring the prisoners of war  aboard the hell ship Enoura Maru. The American Defenders of Bataan and  Corregidor Memorial Society, an organization that represents the  American prisoners of war of Imperial Japan and their families,  organized the commemoration in Hawaii.   That memorial stone is a monument to their courage, suffering, and  sacrifice. It commemorates their tragic death 74 years ago and marks  their final return home. Let that stone and our remembrance of the  prisoners of war on the Enoura Maru remind us of our sacred commitment  to veterans of all eras to ``never forget.'' May they rest in peace.                            ____________________
