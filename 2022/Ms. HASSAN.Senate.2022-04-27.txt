 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Heidi  Matthews-Cantin and John Cantin of Manchester as April's Granite  Staters of the Month. Heidi and John comanage Missy's Closet, a resale  boutique that is holding its fourth annual ``Say Yes to the Prom  Dress'' event this month. This initiative allows young women who  otherwise would not be able to afford a prom dress the opportunity to  pick one out for free.   John lost his daughter, Melissa ``Missy'' Charbonneau, to a domestic  violence incident in 2009, and Missy's Closet was started in her  memory. The resale boutique runs on donations and volunteers and aims  to serve survivors of domestic violence and those struggling with  mental illness or substance misuse.   The mission of ``Say Yes to the Prom Dress'' is to make sure that  every young woman, no matter her economic circumstance, has the  opportunity to feel special and confident in her gown on prom night.  Missy's Closet offers a wide range of colors and sizes that young women  can choose from. This year, the boutique started off prom dress season  with more than 1,000 donated gowns, many of them new.   In addition, each young woman is assisted by a ``fashion  ambassador,'' a volunteer who is trained to give clients words of  encouragement and help them feel confident in their dresses. Free  makeup and jewelry is also available to complete their looks.   Heidi and John's work with Missy's Closet's ``Say Yes to the Prom  Dress'' campaign is not just about the dress; it is about providing  young women a way to feel confident on their special night.  Furthermore, it is not only the young women who walk away happy; the  volunteers at Missy's Closet take immense pride in their work and  recognize the importance of making a positive change in their  community. As Heidi herself says, kindness has a trickledown effect,  and all you need to do is help one person a day   John and Heidi embody the New Hampshire spirit of generosity and  kindness by working to ensure that everyone--regardless of financial  circumstance--has the opportunity to thrive.                            ____________________
