 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to highlight some of the  historic results my colleagues and I have been able to deliver to the  American people over the last 2 years. By putting aside political  agendas and working for the betterment of our communities, we have made  real change.   In the 117th Congress, House Democrats fought to pass landmark  packages to address the disenfranchisement inherently embedded in our  country.   We helped ensure more of our people can thrive by passing the  American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and  Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.   Still, there is more work to be done. My colleagues and I remain  committed to putting money back in the pockets of American workers and  families by addressing inflation, lowering healthcare costs, and  bolstering domestic manufacturing to create new, good-paying jobs--not  scaring people, supporting them.                            ____________________
