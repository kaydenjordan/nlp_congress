 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hardin  Valley Academy AeroHAWKS for their achievements at the American  Rocketry Challenge.   AeroHAWKS Team 1 came in first place, and Team 2 came in 10th place.  Both teams scored high enough that they were invited to participate in  NASA's Student Launch Initiative, and Team 1 has just headed to Paris,  France, to represent the United States in the International Rocketry  Challenge.   I say ``Paris, France,'' because many of you realize there is a  Paris, Tennessee, and that is home to the world's largest fish fry. I  wanted to clarify that.   This was Hardin Valley's first appearance in this competition, and  they competed alongside nearly 800 teams from 45 States. The fact they  did so well demonstrates their intelligence, dedication, and teamwork  abilities. They rose to the challenge and brought pride to east  Tennessee.   My office gave these students a tour of the U.S. Capitol before their  competition here in Washington, and it is clear these students are  passionate and bright and will do great things with their future.   I congratulate everyone from Hardin Valley Academy who competed in  the American Rocketry Challenge. I wish the best of luck to Team 1 as  they compete in Paris for the world title. They are making east  Tennessee and the entire Nation proud.   Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, from my days of rocketry with my  Estes rocket, I believe my V2 rocket is still in the tree of my  neighbor's house. I will state for the record that if any of these  young people would like to climb up and get it, I would gladly reward  them.                     Honoring Corporal Joe Allen Vinyard     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an American hero  who has finally been laid to rest in Blount County.   Corporal Joe Allen Vinyard was part of the 774th Tank Battalion  during World War II. He tragically lost his life in the Battle of  Hurtgen Forest, an important battle on the European front right before  the Battle of the Bulge. Many of the men who sacrificed their lives for  our freedom that day were not identified, including Corporal Vinyard.   In 2021, folks working at the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing in  Action Accounting Agency figured out one set of remains could have been  Corporal Vinyard's. Thanks to DNA testing from samples the family  provided, scientists were able to identify his remains. By September  2022, the family had been notified that he would be brought back to  Blount County.   Corporal Vinyard was laid to rest in Grandview Cemetery in Maryville  this past weekend. He is buried beside his parents, just a few miles  from his home. After almost 80 years, Corporal Joe Allen Vinyard has  finally come home.                  Honoring Sergeant Daniel Clifford Britton     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sergeant Daniel Clifford  Britton, who served our country during the Gulf war.   Daniel graduated from Temple Baptist Academy in 2006. He went on to  the University of Tennessee and participated in the Army ROTC program  and enlisted in the Army on September 3, 2008.   Sergeant Britton attended his initial Active-Duty training at Fort  Benning, Georgia. After graduation, he was assigned to the 15th  Infantry Regiment. He graduated from the air assault course in  September 2009, and in 2010, he deployed in support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom, where he earned his Combat Infantry Badge. During his service,  he was awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal with two stars, Army  Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal twice, and many others. He  was a patriot and loved this country to its core.   Sergeant Britton passed away in May and left behind a daughter who he  loved with his whole being. I offer my condolences to his daughter and  all his friends and family who knew and loved him.   It is my honor to recognize Sergeant Daniel Britton as the Tennessee  Second District's June 2023 Veteran of the Month. His service to this  country, his community, and his family will never be forgotten.   On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, I am not a very good  one, but I owe everything in my life, except for my salvation, to the  men and women who wore our country's uniform. I thank you for this  opportunity. I appreciate your testimony here on the floor about that  man, one of our brave officers, who lost his life. I thank the people  in the gallery for standing up and showing him that respect.   This is a great country we have, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, brother, for  your friendship.                            ____________________
