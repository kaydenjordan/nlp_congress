 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a fellow fighter  pilot, a pilot who is immediately recognizable to millions worldwide  who have seen the movie ``Top Gun: Maverick.'' I know my good friend is  watching right now. Those fanboys and fangirls know him only from the  credits as the ``pilot in bar'' who thanks his fellow captain for  inadvertently buying a round of drinks.   That fighter pilot is my good friend Brian Ferguson, ``Ferg,'' who is  retiring from the Navy Reserve after 30 years of dedicated service next  Friday.   Ferg's accomplishments in the Navy are too numerous to completely  list here, so I will just provide a few highlights. After graduating  from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1993, he joined the Navy,  went to flight school, and earned his naval aviator Wings of Gold. He  spent the next 10 years flying F-18s from the decks of aircraft  carriers in peace and war, including multiple night strikes into Iraq  during Operation Iraqi Freedom.   After 10 years on Active Duty, he transitioned to the Navy Reserve as  an adversary pilot--being the bad guy--flying F-5s with Fighter  Composite Squadron 13. As I can personally attest, the high point of  any fighter pilot's career is the opportunity to command a squadron.  Ferg took command of VFC-13 in 2012, and with the help of his enlisted  sailors and tactically brilliant junior officer pilots, the squadron  won awards for combat readiness, safety, aircraft maintenance, and  personnel retention.   Following command, Ferg continued to serve in important roles with  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, the Naval Aviation Warfighting  Development Center, Carrier Strike Group Fifteen, the Sixth Fleet Navy  Reserve Headquarters Unit, and then as the deputy commander of the  Naval Air Force Reserve.   In 2018, an irresistible opportunity presented itself when Ferg was  asked to be the Navy's technical adviser and aerial coordinator for the  filming of ``Top Gun: Maverick,'' an opportunity he declined at least  twice because--despite being a TOPGUN graduate himself--of the time it  would require him to be away from his family.   Of course, finally it was his wife, Susan, who is a lot smarter than  Ferg--yes, we wrote that out, Ferg, and we mean it--said: If you don't  help make the flight scenes in the movie look realistic and they don't,  you will spend the rest of your life telling people you could have done  it better--which he would--so just go do it yourself so you can't blame  anybody else if the scenes don't live up to the hype.   So Ferg spent nearly 2 years working as the Navy's point man on the  film. His hand is in every scene with an airplane, and as we all know,  those flying scenes lived up to the hype.   In spite of all that he has accomplished in the air, Ferg will be the  first to tell you that the most important things in his life are on the  ground: his lovely wife, Susan, and their four children. While Ferg was  out flying fighter jets and other kinds of things all throughout his  career, Susan raised four exceptional children. I will tell you as a  fellow naval aviator, it is the spouses who endure most of the  sacrifice and do the raising of the children. In Ferg's case I am very  grateful that Susan was the one who did that; and of course she was  working full time herself.   Their three sons, Cole, Evan, and Connor each earned the rank of  Eagle Scout. Cole and Evan graduated college, and Connor is currently  in college. His daughter, Cassie, earned her Girl Scout Silver Award  and is a college student and skilled equestrian.   I also know that when Ferg was in leadership positions, particularly  as the deputy to a two-star admiral, everybody's favorite thing, he  often stayed late so that his sailors and junior officers could get  home to be with their families.   It was the love and support of his own family that enabled Ferg to  serve and succeed in the Navy for the past 30 years, and I rise today  to recognize them for their service, as well.   In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I thank the Fergusons: Brian, Susan,  Cole, Evan, Connor, and Cassie, for the sacrifices they have made for  the Navy and our country over the past 30 years.   Fair winds and following seas, shipmate. You are an American hero.  You will be missed in the Navy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, as many of you know, from time-to-time I  address the House floor with my version of a speech that my childhood  pastor would give every Sunday called ``Joys and Concerns.'' During  this time, he would highlight some of the remarkable things that  members of the church were doing and some of their many  accomplishments.   He would also take this time to bring up prayer requests. That would  unite us as a congregation to pray for our community and those in need.   Recently, I had the opportunity to go to Hillsboro, Texas, which is a  city in my district in Hill County. It is a remarkable place of  wonderful people, and they all love their country. The local community  college, Hill College, has a veterans' museum on campus.   If you take a moment before you walk into the museum, out front to  the right is a small memorial, and it is a ``Medal of Honor Memorial to  Native-Born Texans.'' It is engraved on a headstone. During my visits,  I am always drawn to those to see what I can find there.   My district is home to nine Medal of Honor recipients, and I would  like to take a moment to introduce them to you. If you will indulge me,  it will take a little time, but I think it is worth talking about as we  worry about the future of this country and what we are made of and the  greatness of our people. When I tell you their stories, you should have  no doubt that there should be no doubt about our past and our future.   From Dallas, Commander Samuel Dealey, who served our Nation in World  War II. He was born September 13, 1906, and served our Nation during  World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry  and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of  duty as commanding officer of the USS Harder during her fifth war  patrol in Japanese-controlled waters.   Floodlighted by a bright moon and disclosed to an enemy destroyer  escort which bore down with the intent to attack, Commander Dealey  dived his submarine to periscope depth and waited for the pursuer to  close range, then opened fire, sending the target and all aboard down  in flames with his third torpedo.   Plunging deep to avoid fierce depth charges, he again surfaced, and  within 9 minutes after sighting another destroyer, had sent the enemy  down tail first with a direct hit immediately amidship.   Evading detection, he penetrated the confined waters off Tawi Tawi  with a Japanese fleet base 6 miles away and scored death blows on two  patrolling destroyers in quick succession. With his ship heeled over by  concussions from the first exploding target and the second vessel nose- diving in a blinding detonation, he cleared the area at high speed.   Sighted by a large hostile fleet force on the following day, he swung  his bow toward the lead destroyer for another down-the-throat shot,  fired three bow tubes, and promptly crash-dived to be terrifically  rocked seconds later by the exploding ship as the USS Harder passed  beneath.   This remarkable record of five vital Japanese destroyers sunk in five  short-range torpedo attacks attested the valiant spirit of Commander  Dealey and his indomitable command.   From Hillsboro, Second Lieutenant James Harris.   Second Lieutenant Harris was born on June 27, 1916, and served our  Nation during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for  conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond  the call of duty on 7 October 1944 in Vagney, France.   At 9 p.m., an enemy raiding party comprising a tank and two platoons  of infantry infiltrated through the lines under cover of mist and  darkness and attacked an infantry battalion command post with hand  grenades, retiring a short distance to an ambush position on hearing  the approach of the M4 tank commanded by Second Lieutenant Harris.   Realizing the need for bold, aggressive action, Second Lieutenant  Harris ordered his tank to halt while he proceeded on foot, fully 10  yards ahead of his six-man patrol and armed only with a service pistol,  to probe the darkness of the enemy.   Although struck down and mortally wounded by machine gun bullets  which penetrated his solar plexus, he crawled back to his tank leaving  a trail of blood behind him and, too weak to climb inside it, issued  fire orders while lying on the road between two contending armored  vehicles.   Although the tank which he commanded was destroyed in the course of  the firefight, he stood the enemy off until friendly tanks, preparing  to come to his aid, caused the enemy to withdraw and thereby lose an  opportunity to kill or capture the entire battalion command personnel.   Suffering a second wound, which severed his leg at the hip in the  course of this tank duel, Second Lieutenant Harris refused aid until  after a wounded member of his crew had been carried to safety. He died  before he could be given medical attention.   God bless you, Second Lieutenant.   From Dallas, First Lieutenant Turney Leonard.   Turney Leonard was born on June 18, 1921, and served our Nation  during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for displaying  extraordinary heroism while commanding a platoon of mobile weapons at  Kommerscheidt, Germany, on November 4, 5, and 6, 1944. During the  fierce, 3-day engagement, he repeatedly braved overwhelming enemy fire  in advance of his platoon to direct the fire of his tank destroyer from  exposed, dismounted positions.    He went on lone reconnaissance missions to discover what opposition  his men faced, and on one occasion, when fired upon by a hostile  machine gun, advanced alone and eliminated the enemy emplacement with a  hand grenade. When a strong German attack threatened to overrun  friendly positions, he moved through withering artillery, mortar, and  small-arms fire, reorganized confused infantry units whose leaders had  become casualties, and exhorted them to hold firm.   Although wounded early in the battle, he continued to direct fire  from his advanced position until he was disabled by a high-explosive  shell which shattered his arm, forcing him to withdraw. He was last  seen at a medical aid station which the enemy subsequently captured.   By his superb courage, inspiring leadership, and indomitable fighting  spirit, First Lieutenant Leonard enabled our forces to hold off the  enemy attack and was personally responsible for the direction of fire  which destroyed six German tanks.   From Ennis, First Lieutenant Jack Lummus.   Jack was born October 22, 1915, and served our Nation during World  War II. He received the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and  intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty  as leader of a rifle platoon attached to the 2nd Battalion, 27th  Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces  on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands on March 8, 1945, right before the  war ended.   Resuming his assault tactics with bold decision after fighting  without respite for 2 days and nights, First Lieutenant Lummus slowly  advanced his platoon against an enemy deeply entrenched in a network of  mutually supporting positions.   Suddenly halted by a terrific concentration of enemy fire, he  [[Page H4337]]  unhesitatingly moved forward of his front lines in an effort to  neutralize the Japanese position. Although knocked to the ground when  an enemy grenade exploded close by, he immediately recovered himself  and, again moving forward despite the intensified barrage, quickly  located, attacked, and destroyed the occupied emplacement.   Instantly taken under fire by the garrison of a supporting pillbox  and further assailed by the slashing fury of hostile rifle fire, he  fell under the impact of a second enemy grenade but courageously  disregarding painful shoulder wounds, staunchly continued his heroic  one-man assault and charged the second pillbox, annihilating all of the  occupants.   Subsequently returning to his platoon position, he fearlessly  traversed his lines under fire, encouraging his men to advance and  directing the fire of supporting tanks against other stubbornly holding  Japanese emplacements.   Held up again by a devastating barrage, he again moved into the open,  rushed a third heavily fortified installation, and killed the defending  troops. Determined to crush all resistance, he led his men indomitably,  personally attacking foxholes and spider traps with his carbine and  systematically reducing the fanatic opposition until, stepping on a  land mine, he sustained fatal wounds.   By his outstanding valor, skilled tactics, and tenacious perseverance  in the face of overwhelming odds, First Lieutenant Lummus had inspired  his stouthearted marines to continue the relentless drive northward,  thereby contributing materially to the success of his regimental  mission.   His dauntless leadership and unwavering devotion to duty throughout  sustain and enhance the highest tradition of the United States Navy  service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.   From Fort Worth, Second Lieutenant George O'Brien.   Second Lieutenant O'Brien was born on September 10, 1926, and served  our Nation during the Korean war. He received the Medal of Honor for  conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and  beyond the call of duty as a rifle platoon commander of Company H in  action against enemy aggressor forces.   With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery  bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill  position on the main line of resistance, which had been overrun by a  numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second  Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was  given and, shouting for his men to follow, raced across an exposed  saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly  small-arms, artillery, and mortar fire.   Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile  automatic weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position,  he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward, and continued to  spearhead the assault, pausing only long enough to go to the aid of a  wounded marine.   Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand  grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to the best of his  advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least  three of the enemy.   Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during  the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for  medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for  a period of nearly 4 hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and  maintaining superb direction of the unit.   With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces  to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position,  attending to the wounded, and expediting their evacuation.   When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he  remained to cover the withdrawal and to ensure that no wounded were  left behind.   By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of  overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant  source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly  instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line  of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting  spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest  traditions of the U.S. Navy service.    From Palestine, Captain Steven Bennett.   Captain Steven Bennett was born on April 22, 1946, and served our  Nation during the Vietnam war. Captain Bennett was the pilot of a light  aircraft flying an artillery adjustment mission along a heavily  defended segment of route structure.   A large concentration of enemy troops were massing for an attack on a  friendly unit. Captain Bennett requested tactical air support but was  advised that none was available. He also requested artillery support,  but this, too, was denied due to the close proximity of friendly troops  to the target.   Captain Bennett was determined to aid the endangered unit and elected  to strafe the hostile positions. After four such passes, the enemy  forces began to retreat. Captain Bennett continued the attack, but as  he completed his fifth strafing pass, his aircraft was struck by a  surface-to-air missile which severely damaged the left engine and the  left main landing gear. As fire spread in the left engine, Captain  Bennett realized that recovery at a friendly airfield was impossible.                                time  1745    He instructed his observer to prepare for ejection but was informed  by the observer that his parachute had been shredded by the force of  the impacting missile. Although Captain Bennett had a good parachute,  he knew that if he ejected, the observer would have no chance of  survival.   With complete disregard for his own life, Captain Bennett elected to  ditch the aircraft in the Gulf of Tonkin, even though he realized that  a pilot of this type of aircraft had never survived a ditching. The  ensuing impact upon the water caused the aircraft to cartwheel and  severely damaged the front cockpit, making escape for Captain Bennett  impossible. The observer successfully made his way out of the aircraft  and was rescued.   Captain Bennett's unparalleled concern for his companion,  extraordinary heroism, and intrepidity above and beyond the call of  duty at the cost of his life were in keeping with the highest  traditions of U.S. military service and reflect great credit upon  himself and the United States Air Force.   From Corsicana, Sergeant Candelario Garcia, who was born on February  26, 1944, served our Nation during the Vietnam war. He received the  Medal of Honor for distinguishing himself with acts of gallantry and  intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an  acting team leader for Company Bravo, 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry, 1st  Brigade, 1st Infantry Division during combat operations against an  armed enemy in Lai Khe, Republic of Vietnam, on December 8, 1968.   On that day, while conducting reconnaissance, Sergeant Garcia and his  platoon discovered communication wire and other signs of an enemy-based  camp leading to a densely vegetated area. As the men advanced, they  came under intense fire. Several men were hit and trapped in the open.  Ignoring a hail of hostile bullets, Sergeant Garcia crawled to within  10 meters of a machine gun bunker, leapt to his feet, and ran directly  at the fortification, firing his rifle as he charged.   Sergeant Garcia jammed two hand grenades into the gun port and then  placed the muzzle of the weapon inside, killing all four occupants.   Continuing to expose himself to intense enemy fire, Sergeant Garcia  raced 15 meters to another bunker and killed its three defenders with  hand grenades and rifle fire.   After again braving the enemy's barrage in order to rescue two  casualties, he joined his company in an assault which overran the  remaining enemy positions.   Sergeant Garcia's extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and  beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of  military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and  the United States Army.   Finally, from Dallas, Specialist Robert Law, who was born on  September 15, 1944, served our Nation during the Vietnam war. He  received the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity  in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.  [[Page H4338]]    Specialist Law distinguished himself while serving with Company I.  While on a long-range reconnaissance patrol in the Tinh Phuoc Thanh  Province, Specialist Law and five comrades made contact with a small  enemy patrol. As the opposing elements exchanged intense fire, he  maneuvered to a perilously exposed position, flanking his comrades, and  began placing suppressive fire on the hostile troops.   Although his team was hindered by a low supply of ammunition and  suffered from an unidentified irritating gas in the air, Specialist  Law's spirited defense and challenging counterassault rallied his  fellow soldiers against the well-equipped hostile troops.   When an enemy grenade landed in his team's position, Specialist Law,  instead of diving into the safety of a stream behind him, threw himself  on the grenade to save the lives of his comrades.   Specialist Law's extraordinary courage and profound concern for his  fellow soldiers were in keeping with the highest traditions of U.S.  military service and the U.S. Army.   These men made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow soldiers,  their families, and their country. I was humbled and moved to see their  names displayed for all those who visit to see, and I wanted to talk  about them on the floor.   If you have the opportunity, I encourage you to visit this memorial  to pay respect to those men whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for the  freedoms we enjoy today.   Now, I want to recognize some members of our community who have gone  above and beyond.   I congratulate Kira Neff from Midlothian on recently attaining the  rank of Eagle Scout. This level of success is only accomplished through  dedication and hard work. The many hours put into this badge are  evident by her success.   I congratulate Kyle Austin from Palestine on being awarded the  Anderson County Sheriff's Office Life Saving Award. I thank him for all  he does.   I congratulate Laikahs Kelly from Corsicana on winning the State  championship in powerlifting in her respected weight class--a  tremendous accomplishment.   I congratulate Mason Couch from Palestine on his recent promotion to  sergeant in the Correctional Division for the Anderson County Sheriff's  Office. Our community is very fortunate to have him take on this new  role, and the citizens of Anderson County will benefit from his years  of experience in law enforcement.   I congratulate Michelle Woodall from Mansfield and the students of  Ben Barber Innovation Academy on being named DECA Chapter of the Year  for 2022. Being recognized on a national level is an amazing  accomplishment, and they should be proud of everyone who worked this  past school year to help them earn this accolade.   I congratulate Nora Frasier from Mansfield on being awarded the 2022  Excellence in Leadership Award for the Texas Organization for Nursing  Leadership and for being recognized as one of 23 notable women in Texas  hospitals, healthcare, and public policy by the Texas  Hospital Association. These awards are a tribute to her courageous and  selfless acts working in healthcare and the exemplary contributions she  has shown to the hospital. I truly appreciate all that she does in the  field of nursing and the outstanding service, compassion, and  leadership that she shows toward her staff and those around her. I  thank her for keeping our community's health a high priority.    I congratulate William Stewart from Palestine and the Palestine High  School Student Council on winning the Sweepstakes Award and being  recognized as a Sweepstakes Council by the Texas Association of Student  Councils. It is an incredible accomplishment, and I know it took many  hours of practice and dedication to reach this success.   I congratulate Paul Box from Waxahachie on placing third overall in  the men's division at the World Marathon Challenge. It is an incredible  accomplishment, and I trust that his hard work and enthusiasm for  running will inspire others to exhibit the same discipline and  leadership qualities that have helped him become a world-class athlete.   I congratulate Rustin Smith from Midlothian on also achieving Eagle  Scout.   I congratulate Victor Campa from Ennis on being named Firefighter of  the Year for 2022 from the Ennis Fire Department. This award is a  tribute to his courageous and selfless acts as a first responder. I  thank him for his willingness to serve Ennis and the State of Texas.   I congratulate Mary Gunter from Fairfield on 40 years of service for  the Child Nutrition Department at Fairfield Independent School  District. I thank her for her commitment and love for her students and  families in her community.   I congratulate Mike Littrell from Dawson on being inducted into the  Ag Teachers Association of the Texas Hall of Fame. I thank him for all  his hard work in teaching ag through hands-on learning at Dawson ISD  and feeding the world.   I congratulate Andy McClendon from Midlothian on his graduation from  The American Legion Boys State program. I, myself, was a Boys State  graduate. Being elected to participate as a delegate reflects his hard  work, dedication, and strong leadership skills.   I recognize Curtis Putz from Corsicana for being awarded the Star of  Texas by Governor Abbott. This honor recognizes his commitment to our  community, which will have a lasting impact for many years to come. I  thank him for the risks that he has taken, the sacrifices he makes, and  his acts of selflessness for others. Navarro County is a safer place to  live because of him.   I also congratulate Waxahachie CARE for being awarded Nonprofit of  the Year from the Waxahachie Chamber of Commerce. I thank them for  supporting the families in our wonderful community. Their commitment to  helping families in need in our area is truly remarkable.   Finally, I thank Hill County Emergency Management, Texas A&M Forest  Service, Hillsboro Fire Department, and White Bluff Volunteer Fire  Department for their work containing the wildfire near Blum, Texas, on  July 31. This deadly fire engulfed over 300 acres and claimed several  buildings. Because of the dedication and the hard work of all those  involved, no homes were lost and no lives were lost.   Finally, I congratulate Commissioner Lane Grayson, Neal Bryd, Chad  Spence, Casey Crow, Ruben Benavidez, Brenda Blaylock, James Byrd, Neal  Byrd, Jimer Cannaday, Rodney Dickerson, Russel Ellison, Dwight Koch,  Fernando Limon, Adam Pryor, Chad Spence, Tim Zabojnik, and Leon Zajic,  all of Ellis County Precinct 2 for achieving 3,000 days of no lost  time. This is an achievement that few construction crews can claim. It  requires 3,000 days of no work-related injuries. I thank them for all  of their hard work and, more importantly, putting the safety of their  fellow coworkers and citizens above all.   These are just a few examples of some outstanding people living in  Texas' Sixth District. When you think that there is no hope in our  country, know that there is, that there are people in our communities  and here in Washington working hard to leave this world a better place  than when they got here. It is my privilege to honor them on the House  floor.   Every Sunday after the joys would come the concerns, and there was  never a shortage because everybody knew in Matthew, he says: ``Where  two or three are gathered in my name, I am in the midst of them.''   I start with a concern from Katherine from Palestine, whose mother  recently got diagnosed with cancer. She asked that we keep her in our  prayers as she and her family go through this difficult time.   Tamra from Jacksonville asks us to keep all of our homeless veterans  in our prayers. Many are battling with mental illness and unseen wounds  from their time defending our country.   Neal from Irving is concerned about what he sees in the news with  regard to fentanyl. While he does not understand why anybody would  choose to take it, he knows it is a problem.   Mark from Whitney recently took his wife to the hospital for a  collapsed lung and asked that we keep her in our prayers.   John from Whitney is joyful for the life that God has given him and  is concerned about the chemo and radiation treatment he started this  week. My  [[Page H4339]]  thoughts and prayers are with John and Shelby and their family.   To close out, I want to bring attention to a brave young lady who has  been visiting us here in Washington this week and needs our prayers.  Isabella Day is 12 years old. During a routine doctor visit, she was  diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma when she was only 9 months old.  Since the day she was diagnosed, Isabella and her parents, Tim and  Leslie, along with her sisters Anna and Jaclyn, have dedicated  themselves to helping children with childhood cancer.   Back in May, I met Isabella in my office, and I was moved by her  story. Before that, I met her out on the campaign trail. She came and  talked to me and asked me some really hard questions. I was really  impressed by her and asked her to come to the office.   This week, she has had the opportunity to share her story with  Chairwoman Granger, Congresswoman Julia Letlow, Congressman Steny  Hoyer, Congresswoman Katherine Clark, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris  Rodgers, Congressman   Dan Crenshaw, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo,  Congressman   Robert Aderholt, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and  Congressman Juan Ciscomani.    If she was of age according to the Constitution, I think she would  probably be put forth as a candidate for President. She is that  impressive, and I am proud to know her.   I am thankful to each of my friends who took the time to visit with  her. It changed my life. She has changed my life, and I know it did  yours.   I mentioned the nine recipients of the Medal of Honor from different  ages and eras, and I served with men and women who, no doubt, had we  been in conflict today, would be deserving of that, too, so I just want  to tell people that when you lose hope, there is much to be hopeful for  in this country. We have incredible women here in this Chamber,  incredible men here in this Chamber, Representatives up here in  Washington, D.C., who sacrifice a lot of their time, a lot of time with  their families, to serve.   Don't read the hype in the media. Understand that they are working  very hard. Remember that when I talk about these Medal of Honor men who  were drafted in World War II or Vietnam, they would tell you that they  are just like any of the others of us called to do something great, and  they were awarded a medal for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at  the risk of their lives and usually in the face of overwhelming odds.   What we face today is not overwhelming. We are the United States of  America. We have and can continue to accomplish anything we set our  minds to.   I ask that we keep all Americans in our prayers, keep joy in your  hearts, hope in man, and faith in God.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
