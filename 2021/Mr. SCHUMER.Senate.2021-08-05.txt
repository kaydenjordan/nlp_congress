 Madam President, before my remarks, I ask unanimous  consent that the cloture vote on the Lee nomination occur at a time to  be determined today by the majority leader following consultation with  the Republican leader.    Madam President, all week, as we all know, Senators have  worked together to move forward on the bipartisan infrastructure bill.  Since the text of the bipartisan proposal was finalized on Sunday, both  sides have had extensive opportunities to offer amendments. Senators  have certainly taken advantage.   So far, the Senate has considered 22 amendments on this bipartisan  piece of legislation. We considered 14 amendments yesterday alone. Of  the 22 total amendments, more than half have been offered by our  Republican colleagues. Clearly, the Democratic majority has given  Members who were not part of the bipartisan group a chance to make  their mark on this important bill.   Taking a step back, this Senate has operated much differently under  Democratic leadership this year than it did under Republican leadership  over the past 6. We have had bipartisan bills on the floor, open for  amendment, and all 100 Senators are participating in the legislative  process. The anti-Asian hate crimes bill and the USICA bill were both  major bills that worked in a bipartisan way with amendments, as is this  bill.   We have taken more amendment votes this year than nearly any year in  recent memory. In fact, we have had more rollcall votes on amendments  this year, only halfway through, than during the past 2 years, where  the Republicans were in charge, combined. In other words, in one-half  of the year in 2021, where Democrats got in charge, we have had more  amendments than in all of 2019 and 2020. So any talk that we  [[Page S5892]]  are not working the Senate, whenever we can, in a fair, bipartisan way  is just wrong--just wrong.   Consider this: At this point in the calendar year in 2017, the first  year of a Republican President and a Republican Senate majority--a one- to-one comparison to our current political configuration--the Senate  held rollcall votes on 10 amendments--10--at this point in the first  year of the Trump Presidency. On this bipartisan infrastructure bill  alone, the Senate has held rollcall votes on 17 amendments. In 7  months, the 2017 Republican majority allowed rollcall votes on only 10  amendments, and we have done almost double that number in the past 7  days alone.   This is how I promised the Chamber would function under a Democratic  majority. I promised it while we were fighting to get that majority,  and we are fulfilling that promise now that we have it Legislators  should actually have a chance to legislate. No one can deny that we  kept our word here in the Democratic majority.    Today, we will consider even more amendments, and then, hopefully, we  can bring this bill to a close very shortly. Our goal is to pass both a  bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget resolution during this work  period, and we will stay here to get both done.                            ____________________     On another matter, climate. President Biden announced  this morning that he will sign an Executive order to significantly  escalate our country's fight against climate change.   Specifically, President Biden's Executive order will set an ambitious  goal to make half of all new cars sold in America zero emissions by the  end of the decade. He will announce further steps to address several of  the worst climate-warming rules that were put in place under the Trump  administration.   I applaud President Biden for taking necessary steps to put our  country on a path to substantially reduce our carbon pollution. Climate  change is the defining challenge of our times. We have no choice but to  reduce our country's greenhouse gas emissions very quickly to reach the  targets that will spare our country and our planet the worst effects of  climate change, and we cannot do it without dealing with carbon  pollution from cars we drive. Transportation is the biggest source of  carbon pollution, accounting for roughly one-third of America's carbon  output.   President Biden's Executive order is an important step in the right  direction, and I am happy and proud to say it dovetails with an effort  I have long advocated here in the Congress, even before the Biden  Presidency. It is called Clean Cars for America. In fact, President  Biden generously adopted our Clean Cars for America plan and placed it  in his Build Back Better.   My Clean Cars for America proposal--and I have worked closely with  Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters, and others on this proposal--would  help our country make the transition that President Biden is talking  about today by making electric cars more affordable, expanding our  charging infrastructure, and creating incentives to manufacture  batteries and electric vehicles here in America. It is good for  climate. It good for jobs. And it is good for America to become the  center of electric car manufacturing in the world, as we have been with  the traditional type of automobile.   The proposal--I am proud to say we worked hard to make this happen.  Clean Cars for America is now, as I said, largely adopted in the Build  Back Better plan and is supported not only by the environmental  community, but by the major labor unions and several of the major car  manufacturers as well. It is the first time on a major piece of climate  legislation we have gotten such broad support.   The transition to electric vehicles, of course, is already underway,  but it is not happening fast enough to reach the targets that President  Biden announced today. Clean Cars for America is the way to supercharge  the transition to electric vehicles, and large parts of it will be-- some of it was put in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, but large  parts of it we hope to add in the reconciliation process.   Put another way: If President Biden's Executive order represents the  destination we need to reach on the horizon, our Clean Cars for America  is the road to get there.   President Biden's announcement, combined with our Clean Cars  proposal, represents the bold level of action we need to tackling  carbon pollution from cars.   When Democrats assumed the majority, I instructed my committee chairs  to find climate-reducing policies to incorporate into the legislation  we work on. Earlier this year, the Senate passed the first major  climate legislation in years when we reversed the Trump  administration's methane emissions rule. And as we continue working on  a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget resolution, I have  committed that we will make historic investments in reversing climate  change. I am proud to say our Clean Cars for America is going to be a  very big part of that.   Democrats promised action on climate, and we are going to make it a  vital part of the legislation we work on in the weeks to come. It is a  big challenge, but one we must meet. It is so important for the future  of our planet, for our children, and our grandchildren even more than  for us                            ____________________     One final matter, evictions. Earlier this week, the  Biden administration announced that the CDC will adopt an eviction  moratorium to provide critical protections for another 60 days as our  country continues its path towards full recovery.   I applaud everyone who made it happen, from the President to the CDC,  to Speaker Pelosi, to Senator Brown, as well as several of my  Democratic colleagues in the House, including a brave band of New  Yorkers, including Congress Member Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Jones.  Above all, Representative Cori Bush gets huge credit--one person who  changed things for tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of  people, and everyone who stood with her as well.   As I explained yesterday, while this moratorium is an important  safeguard to protect millions of American families in danger of  evictions, it is not the only piece of the puzzle. Once the moratorium  comes to an end--whenever that is--there is still a fundamental  challenge of making up for a year of lost rent and lost mortgage  payments.   Congress considered this problem very early this year. I pushed for,  and we passed, along with Senator Brown and so many others, substantial  rental and mortgage assistance in the American Rescue Plan.   Unfortunately, State governments have been really uneven about  distributing that crucial assistance. A few States--the State of  Illinois, the State of Texas--have done a pretty good job, but many  have not. Unfortunately, one of those that has done a very poor job  distributing this money is my home State of New York.   Simply put: State governments, especially New York, must do a better  job of distributing the $47 billion Congress appropriated for emergency  rental assistance. The money is there, but far too little has gone out  the door.   In New York specifically, Congress sent more than $2 billion to help  renters in New York; and, inexplicably, some reports indicate less than  0.5 percent of New York's allocation had been received by tenants and  landlords as of a week ago.   Today, I am sending a letter with colleagues in the New York  delegation to the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability  Assistance, calling on that office to hurry up to fix the inexcusable  delays in rental assistance and immediately begin disbursing these  funds.   We need to understand why New Yorkers are having such trouble  navigating the process to get the money they need. There have been  reports of frustrating crashes and glitches on the online application  process, confusing instructions, and very little support to help the  applicants, even though the money has been there for several months.   The clock is ticking to fix this mess. The State moratorium expires  in less than a month, and the CDC's moratorium will give only one more  month of protection after that. New York State needs to act quickly,  and we expect a response by August 9 as to how we can  [[Page S5893]]  get a handle on these delays and, most importantly, get the money to  New Yorkers faster so they can pay the rent.   By the way, many landlords, particularly small landlords, depend on  this as well. If you worked hard--let's say you are a bus driver and  you own a three-family house. When the tenants in your house don't pay  you, you don't have any cushion and you have to pay the mortgage. So  this bill will help with that as well, this proposal.   Right now, there are 6\1/2\ million Americans who are behind in their  rent. According to the New York Times, over 400,000 renters in New York  City alone owe a collective debt of $2 billion.   Congress did its job by making sure that we have money in place to  help these Americans avoid evictions. Now the States need to step it up  to make sure that this money gets into the hands of renters as soon as  possible.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today with some sad, some horrible  news about the passing of a great friend, Rich Trumka, who left us this  morning.   The working people of America have lost a fierce warrior at a time  when we needed him most. Just yesterday, Rich was lending his support  to the striking miners in Alabama.   Following in his father's footsteps, he worked in the mines. He went  to Penn State, earned his law degree. He didn't practice. He didn't go  to some fancy place. He went right to work for the United Mine Workers,  which he lead for so many years, and then he became head--first,  secretary-treasurer--of the AFL-CIO.   He had in his veins and every atom of his body the heart, the  thoughts, the needs of the working people of America. He was them. Rich  Trumka was the working people of America. He never had any airs. He  never put it on, and he cared about his fellow workers so.   He was a great leader. He knew that the labor movement and working  people had to expand and be diverse. One of his passions as a labor  leader was immigration reform, which I talked to him about repeatedly  because they were working people, too, no matter where they came from  or what they looked like.   It is just horrible news. I will have more to say about it later, but  I wanted to inform my colleagues that we have just lost a giant, and we  need him so.   We will remember him forever, and his memory will, I know, importune  all of us to do more, even more, for the working people of America, who  Rich Trumka so dearly and deeply loved.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, we are working on an agreement. As you  know, we have been working all day, but we aren't there yet as work  continues on the agreement. I am filing cloture on both the substitute  and the underlying bill for a Saturday vote. If we come to an agreement  yet tonight, which is our preference, we will have additional votes on  amendments. I believe we are very close to an agreement and see no  reason why we can't complete this important bipartisan bill. I urge  both sides to continue working diligently to make it happen.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, Thursday,  August 5, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture  is invoked on Executive Calendar No. 50, the Lee nomination, all  postcloture time be yielded back and that notwithstanding rule XXII,  the Senate vote on confirmation at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, not before  Saturday, August 7, 2021; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon  [[Page S5923]]  the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.    I ask that the Senate vote on cloture as under the  previous order.   This vote--I know that Members are probably not all here right now,  so we will keep it open for a little while. I urge Members to get here  soon.    Mr. President, now we have worked long, hard, and  collaboratively to finish this important bipartisan bill.   The Senate has considered 22 amendments during this process, and we  have been willing to consider many more. In fact, we have been trying  to vote on amendments all day but have encountered numerous objections  from the other side.   However, we very much want to finish this important bill, so we will  reconvene Saturday at noon to vote on cloture, and then we will follow  the regular order to finish the bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2670         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Redistricting Reform Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.         Congress finds that it has the authority to establish the       terms and conditions States must follow in carrying out       congressional redistricting after an apportionment of Members       of the House of Representatives because--        (1) the authority granted to Congress under article I,       section 4 of the Constitution of the United States gives       Congress the power to enact laws governing the time, place,       and manner of elections for Members of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the authority granted to Congress under section 5 of       the 14th amendment to the Constitution gives Congress the       power to enact laws to enforce section 2 of such amendment,       which requires Representatives to be apportioned among the       several States according to their number.           TITLE I--REQUIREMENTS FOR CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING       SEC. 101.

SEC. 102. BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING.         A State that has been redistricted in accordance with this       Act and a State described in section 101(c) may not be       redistricted again until after the next apportionment of       Representatives under section 22(a) of the Act entitled ``An       Act to provide for the fifteenth and subsequent decennial       censuses and to provide for an apportionment of       Representatives in Congress'', approved June 18, 1929 (2       U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the State to conduct such       subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution of       the United States, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C.       10301 et seq.), the Constitution of the State, or the terms       or conditions of this Act.       SEC. 103. CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING.         (a) Criteria.--Under the redistricting plan of a State,       there shall be established single-member congressional       districts using the following criteria as set forth in the       following order of priority:        (1) Districts shall comply with the United States       Constitution, including the requirement that they equalize       total population.        (2) Districts shall comply with the Voting Rights Act of       1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), including by creating any       districts where two or more politically cohesive groups       protected by such Act are able to elect representatives of       choice in coalition with one another, and all applicable       Federal laws.        (3) Districts shall be drawn, to the extent that the       totality of the circumstances warrant, to ensure the       practical ability of a group protected under the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to participate       in the political process and to nominate candidates and to       elect representatives of choice is not diluted or diminished,       regardless of whether or not such protected group constitutes       a majority of a district's citizen voting age population.        (4) Districts shall respect communities of interest,       neighborhoods, and political subdivisions to the extent       practicable and after compliance with the requirements of       paragraphs (1) through (3). A community of interest is       defined as an area with recognized similarities of interests,       including ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social, cultural,       geographic or historic identities. The term communities of       interest may, in certain circumstances, include political       subdivisions such as counties, municipalities, tribal lands       and reservations, or school districts, but shall not include       common relationships with political parties or political       candidates.        (b) No Favoring or Disfavoring of Political Parties.--        (1) Prohibition.--The redistricting plan enacted by a State       shall not, when considered on a Statewide basis, be drawn       with the intent or the effect of unduly favoring or       disfavoring any political party.        (2) Determination of effect.--        (A) Totality of circumstances.--For purposes of paragraph       (1), the determination of whether a redistricting plan has       the effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring a political       party shall be based on the totality of circumstances,       including evidence regarding the durability and severity of a       plan's partisan bias.        (B) Plans deemed to have effect of unduly favoring or       disfavoring a political party.--Without limiting other ways       in which a redistricting plan may be determined to have the       effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring a political party       under the totality of circumstances under subparagraph (A), a       redistricting plan shall be deemed to have the effect of       unduly favoring or disfavoring a political party if--        (i) modeling based on relevant historical voting patterns       shows that the plan is statistically likely to result in a       partisan bias of more than one seat in States with 20 or       fewer congressional districts or a partisan bias of more than       2 seats in States with more than 20 congressional districts,       as determined using quantitative measures of partisan       fairness, which may include, but are not limited to, the       seats-to-votes curve for an enacted plan, the efficiency gap,       the declination, partisan asymmetry, and the mean-median       difference; and        (ii) alternative plans, which may include, but are not       limited to, those generated by redistricting algorithms,       exist that could have complied with the requirements of law       and not been in violation of paragraph (1).        (3) Determination of intent.--For purposes of paragraph       (1), a rebuttable presumption shall exist that a       redistricting plan enacted by the legislature of a State was       not enacted with the intent of unduly favoring or disfavoring       a political party if the plan was enacted with the support of       at least a third of the members of the second largest       political party in each house of the legislature.        (4) No violation based on certain criteria.--No       redistricting plan shall be found to be in violation of       paragraph (1) because of partisan bias attributable to the       application of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1), (2),       or (3) of subsection (a), unless one or more alternative       plans could have complied with such paragraphs without having       the effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring a political       party.        (c) Factors Prohibited From Consideration.--In developing       the redistricting plan for the State, the independent       redistricting commission may not take into consideration any       of the following factors, except as necessary to comply with       the criteria described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of       subsection (a), to achieve partisan fairness and comply with       subsection (b), and to enable the redistricting plan to be       measured against the external metrics described in section       203(d):        (1) The residence of any Member of the House of       Representatives or candidate.        (2) The political party affiliation or voting history of       the population of a district.        (d) Applicability.--This section applies to any authority,       whether appointed, elected, judicial, or otherwise, that       designs or enacts a congressional redistricting plan of a       State.        (e) Severability of Criteria.--If any of the criteria set       forth in this section, or the application of such criteria to       any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional,       the remaining criteria set forth in this section, and the       application of such criteria to any person or circumstance,       shall not be affected by the holding.              TITLE II--INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS       SEC. 201. INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION.         (a) Appointment of Members.--        (1) In general.--The nonpartisan agency established or       designated by a State under section 204(a) shall establish an       independent redistricting commission for the State, which       shall consist of 15 members appointed by the agency as       follows:        (A) Not later than October 1 of a year ending in the       numeral zero, the agency shall, at a public meeting held not       earlier than 15 days after notice of the meeting has been       given to the public, first appoint 6 members as follows:        (i) The agency shall appoint 2 members on a random basis       from the majority category of the approved selection pool (as       described in section 202(b)(1)(A)).        (ii) The agency shall appoint 2 members on a random basis       from the minority category of the approved selection pool (as       described in section 202(b)(1)(B)).        (iii) The agency shall appoint 2 members on a random basis       from the independent category of the approved selection pool       (as described in section 202(b)(1)(C)).
