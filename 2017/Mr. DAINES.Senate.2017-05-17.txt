 Mr. President, along with my dad, Clair, who started our  family homebuilding business 45 years ago, I wish to congratulate the  National Association of Home Builders on reaching its 75th anniversary.   For three-quarters of a century, NAHB has been fighting for the  American dream, advocating for those who want to own a home for  themselves and their families and advocating for homebuilders who  provide jobs and make the homeowners' dreams a reality.   Before coming to Congress, I worked for my dad in our family  homebuilding business, and I have great respect for the work their  members do in our communities. They truly are job creators, economic  drivers, and dream makers.   I have been happy to meet with some of their members when they have  come to Capitol Hill. I can tell you that it is helpful to have face- to-face meetings with their team to talk about the issues that matter  to them the most. Though I have a background in homebuilding, many  congressional and Presidential staff do not. It makes a difference to  hear from folks on the ground in their business.   When it comes to homebuilding and homeownership, we all share the  same goal--let's keep home prices affordable.   Their advocacy has enabled millions of American families, like mine,  to make one of the most important purchases of their lives: a home.   As you know, when people achieve the American dream of homeownership,  they are on the path to wealth creation and upward mobility, not to  [[Page S3005]]  mention the sense of pride that comes with having a place to call their  own.   That sense of pride overflows to the way people invest in their  communities, and we all benefit from a more engaged neighbor. As they  know better than anyone and Sir Winston Churchill once said, ``We shape  our dwellings, and afterwards our dwellings shape us.''   When the times are good or times are tough and through the general  cyclical nature of the industry, NAHB has remained a steady advocate  for the importance of affordable and quality housing, both for  homeowners and renters. Thanks in part to them, builders and consumers  are back up on their feet.   I am grateful for their commitment to serving our Nation by building  safe and beautiful homes, and I am grateful for the 75 years of  advocacy from NAHB.   Congratulations again on achieving this major milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing the University of Montana Grizzlies softball team  for their outstanding performance at the Big Sky Conference softball  tournament. This team has come a long way in a short time, and their  journey this season is something that all Montanans can appreciate.   Last week at Ogden, UT, the Grizzlies won the Big Sky Conference  softball championship for the first time in the school's history. This  accomplishment is highlighted by the fact that the softball program is  only in its third year on campus. Four years ago, there was no team or  coach; today they are conference champions.   Jamie Pinkerton, the Grizzlies' coach, was also voted the Big Sky  Conference ``Coach of the Year'' for the second year in a row.   As conference champions, the Grizzlies will represent Big Sky in the  2017 NCAA Division I softball championship this Friday as they travel  to Washington to challenge the Huskies in the regional qualifying  round. The Grizzlies will have both the Big Sky State and the Big Sky  Conference rooting for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1164         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the travel and tourism industry is a  pillar of Montana's economy. Our wealth of public lands, first-class  fishing, hiking and skiing, and our breathtaking natural landscapes  make Montana a special place for people to visit. Last year alone,  visitors to Montana spent $3.46 billion in our state. And Montana is  not alone. The travel and tourism industry plays a significant role in  the United States economy as well, contributing over $503 billion to  the U.S. GDP just last year.   With advancements in technology and the increased use of online  marketplaces, travelers have the ability to do more research, plan  trips, and book reservations online. Online platforms allow customers  to compare thousands of brands in one place and as a result the number  of hotel reservations made online has surged over the past several  years, many of which are on legitimate third-party websites. However,  as the ease and number of online bookings has increased, so has the  number of online booking scams.   Illegitimate reservation sellers pose as hotel websites, leading  consumers to believe they are booking directly with the hotel, when in  fact they are booking with an unrelated third party. Transactions on  these sites can result in additional hidden fees, loss of expected  loyalty points, or even confirmation of reservations that were never  made. One study found that as many as fifteen million bookings a year  are affected by fraudulent websites. In Montana, you expect to get what  you pay for. When you book a hotel online only to find out you are not  on the list when you arrive, you not only lose your money, but you lose  the positive experience tourism awards.   That is why I am proud to introduce the Stop Online Booking Scams Act  of 2017 along with my colleagues Senators Nelson, Fischer, and  Klobuchar. This bill requires third-party sites to disclose that they  are not affiliated with the hotel, providing clarity and transparency  to consumers booking online. It also empowers State attorneys general  to pursue cases on behalf of consumers who have been scammed. Providing  clear disclosures that reveal the true identity of websites will give  confidence to the millions of consumers who make reservations online  every year. I ask my colleagues who have not yet done so to join me in  cosponsoring this much-needed legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Portman, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Capito,          Mr. King, Ms. Collins, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Booker):   S. 1169.

Mr. President, the travel and tourism industry is a  pillar of Montana's economy. Our wealth of public lands, first-class  fishing, hiking and skiing, and our breathtaking natural landscapes  make Montana a special place for people to visit. Last year alone,  visitors to Montana spent $3.46 billion in our state. And Montana is  not alone. The travel and tourism industry plays a significant role in  the United States economy as well, contributing over $503 billion to  the U.S. GDP just last year.   With advancements in technology and the increased use of online  marketplaces, travelers have the ability to do more research, plan  trips, and book reservations online. Online platforms allow customers  to compare thousands of brands in one place and as a result the number  of hotel reservations made online has surged over the past several  years, many of which are on legitimate third-party websites. However,  as the ease and number of online bookings has increased, so has the  number of online booking scams.   Illegitimate reservation sellers pose as hotel websites, leading  consumers to believe they are booking directly with the hotel, when in  fact they are booking with an unrelated third party. Transactions on  these sites can result in additional hidden fees, loss of expected  loyalty points, or even confirmation of reservations that were never  made. One study found that as many as fifteen million bookings a year  are affected by fraudulent websites. In Montana, you expect to get what  you pay for. When you book a hotel online only to find out you are not  on the list when you arrive, you not only lose your money, but you lose  the positive experience tourism awards.   That is why I am proud to introduce the Stop Online Booking Scams Act  of 2017 along with my colleagues Senators Nelson, Fischer, and  Klobuchar. This bill requires third-party sites to disclose that they  are not affiliated with the hotel, providing clarity and transparency  to consumers booking online. It also empowers State attorneys general  to pursue cases on behalf of consumers who have been scammed. Providing  clear disclosures that reveal the true identity of websites will give  confidence to the millions of consumers who make reservations online  every year. I ask my colleagues who have not yet done so to join me in  cosponsoring this much-needed legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______
