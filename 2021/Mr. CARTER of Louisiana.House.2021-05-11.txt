 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Scalise for his  very kind words and wonderful introduction.   First, a very special thanks to my wife, Ana, who is behind me, my  children, my family, my team, my friends, and all of my amazing  supporters. No one runs for office alone, and they were all there with  me every step of the way from the very beginning.   To God be the glory. From the Cut Off to the Congress, God is  amazing.   My mother, who could not be with us here today, Pastor Eartha Fleming  Carter, taught her children the importance of public service. I promise  I will never forget those lessons. I will continue to listen to the  concerns, the hopes, and the dreams of my district. I will work for and  be the voice of the people.   Worldwide, my district is known for Mardi Gras, great food, our  amazing culture bearers, and as the birthplace of jazz. Just as  importantly, it has 3 of the top 10 ports in the U.S., a vibrant  manufacturing base, renowned universities, rich agricultural  production, and we are the gateway to space through the Michoud  Assembly Facility in eastern New Orleans.   My district also has a lot of needs: COVID recovery, economic  development, infrastructure investment, criminal justice reform,  environmental justice, and education, to name a few. I am here to serve  my district, and I believe we can help all of our people reach their  full potential.   I commit to working with everyone in the Congress and the White House  to address those needs and to stand strong when those needs are not  being addressed.   I am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve, and I will  do so with every fiber of my very being.   I always seek God's guidance, and I will continue to do that as I  serve the people of Louisiana and this great country. I will lead with  honor and integrity.   May God continue to bless Louisiana and these United States of  America.                            ____________________
