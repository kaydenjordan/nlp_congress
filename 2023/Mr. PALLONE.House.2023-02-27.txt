 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1108 to extend the authority  of the Federal Communications Commission to auction commercial  spectrum.   Our Nation's airwaves are one of our country's most important natural  resources. Indeed, radio waves are a critical component in building  next-generation wireless networks and delivering high-speed services to  American consumers. As such, radio waves and the networks they support  can make a meaningful difference in Americans' lives by expanding the  reach of telehealth services, extending learning beyond the classroom,  and providing critical communications for public safety activities. To  achieve these notable goals, we must continue to expand the ability of  commercial users to access our airwaves.   H.R. 1108 provides a short-term extension of the Federal  Communications Commission's auction authority for roughly 2 months from  its expiration date this coming March.   It is essential that we extend this authority. Congress has never  allowed this spectrum authority to lapse, and to maintain our Nation's  global leadership in wireless innovation, we must ensure that  consistent management and oversight of spectrum remains intact, which  includes spectrum auctions. For years these auctions have efficiently  made our airwaves available for commercial use.   Importantly, though, even with the passage of this legislation, our  work will not be done. We must spend these next 2 months working with  our Senate colleagues to pass a bipartisan spectrum agreement that can  get to the President's desk before the FCC's auction authority expires  again.                                time  1730    The Energy and Commerce Committee has traditionally worked in a  bipartisan fashion on key telecommunication matters, and I commend  Chairwoman Rodgers for continuing this tradition with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this timely bill  in a bipartisan manner, and I hope the Senate will soon follow. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation  to extend this spectrum auction authority. I urge all of my colleagues  to support it in a bipartisan manner, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 538, the Informing  Consumers about Smart Devices Act.  [[Page H892]]    The Internet of Things revolution has ushered in a new age of  convenience and efficiency for the American public. Smart thermostats  can save consumers money by tracking and reporting home energy use and  making recommendations about adjusting temperatures to meet consumers'  needs. Smart refrigerators can provide recipe suggestions based on the  contents of the refrigerator. Smart ovens can scan food to  automatically optimize the cooking process. Smart coffee makers can  brew a fresh pot of coffee just as you are getting out of bed.   The American consumer is embracing these technologies. Today, the  average American home has 11 Internet of Things, or IOT, devices. Over  a quarter of consumers have at least one home automation device. These  are technologies that allow consumers to interconnect and control their  various IOT devices from one platform.   Congress should also embrace these technologies, but we must ensure  that the IOT revolution does not come at the expense of consumers'  privacy. Troubling reports have uncovered that some IOT devices may  record images or audio without the user's awareness. Researchers have  revealed that some IOT devices may accidentally record users as many as  19 times a day, collecting as much as 43 seconds of audio each time.  Robot vacuums have taken intimate images of unsuspecting consumers  which eventually ended up online.   Mr. Speaker, we must take action to combat these threats to people's  right to privacy. That is why I am proud to support the Informing  Consumers about Smart Devices Act. This legislation will require  manufacturers of IOT devices to alert consumers that a device includes  a camera or microphone if a consumer would not reasonably expect the  device to contain such features.   Last Congress, this bill was unanimously reported out of the Energy  and Commerce Committee and passed the House with broad bipartisan  support.   I thank Representative Seth Moulton for his leadership on this issue,  and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.   While this bill addresses significant privacy concerns, it is also  important that I note that we have to recommit to adopting a  comprehensive privacy framework that protects all Americans and  provides heightened protections for our children nationwide.   The American Data Privacy and Protection Act, which I authored last  Congress with Chairwoman Rodgers, would do just that. It would ensure  that consumers, wherever they reside in this country, will have  meaningful control over their personal information and that children  will have heightened privacy protections. It also provides clear and  consistent rules of the road on privacy and data security to  innovators, entrepreneurs, and small tech companies.   I appreciate that we are advancing today's legislation on a  bipartisan basis. I know this legislation is important, but I also look  forward to working with Chairwoman Rodgers to pass the American Data  Privacy and Protection Act on a bipartisan basis in this Congress, as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the Democratic sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I will just close by saying I do think this is an  important bill for consumers, and I thank the sponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1059, the SECURE Notarization  Act.   Today, thanks to modern technology, we can oftentimes cash a check,  book a flight, and lock and unlock our doors all from the convenience  of our smartphone. But that same convenience does not exist for getting  something notarized in many States.   People are often required to go through the notary process, the  process of authenticating the signatory to a document for wills,  mortgages, and purchasing or transferring valuable assets. Today, many  States will require a person to physically appear before a notary  public in order to complete this process.   Now, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person  notarizations were not only inconvenient, but they also posed a health  risk. In-person notarization requirements forced far too many consumers  to choose between potentially exposing themselves to COVID-19 and  purchasing a house or updating their wills.   To protect consumers and commerce, dozens of States enacted laws or  took emergency actions to permit electronic and remote online  notarizations. These notarizations allowed the consumer and the notary  to execute notarizations through secure audiovisual communications.   As our lives have returned to a new normal, it has become apparent  that electronic and remote online notarizations are a valuable tool for  facilitating commerce and making these services more accessible.   Such tools are particularly important for vulnerable populations like  the elderly, underserved communities, and others with mobility issues  or lacking access to reliable and inexpensive transportation. But State  action alone cannot assure universal access to electronic and remote  online notarizations that meet robust security standards and consumer  protections.   Our Nation lacks the universal standard for electronic and remote  online notarizations. As a result, there is no standard that permits  nationwide use of electronic and remote online notarizations. There is  no standard that creates robust security requirements and there is no  standard that ensures electronic and remote online notarizations are  valid nationwide.   That is why I am proud to support the SECURE Notarization Act. This  legislation will transition notarizations to the 21st century without  sacrificing security, making the process more convenient and safer for  the American public.   Last Congress, this bill was unanimously reported out of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce and passed the House with broad  bipartisan support. I commend Representative Dean for her leadership on  this bipartisan legislation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the Democratic sponsor of  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge support for this bill. Once  again, it did pass the last time in Congress. We hope we can get it to  the Senate. It is important to have a nationwide standard for  notarization.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
