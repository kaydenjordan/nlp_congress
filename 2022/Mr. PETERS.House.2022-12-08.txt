 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Respect for  Marriage Act. Today, we celebrate equality, fairness, and love.   Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell, all loving couples  have had a right to marry across our country. However, if the Supreme  Court won't protect Americans, especially in light of the repeal of  Roe, we in Congress must do everything in our power to defend those  freedoms.   The Respect for Marriage Act ensures Federal marriage equality by  guaranteeing the Federal rights, benefits, and obligations of  marriages. Today's legislation provides certainty for those couples,  and all future couples, that the Federal Government will continue to  recognize their marriages, no matter where they live or who they are  married to.   I am proud to support this historic bill alongside members of both  parties to protect the rights of San Diegans and Americans across the  country.
