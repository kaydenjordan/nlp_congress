 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of National Adoption Day  this coming Saturday.   National Adoption Day began in 2000 when seven cities opened  courtrooms on the Saturday before Thanksgiving to alleviate the backlog  of pending adoptions. Since then, more than 65,000 children have had  their adoption finalized during a National Adoption Day celebration.   The number of North Carolina children in foster care has been  increasing, with last year totaling nearly 11,000. There are more than  425,000 children in foster care nationwide, with over 110,000 awaiting  adoption by permanent families.   National Adoption Day aims to raise awareness of these children and  educate the estimated 47 million Americans who have considered adopting  a child in foster care.   May this year's effort be another success by connecting children  awaiting adoption with parents who can provide the love and stable  environment they need to realize their potential.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further  consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 1138) condemning the anti- Semitic attack on the building housing three congregations, Tree of  Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light, honoring the memory of the victims of  the attack, and offering condolences to and expressing support for  their families, friends, and community, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the text at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the preamble at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the order of the  House of January 8, 2018, regarding morning-hour debate not apply  tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that further  proceedings on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R.  5787) to amend the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to give effect to more  accurate maps of units of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources  System that were produced by digital mapping of such units, and for  other purposes, may be postponed through the legislative day of  November 16, 2018, as though under clause 8 of rule XX.
