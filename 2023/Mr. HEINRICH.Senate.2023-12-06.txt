 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just  want to make a point that we need a complete security package. All of  these things are related, and all of them reinforce not only our allies  and innocent civilians but also our own security and the future of the  direction of the free world.   We are not going to turn our back on Ukraine. How many meetings did  we  [[Page S5799]]  have via Zoom or actually in person with Zelenskyy where so many of our  colleagues said we would always stand with Ukraine after all that  Ukraine has been through. And I remember being in briefings where  people were predicting that Ukraine would crumble in a matter of days.  And they stood up to the Russian aggression and they continue to stand  up to Russian aggression and they have actually pushed Russia back.  That isn't just in Ukraine's interest. That is in the interest of the  free world.   We need a security package that supports our allies in Israel, that  supports the innocent civilians in Gaza that are also the victims of  what Hamas has done. And we need a security package that stands with  our allies in Ukraine.   Mr. President, I would offer the rest of my time to my colleague from  Hawaii.
