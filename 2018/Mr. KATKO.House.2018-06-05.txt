 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Roderick Allison,  Acting Deputy Administrator of the Transportation Security  Administration, who recently announced his retirement from TSA after 33  years of government service.   Mr. Allison's career began in 1985 with 13 years in the U.S. Army at  the National Security Agency and 7th Special Forces Group.   In 1998, Director Allison's career with the Federal Air Marshal  Service began when the program was part of the FAA.   Following the events of 9/11, Mr. Allison returned to the Federal Air  Marshal Service and has served with distinction in several critical  roles throughout TSA, including Acting Administrator, Acting Chief of  Staff, and Acting Chief of Operations.   Since becoming Director of the Federal Air Marshal Service in May of  2014, Mr. Allison has been widely recognized for his resolute  leadership, integrity, and commitment to the mission of TSA and the  Federal Air Marshal Service. He truly is a leader among leaders. He has  established a lasting legacy, both through action and mentorship, that  will continue to have a positive impact on TSA and Federal Air Marshal  Service personnel for many years to come.    Thank you for your service, Mr. Allison.                            ____________________
