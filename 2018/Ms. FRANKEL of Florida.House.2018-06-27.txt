 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, research shows that when women  have a seat at the table, the prospect that peace negotiations will  succeed rises significantly.   The Women, Peace, and Security Act enacted into law last year  requires the Department of Defense to leverage the unique roles women  bring to the table in peace building, conflict resolution, and military  operations.   This amendment would build on this law by allocating additional  funding for full-time gender advisers, training foreign security forces  on how to include women in their security efforts, and research on  women's contributions to security at the National Defense University.   Mr. Chair, according to Womankind World, which is a global women's  rights organization, women and girls suffer disproportionately during  violent conflict. Sexual violence is often used as an instrument of  war. Although men and boys also may be abused, it is this way that  women and girls are primarily targeted. For example, during Sierra  Leone's 11-year civil war, an estimated 250,000 women experienced  sexual violence.   The destabilizing effect of conflict on families and communities can  mean other forms of violence increasing in intensity, including  domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and trafficking. Refugee women  and girls are especially vulnerable.   Although they are disproportionately affected by conflict, women seem  to be sidelined from formal conflict resolution and peace processes,  meaning that postconflict recovery and reconciliation programs often  overlook women's specific needs.   Over the last two decades, women accounted for just 9 percent of  negotiators at peace tables. Out of 585 peace agreements from 1990 to  2010, only 92 contained any reference to women.   Despite that, women play an essential role in building peace in local  communities. However, of course, women face multiple barriers. Even so,  evidence shows that formal peace agreements that include women's  perspectives are most likely to last.   Mr. Chair, we have an opportunity to make women's voices heard and to  make the world a safer place. I urge adoption of this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
