 Mr. Speaker, when we go home, our constituents ask us:  What is the Congress doing? What has the Congress done?   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise proudly to let the American people know that  Democrats are fighting for the people. In 2019, alone, we have passed  nearly 400 bills, over 275 of which were bipartisan.   To name a few: a once-in-a-generation gun violence prevention bill,  raising the minimum wage, protecting people with preexisting healthcare  conditions, and keeping the United States in the Paris climate  agreement.   I am proud that I have authored two bills that have passed the House:  one to make home buying more affordable--we have a problem with  affordable housing--another to make the financial system more diverse  and inclusive, H.R. 281. In addition, I have three bills that were  adopted as amendments into legislation.   Unfortunately, 300 bills are over there with Mr. McConnell. Let's get  them out of the graveyard so they don't die on the vine.                            ____________________
