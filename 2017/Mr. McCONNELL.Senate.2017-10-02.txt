 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now observe a moment of silence for the victims of the Las Vegas  attack.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senate will now observe a moment of silence for the victims of  the attack in Las Vegas.   (Moment of silence.)    Mr. President, the news we awoke to this morning was  heartbreaking. What happened in Las Vegas is shocking, it is tragic,  and for those affected and their families, it is devastating. It is  hard to even imagine their pain. I hope they will know that we are  praying for them now. I hope they will find strength in the love and  kindness of those around them in these hours of such darkness and pain.  I hope they will see that our country is standing by their side today.   Many Americans are still in shock. Others have begun to wonder why  someone would do something this terrible. Investigators will continue  their dedicated work in search of answers, but what is clear now is  that this is a moment for national mourning and for prayer.   Just a moment ago, President Trump led the country in observing a  moment of silence. As he noted this morning, we are all grateful for  the courageous efforts of the first responders. They always put their  lives on the line to save others. They do so with a selflessness that  reminds us of the inherent courage and mercy that remains possible  within each of us--light amidst the dark, hope in times of terrible  grief.   The same is true of the national spirit of compassion that shines  through our country in the moments when it is needed most. Whether it  is lining up to donate blood or signing up to volunteer their time, our  fellow Americans are always there to offer what they can when others  are in need.   We thank these Americans and law enforcement and the first responders  for everything they have done. We thank them for their efforts that  continue now.   We again send our condolences to everyone affected by this terrible  tragedy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 119, Lee Francis Cissna.

Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate a special  anniversary in my home State. The Salmon P. Chase College of Law at  Northern Kentucky University, NKU, is marking its 125th year of  educating students and helping them follow their dreams in the legal  field.   Chase's story is one of transformation and innovation, and through it  all, the school has produced graduates prepared to excel in the legal  field. Originally founded in Ohio, Chase was only the third law school  in the Nation to offer night programs. Since then, Chase has crossed  the Ohio River into Kentucky, joined with NKU, and continued to find  the best ways to grow as a respected institution.   Named after Salmon P. Chase, the sixth Chief Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court, the college is known as the Lawyer's School for its  commitment to helping students be practice-ready upon graduation. Today  Chase is a proud part of Kentucky's legal community. With graduates in  a wide range of careers, including serving as Federal judges and as  Members of Congress, Chase's impact has grown considerably since its  founding. It is also the proud home to a nationally recognized moot  court team and has led the Commonwealth in the bar exam passage rate in  recent years.   These successes wouldn't be possible without the dedicated work of  Chase's faculty, staff, and administration. I would like to extend my  sincere congratulations to Jeffrey Standen, who serves as dean and  professor at Chase. Under his leadership, Chase has continued its  growth, innovation, and achievement. The school's distinguished faculty  come from some of the highest levels of the bench and bar with the  experiences and passion to prepare students for success in their  careers. The school's alumni, more than 5,000 and counting, are using  their skills in more than 47 States, in Washington DC, and around the  globe.   I would also like to thank NKU's interim president Gerard St. Amand,  a current professor and former dean of Chase himself, for his  commitment to the university and his willingness to help guide the  community.   Each time I have had the opportunity to engage with Chase students, I  have noted their intellectual curiosity and their passion for the law.   The Chase College of Law has grown so much in the last 125 years, and  it has become an integral part of Kentucky's legal community. I am  proud to join with the Chase students, faculty, staff, administration,  and alumni to commemorate this occasion. I urge my colleagues to help  me celebrate Chase's quasquicentennial anniversary, and I look forward  to many more years of accomplishments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.
