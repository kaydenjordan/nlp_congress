 Mr. President, let me begin with a quote:         I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking of using the       debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge.    These words are not mine. They are not even the words of a Democrat.  They come from former President Donald Trump.   For all of his terrible flaws--in this case, I would say a broken  clock is right twice a day--even Donald Trump understood what House  Republicans today do not: The full faith and credit of the United  States must never be taken hostage.   Again, to quote former President Trump:         I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking of using the       debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge.    Time is ticking before the United States enters into a first-ever  default on the national debt if things don't change.   Yesterday, Speaker McCarthy met with House Republicans in the hopes  of uniting his party around a single framework of cuts, albeit one that  will never become law. Speaker McCarthy's meeting, from all reports,  did not go well, to put it lightly.   One GOP Member said yesterday:         I am still a no.   Another from Florida:         I think that they should go further. . . . I am in favor of       very aggressive cuts.    Another from South Carolina:         I'm not there yet.    We could go on and on with these quotes.   Even now, Speaker McCarthy--this is months and months after he  proposed making deep cuts as a condition, as brinksmanship, as hostage- taking, to just simply make sure that we avoid default--even now, he is  still very short of the support he needs to pass a debt ceiling bill  because the chasm is too big between moderates and the hard-right  extremists who are glad to see the economy taken hostage in exchange  for their priorities.   As the Washington Post wrote this weekend:         Many GOP lawmakers and aides admit it is not even clear       whether their emerging plan can actually attract 218 votes.   [[Page S1220]]     And now the clock is ticking. We are getting closer and closer to  when we have to act to avoid default.   So for all the speeches, for all the letters, for all the wish lists  and meetings with this family or that family, the underlying facts  haven't changed: At this point, Speaker McCarthy does not have a plan  for avoiding a catastrophic default on the debt.   I quoted one former Republican President, let me quote another,  Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan said:         [Debt ceiling] brinksmanship threatens the holders of       government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and       veterans benefits.    And:         The United States has a special responsibility to itself       and to the world to meet its obligations.    When Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump say that the Republican strategy  led by Speaker McCarthy is folly, you know how far right the whole MAGA  Republican House has gone. Things that were accepted a few years ago,  by very conservative Republican Presidents--Reagan, Trump--now seem to  be discarded in a headlong rush to make the kind of deep cuts that  Americans will never support and to tie it to the debt ceiling, which  could head us crashing into default.   The solution to this entire mess is staring Republicans right in the  face: Do what we did three times under Donald Trump and twice under  President Biden and work with Democrats to avoid default without  brinksmanship, without blackmail, and without hostage-taking. If  Republicans drop their hostage-taking and approach Democrats in good  faith, the default crisis could be resolved. But if Speaker McCarthy  does not change course, he--he--will be leading America into default of  not paying our debts for the first time.                                   FOX News    Mr. President, on FOX News, yesterday, FOX News agreed to pay nearly  $800 million to end a defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting  Systems after FOX spent months lying about the 2020 election. It is one  of the largest settlements ever in a defamation case.   Trial or no trial, the world sees that FOX News knowingly and  intentionally lied to the country about the 2020 election. The amazing  thing is that FOX knew that these were lies, and they still put that  propaganda on the air. And it is not just trivial lies; it is lies that  go to the essence of our democracy. To think that the leaders of FOX  News, Rupert Murdoch, don't give a hoot about democracy and still would  put these lies on for political or mercenary purposes is just galling,  appalling, and, frankly, downright against what America stands for and  has stood for for hundreds of years.   FOX commentators spread conspiracy theories and passed them off as  news. They spread distrust in our democracy and claimed it was a  legitimate concern. So FOX News's legacy and Rupert Murdoch's legacy is  forever sealed as the network that sought to undermine American  democracy one prime-time segment at a time. FOX News's legacy is sealed  as the network that has minuscule reward for the truth and would  knowingly lie to achieve political and mercenary goals.   Even without a single witness taking the stand, what we do know about  this case is shocking. Under oath, Rupert Murdoch the owners of FOX  News, admitted his hosts were spreading the narrative of the Big Lie.  We are not just throwing rhetoric around here; these are facts. Here is  what Murdoch said: ``Maybe Sean [Hannity] and Laura [Ingraham] went too  far,'' he admitted in one email. That is certainly a way to put it.   Asked if he could have stopped the lies, Mr. Murdoch admitted:         I could have . . . but I didn't.    Amazing. Amazing.   So settlement or not, there is no question that FOX News lied. Sadly,  too much damage has already been done. A significant segment of  voters--by some measures as much as 30 percent of the electorate--still  do not believe the 2020 election was legitimate. And when people start  doubting that elections are legitimate, that is the beginning of the  end of a democracy. It is just galling.    Again, this is not lying about some trivial thing; this is lying that  undermines the essence of what America has been all about.   And 2 years after the Presidential election, FOX News still lies  about what happened in 2020. Not 2 months ago, Tucker Carlson claimed  January 6 was not an insurrection, using manipulated security footage  provided to him exclusively by Speaker McCarthy. FOX News has not shown  any remorse--any remorse--for undermining our democracy and blatantly  lying.   Again, Rupert Murdoch's legacy and FOX News's legacy is sealed. They  will forever be remembered as the ones who sought to break American  democracy from within by lying about it.   For their own sake--even more importantly, for the sake of our great  country--Mr. Murdoch and FOX News leadership should put a halt to the  spread of the Big Lie on their network because when enough people  believe elections are not on the level, that is the beginning death  knell of a democracy.                                   Abortion    Mr. President, now on the abortion issue and military holds, for the  last 10 months, the American people have made clear they reject the  hard right's war on women. After many ballot initiatives, special  elections, and one disastrous midterm for the GOP, there is no denying  that the MAGA obsession with attacking women's freedom of choice has  been a disaster. And yet, the more Americans reject MAGA extremism,  particularly on the issue of choice, the more MAGA Republicans double  down. Now, through the actions of one Senator, even military families  have been taken hostage by the hard right.   We are talking about women veterans. We are talking about women who  volunteer and risk their lives oftentimes for us. And now this hard- right group is telling them they don't have the right to decide what to  do when it comes to their bodies and their healthcare--it is  outrageous. The same people on the other side who praise our military  and our soldiers are treating women as second-class citizens. That is  outrageous.   It is outrageous when they do it to all women, but particularly  outrageous when they do it to women veterans, women who serve because  they, again, are our heroes and risk their lives for us.   And now, through the actions of one Senator, even military families  have been taken hostage by the hard right. Today, the Senator from  Alabama will push legislation that would take away reproductive care  for hundreds of thousands of veterans and their families. It is the  extreme kind of proposal millions of Americans strongly oppose and one  which, if passed, would gravely harm the health of women, particularly  our veterans.   Senator Tuberville's legislation is bad on its own, but he has made  it even worse because he continues threatening our national security by  blocking over 180 military promotions. The Secretary of Defense himself  and so many of our leading military figures, past and present, have  warned us that this delay is dangerous to the security of America.   What is equally disappointing as the Senator from Alabama's reckless  action, it is disappointing to see that more of my colleagues on the  other side have not yet called out the Senator's reckless stunts. I  thank those who, indeed, have raised their voice, but we need more.   Republicans who claim to be such supporters of our military all of a  sudden have gone mum, silent, when the Senator from Alabama risks  military security because he believes passionately in something. Every  one of us could do this. No one has chosen to do it the way the Senator  has.   It is a new chapter, a sad chapter. We hope it will end soon, that,  whether publicly or privately, our Republican colleagues go to him and  say this is just dead wrong, no matter how passionately he feels.   And why is Senator Tuberville doing this? Because he wants to make  the healthcare decisions for the women of our military. He wants to  decide that. The military shouldn't decide it. The country shouldn't  decide it. The women shouldn't decide it. He wants to make that  decision. What arrogance.   He is threatening to permanently inject politics into the  confirmation of routine military promotions so he can  [[Page S1221]]  push the MAGA hardline on blocking women's choice.   This is the MAGA hard right in a nutshell: Eliminate women's choice  at all costs, even at the cost of our national defense.   I urge my colleagues sincerely, passionately, as passionately as he  is, maybe even more so, to drop his hold, and I will certainly oppose  this measure later today.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when the health and safety of our country  is at risk, it is up to veterans to step up to protect us. They risk  their lives for us. They are always there for us. But today Senator  Tuberville from Alabama is pushing legislation that would take away  reproductive care for hundreds of thousands of veterans and their  families. That is right. The hard right is telling our veterans they  should be treated as second-class citizens, our women veterans.   It is the kind of extreme proposal millions of Americans strongly  oppose and one which, if it is passed, would gravely harm women's  health. There are over 150,000 women veterans. They risk their lives  for us. Now we must protect them.   The more Americans reject MAGA extremism, the more MAGA Republicans  seem to double down, and this bill is a perfect example. That is the  MAGA right in a nutshell: Eliminate women's choice at all costs, even  at the cost of our national defense. Again, the MAGA right says:  Eliminate women's choice at all costs, even at the cost of national  defense.   Here is the bottom line: Our veterans dedicated their lives to our  freedom so we should protect their freedom of choice, plain and simple.                              Order of Procedure    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to  the Scott of Florida amendment No. 81 occur following the vote on the  motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 10; further, I ask that the Senate vote  at 11:15 a.m. tomorrow in relation to amendment Nos. 85 and 83; and the  Senate vote on passage of S. 870, as amended, if amended, at 1:45 p.m.,  with all provisions under the previous order remaining in effect.    I yield the floor, and I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on  this CRA, this awful CRA.                                Vote on Motion
