 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Vice President  traveled to North Carolina to tout the Biden administration's so-called  accomplishments in helping our Nation's small businesses.   Well, the American people can see through the Vice President's PR  stunt and know sky-high inflation, worker shortages, and supply chain  disruptions are nothing to celebrate.   I have been a small business owner for 52 years and still am, and I  know these economic headwinds job creators are facing firsthand.   The reality is small businesses are worse off due to this  administration's disastrous policies and out-of-control Washington  spending.   As the chairman of the Small Businesses Committee, I welcome anyone  who wants to celebrate entrepreneurship and recognize our great small  businesses.   However, no amount of media events will change the dire reality Main  Street continues to experience under  [[Page H588]]  this administration's 2-year crackdown on job creators.   More needs to be done to unleash the full potential of Main Street,  and the direction must change before anyone goes on a victory lap or  asks for a trophy.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
