 Mr. Speaker, today I rise because today  former Senator Bob Dole will receive the Nation's highest civilian  honor to recognize his decades of service as a soldier, a lawmaker, and  a statesman. House and Senate leaders will present the 94-year-old  former Senator with the Congressional Gold Medal.   Senator Dole represented Kansas for 35 years: first as a  Representative of this House, and later lending his leadership to the  U.S. Senate. In 1996, he was the GOP candidate for President.   President Ronald Reagan, in 1989, said that Senator Dole served  America heroically and ``has . . . been a friend to veterans, farmers,  and Americans from every walk of life. Bob Dole has stood for  integrity, straight talk, and achievement throughout his years of  distinguished public service.''   Senator Dole has served this country, this Nation, on the  battlefield, enlisting with the U.S. Army during World War II. During a  military offensive in Italy, he was seriously wounded while trying to  save a fellow soldier. Despite his grave injuries, Dole recovered and  was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star with an oak cluster for  his service, among other medals.   I am proud that we will honor Senator Dole today for his life of  service to the United States both in the military and here on Capitol  Hill. It is sure to be a moving ceremony in honor of a real American  hero.                      Honoring Army Secretary Mark Esper     Mr. Speaker, service to one's country  is among the most notable and selfless acts throughout history. Our  military men and women have shown uncompromising honor, dedication to  duty, and genuine love of country.   This evening, Members of Congress will have an opportunity to meet  the 23rd Secretary of the Army, the Honorable Mark T. Esper. Secretary  Esper is a 1986 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He  served on Active Duty for more than 10 years before transitioning into  the Reserve, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel.   Secretary Esper's service included deployment with the 101st Airborne  Division during Operation Desert Storm. For his valor during that  operation, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.   Proudly, the Secretary is a Pennsylvania native. He graduated from  Laurel Highlands High School in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1982.  Secretary Esper later earned a master's degree in public administration  from Harvard and a doctorate from George Washington University.   I am looking forward to meeting the Secretary tonight thanks to the  reception hosted by the House Army Caucus.   In addition to the Secretary, we will be joined by General Mark  Milley, the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army. The Army senior leaders  and members of the Army staff will also attend.   This reception provides an important opportunity for Members to meet  directly with Secretary Esper and General Milley as well as the Army  staff to gain their perspectives on the strategic environment facing  the Army during the 115th Congress and discuss issues facing our Army,  our soldiers, and their families.   Two outstanding events will take place today in the Capitol, and I  look forward to both of these historic occasions.         Congratulating the Pennsylvania State Showmen's Association     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  Pennsylvania State Showmen's Association on the occasion of their 50th  anniversary. I look forward to joining them Friday evening at their  annual Pennsylvania State Showmen's Association convention as they  celebrate this monumental milestone.   The Pennsylvania State Showmen's Association has served to keep the  outdoor amusement industry alive and strong through their combined  efforts. The PSSA has grown because its members have learned to put  their individual goals aside for the common goals of the industry. This  unity really has given them the strength and foresight necessary to  continue their work into the next century.   Their annual convention and trade show brings together board members,  volunteers, and staff from most of the 109 Pennsylvania county and  local fairs.   For 14 years, their supportive scholarships have generated more than  $200,000.  [[Page H417]]                                     time  1015    Their investment in our Commonwealth's next generation of leadership  is to be commended.   Thanks to all the members of the Pennsylvania State Showmen's  Association for the work that they do, to the best of their human  ability, to keep the outdoor amusement industry the best of America's  family entertainment. Congratulations and happy 50th.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Emporium Borough Mayor Bruno Carnovale on his upcoming  retirement after more than 50 years of service to the community.   Mayor Carnovale first served as a council person for 18 years, then  as civil service chairperson for the Emporium Borough Police Department  for 4 years, and, most recently, as mayor beginning in 1988.   It was 1966 when Bruno Carnovale ran for office with the goal of  finding a solution to continual flooding problems near Oak Street. He  stuck around long after that goal was achieved.   Mayor Carnovale grew up in Johnsonburg, but he has had connections to  Emporium since spending childhood summers working on his grandfather's  farm. After high school graduation, he moved to Emporium and briefly  went to work for Sylvania before joining the Navy during World War II.  After the war, he returned to Sylvania and became a senior electrical  designer, certified electrical inspector, and master electrician.   Mayor Carnovale has been active with The American Legion, Lions Club,  Cameron County Republican Committee, the American Cancer Society, and  he is an active member of St. Mark's Church.   Mr. Speaker, I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement, and  I thank him for his service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   What an outstanding turnout tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here tonight and participate in this  Special Order to celebrate the sanctity of human life and redouble my  commitment to protecting the most vulnerable among us: the unborn.   I want to thank Congressman Chris Smith for hosting this opportunity  tonight. He has certainly been a champion of the pro-life moment, and  this week marks the 45th anniversary of Roe V. Wade, the Supreme Court  decision that set constitutional precedent on the issue of abortion.   That decision also ignited the pro-life movement, which was already  taking shape.   And this movement will be witnessed on Friday, when more than 100,000  pro-lifers from across the country will come to Washington, D.C. for  the 45th annual March for Life. This year's theme is ``Love Saves  Lives.''   And, Mr. Speaker, it surely does.   Thanks to the pro-life movement, abortion rates across the country  are at the lowest since 2013.   Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania remains one of the top  protective states in the nation to provide legal protections for human  life from conception to natural death, according to Americans United  for Life.   From 2015 to 2016, we saw a 3 percent decline in abortions in  Pennsylvania, and these statics reflect important Pennsylvania State  laws, such as, the ban on sex-selection abortion.   These figures are certainly welcome news, but the fight is not over  and there is more work to be done.   I know this House will continue to work tirelessly at the federal  level to put the health and safety of women and children first. Pro- life education and legislative efforts are making an impact on our  culture and in the lives of women facing unexpected pregnancies.   We must always be a voice for the voiceless. And we must continue to  build a culture that values life and respects mothers and their  children.   I am proud to be part of this movement and I thank every individual  here tonight for their commitment to this important cause.   Because we all know that ``Love Saves Lives.''
