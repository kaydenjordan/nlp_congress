 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week to recognize the members of law enforcement who bravely serve to  protect our communities across the Nation.   I would also like to give a special recognition to Detective Stacy  Hinshaw from the Lawrence Police Department for being named detective  of the year. During the year 2020, Detective Hinshaw worked over 119  cases, the vast majority involving complex child abuse and sexual  assaults. Detective Hinshaw has developed an extensive network of  support resources for victims in partnership with many community  organizations and has been recognized by the FBI and the U.S.  Attorney's office for her work.   Congratulations to Detective Stacy Hinshaw, and I would like to  extend my deepest gratitude for all law enforcement officers.  [[Page H2212]]                                ____________________
