 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a great  leader and an exceptional officer, Rear Admiral Patrick ``Pat'' A.  Piercey who will soon retire from the U.S. Navy after over 35 years of  dedicated service to the Nation. Rear Admiral Piercey is a native of  Clinton, OK, and graduated with distinction from the U.S. Naval Academy  in 1985. He is a true professional and a dedicated leader. Throughout  his career, he commanded our great sailors at many levels, deployed  numerous times in defense of the Nation and served in some of the most  critical positions in our Navy. Rear Admiral Piercey has provided  outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on  numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Navy, Congress,  and the Nation.   Rear Admiral Piercey commanded USS Howard--DDG 83--USS Bunker Hill-- CG 52--Carrier Strike Group 9, and Naval Surface Forces Atlantic. Due  to his sound judgment and intellect, Rear Admiral Piercey served in  many critical assignments, including special assistant to the Deputy  Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, executive  assistant to the Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, and Director for Operations--J3--U.S. Inda-Pacific Command.   For the past 2 years, Rear Admiral Piercey has served as the Chief of  Staff of U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. During this  period of extraordinary change and challenge in Europe's security  environment, Rear Admiral Piercey has improved relationships with NATO  allies and European partners. Through his strategic vision, he has  successfully positioned U.S. European Command to meet every mission  requirement in Europe.   On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Congress, I want to  thank Rear Admiral Piercey for his decades of dedicated service to the  Navy and our Nation. I am sure that many officers and sailors will  continue to emulate him as a role model for service, sacrifice and  leadership. I also want to thank his wife, Katherine, and their  children, Rebecca and Andrew, for their sacrifices and tremendous  support. I join my colleagues in wishing him and his family fair winds  and following seas and future success in retirement.                            ____________________
