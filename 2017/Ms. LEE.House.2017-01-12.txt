 Mr. Speaker, let me first say how happy I am today to  acknowledge the extraordinary accomplishments of two high school  football teams in my beautiful congressional district. Until now,  Oakland, California, never held a State championship, but now we have  two. On December 17, Bishop O'Dowd clinched the CIF State Division 5-AA  Championship. They beat Valley View High School 43-24, with former  Oakland Raiders running back Coach Napoleon Kaufman leading them to  victory. The same day, McClymonds' Warriors claimed the CIF State 5-A  Championship with a 20-17 victory, becoming the first Oakland Athletic  League team to win a State championship.   McClymonds is a public historic high school in the West Oakland  community of my district. Coach Michael Peters has coached McClymonds  since 1992 and has shown his commitment over the years to ensuring his  athletes succeed both on the field and in the classroom.   Bishop O'Dowd, a Catholic high school, has been an athletic force for  years, and I am so proud of their team. They have achieved the historic  accomplishment of their championship also.   These young athletes have embodied the spirit, the passion, and the  sportsmanship of Oakland and the entire East Bay. Please join me in  congratulating them on these championships.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey  for yielding, but also for her tremendous leadership on so many issues,  including as a champion for women and women's health and reproductive  health care, and also for this important discussion tonight.                                time  1915    I just want to mention that I serve on the Budget Committee, and you  mentioned a nominee, Congressman Tom Price of Georgia, for Secretary of  Health and Human Services. Once again, we see President-elect Donald  Trump making recommendations of those individuals who want to dismantle  the safety net and dismantle health care within the agencies that they  are going to run. This is a very, very troubling development in terms  of these cabinet appointee nominees.   I note that--and many know--President-elect Trump ran one of the most  divisive and prejudiced campaigns that we have witnessed in modern  history. Since winning the Presidency, he has nominated billionaires to  serve in his cabinet, proving that he will govern just as he  campaigned. Also, he has nominated individuals who want to dismantle,  for the most part, the agencies that they will have jurisdiction over.   Another example is his choice for Secretary of State, which  Congresswoman Watson Coleman mentioned, and that is Rex Tillerson. I  serve on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee and understand the  importance of our diplomatic initiatives, our USAID initiatives, and  our efforts to really bring education and health care to the poorest of  the poor around the world. Our Secretary of State serves as the  Nation's chief diplomat and represents America's interests around the  world. I have the opportunity and the privilege to serve on the  committee that funds the majority of these efforts.   So the nomination of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson really troubles  me. His extensive ties to the Kremlin raises the question: Whose  interest will he represent?   Our country cannot afford a Secretary of State who will place private  corporate interests over the needs of the American people and our  national security interests. His recent confirmation hearing revealed  what we have known all along in Republican-controlled Washington, that  cabinet officials will cater to special interests, not to American  families, based on the nominees that we have seen come forward.   It is not just the Secretary of State we should be concerned about.  Here at home, President-elect Trump has nominated cabinet officials  that would turn back the clock on progress. His nomination for  Secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, is another millionaire CEO who  benefits from an economy rigged against families struggling to make  ends meet. He earns more than $1 million a year, but opposes a raise  for low-wage workers earning just $15,000 a year. He says that food  assistance programs keep low-wage workers like those he employs at, I  believe, Carl's Jr. and Hardee's--he says that if low-wage workers  apply for these food assistance programs, then the programs actually  discourage work. There are millions of people who are working two jobs  being paid minimum wage who need food assistance, who need food stamps,  because they can't survive in today's economy.   So the working, poor, low-income individuals, should be very troubled  by this appointment as Secretary of Labor, which is supposed to look  out for the rights of working men and women. We need a Labor Secretary  committed to helping working families and addressing the epidemic of  poverty, not one who caters to the most affluent.   Also, by nominating Senator Sessions to lead the Justice Department,  President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear that he will abandon  our fundamental civil and human rights. Senator Sessions has a long  history of opposing civil rights and equality. I am very proud of  members of the Congressional Black Caucus for really setting forth his  record and his history, such as laying out the fact that he was  rejected from serving as a Federal judge due to his blatantly racist  comment. He forcefully degraded the LGBT community, opposed the  Violence Against Women Act, and violated the Voting Rights Act, calling  it an intrusive piece of legislation.   Clearly, someone who has publicly shown prejudice and intolerance is  not qualified to serve as the chief law enforcement for our civil  rights laws. Once again, you see a nominee who really doesn't believe  in the values of liberty and justice for all, a person to head an  agency that is supposed to be an agency that ensures the civil and  human rights for all. Let me be clear, these nominations are a chilling  indication of how a Trump administration intends to govern.   Our Nation has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect,  preserve, and expand civil rights, civil liberties, and human rights  for all Americans. We will not allow a Trump administration to drag us  back into the past.   Finally, let me just say something that is troubling me tremendously  at this point in our history. Our Nation prides itself on being a  democracy. We actually promote democracy abroad through our democracy  programs, which, of course, I have historically opposed. The point I am  trying to make and want to make clear is that this new administration,  when you look at the majority of cabinet nominees, they are very, very  wealthy and do not fundamentally believe in a strong public sector and  in many ways do not support the mission of the cabinets they are  actually asked to lead.   Privatizing Medicare and other public sector programs that ensure  that the most vulnerable have a safety net and an opportunity to live  the American Dream by privatizing these agencies is dangerous. It will  lead to chaos. Private sector takeover of the government is dangerous  and it erodes our public institutions that are required in a democracy.   So, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, I believe this is the dangerous,  slippery slope that this administration has embarked upon, and we need  to expose every step of the way who these individuals are, their  background, and we have to urge that they comply with the ethics  requirement and submit their financial disclosure statements and all  the required ethics forms so that the public will know who they are. We  must be transparent and, of course, we would like for our President- elect to release his income taxes also.   Again, we kind of see what is taking place now. We knew this during  the campaign. I thought that we were going to see now more of an effort  to unify the country, but, unfortunately, I think these nominees show  us which direction, unfortunately, this new administration will take.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the Congresswoman. It is true. As we see  the unfolding of some of the drama that is taking place, including that  which affects us and is associated with Russia, it is even more  important than ever that the President show us that he is not hiding  anything regarding his relationships that potentially present a  contradiction of his first and foremost responsibility to us and show  us his tax returns.   I thank the gentlewoman from California very much for being here.   I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).
