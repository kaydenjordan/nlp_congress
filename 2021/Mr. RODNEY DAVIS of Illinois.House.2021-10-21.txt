 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and  colleague from Indiana (Mr. Banks) for yielding.   I can tell you, when I got elected to serve in this body almost 9  years ago, I didn't expect to be standing here today to talk about such  an important issue.   I spent 16 years as a congressional staffer working for a Member of  Congress whom I looked up to and who respected this institution for  what it was and what it meant to our country.   When I came to Congress to serve with him, I had the utmost respect  for this institution at the same time. That is why I wanted to be part  of the House Administration Committee because I wanted to make this  Congress and this House work better, act in a much more bipartisan  manner, and make sure that we protect those who run this campus, but  also at the same time protect those who protect us.   Madam Speaker, we are now months and months in, months and months  [[Page H5761]]  post January 6. From my many conversations with U.S. Capitol Police  officers and those who work on this campus, they have the same concerns  I have.   The question they ask is: Why were we so unprotected on January 6?  And what has changed since then?                                time  1500    Getting to the bottom of those questions should be the top priority  for all of us in this House. There are serious security vulnerabilities  that have not been addressed by this House in nearly 11 months after  January 6. And this is what the majority has decided to spend its time  on, holding a private citizen, who wasn't even part of the  administration at the time, in contempt for refusing to comply with  House Democrats' subpoenas. This is after more than 600 people have  been arrested for their role in the tragedies we saw on January 6.   When I get the article, I will submit for the Record, Madam Speaker,  a Reuters article that talks about senior officials stating at the FBI  that there was no organized effort to overthrow the government on  January 6. So I will submit it once I get a copy of that. I did not  bring it with me.   But our job, again, is to secure this Capitol. We have never seen a  breach like the one that we saw that day. And it is our responsibility  to make sure it doesn't happen again.   But that hasn't been done under the leadership of this House. We have  had two independent reports regarding January 6, one bipartisan report  in the Senate and another one commissioned by the Speaker herself, and  that came out in March. These have never been acted on. But this is  what the select committee has been working on?   The Capitol Police IG has released seven reports related to January  6, making recommendations on what is needed to secure this Capitol. To  my disappointment, the majority has not acted in a meaningful way to  ensure that all 103 IG findings are implemented.   These reports have all told us what the problems are and the  recommendations on how to fix them. But Congress, us, have failed to  even debate these changes, let alone act on them.   We know massive changes to intel, perimeter protection training,  leadership structure, decisionmaking processes, and many, many more are  needed, but neither the select committee, nor the Committee on House  Administration, seem at all interested in ensuring these changes are  made.   The Committee on House Administration, which has oversight of  security, hasn't held a single hearing since August 5, with no upcoming  hearings scheduled according to the majority's website.   The select committee, right now, as we see, is just purely focused on  political subpoenas.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the articles I previously  mentioned.                       [From Reuters, Aug. 20, 2021]        Exclusive: FBI Finds Scant Evidence U.S. Capitol Attack Was                            Coordinated--Sources                   (By Mark Hosenball and Sarah N. Lynch)         Washington, Aug 20 (Reuters).--The FBI has found scant       evidence that the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was the       result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential       election result, according to four current and former law       enforcement officials.        Though federal officials have arrested more than 570       alleged participants, the FBI at this point believes the       violence was not centrally coordinated by far-right groups or       prominent supports of then-President Donald Trump, according       to the sources, who have been either directly involved in or       briefed regularly on the wide-ranging investigations.        ``Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off       cases,'' said a former senior law enforcement official with       knowledge of the investigation. ``Then you have five percent,       maybe, of these militia groups that were more closely       organized. But there was no grand scheme with Roger Stone and       Alex Jones and all of these people to storm the Capitol and       take hostages.''        Stone, a veteran Republican operative and self-described       ``dirty trickster'', and Jones, founder of a conspiracy-      driven radio show and webcast, are both allies of Trump and       had been involved in pro-Trump events in Washington on Jan.       5, the day before the riot.        FBI investigators did find that cells of protesters,       including followers of the far-right Oath Keepers and Proud       Boys groups, had aimed to break into the Capitol. But they       found no evidence that the groups had serious plans about       what to do if they made it inside, the sources said.        Prosecutors have filed conspiracy charges against 40 of       those defendants, alleging that they engaged in some degree       of planning before the attack.        They alleged that one Proud Boy leader recruited members       and urged them to stockpile bulletproof vests and other       military-style equipment in the weeks before the attack and       on Jan. 6 sent members forward with a plan to split into       groups and make multiple entries to the Capitol.        But so far prosecutors have steered clear of more serious,       politically-loaded charges that the sources said had been       initially discussed by prosecutors, such as seditious       conspiracy or racketeering.        The FBI's assessment could prove relevant for a       congressional investigation that also aims to determine how       that day's events were organized and by whom.        Senior lawmakers have been briefed in detail on the results       of the FBI's investigation so far and find them credible, a       Democratic congressional source said.        The chaos on Jan. 6 erupted as the U.S. Senate and House of       Representatives met to certify Joe Biden's victory in       November's presidential election.        It was the most violent attack on the Capitol since the War       of 1812, forcing lawmakers and Trump's own vice president,       Mike Pence, to scramble for safety.        Four people died and another died the following day, and       more than 100 police officers were injured.                                TRUMP'S SPEECH         Trump made an incendiary speech at a nearby rally shortly       before the riot, repeating false claims that the 2020       election was stolen and urging supporters to march on the       Capitol to pressure lawmakers to reject Biden's victory.        In public comments last month to the Democratic-led       congressional committee formed to investigate the violence,       police officers injured in the mayhem urged lawmakers to       determine whether Trump helped instigate it. Some Democrats       have said they want him to testify.        But the FBI has so far found no evidence that he or people       directly around him were involved in organizing the violence,       according to the four current and former law enforcement       officials.        More than 170 people have been charged so far with       assaulting or impeding a police officer, according to the       Justice Department. That carries a maximum sentence of 20       years.        But one source said there has been little, if any, recent       discussion by senior Justice Department officials of filing       charges such as ``seditious conspiracy'' to accuse defendants       of trying to overthrow the government. They have also opted       not to bring racketeering charges, often used against       organized criminal gangs.        Senior officials had discussed filing such charges in the       weeks after the attack, the sources said.        Prosecutors have also not brought any charges alleging that       any individual or group played a central role in organizing       or leading the riot. Law-enforcement sources told Reuters no       such charges appeared to be pending.        Conspiracy charges that have been filed allege that       defendants discussed their plans in the weeks before the       attack and worked together on the day itself. But prosecutors       have not alleged that this activity was part of a broader       plot.        Some federal judges and legal experts have questioned       whether the Justice Department is letting defendants off too       lightly.        Judge Beryl Howell in July asked prosecutors to explain why       one defendant was allowed to plead to a misdemeanor charge       carrying a maximum sentence of six months, rather than a more       serious felony charge.        Spokespeople for the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney's       office in Washington, which is leading the Jan. 6       prosecutions, declined to comment.        The congressional committee investigating the attack will       talk with the FBI and other agencies as part of its probe.                                   ____                    [From Business Insider, Aug. 20, 2021]  FBI Finds No Evidence That Trump and His Allies Were Directly Involved          With Organizing the Violence of the Capitol Riot: Report                             (By Bryan Metzger)         The FBI has found no evidence that Trump was directly       involved in organizing Capitol-riot violence.        It also found little evidence of an organized plot to       overturn the election results.        Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off cases,''       said one former official.        See more stories on Insider's business page.        The FBI hasn't found any evidence that the January 6       assault on the US Capitol was part of an organized plot to       overturn the election results, Reuters reported, citing law-      enforcement officials.        The officials also said that the FBI has ``so far found no       evidence'' that former President Donald Trump or ``people       directly around him were involved in organizing the       violence,'' Reuters reported.        ``Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off       cases,'' a former law-enforcement official familiar with the       investigation told Reuters. ``There was no grand scheme with       Roger Stone and Alex Jones and all of these people to storm       the Capitol and take hostages.''        More than 570 participants have been arrested by federal       officials. Investigators have found that groups such as the       Oath Keepers  [[Page H5762]]       and Proud Boys did plan ahead of time to break into the       Capitol, but they didn't engage in much planning beyond that       step. Reuters reported that 40 percent of the defendants are       being prosecuted on conspiracy charges, implying a certain       amount of planning and coordination.        But prosecutors have generally shied away from alleging a       broader plot. Senior Department of Justice officials do not       intend to bring forward seditious-conspiracy charges or even       racketeering charges, which are commonly used against       organized criminal gangs.        A Democratic congressional source told Reuters that senior       lawmakers who have been briefed on the FBl's investigation       find the results credible.        Though the FBI has not found an organized plot or direct       involvement by Trump, that doesn't mean that Trump didn't       play an important role in instigating the violence. Earlier       this year, the House of Representatives impeached Trump on       the charge of ``incitement of insurrection'' after he spent       weeks promoting conspiracy theories about the results of the       2020 election. On January 6, Trump gave a speech on The       Ellipse where he urged supporters to march on the Capitol.        Read the original article on Business Insider.    Additionally, a number of questions  from that day still remain unanswered. I am still waiting for the  Speaker of the House to answer a letter I sent her back in February  that asked why the National Guard, requested by Police Chief Sund, were  denied? And why was the Speaker's office and the Speaker involved in  eventually approving the request? Why has the House Sergeant at Arms  refused to comply with preservation and production requests from my  office?   We have many, many more questions about why the Capitol was so  unprepared that day. Our top priority should be ensuring our Capitol is  never as vulnerable as it was on January 6, but this majority has done  absolutely nothing to make the security changes needed to make this  Capitol safer.   Madam Speaker, we must do better. We have not fixed the institutional  problems with our security apparatus that led to the lack of  preparation, the danger that our brave officers were put in on that day  and any other possible day like that in the future. That is a failure  of leadership in this institution.   We must fix the problems that led to the terrible security posture  here--and I will tell you, after witnessing what we saw a few different  days and security postures that this House was put into a couple of  other days since January 6--and I urge you to talk to the brave  officers that stand around these buildings and protect all of us every  day; ask them the same question I do. Ask them if we have put them in a  better position than they were in on January 6? And the answer out of  every single officer I asked that question to is ``no.''   What is stopping this House from fixing the problems? It is a lack of  will. It is a lack of focusing on the true issues that led for them to  be put in a dangerous spot on January 6. Instead, we are talking  politics. It is wrong, and we must do better.   I have said this time and time again, I stand willing to work with my  Democrat colleagues to make this House, this Capitol, safer for  everyone. Instead, it is all about political points like the one being  scored today.   I am disappointed. You can tell. My frustration is going to continue  to boil over until we are in a position to fix the problems that I have  laid out and that we know exist.
