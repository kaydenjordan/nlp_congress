 Mr. Speaker, each year, too many lives are cut short  because of drug overdoses. And fentanyl and its analogs, most of which  originate from China, are making this crisis even worse.   Sadly, under the Biden administration's porous border policies, many  of these deadly drugs are flooding across the southern border and  devastating communities across the country. We need to use every  available resource to fight back, including giving law enforcement the  flexibility to go after drug traffickers who flout the law. Unless we  take action, an important tool--the DEA's emergency scheduling order  for fentanyl-related substances--will expire this very month.   It is past time to make this scheduling classification permanent, and  I am proud to cosponsor the HALT Fentanyl Act to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill, secure the border, and stem the  tide of the growing fentanyl crisis.  [[Page H983]]                                ____________________
