 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize a young man from  Houston, Texas, who, as long as he can remember, wanted to be a police  officer.   DJ Daniel was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and spine cancer  when he was just 8 years old and has undergone 11 brain surgeries. He  has spent half of his life battling cancer.   I cannot think of a braver young man than DJ. Given 5 months to live,  he made it his mission to be sworn in by 100 law enforcement agencies.  Here it is, 3 years later, and he has been sworn in by 743 police  departments across the country.   DJ has made a tremendous impact on many across the Nation and is a  shining example of what makes Texas so great.   Anyone who has followed DJ's story will be the first to say how he  embodies the qualities we look for in law enforcement. Strength,  courage, resilience, and selflessness are all traits I have heard  describing DJ.   May God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
