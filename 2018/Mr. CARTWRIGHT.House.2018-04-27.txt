 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member, and I would  like to thank the committee also for including the PREPARE Act in the  en bloc package. I would also like to thank Congressman Lance for being  my partner on the PREPARE Act for the past two Congresses and  Congressmen Webster, Sanford, and Meadows for being cosponsors and  supporters of my amendment, the PREPARE Act. I would also like to thank  the over 50 outside organizations, companies, and think tanks that have  supported the PREPARE Act. Finally, I thank Chairman Shuster and  Congressman Gowdy for passing the PREPARE Act out of the T&I and OGR  committees, respectively.   Extreme weather is expensive. Last year the public and private sector  saw a combined $300 billion in damages from major extreme weather  events. Congress had to spend an extra $120 billion in disaster  supplemental appropriations so we could get our disaster-ravaged  communities back on their feet. And from our infrastructure to our  defense, our public buildings to our supply chains, the Federal  Government itself has an enormous amount of assets that are vulnerable  to extreme weather events.   I have been working for 5 years to build upon commonsense GAO  recommendations to help our Federal Government and our Nation better  prepare for extreme weather events. This amendment will save lives and  will save money by helping get our government coordinated, improve  planning, and facilitate a better working relationship with State and  local officials.   We know extreme weather events are happening more frequently, and  they are causing more damage. We owe our citizens better planning,  better engagement, and a better response. In passing the PREPARE Act,  the House of Representatives is taking a responsible, important step in  that direction.   I thank the gentleman again for including this amendment in the en  bloc package.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, on June 1, 2011, Sal and Helen Sparich were sitting in  traffic in Tamaqua in northeastern Pennsylvania when, suddenly, without  warning, a loaded tractor-trailer rammed into them from behind, cutting  their car in half, killing Helen instantly and debilitating and giving  horrible, severe, grievous injuries to Sal Sparich. He ended up  spending the next 15 months in the hospital, and then he died. He left  $1 million in medical bills, which Medicare had to pay for.   What we know about this accident is that the driver of the tractor- trailer had a horrible driving record. The company, the fly-by-night  independent contractor trucking company that he worked for, had an  insanely bad safety record, and it was one that anybody could have  discovered by going on the safety website because there were flashing  yellow icons next to the name of that company.                                time  1000    But the broker and the shipper in this case didn't care, Mr. Chair.  They didn't check. They can't care about the safety record, about the  driving record. The only thing they checked was who had the lowest  price. The only thing they cared about was who had the lowest price.   Mr. Chair, we Americans care about personal responsibility and  accountability. It is something we teach our children.   This is an amendment that would take away accountability and  responsibility for the brokers and shippers.   This is a longstanding, time-honored part of American law that  brokers and shippers are responsible and accountable for picking safe  companies and safe drivers.   This amendment would take that away, it would make American roadways  much more dangerous because of this exact type of situation.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote on it.
