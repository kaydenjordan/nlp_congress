 Mr. President, the Senate, as I said yesterday, has a  full schedule of work before it this fall. It is what the President,  Vice President, and I discussed at our working lunch at the White House  yesterday.   This week, the Senate is advancing one of the most important items on  our agenda with consideration of the comprehensive budget for fiscal  year 2018. It is a good budget that reflects the hard work of Chairman  Enzi and the Budget Committee. It will help rein in Federal spending.  It will help our country achieve balance. It will also help our economy  grow.   One of the ways this budget will do so is by providing legislative  tools to advance tax reform. After a lost decade of missed economic  opportunities, America's middle class deserves an economy that reaches  for its full potential again, and tax reform is the single most  important thing we can do today to get there.   It is not hard to see why. Our current Tax Code is archaic, arduous,  and often just plain bizarre. It holds our economy back. It can hold  workers' wages down. It actually incentivizes companies to shift jobs  and profits overseas. It makes it easier for the wealthy and well- connected to game the system. Yet it is almost impossible for anyone  else to understand it.   A constituent from Harrodsburg, KY, wrote to my office exasperated  about the unfair Tax Code. This is what she said: ``I am writing today  to express my complete and total disgust for the complex, completely  unfair, and completely messed up tax system in this country.'' This  constituent, who has worked for nearly three decades as a CPA and has  helped countless Kentuckians navigate the system, described some of the  hardships faced by her clients and then continued by saying that ``the  honest, hardworking folks can't get ahead, the cheaters don't get  caught and the rich just keep getting richer.''   That was my constituent from Harrodsburg, KY, summing up today's Tax  Code. Her story underlines the systemic problems of our Tax Code, and  it is often our Nation's workers--including those in Kentucky--who  continue to bear the burden.   Recently, the Kentucky State treasurer wrote an op-ed calling on  Congress to provide much needed relief from our Tax Code. ``We need tax  reform,'' she wrote, ``to increase Kentucky's economic growth and for  greater middle-class prosperity throughout the Commonwealth.''   I agree. So does President Trump, his team, and our colleagues here  in Congress. We are all in agreement that delivering relief to working  families should be at the heart of our plan, and that is what we  continue to work toward in developing tax reform.   For families and individuals in Kentucky and across the Nation, we  think taxes should be lower, simpler, and fairer. Our plan calls for  doubling the  [[Page S6422]]  standard deduction and significantly increasing the child tax credit.  We will eliminate loopholes that are primarily used by the wealthy  while protecting incentives that benefit the middle class.   Our plan also reforms the Tax Code to provide relief to our Nation's  small businesses and to make it easier to keep jobs here in America. In  an increasingly competitive global economy, we are working to put  American workers on a level playing field.   Above all, our goal is this. We want to take more money out of  Washington's pockets and put more money into the pockets of the middle  class in Kentucky and across our country.   This sounds like a place where we should all be able to agree-- Republicans and Democrats alike. In fact, our friends on the other side  of the aisle have often supported the idea of tax reform and bringing  jobs back to America. I hope they will again in the course of this  important effort. I hope they will not fall into blind partisanship and  reject any collaboration simply because they don't like the President.   Instead, they can work with us in a serious way on an overhaul of the  Tax Code that can truly help the people of Kentucky, help the people of  their States, and help Americans all across the land.   I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues in Congress and  the administration to pass a responsible budget and to deliver tax  reform for the American workers and families, who deserve an economy  that reaches its true potential once again.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the House message accompanying H.R. 2810.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House disagree to the amendment of the       Senate to the bill (H.R. 2810) entitled ``An Act to authorize       appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities       of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and       for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to       prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year,       and for other purposes,'' and ask a conference with the       Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.                               Compound Motion     Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its  amendment, agree to the request by the House for a conference, and the  Presiding Officer appoint the following conferees: Senators McCain,  Inhofe, Wicker, Fischer, Cotton, Rounds, Ernst, Tillis, Sullivan,  Perdue, Cruz, Graham, Sasse, Strange, Reed, Nelson, McCaskill, Shaheen,  Gillibrand, Blumenthal, Donnelly, Hirono, Kaine, King, Heinrich,  Warren, and Peters.   Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the motion.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H. Con. Res. 71.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
