 Mr. President, my colleague Senator Mike Crapo  joins me today in honoring the life of Colonel Edwin Don Strickfaden,  who dedicated 35 years to protecting the citizens of Idaho through his  service in Idaho law enforcement.   Colonel Strickfaden led the Idaho State Police, ISP, with  distinction, serving as director when two Idaho law enforcement  agencies were combined to form one ISP and leading the force to  accomplish many law enforcement successes furthering the security of  our communities. Current Idaho State Police director Colonel Ralph  Powell recognized Colonel Strickfaden as a ``champion for all law  enforcement throughout the state,'' and a ``charismatic leader'' who  ``worked tirelessly to keep us safe.'' Colonel Strickfaden--Ed to most  of us--joined Idaho law enforcement in 1967 after serving 4 years in  the U.S. Air Force. A native Idahoan, Ed was born on August 3, 1945, to  Don and Ruth Strickfaden in Nez Perce, ID, and served many communities  throughout Idaho before retiring in 2002 making a home with his wife,  Barbara, in Salmon, ID. Barbara has worked for my Gubernatorial and  U.S. Senate offices, which has given us more opportunities to interact  with this remarkable Idahoan.   Colonel Strickfaden was known for his thoughtful, reasoned, and  inspiring leadership. Although this example of his bravery and devotion  to helping others was already highlighted in a 2003 Congressional  Record statement, it is worthy of repeating as it is emblematic of how  he served. Colonel Strickfaden was honored by then-Governor Cecil  Andrus for diving into the icy December waters of the Clearwater River  to rescue a woman from a submerged vehicle. His sense of duty and clear  empathy for the people he served was an outstanding example to many.   Colonel Strickfaden made an extraordinary difference in the lives of  Idahoans he served and the many who knew him. We thank him for his  outstanding service as we join his family, including Barbara and their  beloved children, grandchildren, and great-grandchild and many friends  in mourning his passing and honoring his loving legacy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, known for its diverse natural  resources and awe-inspiring landscapes, Idaho is a place of countless  possibilities, where citizens with determination and ambition can lay  the foundation for their own success. I am particularly proud of my  home State's entrepreneurs who continue to pioneer new enterprises that  bring our communities together and inspire a creative spirit in  Idahoans across the State. These traits are well represented in this  month's Small Business of the Month. As chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor  Hot Shots Inc. delivery service as the Senate Small Business of the  Month for March 2017.   Founded by Lance and Mary Curtis, Hot Shots Inc. is a family-owned  and operated small business headquartered in Boise, ID. The innovative  vision of the company is driven by a management team with over 50 years  of combined experience in courier services. Hot Shots Inc. has provided  delivery services in the Boise area since 1998. Their offerings are  distinct in that they are capable of delivering anything from small  parcels to large freight throughout the Treasure Valley, Sun Valley,  Magic Valley, and Twin Falls, all with a same-day guarantee. Over the  years, this company has earned and maintained a high level of trust in  the Boise area, as is evident through their special delivery service  which allows them to access a number of secure locations such as  corporate, banking, medical, government, and military sites. Part of  what makes Hot Shots Inc. a successful enterprise is its use of modern  technology, specifically its utilization of an online ordering system,  a GPS package tracking system, and an email notification system. The  company has adapted with technological advances, making all of these  changes to support mobile transactions. All of these advances help  instill confidence in every customer that his or her package, parcel,  or shipment will arrive on time. This commitment to customer service  has helped the company excel in its field and allowed Hot Shots Inc. to  enter new markets such as warehousing.   Hot Shots Inc. has been a pillar of the community since they first  opened their doors. This family-run business has displayed its  commitment to the Boise community in a variety of ways, whether by  delivering diapers for the Idaho Diaper Bank or through their support  of the Idaho Foodbank Backpack Program, among other community service  activities. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to  Lance and Mary Curtis and the employees of Hot Shots Inc. for being  chosen as the March 2017 Small Business of the Month. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth  and success.                            ____________________
