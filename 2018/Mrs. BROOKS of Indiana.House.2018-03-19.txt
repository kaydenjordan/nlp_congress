 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 50 years ago, on April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee. That same night,  Senator Robert F. Kennedy was scheduled to deliver a campaign speech in  Indianapolis, the city which my friend and colleague, Representative  Andre Carson, and I both represent in Congress.   Instead, Senator Kennedy broke the news to Hoosiers about what had  just happened. His speech calmed a volatile crowd and called for a  nonviolent reaction to the assassination. He pleaded with the crowd to  remain committed to the ideals and peaceful movement of Dr. King during  a time of turmoil, confusion, and despair. It has been called one of  the most important and historic speeches of the 20th century.   Unlike other cities which erupted into violence and riots following  Dr. King's assassination, Indianapolis did not burn. The hallowed  grounds where Senator Kennedy's remarks were delivered is known in  Indianapolis as Kennedy-King Park.                                time  1730    Thanks to H.R. 4851, it will be given the national recognition it  deserves for its significance in the civil rights movement. I am proud  to support this legislation to honor this historic moment.   I thank Chairman Bishop; Ranking Member Grijalva; especially my  colleague and good friend from across the aisle, Representative Carson,  who has led the charge to recognize this park.   Before I close, I want to share a small portion of the words shared  by Senator Kennedy just about 50 years ago that I think we cannot  recite enough in this country:   ``What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in  the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is  not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward  one another, and a feeling of justice towards those who still suffer  within our country.''   As my good friend has just said, Senator Kennedy's words are still  very relevant today. Maybe even more relevant  [[Page H1677]]  today. I encourage all of my colleagues to remember and reflect upon  them as we approach the 50th anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr.   I am also happy to share that anyone traveling to or from  Indianapolis in the coming weeks will be able to hear and read Senator  Kennedy's remarks at an exhibition prominently displayed at the  Indianapolis International Airport to commemorate the 50th anniversary  of Dr. King's assassination in April. I am proud that this body will be  adding this special place to the African American Civil Rights Network.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
