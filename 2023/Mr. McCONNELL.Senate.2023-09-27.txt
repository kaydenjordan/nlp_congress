 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate took the first  step toward avoiding a harmful and unnecessary government shutdown. The  business before us now is to pass standard, short-term funding  legislation to keep basic and essential government functions operating  while work continues on full-year appropriations.   We are talking about making sure that the servicemembers who will  continue to stand watch around the world and the Border Patrol and ICE  agents who will continue to contend with the Biden administration's  border crisis here at home and the VA medical providers who will  continue to care for America's heroes don't have to go without their  paychecks.   The choice facing Congress is pretty straightforward. We can take the  standard approach and fund the government for 6 weeks at the current  rate of operations, or we can shut the government down in exchange for  zero meaningful progress on policy.   So let's be clear. There are a number of important discussions on  additional funding priorities that are still unresolved. Many  colleagues are eager to make real progress in bringing the Democrats'  reckless spending to heel; to force the administration to start taking  its southern border crisis seriously; to provide greater relief for  victims of wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters; and to  deliver continued assistance to Ukraine's defense against Russia. And  on all of those counts, I am one of them.   We would like to address all of those issues, but these important  discussions cannot progress if Congress simply fails to complete our  work on standard, short-term funding and the basic functions of  government end up being taken hostage. So a vote against a standard,  short-term funding measure is a vote against paying over a billion  dollars in salary for Border Patrol and ICE agents working to track  down lethal fentanyl and tame our open borders. Letting FEMA's Disaster  Relief Fund dry up is not a productive way to advocate for victims of  disasters. Letting small businesses' loan applications collect dust is  not a productive way to help working Americans contend with Washington  Democrats' historic inflation.   Shutting down the government isn't an effective way to make a point.  Keeping it open is the only way to make a difference on the most  important issues we are facing.                              Economic Recovery    Mr. President, on another matter, the American people are absolutely  sick--sick and tired--of living under Bidenomics. According to one  recent survey, nearly 70 percent of Americans think the economy is  actually getting worse. And support for President Biden's handling of  the economy is at the lowest level of his Presidency.   It might have something to do with the fact that since President  Biden took office, soaring inflation has turned rising wages into net  pay cuts for American workers. Real wages are down 2.3 percent since  2021. Household incomes fell in 17 States last year. And for all but  the wealthiest 20 percent of households, American families' savings  have actually shrunk.   A food truck owner in Atlanta told reporters recently that he is  paying--listen to this--25 percent more for ingredients, while the  lines for his sandwiches are dwindling as customers cut back on their  spending. Here is what he said:         I've had to raise some of my prices just to kind of keep up       to make it. . . . And gas prices, when you drive a food       truck, you only get eight miles a gallon. So the cost of [my]       fuel really hurts.    Here is what the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week:         People hate inflation, hate it.    The Chairman of the Fed is absolutely right. Working families are  tired of wondering how to make ends meet every month. They are tired of  being told that Bidenomics is working for them.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
