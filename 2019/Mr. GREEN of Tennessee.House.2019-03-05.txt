 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  first responders who have been working around the clock tirelessly  since the recent flooding in Tennessee.   Last week, I visited a few counties to see the damage and hear from  the local officials firsthand. The damage to our infrastructure, homes,  and businesses  [[Page H2343]]  was substantial. The flooding stranded many Tennesseans, who had to be  rescued by boat.   It breaks the heart to see so many lose everything they own.   First responders and local leaders are out every day and have been  since the flooding started. In many communities, mayors--in fact, in  one community, Mayor Carroll was out in a boat delivering food and  water to residents of Perry County.   We are working hard to help these Tennesseans return to normalcy, and  I hope you will join me in keeping everyone affected by the floods in  your prayers.                            ____________________
