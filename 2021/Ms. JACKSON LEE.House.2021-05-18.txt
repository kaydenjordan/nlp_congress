 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I also thank you for your leadership. I thank  Congresswoman Meng for her power and passion and the hurt that we saw  as she proceeded to say something has to be done. I thank Senator  Hirono, the bipartisan supporters, and the Tri-Caucus that was led to  believe that we had to stand together as those who have been impacted  by hate. I thank Mr. Beyer for his initiative, bipartisanship, and for  reporting hate.   It is important to note that there were nearly 3,800 reported cases  of anti-Asian discrimination and incidents related to COVID-19 between  March 19, 2020, and February 28, 2021. During that time, race had been  cited as a factor, and then the worst among many, seniors being beat  brutally to the ground, dying, injured, and hurt for life.   Then, in Atlanta, the unspeakable occurred for seven women, six of  whom were of Asian descent.   It is time for this House, in a bipartisan manner, as in the Senate  with over 90 supporting it in its final passage, it is time for us to  raise our voices emotionally and make a commitment, no matter what  color we are, as we see people of our color attacking Asian Americans,  we should stand and be heard. No hate crime should be allowed to stand.  We, of course, have seen that all over.   I ask my colleagues to rise to support S. 937 and the Beyer bill  because no hate crime should be allowed to stand in America.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important and timely  bill to address the urgent issue of hate crimes.   For the past year, I have expressed great concern about the increase  in violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. It is  outrageous. Madam Speaker, many of us awoke in March to the horrific  news that in suburban Atlanta, Georgia, a 21-year old angry white man  murdered 8 persons at three Asian massage spas.   Among the innocent victims were 6 young Asian American women who  worked in the establishments.   The suspected perpetrator of these brutal crimes has been arrested  and charged with 8 counts of murder.   According to the Atlanta Police Department, the killer is reported to  have told police that he has an issue, what he considers a ``sex  addiction,'' and ``sees these [Asian massage spa] locations as  something that allows him to go to these places'' and ``it is a  temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.''   Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March  2020, there has been a significant increase in harassment and violence  against the Asian American community.   Unfortunately, this is not new; there is a long history of racism  again Asian Americans, especially during times of social and economic  unrest.   Throughout American history, Asian Americans are often blamed for the  emergence of pandemics and diseases, even if the sickness originated  far outside the Asian American community.   The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception, as American citizens, and  residents of actual or perceived Chinese descent, have received intense  and unjust scrutiny, violence, and harassment as perpetrators associate  them with the cause of the pandemic and resulting social and economic  turmoil.   And the racist practice of the 45th President of always referring to  the coronavirus as the ``China Virus,'' or ``Kung Flu'' certainly  contributed to, and inflamed, an already dangerous climate for persons  of Asian descent.   Examples of additional violent physical assaults against the Asian  American community over the last year include:   A sixteen-year-old boy was sent to the emergency room after being  physically attacked at his high school by an assailant who claimed the  boy had COVID-19 simply because he was Asian.   An 81-year-old woman was punched in the face and lit on fire outside  her home.   A woman was kicked, punched, and hit with an umbrella in a subway  station in New York.   A man and his ten-year-old son were followed to a bus station by a  man who was yelling and cursing at them before eventually hitting the  man over the head.   A 61-year-old man was slashed across the face with a boxcutter on the  subway in New York City. His injuries required him to receive nearly  100 stitches.   A woman was doused in a caustic chemical as she took out the trash,  resulting in chemical burns on her face, neck, and back.   A 52-year-old woman was shoved to the ground and hit her head on a  metal newspaper stand.   A 51-year-old man was beaten with his own cane at a bus stop. His  injuries were so severe, he lost part of a finger.   In my hometown of Houston, Texas, we know all too well the fear,  horror, and heartbreak inflicted on members of vulnerable and  marginalized communities when they are targeted by hate crime violence.   Madam Speaker, hate crimes are among the worst atrocities that exist  in modern day society.   A hate crime is defined as the incidence of violence motivated by the  actual or perceived race, color, national origin, relation, sexual  orientation, gender, and disability of the victim.   Unfortunately, hate crimes are underreported for several reasons,  including fear and intimidation.   The Department of Justice must better focus its resources on  prosecuting these hate crimes, and this bill is needed to help expedite  investigations of these offenses during the pandemic.   The bill also will provide greater support for prevention and  community relations programs related to hate crimes, as well as improve  data collection.   We need to stand together to send a clear message that this kind of  behavior will not be tolerated.   We also need to stand in solidarity with the victims and communities  impacted by these terrible crimes.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, so that we can send it  to the President's desk without delay.    Madam Speaker, I thank the manager for her  leadership. I also thank all of those on the floor who understand the  indignity of massacres, racism, and devastating histories that our  country has faced.   We, too, are Americans, and I love this country.   Last night, on the floor of the House, I said that, as a young girl,  I knew about the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria; I knew about  Columbus and Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. And that was well,  though, obviously, there are challenges to that history, even today.  That is what we knew. But we did not know the history--the slave  history or even the fact that there was something called Tulsa,  Oklahoma, a bright and shining star of economic opportunity.   This picture shows young girls dancing in a parade, just like today,  with cowboy hats on, the high school dance team, if you will. None of  that was taught to any of us, this prosperous place.   And then a community known as Greenwood, in June of 1921, after a  series of heinous events that nearly entirely destroyed Greenwood. We  knew nothing about this. A hundred years; three living descendants. We  will be on our way.   I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for championing this with me,  and Chairwoman Beatty for understanding the validity of telling the  truth.   In this story, they saw men, women, and children driven like cattle,  huddled like horses, and treated like beasts. I saw hundreds--this is a  testimony--of men march through the main business section with their  hats off, their hands up, with dozens of guards marching them with guns  and cursing them from everything mentionable. Three hundred of them  died, and are buried in unmarked graves. They were murdered.   The attackers looted and intentionally burned an estimated 1,256  homes in Greenwood, America's Black Wall Street, along with nearly all  of the district's churches, schools, and businesses.   When others began to say, ``Pull yourself up by your bootstraps,''  these freed slaves, for barely 100 years, developed Greenwood.   Yet this is what happened. This is the body of a charred Negro killed  in the riot.   How many were like that?   As I said, the death toll came about because something happened in an  elevator, a word, something like Emmett Till said to a White woman. In  a firestorm of hatred and violence, that is perhaps unequal in  peacetime in the history of the United States, the White mob destroyed  almost 40 square blocks, left almost 9,000 Greenwood district residents  homeless.   So this is a story from 100 years ago. Look at the smoke coming from  the buildings that were industries. People had ice cream parlors,  restaurants, and boarding houses burned to the ground.   We come today to say, the burned-out ruins of Greenwood--there is one  door left in Tulsa, to be able to embrace those from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  They will be here tomorrow for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. I  am honored this legislation will honor them.    Madam Speaker, we will know and history will tell us  that embedded in the annals of the Congressional Record will be H. Res.  398 that talks about that story.   Yet we rise above that, not so much to ignore it, but we ask that we  condemn the violence in this resolution. We ask for rejection and  active opposition to the false ideology of white supremacy. We ask for  tolerance and unity. We ask and are calling upon Americans to celebrate  ethnic, racial, and religious diversity.   We, too, mourn those who were killed in Atlanta for Asian hate. It  says, encouraging all persons in the United States to reflect upon all  of our history. Yes, we can rise above it, but we must know that the  stories that are told say that Tulsa must have some repair, some say  reparations.   Finally, as I close, we hear a testimony from the great-granddaughter  of Howard and Harriet Ector. They were builders and pillars of Black  Wall Street. They were featured in the Smithsonian. As a little girl,  their great-great-granddaughter was saved by hiding in a chicken coop  at age 9 to dodge bullets. It was a race war. We should not ignore our  differences, but we should be unified by who we are.   I am delighted to support this resolution, and I ask my colleagues to  vote for it.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a report by the Oklahoma  Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.                     1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Factsheet    Source--Tulsa Race Riot: A Report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study                 the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, Feb. 28, 2001         Following World War I, Tulsa, Oklahoma was recognized       nationally for its affluent African American community known       as the Greenwood District. This thriving business district       and surrounding residential area was referred to as ``Black       Wall Street.'' In June 1921, a series of heinous events       nearly destroyed the entire Greenwood area.        ``I saw men, women and children driven like cattle, huddled       like horses and treated like beasts. Thus, I fully realized       the attitude of the Southern white man when he has you       bested. I saw hundreds of men marched  [[Page H2477]]       through the main business section of ``White Town'' with       their hats off and their hands up, with dozens of guards       marching them with guns, cursing them for everything       mentionable. I saw large trucks following up the invaders, as       they ran the colored people from their homes and places of       business. Everything of value was loaded on these trucks and       everything left was burned to ashes. I saw machine guns       turned on the colored men to oust them from their       stronghold.'' --Anonymous primary source        Starting late on the evening on May 31 and continuing into       the day of June 1, 1921, a White mob attacked the Greenwood       district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, razing it to the ground. The       attackers looted and intentionally burned an estimated 1,256       homes in Greenwood--America's ``Black Wall Street''--along       with nearly all the district's churches, schools, and       businesses.        The number of persons killed in the riot may never be       known, but a 2001 report by a commission created by the       Oklahoma legislature estimated, based on available evidence       at that time, that at least 75 to 100 people died in the       Massacre, and found that one credible contemporary source       estimated the death toll at 300 people. All told, in what the       late historian and Tulsa survivor John Hope Franklin       described as a ``firestorm of hatred and violence that is       perhaps unequaled in the peace time history of the United       States,'' the White mob destroyed almost forty-square-blocks       and left almost 9,000 Greenwood district residents homeless.        As the White invaders moved through the district, a violent       pattern of murder, looting, and arson emerged. Armed Whites       would force Black residents from their homes or businesses       where they were held at ``a growing number of internment       centers,'' loot what valuables or furnishings they could       carry, and then torch the structure. They summarily shot any       Black men found in a home with a firearm as well as anyone       else who resisted. This pattern was repeated, ``[h]ouse by       house, block after block'' until all of the city's Black       neighborhoods were engulfed in flames.        Whites engaged in the attack also committed numerous other       atrocities. According to one Black eyewitness, White looters       murdered a Black elderly disabled man who, despite having       expressed a willingness to do so, could not comply with their       order to leave his home. According to one White eyewitness,       prominent Black surgeon Dr. A.C. Jackson was gunned down on       his front lawn with his hands up after attempting to comply       with the White rioters. Another Black eyewitness recounted       how he and 30 or 40 other men who had surrendered to the       rioters were lined up and forced to run with hands over their       heads to an interment center located at Convention Hall, all       while some of their White captors shot at their heels with       guns. A group of White men even ran a car into the group,       knocking over two or three of their number. In another       horrifying display of brutality, a Black disabled homeless       man was tied by his leg to a car and dragged by ``white       thugs'' through the streets of the downtown business district       where he panhandled.        While some might attribute these atrocities to the actions       of a few ``rogue'' officers, the ``official'' police response       to the violence also appears to have been, at best, mired in       confusion and, at worst, to have reflected unfounded racial       fears of a so-called ``Negro uprising.'' Responding to the       baseless rumors that Blacks were coming from outside of town,       the police chief ordered roughly one-fifth of the officers on       duty to setup checkpoints on various roads leading into the       city, and at the railroad station, wasting precious manpower       that could have been used elsewhere to prevent the violence       and destruction.        Following the Massacre, local authorities did less than       nothing to provide justice for the many Black victims.       Thousands of Black residents remained in internment camps in       the days immediately following the Massacre.        Local officials actively sought to hinder the Black       community's rebuilding efforts. Within a week of the       Massacre, the Tulsa City Commission passed a fire ordinance       aimed at preventing Black Tulsans from rebuilding the       Greenwood commercial district where it originally stood, and       the so-called Reconstruction Commission established by White       business and political leaders batted away offers of outside       aid. Black Tulsans successfully challenged the ordinance,       which was later struck down as unconstitutional by the       Oklahoma Supreme Court, and managed to rebuild at least parts       of the community where it once stood. Many other Black       residents left homeless or rightfully feeling fearful and       unwelcome left Tulsa. Thousands of survivors were likely       traumatized by the violence they witnessed or experienced in       the Massacre.        The Massacre also destroyed millions of dollars in Black-      owned property. The 2001 commission also estimated the       property damage at 17 million in 1999 dollars, which would be       more than 25 million today. Another source estimates the       total value of the property destroyed at between 50 and 100       million in today's dollars.
