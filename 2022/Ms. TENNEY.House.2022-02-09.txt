 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, we all believe that all people have inherent dignity and  possess equal human rights. We all reject violence directed at  individuals on the basis of their race, religion, biological sex, or  sexual orientation. The problem with this bill, however, is that it  borrows language from two existing laws: the Global Magnitsky Act and  the so-called Section 7031(c) sanctions, and then creates a new  reporting mechanism that is not focused on the human rights of all, but  rather the human rights of particular groups.   I don't see why we should focus on some human rights violations more  than any others. Every person's human rights are of equal value and  certain violations of those rights should not be subordinate to others.   Furthermore, the bill's broad language has the potential to sweep in  nonviolent conduct and impose visa restrictions on individuals engaged  in that conduct.   For example, it speaks about ``complicity'' and ``cruel treatment,''  vague terms. Is a parent overseas who rejects her minor child's wish  for a sex change operation complicit in cruelty? Is the Pope engaged in  ``degrading treatment'' when he expresses opposition to same-sex  marriage based on the tenets of his religious faith?   Mr. Speaker, there are no safeguards in the bill that address these  situations. When free speech, religious freedom, and parental rights'  protections were proposed to be added to the bill, the Democrats balked  and voted against it. They preach tolerance until they are asked to  vote on it.   Regardless of the author's intent, which I think is good, there are  people that will use the bill to target their political and ideological  opponents in the culture wars. The bill's author will say that there  should be no problem since it just uses the very same language as other  human rights statutes, but those existing provisions already address  and punish the conduct this bill targets.                                time  0930    So, the real question is, why is this bill so necessary? In the  committee report, Democrats acknowledge the bill is redundant. But in  search of some--any, perhaps--rationale, they claim that not enough  sanctions have been rolled out that cover crimes committed against  LGBT-identifying individuals. That is simply not true.   We know, for example, under the Trump administration, groups and  individuals from Chechnya were sanctioned under Global Magnitsky for  human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and the torture  of LGBT-identifying individuals.   The former Gambian President was also sanctioned after having rounded  up people based on sexual orientation and after making shocking  statements against LGBT-identifying individuals. These sanctions, as I  said, were imposed under the Trump administration, but even more have  been imposed, using the Global Magnitsky Act, under President Biden.   We know, based on a recent Global Magnitsky report to Congress that  came out a few weeks ago, individuals last year in places like Cuba,  Uganda, and even Bangladesh have been sanctioned, and all are  associated with groups or conduct targeting LGBT-identifying  individuals.   So, this bill is clearly unnecessary. It reflects and represents the  administration's aggressive attempts to push the envelope regarding  culture war issues at every possible juncture, not only domestically  but abroad.   That is distracting and requires diplomats to devote time and  resources to culture war issues at the expense of attention paid to  China, Russia, Iran, the quagmire in Afghanistan, and the crisis at our  southern border.   It is disappointing that as Ukraine is on the verge of being invaded  by Russia, as North Korea continues to conduct ballistic missile tests,  as illegal aliens stream through our southern border--some on our  terror watch list--the majority has decided now is the time to bring  this bill forward.   The State Department agrees. It has reviewed the Global Respect Act  and recommended extensive changes, signaling it, too, sees this bill as  superfluous, potentially misguided, and definitely duplicative. Other  groups have said much the same, including The Heritage Foundation, the  Center for Family and Human Rights, Concerned Women for America, and  the Family Research Council.   Although I agree with the sentiment that human rights violations of  any kind are deplorable and despicable, the devil is really in the  details on this bill. We oppose this bill for the reasons I have  stated.  [[Page H1082]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's passion, and I support his  support of condemning and sanctioning these terrible acts against the  LGBT community.   I just wanted to let the Speaker know, in the newest Global Magnitsky  Act report, which was just released a few weeks ago and covers 2021,  sanctions were imposed on Cuban police; in Uganda, the Chief of the  Military Intelligence; also in Bangladesh, the Rapid Action Battalion.   All of these were associated with LGBT causes, which means this act  is being used to sanction those who commit acts of violence of any kind  against people of the LGBT community. I just wanted to make sure that  the gentleman is aware of that. The State Department is already  reporting and already doing this, and it is being done.   Though I support everything that he is stating here, it is already  being done. In the interest of good legislation, we don't want to  overburden our bureaucrats and people that are working on these issues.  Also, reporting, they have indicated that additional reporting  requirements only take more time out of the organization.   I do appreciate the messaging from the gentleman from Rhode Island.  It is very important that we signal to the world that we condemn acts  against the LGBT community. The problem is, we already have this, and  we already have the ability and two tools that are very effective and  used internationally to condemn these acts.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I support the underlying idea behind the bill,  and I really appreciate the passion of the sponsor and those speaking  out on behalf of it and protecting the human rights of all individuals  living abroad and holding violators accountable. But as I have said, we  have a strong difference of opinion about whether a bill that is  duplicative of current law is necessary.   I think the Global Respect Act, at the moment, the way it is drafted  is counterproductive insofar as it would create a separate regime aimed  at protecting human rights of some rather than human rights of all. And  I fear it could be used to target the left's political opponents in the  culture wars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to respond a little bit to the sponsor, and, again,  I can't say enough that we support and echo the sentiments of  protecting the rights of the LGBT community around the world and at  home.   But this bill actually mirrors the Global Magnitsky Act, and the  language is the same. So it is kind of hard to argue we should just  have another set of standards and require even more reporting from a  State Department that is overwhelmed by issues around the world when we  already have this.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at these instances, the State Department  doesn't disclose necessarily what the nature of it is because of the  confidentiality, but if you actually go into a Google search and look  at the reporting in each of these countries, they are all based on  conduct against people with LGBT leanings, and that is why the act was  used. The State Department preserves confidentiality.                                time  1000    So in the end, yes, we are using this act right now, today, to  condemn and to sanction this activity against the LGBTQ communities  around the world. So I oppose the en bloc of amendments. While some of  the amendments are well-intentioned, they are ultimately duplicative  and unnecessary, again, just like the underlying act. They require the  Department of State to do what it is already doing in practice.   For example, the Gottheimer amendment No. 2 requires a study  examining risks to LGBTQI individuals. The State Department publishes  its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices each year,  including this data, and they just provided another report recently.   Human rights officers who are stationed at our embassies and  consulates around the world meet routinely with local activists and  local officials to gain this information. They talk to individuals on  the ground to compile these reports, which are detailed and  comprehensive. Each regional bureau in the Department is involved in  this process. This amendment, therefore, calls for the Department to do  what it is already doing, and is burdensome on the Foreign Service  officers and career officials.   Other amendments, like the Harder amendment No. 7, also very well- intentioned and also messaging in a very positive way, show that the  Democrats know they have overreached on the bill. The Harder amendment  prevents sanctions against any individual based solely upon religious  belief.   I agree with this sentiment, but at markup, Democrats rejected a very  similar religious freedom and free speech amendment offered by  Representative Scott Perry. The rationale was: Well, this bill just  isn't about that. Well, it seems one of their colleagues disagrees.   While I appreciate the Democrats are willing to acknowledge some of  the flaws in the bill, the Harder amendment is also insufficient. The  amendment speaks only of religious belief. It does not speak to  situations in which religious adherents manifest or express their  beliefs in daily life.   So under Representative Harder's amendment, a person who expresses  belief in the traditional family, or in conventional human biology,  could still be sanctioned because sanctions would not be based on  beliefs but, rather, on actions.   This amendment is not as robust as the measure that Representative  Perry put forward at markup, and we have no choice but to oppose it.   This en bloc does not contain amendments that would enhance the  legislation, in our opinion. Instead, these amendments seek to add  safeguards to a bill that, as I have explained, is duplicative,  unnecessary, and even dangerous insofar as it can be used by the left  to target political opponents in the international culture wars.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H1087]]     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for yielding.  It is just an honor to serve with you and also to serve with our great  colleague, Byron Donalds from Florida. I thank the gentleman for  hosting this very important Special Order to celebrate and recognize  Black History Month.   Upstate New York has a strong abolitionist history, and I am honored  to highlight the stories of our region's abolitionist heroes today.  These individuals played a pivotal role in bringing our Nation's  founding ideals to fruition following the brutal failure of slavery in  our early days.   Not many people outside New York realize just how rich our history is  within the abolitionist movement. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to  visit a few of these sites with Congressman Owens back in October which  we later recalled and memorialized on the House floor in January in  another Special Order. Many of these sites, such as the Gerrit Smith  Estate National Historic Landmark and the National Abolition Hall of  Fame and Museum, are located in the heart of my district in Peterboro,  Madison County, New York.   The Gerrit Smith Estate is named for Gerrit Smith, a wealthy New York  landowner and one-term Member of the House of Representatives, who,  coincidentally, represented the 26th District, as I do now. Smith put  his wealth to good use by fervently supporting the abolitionist  movement. He truly put his wealth behind his beliefs and promoted the  rights of individuals to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   For nearly 40 years, Smith dedicated his whole heart to the  abolitionist cause. Other notable abolitionist heroes such as Harriet  Tubman, Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, all made their way to the Smith Estate at one point or another  to participate in Smith's good work.   Peterboro, New York, became a haven for fugitive slaves because of  Gerrit Smith's courage and undying vision for a better, more equal  America. Gerrit donated much of his farmland to escaped slaves so they  could become self-sufficient and avoid slave hunters. Gerrit Smith also  supported Frederick Douglass' newspaper, The North Star, and gave him  what would be the equivalent of about $7,000 a month in today's  dollars, and kept that newspaper going to inform the public about what  was happening in the abolitionist movement.   His home became a stop along the famous underground railroad where  people would come for shelter, food, and support. Hundreds of enslaved  people found their way to freedom because of Gerrit Smith's valor and  generosity. Down the road in Peterboro you will find the National  Abolition Hall of Fame and Museum. This fixture of the community is  located in the same building where the first-ever meeting of the New  York State Anti-Slavery Society was held in 1835.   Because of their importance to the movement, both the Gerrit Smith  Estate National Historic Landmark and the National Abolition Hall of  Fame and Museum now are listed as 2 of the 22 sites on the New York  State Underground Railroad Heritage Trail.   The abolitionist Reverend Henry Highland Garnet once told an old  friend by the name of Frederick Douglass: There are two places where  slaveholders cannot come. There is Heaven, and there is Peterboro. We  are so proud to have Peterboro in our district.   I am so honored that I got to stand there below that sign with my  great colleague, Burgess Owens from Utah. Gerrit Smith and the New York  State Anti-Slavery Society surely are to thank for that. We also want  to celebrate Black History Month and recognize the many accomplishments  of so many Black Americans.    Another one of them just outside my district is Harriet Tubman, where  she spent a lot of her later years, a woman who lived to be 92; and you  have heard Congressman Owens talk about her and me as well in Special  Orders, but truly a remarkable person. We stood in awe of Harriet  Tubman's accomplishments, her tenacity. She was strong, she was  compassionate, she was courageous, she was kind. And not only did she  serve as a conductor of the underground railroad, among so many  accomplishments, she also freed countless slaves. She worked as a  scout, a spy, and a nurse in the Union Army. At her core, Harriet  Tubman was a woman of such deep compassion and care for everyone around  her.   In her later years, she helped so many who came through her home in  Auburn, New York, providing them shelter, medical attention, and just  undying love. Despite the obstacles she faced, Harriet Tubman never  gave up nor was she ever consumed by anger or cynicism. She led with  integrity and was incredibly resilient. She is a tremendous role model  for all of us today.   As I have said before, the way to improve our Nation is not to  cynically tear down our institutions or erase and rewrite our history,  but rather to take inspiration from the ideals of our Founding, and  those who persevered with great courage to fight for a better future  against so much that was against them.   People like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman are just great  Americans, tremendous Americans and part of our history, and so many  contributed to their ability to achieve the goals to finally  eradicating slavery and bringing us where we are today in celebrating  Black History Month for such a long period of time in our country, as  Congressman Clyburn mentioned earlier.   I just want to thank Congressman Donalds and also Congressman Owens  for their great leadership on behalf of our side of the aisle, and also  just on representing and protecting our institutions of freedom, human  rights, individual rights, and all that they do as great Americans. I  am honored to be able to be here with them today. I thank you so much  again for your great generosity.
