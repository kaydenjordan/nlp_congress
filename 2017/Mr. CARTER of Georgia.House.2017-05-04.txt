 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to support the American Health Care Act.   For the last 7 years, I have watched ObamaCare crush the healthcare  system that I worked in for more than 30 years. Thanks to ObamaCare, we  have an insurance exchange that has withered to where a third of the  counties in our country have only one insurer. At home in Georgia, 96  counties have only one choice on the exchange. That is not a choice.   ObamaCare has failed, and the American Health Care Act is critical to  resuscitate our healthcare system and move it in a direction where  patients, families, and doctors are making decisions, not the Federal  Government and bureaucrats sitting behind a desk in Washington.   The American people need and deserve better, and that is why we must  pass the American Health Care Act. This legislation guts ObamaCare and  rebuilds a system that would deliver the choice and control that  patients need and deserve all while ensuring that health insurers will  not be allowed to discriminate by gender or preexisting conditions, and  no one will be denied coverage, period.                                time  1145
