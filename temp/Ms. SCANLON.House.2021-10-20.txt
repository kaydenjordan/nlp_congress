 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the urgency of passing  the Freedom to Vote Act, which the Senate is considering today.   The events of the past year have exposed the fragility of our  democracy, and Congress must act now to protect that most fundamental  of American freedoms: the freedom to vote.   In 2020, we lived through the most challenged and scrutinized  election in American history. But now, even after the result is beyond  all reasonable debate, radical right-wing extremists and would-be  dictators are still trying to overturn the 2020 election; stoking the  flames of conspiracy, hate, and chaos in order to create a dark and  twisted vision of America that these agents of chaos have embraced.   Unless Congress acts now, the radical right will keep using the big  lie told by the former President and endorsed by his supporters to  enact damaging voting restrictions and prevent Americans who have  rejected their dark vision for our country from participating in our  representative democracy.    In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where I live, the majority in  our  [[Page H5685]]  State legislature has embraced these lies and conspiracy theories about  election fraud to propose a raft of new laws that would make it more  difficult for eligible voters to actually vote. We have an opportunity  to put an end to these anti-democratic tactics and Congress must seize  it.   Today, the Senate will take a crucial vote on the Freedom to Vote  Act, important legislation that is necessary to ensure that our  government remains by the people and for the people, not politicians.   Similar to the For the People Act, which the House has passed both  this term and last, the Freedom to Vote Act sets basic nationwide  standards for how elections are conducted and ensures that the voices  of everyday American voters are heard in Washington. It will work in  tandem with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore  critical protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and combat racial  discrimination in voting. Together, these two bills will safeguard our  democracy from both current and future threats.   Ultimately, the Freedom to Vote Act is about ensuring that people,  not politicians, hold the power in our government.   Let's talk for a moment about what this bill is and what it isn't.  The Freedom to Vote Act would set national standards to protect the  freedom to vote, end partisan redistricting, ensure sound election  administration, and fix our broken campaign finance system.   These key provisions are widely supported by the American people,  including majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.  People are tired of cycles of chaos, followed by inaction, when it  comes to our elections. The most basic foundational element of our  democracy deserves to be treated with seriousness, urgency, and care.  We cannot stand by as discriminatory voter laws, partisan  gerrymandering, and dark money drowns out the voices of American  voters.   As for what this bill does not do, contrary to what some of our  colleagues across the aisle--and particularly Mitch McConnell--have  claimed, the Freedom to Vote Act is not an unconstitutional power grab.   Our Founding Fathers may not have anticipated all the ways our  country would change over the centuries and the ways in which we would  need to adapt, but they were really, really good in anticipating the  evil that men might do in pursuit of power, including anticipating  efforts to undermine the most precious value enshrined in the  Constitution, the right to a government chosen by, for, and of the  people.   One of the ways the Framers did this was in Article I, Section 4 of  the Constitution, which allowed States, in general, to regulate the  time, place, and manner of elections to Federal offices, like Congress,  but with a really important exception. The second half of that section  says, ``Congress may at any time make or alter such State  regulations.''   Why did the Framers do this? Because they already knew of instances  in which State legislators might try to corrupt the election process in  order to impact the Federal Government, even as they were drafting the  Constitution. And isn't that where we are today?   We have States that are trying to make it harder for people who live  in cities and people of color to vote. We have State legislatures  proposing to overturn the results of the last election and future  elections if the party in power in that State doesn't like the  candidate that the people voted for.   We have State legislatures proposing to politicize professional  election staff and procedures with bills that would allow partisan  legislatures to overthrow the Presidential electors chosen by the  people and substitute electors who will vote for another candidate.   That is why it is so important that Congress act to fulfill what may  be its most sacred obligation under the Constitution to protect the  right of the American people to chose their own representatives rather  than letting elected officials manipulate that process to stay in  power.   If the Senate again fails to fulfill its responsibility with the  filibuster intact, then it is time for the filibuster to go.                            ____________________
