 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the greatest  code breakers in American history, Agnes May Meyer Driscoll.   At the age of 29 Driscoll enlisted in the United States Navy in 1918  and was assigned to the code and signals section. While in this unit,  she helped develop the machine called CM, later a standard enciphering  device for the Navy in the 1920s.   She continued her work into World War II, where she was a vital part  in breaking the Japanese Navy's JN-25b code, which gave Admiral Nimitz  a crucial advantage at the Battle of Midway, a turning point in the war  in the Pacific.   Nicknamed Miss Aggie and Madame X, Driscoll retired in 1959 at the  age of 70. When she passed away in 1971, she was buried amongst fellow  American heroes in Arlington National Cemetery.   Driscoll forever changed the field of cryptology and was rightfully  inducted into the National Security Agency Hall of Honor in 2000.   It is a pleasure to recognize her service on behalf of the Colonel  Thomas Hughart Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and  her great nephew, retired U.S. Navy Captain Victor Meyer, who resides  in Staunton, Virginia.   Our country is immensely grateful for Miss Aggie's service.                            ____________________
