 Mr. Speaker, October is Breast Cancer  Awareness Month, so it is fitting that I rise today in support of H.R.  4078, the EARLY Act Reauthorization, which passed the House earlier  this week. I am honored to have co-led this bipartisan legislation with  my good friend, colleague, and breast cancer survivor, Representative  Debbie Wasserman Schultz.   This is an important public health bill to ensure that young women  throughout the United States understand the importance of breast health  and the value of regular breast cancer screenings.   This bipartisan bill raises public awareness about breast health and  educates healthcare providers to encourage early detection of breast  cancer. It also supports initiatives and research to help identify  high-risk women by collecting family histories and educating patients  about early warning signs.   These programs are vitally important. We all know the statistics. One  in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast  cancer over her lifetime, and many women with breast cancer typically  have no symptoms.   This disease has taken far too many of our loved ones. In 2017,  breast cancer was the number one most diagnosed cancer type in the  United States and the number two most deadly.   Earlier this year, I lost a very dear friend to this terrible  disease, Judy Christofilis. She and I had volunteered in the Junior  League in Indianapolis over 20 years ago. She was a successful  accountant, a pillar of the Indianapolis community, and, above all, a  dedicated philanthropist.   She was on the board of the Indianapolis Day Nursery, Indiana's  oldest and largest early childhood education nonprofit. She was  extremely active in the Junior League of Indianapolis and the  Indianapolis Art Center.   But in the last decade of her life, when she was battling breast  cancer, she was a founding member of the Indianapolis American Cancer  Society Guild and served as its treasurer. The guild's mission is to  support the central Indiana office of the American Cancer Society by  generating awareness, raising funds, and providing support for  community outreach programs to achieve the shared goal of savings lives  by helping people stay well, get well, find cures, and fight back.                                time  1015    This mission epitomizes Judy's fight against breast cancer. She  battled metastatic breast cancer for more than a decade. Her  resilience, and spirit, served as an inspiration to me and so many  others in our community.   Her story is just a reminder of why breast cancer screening is  vitally important, and it is often the best and only way to identify  this cancer in its earliest stages. Women--even young women--are  susceptible to this deadly disease, which is why regular breast  screenings are so crucially important.   Our bill reauthorizes the program through fiscal year 2024, and it  funds CDC programs to identify gaps in education and awareness,  particularly among young women and healthcare providers. It supports  young survivors through grants to organizations focused on helping them  cope with the many unique challenges they face as young women and in  implementing a targeted media campaign to reach young and higher-risk  women.   The science is clear: Early detection is the single most effective  way to stop these cancers before they become deadly.   In my very last conversation with Judy before she passed away in  March of this year, she asked me to keep up the fight for all people  battling cancer. This bill, in large part, for me, is dedicated to my  very dear, close friend Judy Christofolis. She truly is one of my  heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our Senate colleagues to pass this important bill  this month during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  [[Page H5120]]                               U.S. Center for SafeSport     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass S.  2330, the Empowering Olympic Paralympic and Amateur Athletes Act of  2020.   This bill is the result of several years of work that began in 2016.  Indiana's very own Indianapolis Star broke the story about former USA  Gymnastics' team doctor, Larry Nassar's abuse of athletes under his  care. Several years have passed since Dr. Nassar went to prison, but  Congress has continued to work to ensure this kind of abuse never  happens again.   In 2017, I led the charge in the House to address the horrible  situation by introducing the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse  Act. I was grateful to see it pass the House and see it get signed into  law.   That law established the U.S. Center for SafeSport as the entity  responsible for developing policies that all U.S. Olympic governing  bodies must implement to better protect their athletes and, most  critically, the center was charged with investigating claims of abuse  against amateur U.S. athletes.   The center has received hundreds of claims they are responsible for  investigating. And, today, with the passage of this bill later today,  we will help ensure they will be able to fulfill that mandate.   When it was originally conceived, the center was not provided a  steady revenue stream, but today S. 2330 will require the U.S. Olympic  and Paralympic Committee to provide direct funding to the U.S. Center  for SafeSport to guarantee it stays committed to protecting athletes.   This reform, along with many others included in Empowering Olympic,  Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act, will bring much-needed further  reform to ensure our young athletes will not have to suffer at the  hands of another in their quest for gold.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure.                            ____________________
