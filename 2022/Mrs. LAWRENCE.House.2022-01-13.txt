 Mr. Speaker, today I stand on the shoulders of my  grandmother and my grandfather, who migrated to the North from the  South, who took me every election day, dressed up, and educated me  every step of the way to understand the power of the right to vote. She  was denied the right to vote.   It is heartbreaking that this bill that has been passed time and time  again is now a political ploy. We now know that the freedoms and the  rights of Americans are based and bred from voting rights. I stand here  today in support of passing this bill.    Madam Speaker, on the cusp of celebrating Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, this Congress has an important decision to  make. Will we stand to protect voting rights or will we hide behind  voter suppression laws? Will we protect the fundamental right to vote  or will we undermine it? This is an easy decision to make, and I know  where I stand--to protect the right to vote. Now is the time for  action. Now is the time for Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote John  R. Lewis Act to the President's desk. As Dr. King said, ``The time is  always right to do what is right.'' And that time is now.
