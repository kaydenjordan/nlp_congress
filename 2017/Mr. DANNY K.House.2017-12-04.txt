 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in every place that I  went yesterday, people asked me: What are you going to say to the  conferees?   I said that I am going to join with my colleagues and say to the  conferees: Help the needy and not the greedy.   I am going to say to the conferees: Why give 50 percent of the tax  break to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population in this country?   I am going to say: Why cut Medicare, Medicaid, and provisions of the  Affordable Care Act that have kept millions of people from having the  agony, pain, and frustration of not being able to find healthcare?   I am going to say: Save the children; save the veterans; save the  center cities that are decayed; save the infrastructure; save the  safety net; and save America.
