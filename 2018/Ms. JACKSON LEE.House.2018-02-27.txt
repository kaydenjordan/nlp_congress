 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for managing  this legislation. I thank Congresswoman Wagner for her leadership and,  as someone said, continued determination, joined by my friend and  colleague from Ohio, Congresswoman Beatty and Congresswoman Maloney. We  have all worked together over the years for the victims of human  trafficking and sex trafficking.   In the last couple of hours, we heard in the Judiciary Committee the  stories of the victims of rape, so we know that this is an important  time and important legislation. Throughout this time, you will hear  stories of victims who have been victimized and are in need of this  legislation.   Just to recount my statement in the Rules Committee, yesterday,  Monday, a week ago, in Houston, I sat down with victims who had been  trafficked or who had been victimized through online sex trafficking or  other aspects of sex trafficking. It was overwhelming to hear parents  speak of a young girl, their daughter, who had been misled and driven  away from their home or from her area and had been taken and abused for  a long period of time until he had to rescue her himself, spending  $50,000, and then $60,000, to be able to rehabilitate herself, which is  now an ongoing process. Though, as every family and every parent, he is  grateful that she is alive.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1865, Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, an important bill  intended to address the reprehensible crime of online sex trafficking  by prosecuting the violators and providing relief to the violated.                                time  1415    First and foremost, H.R. 1865 makes clear that section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act, which its interpretation was expanded in  the first circuit court ruling of Doe v. Backpage, this bill makes it  clear that section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was never  intended to protect the facilitation of online prostitution or sex  trafficking and calls out those websites that have acted recklessly in  allowing the sale of victims of sex trafficking online or stood idly by  while young boys and girls, many as young as 13 years old or even  younger, were coerced, threatened, tortured, bought, and sold on the  whims of their exploiters.   Secondly, this legislation will provide Federal prosecutors with an  additional weapon to use against the immoral individuals who  participate in the forced enslavement we know as sex trafficking.   H.R. 1865 creates the new offense of intentional promotion or  facilitation of prostitution while using or operating a facility or  means of interstate or foreign commerce, such as the internet. A  general violation of this offense will be punishable by a sentence of  upwards of 10 years.   Websites have operated with impunity, hidden behind section 230,  allowing traffickers to advertise, promote, sell minors and other  vulnerable at-risk members of our society, children, parents' precious,  precious children, who are forced to perform unspeakable acts under the  threat of violence, gun violence, starvation, and emotional and  physical abuse.   Under this legislation, an aggravated violation of the new offense,  punishable by imprisonment, occurs if a defendant, such as Backpage,  promotes or facilitates the prostitution of five or more victims or  acts with reckless disregard of the fact that the conduct in question  contributed to sex trafficking as defined in the Federal criminal code  at section 1591, title 18.   Not only does H.R. 1865 create criminal liability and mandatory  restitution for online sex traffickers and their enablers, this  legislation goes even further. Victims harmed as a result of an  aggravated violation of this new offense will have the ability--very  important--to seek civil damages, while judges will be required to  impose restitution upon defendants convicted of committing either the  general or aggravated violation.   We appreciate law enforcement, U.S. attorneys, yet we know that State  law enforcement agencies and prosecutors are vital in the fight as  well, and they have called on Congress to act and to fight more  effectively. There are State task forces across the country working to  protect young girls and boys, and H.R. 1865 allows State legislators to  enact laws prohibiting the conduct that reflects the offense created in  this bill.   Soon we will be discussing the Walters amendment, which is offered  because of the victims groups who want a stronger response to helping  victims. We thank them for that.   The Jackson Lee amendment, which I will offer, leads to be able to  help understand what the level of recovery is and the mandatory  restitution. It will tell the story. It will provide the GAO study to  find out how this legislation is positively impacting, who is receiving  the dollars, are they receiving the dollars.   Today, this account has swelled to $99 billion a year, with a  considerable portion of that money being generated through online  advertising solicitation, and that is the account of dollars that are  being used through sex trafficking.   My amendment will determine and help to bring information to us as to  the effectiveness of this particular legislation, and I think it will  be very important.   Let me conclude by saying that a letter to Congress from the National  Association of Attorneys General indicated certain Federal courts have  broadly interpreted the Communications Decency Act, which has left  victims and State and local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors,  who regularly confront the cruel realities of sex trafficking, feeling  powerless against online ad services and websites that facilitate or  allow sex trafficking.   My heart goes out, and I am grateful that we have moved. As we move  forward, we will be able to build with more legislation that might  include my second amendment that would have allowed victims of sex  trafficking to file civil actions in State courts.   Mr. Chair, let me express my gratitude to the victims who have been  courageous enough to tell their story.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1865, the ``Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,'' an important  bill, intended to address the reprehensible crime of online sex  trafficking by prosecuting the violators and providing relief to the  violated.   First and foremost, H.R. 1865:   (1) Makes clear that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  was never intended to protect the facilitation of online prostitution  or sex trafficking; and   (2) Calls out those websites that have acted recklessly in allowing  the sale of victims of sex trafficking online, or stood idly by while  young boys and girls--many as young as thirteen years old or even  younger--were coerced, threatened, tortured, bought, and sold on the  whims of their exploiters.   Secondly, this legislation will provide federal prosecutors with an  additional weapon to use against the immoral individuals who  participate  [[Page H1292]]  in the forced enslavement we know as sex trafficking.   H.R. 1865 creates the new offense of intentional promotion or  facilitation of prostitution while using or operating a facility or  means of interstate or foreign commerce, such as the Internet.   A general violation of this offense will be punishable by a sentence  of imprisonment of up to ten years.   Websites have operated with impunity and hidden behind Section 230-- allowing traffickers to advertise, promote, and sell minors and other  vulnerable, at risk members of our society, who are forced to perform  unspeakable acts under the threat of violence, starvation, and  emotional and physical abuse.   Under this legislation, an aggravated violation of the new offense,  punishable by a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment, occurs if a  defendant, such as Backpage.com:   (1) Promotes or facilitates the prostitution of five or more victims;  or   (2) Acts with reckless disregard of the fact that the conduct in  question contributed to sex trafficking, as defined in the federal  criminal code at section 1591 of title 18.   Not only does H.R. 1865 create criminal liability and mandatory  restitution for online sex traffickers and their enablers, this  legislation goes even further.   Victims harmed as a result of an aggravated violation of this new  offense will have the ability to seek civil damages, while judges will  be required to impose restitution upon defendants convicted of  committing either the general or aggravated violation.   We appreciate the efforts of federal law enforcement and assistant  U.S. attorneys who endeavor to rid the streets and virtual highways of  sex trafficking.   Yet we know that state law enforcement agencies and prosecutors are  vital to this fight as well, and they have called on Congress to help  them fight more effectively.   There are state task forces across the country working on the  frontlines to locate young girls and young boys--children--and return  them to the arms of distraught mothers and fathers.   H.R. 1865 allows state legislatures to enact laws prohibiting conduct  that reflects the offenses created in this bill and the existing sex  trafficking statute that I previously mentioned.   Congresswoman Walters has offered an amendment, which is supported by  many victims' advocacy groups, to further strengthen the legislation  before us today.   Taking two key provisions from the Senate bill, known as SESTA, the  Walters amendment makes clear that the Communications Decency Act does  not impair or limit federal causes of action filed by victims of sex  trafficking and creates a right of action for state attorneys general  to file federal causes of action for sex trafficking on behalf of their  citizens.   This leads me to my own amendment, which is intended to measure the  effectiveness of the civil recovery and mandatory restitution  provisions of H.R. 1865.   In every community across the country, soulless individuals bend,  break, and use the minds and bodies of young girls, young boys, men,  and women--for a profit--over and over and over again.   Despite the reprehensible nature of this crime, sex trafficking is a  widespread problem that is now the fastest growing criminal industry.   Today, it has swelled to $99 billion a year--with a considerable  portion of that money being generated through online advertising and  solicitation.   Sex traffickers have harnessed the wide-reaching expanse of the  Internet together with the ability to conduct their so-called business  anonymously.   They are no longer restricted to dark, unsafe street corners, filthy  truck stops, or seedy hotels and strip clubs.   Instead, websites have made sex trafficking easy, convenient, and  less risky for traffickers and their cowardly customers.   Today, visitors to websites can scroll through virtual Yellow Pages  of listings, on their cell phones or tablets, according to their  location, tastes, and preferences, without leaving the privacy and  safety of their homes.   According to the Polaris Project, U.S. law enforcement has identified  online advertisements as the primary platform for buying and selling  sex with minors. Over the past several years, more than 80 percent of  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's reports  regarding child sex trafficking relate to the sex trafficking of a  child online.   When notified of the criminal activity occurring on their websites  and platforms, many companies, have worked to remove the content and  even collaborated with law enforcement to find the perpetrators and  rescue victims.   On the other hand, there are companies that have made every effort to  obfuscate the criminal nature of the activity that is allowed to  continue unabated, while the companies continue to turn a profit, and  traffickers continue to force their captives to perform sex acts, under  the threat of violence and actual physical and emotional abuse.   Girls and boys, men and women, are brazenly advertised and sold for  sex on roughly a dozen major websites--the most notorious of these is,  of course, Backpage.com.   However, local law enforcement officials in Seattle, Washington have  identified more than 130 websites where mostly women and children are  bought and sold for sex.   Many attempts have been made to hold these websites, including  Backpage.com, accountable for allowing sex traffickers to operate on  their platforms and profiting from their conduct.   However, as was pointed out in a letter to Congress from The National  Association of Attorneys General: ``certain federal courts have broadly  interpreted the Communications Decency Act,'' which has left victims  and state and local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, who  regularly confront the cruel realities of sex trafficking, feeling  powerless against online ad services and websites that facilitate or  allow sex trafficking.   My heart aches for those who are taken advantage of, abused, robbed  of their innocence, and then robbed again of the justice they seek.   As I said earlier, the legislation before us will allow victims to  file civil actions in federal courts under certain conditions and my  amendment will determine if the civil actions are delivering relief and  restoration.   I offered a second amendment that would have allowed victims of sex  trafficking to file civil actions in state courts under the same  conditions set forth in the underlying bill for federal civil actions.   Although I am disappointed that this amendment was not accepted, I  look forward to building upon the work that has been done to address  the needs of victims and survivors of sex trafficking, and introducing  additional legislation to continue along the pathway towards a  comprehensive solution.   I am inspired and energized by the countless survivors who, despite  their suffering, are willing to stand against those who have exploited  them. These brave individuals want justice and I want them to have it.   As a leader in the fight against Human and Sex Trafficking and  Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, I am painfully familiar with the  pervasiveness of sex trafficking in my own state of Texas--which has  become a hot bed of human trafficking.   Among law enforcement and human trafficking authorities, Houston is  known as the hub of human trafficking.   The highest number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline  in Texas comes from Houston, and a study conducted by the University of  Texas stated that there are more than 300,000 victims of human  trafficking in Texas, including almost 79,000 minors.   In the few minutes I have left, I would like to share the story of a  young woman named Kathy, who moved to Houston in 1994 with her family.   Kathy was raised to be strong and independent; she was very involved  in her church, community, and ROTC.   She graduated from high school, with hopes of pursuing a career in  journalism.   Yet, Kathy became a victim of sex trafficking.   Like most girls, she wanted to be loved.   She met a charming young man who treated her like she had never been  treated before.   After a fairytale year, her Prince Charming proposed something Kathy  felt she could not refuse--a promising job with his company, an  administrative position that would triple her income and provide  financial security for her future, which seemed like a dream come true.   The job was in Dallas and, despite her initial hesitation, she saw  the offer as an opportunity to provide for her family.   But, shortly after she arrived in Dallas, Kathy found herself in the  dark world of sex trafficking and prostitution--a life she never  imagined.   Graphic images were taken of her and placed on the Internet against  her will.   She was forced to perform sexual favors multiple times, every day,  throughout Dallas and surrounding areas.   Escape was not easy.   She was cut off from her family.   Her boyfriend, turned pimp, limited her phone calls to johns, and did  not allow her to have money.   But, somehow she found an opportunity to get away and she never  looked back.   After many years of living in silence, Kathy decided to journal her  experience.   That journal became a book, which became a stage play.   Kathy found her voice and is now an inspirational speaker who hopes  to use her story to encourage others to join the fight against sex  trafficking.   Images of Kathy's horrific past linger on the Internet.  [[Page H1293]]    She says: ``Sites like Backpage have chosen to revictimize survivors  and keeps us in bondage by refusing to remove images taken against our  will.''   Kathy hopes that one day the voices of survivors will be heard.   Well, Kathy--know that I hear you.   Congress hears you.   We hear the voices of the victims, who remain in physical and mental  bondage.   We hear the voices of the survivors, who are struggling to rid  themselves of reminders of their torment--survivors like Liliana who  was lured away from her home by a man she met on the internet, held  captive, repeatedly raped by at least five different men, and suffers  from PTSD.   H.R. 1865, the ``Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2017,'' together with Representative Walters's  amendment, provides law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts at every  level with the tools they need to hold responsible each and every bad  actor who participates in, facilitates, contributes to, or profits from  this modern-day form of slavery.   The proposed legislative combination will help defend and protect  communities across the country, guard against the further spread of sex  trafficking, and provide survivors with a path to justice of their own.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), a Democratic cosponsor of this legislation. I thank  her very much for her perseverance and determination.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who joined with Representative  Joyce Beatty from Ohio and the lead sponsor, Congresswoman Wagner, to  be strong supporters of this legislation. She is an original cosponsor  of the bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a member of the Judiciary Committee, a  distinguished Member, who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Immigration and Border Security and knows about violations of human  beings.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time  and offer a closing to this important legislation.   Mr. Chairman, as indicated, I had offered an amendment that would  have allowed victims of sex trafficking to file civil action in State  courts under the same conditions set forth in the underlying bill for  Federal/civil actions.   I believe, however, that we have laid a stupendous foundation for  innocent victims and that we will have an opportunity to work with all  of our friends who fought so hard for this legislation.   So again, I want to take the opportunity to thank Congresswoman  Wagner and her cosponsors, and as well Congresswoman Maloney and  Congresswoman Beatty, and the work that we have done in the Judiciary  Committee through a period of coming together, I believe, is extremely  constructive.   It is so constructive that we have any number of support letters. I  include in  [[Page H1298]]  the Record a statement by John F. Clark, President and CEO of the  National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.   Statement By John F. Clark, President & and CEO, National Center for                       Missing and Exploited Children    Regarding House Action on Legislation to Provide Justice to Child Sex                   Trafficking Victims--February 23, 2018         The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children is       pleased that the House of Representatives is scheduled to       consider Representative Ann Wagner's Allow States and Victims       to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (H.R. 1865) next week. We       strongly urge all Members to support the crucial amendment       offered by Representative Mimi Walters, which makes long       needed updates to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) to       ensure that children trafficked for sex online can have their       day in court against online traffickers and to clarify that       there is no legal protection for anyone who participates in       the sex trafficking of children.        We especially thank Senators Rob Portman and Richard       Blumenthal for their powerful leadership in authoring the       Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (S. 1693), which is the       basis for Representative Walters' amendment, and for their       ongoing support of the child survivors, their families, and       the coalition of advocacy organizations who serve these       survivors.        We look forward to continuing to work with Members of       Congress to bring this legislation to a vote on the House       Floor and through the Senate so that it can get to the       President's desk to be signed into law.     Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from  Enough is Enough.         For Immediate Release: February 26, 2018    Enough Is Enough Calls on the U.S. House of Representatives To Pass      Critical Legislation To Hold Websites Accountable for Knowingly                        Facilitating Sex Trafficking      Statement by Donna Rice Hughes, President & CEO, Enough Is Enough         Great Falls, VA.--H.R. 1865, the Fight Online Sex       Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA), originally introduced by       Representative Ann Wagner, is scheduled for an historic floor       vote on Tuesday. The need for legislation to clarify Section       230 of the Communication's Decency Act (CDA) is necessary       given the 1st Circuit ruling in Doe v Backpage which held       that even if Backpage had participated in the crime of sex       trafficking, Section 230 shielded the company from the claims       filed by child victims.        ``The urgency to amend Section 230 of the Communications       Decency Act is long overdue,'' said EIE President Donna Rice       Hughes. ``Section 230, originally known as the Good Samaritan       Defense, was intended to protect children from the online       exploitation. Unfortunately, it has been anything but a Good       Samaritan immunity for responsible Internet service and       content providers, and instead has been misused by third       party websites like backpage.com as a Trojan horse to       knowingly facilitate sex and trafficking with women in       children,'' said Ms. Hughes. ``There must be accountability       in the form of state and local criminal and civil liability       for such sites which have been referred to by prosecutors as       an `online brothel.' Its time to put the dignity of women and       children over corporate profit,'' said Hughes.        For years, EIE has encouraged Congress to amend Section 230       due to a series of devastating rulings in multiple court       cases over the years which have misinterpreted Section 230 of       the Communications Decency Act by granting anything goes       immunity to websites whose advertising business model       knowingly facilitates sex trafficking and exploitation.        ``By passing FOSTA along with the crucial amendment offered       by Representative Mimi Walters which mirrors S. 1693 ``Stop       Enabling Sex Trafficking Act 2017'' (SESTA), each member of       the House has the opportunity to send an `enough is enough'       clarion message to sites who exploit and traffic vulnerable       children and women and to the federal courts who have failed       to properly interpret Congress's original intent for #230 An       overwhelming `yes' vote by the House will say to child       victims, `we hear you, we see you and we are standing with       you by providing the necessary legislative remedy to seek       justice,'' continued Hughes, who applauded the resolution       last week set forth unanimously by the Kentucky House of       Representatives, which requested and petitioned the U.S.       Congress to amend sections of the Community Decency Act (CDA       230) to ``permit the prosecution of interactive computer       service providers.''        In 2016, during his candidacy, Donald Trump signed EIE's       Children's Internet Safety Presidential Pledge in which he       promised to ``aggressively enforce existing federal laws to       prevent the sexual exploitation of children online, including       the obscenity, child pornography, sexual predation & sex       trafficking laws.'' Ms. Hughes added, ``We strongly urge the       House to pass the FOSTA-SESTA compromise package and move it       to the Senate, offering hope to and justice for those who       have suffered from this unconscionable act of human       exploitation.'' SESTA, originally introduced by Senators       Portman and Blumenthal currently has 67 bipartisan Senate co-      sponsors and is endorsed by the Internet Association (IA), as       is H.R. 1865.        In 2013, Enough Is Enough voiced strong support of the       effort of The National Association of Attorneys General (49       Attorneys General) calling on Congress to support a simple       two word amendment that would enable state prosecutors to       help fight prostitution and child sex trafficking.       Unfortunately, Congress failed to act, resulting in more       years of untold trauma and exploitation for trafficking       victims and huge profits for websites and interactive service       providers.     Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a letter  from World Without Exploitation with many, many signatures.                           For Immediate Release   National Anti-Trafficking Coalition Urges Congress to Pass FOSTA With     Section 230 Provision to Curb Online Sex Trafficking--As Internet  Demand Explodes, World Without Exploitation Calls on National Lawmakers  to Support Survivors and Stem the Tide of Human Trafficking by Holding                            Websites Accountable         New York, NY--February 26, 2018--World Without Exploitation       (WorldWE), the national coalition to end human trafficking       and exploitation, today urges members of Congress to pass       legislation that would clarify Section 230 of the       Communications Decency Act and allow state law enforcement       and survivors to seek justice against websites that knowingly       engage in facilitating human trafficking. The bill will help       disrupt sex trafficking in the United States, much of which       has shifted from the streets to the Internet.        The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA), H.R.       1865, was introduced by Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) and now       includes a crucial amendment by Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) that       seeks to close a legal loophole in Section 230 of the       Communications Decency Act that allows websites that host       online sex ads to operate with impunity. The Walters       amendment echoes language from the Stop Enabling Sex       Traffickers Act of 2017 (SESTA), S. 1693 sponsored in the       Senate by Rob Portman (R-OH) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).        ``Every day, thousands of children and adults are being       illegally bought and sold online, and the websites that       facilitate these transactions have been able to hide behind       legislation that was never designed to shelter this kind of       activity,'' said Lauren Hersh, national director of WorldWE.       ``WorldWE and our members are incredibly grateful to Reps.       Wagner and Walters and Sens. Portman and Blumenthal, among       many others, for listening to the voices of survivors and       driving meaningful change with so much bipartisan support.       The urgency we are seeing to stop human trafficking at the       highest levels of our government is truly inspiring.''        With the growth of the Internet, human trafficking that       once happened mainly on street corners has largely shifted       online. According to the National Center for Missing &       Exploited Children, 73 percent of the 10,000 child sex       trafficking reports it receives from the public each year       involve ads on the website Backpage.com. The anonymity and       ease with which victims can be bought and. sold on the       Internet has created a multibillion-dollar industry, and a       tremendous surge in exploitation across the United States.        ``The illegal sex trade is no less odious simply because it       is operating on the Web,'' said Anne K. Ream, founding co-      chair of WorldWE. ``Wherever it happens, whenever it happens,       human trafficking is an industry in which profits are built       on human pain. We need public policies that are responsive to       the current face of trafficking, which is why passage of       FOSTA with the Walters amendment is so critical.''        ``We urge the House to pass FOSTA with the Walters       amendment and send the bill to the Senate for adoption,''       said Nikki Bell, founder and director of Living in Freedom       Together (LIFT), a survivor-led organization. ``We are hoping       after today, we will be one step closer to bringing justice       to survivors and disrupting the profitable model of online       trafficking in our country.''        To learn more about WorldWE, hear survivor stories, donate,       and join our movement to create a world without exploitation,       please visit http://www.worldwithoutexploitation.org./    About World Without Exploitation         World Without Exploitation (WorldWE) is a national       coalition of more than 100 organizations and individuals       committed to human rights, civil rights, and gender justice.       WordWE's mission is to create a world where no person is       bought, sold or exploited. The coalition aims to create a       culture where those who have been trafficked or sexually       exploited are treated as victims of a crime, not criminals       themselves, while those who purchase, sell or exploit another       human being are punished.     What was it like before this legislation? Simply,  J.S., who is documented in the film ``Jane Doe,'' will tell you. A  bright young lady, 15 years old, ran on the track team here in this  area and, for her own enthusiasm, went to Seattle, Washington.   When she went to Seattle, Washington, it would have been nice if a  kind soul had found her, but that was not the case.  [[Page H1299]]    Within 15 days, she met a man twice her age, who seduced her with  gifts and convinced her to stay with him. Once she trusted the 32-year- old, he quickly turned on her and raped her, and he would post explicit  pictures of her in an ad on Backpage.com, and she was forced to  continue to have sex for money.                                time  1500    One would think that there was relief. But when her family sought to  file in court, she lost. She lost. Only through the work of Congress  has her case been able to move forward on an appeal.   So the work that we have done is vital to saving lives and to  restoring lives. I am inspired and energized by the countless  survivors, many of whom I have seen today and many of whom I have  joined with last Monday in my district.   As a leader in the fight against human and sex trafficking and  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, I am painfully familiar with the  pervasiveness of sex trafficking in my own State of Texas, which has  become a hotbed of human trafficking in the city of Houston.   Among law enforcement and human trafficking authorities, Houston is  known as a hub of human trafficking, not because of the lack of concern  and energy in my law enforcement and social service community. It is  just an epicenter because of the ability for people to come because of  the warm weather, for children who have aged out of foster care, and  for others who are victims of human trafficking.   The highest number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline  in Texas comes from Houston, and a study conducted by the University of  Texas stated that there are more than 300,000 victims of human  trafficking in Texas, including almost 79,000 minors.   The story of Kathy, right here in Houston, in the few minutes I have  left, I would like to share the story of a young woman named Kathy who  moved to Houston in 1994 with her family. Kathy was raised to be strong  and independent. She was very involved in a church community and ROTC.  So in the few minutes I have remaining, I will share the story of  Kathy.   She graduated from high school with hopes of pursuing a career in  journalism, but she became a victim of sex trafficking. Like most  girls, she wanted to be loved. She met a charming young man who treated  her like she had never been treated before.   After a fairytale year, her Prince Charming proposed something Kathy  felt she could not refuse: a promising job with his company, an  administrative position that would triple her income and provide  financial security for her future. It seemed like a dream come true.   The job was in Dallas. Despite her initial hesitation, she saw the  offer as an opportunity to provide for her family. But shortly after  she arrived in Dallas, Kathy found herself in the dark world of sex  trafficking and prostitution, a life she never knew she would be  involved in.   Graphic images were taken of her and placed on the internet against  her will. She was forced to perform sexual favors multiple times every  day throughout Dallas' surrounding areas.   Escape was not easy. She was cut off from her family. Her boyfriend- turned-pimp limited her phone calls to johns and did not allow her to  have money. Somehow she found an opportunity to get away, and she never  looked back.   After many years of living in silence, Kathy decided to journal her  experience. The journal became a book, which became a stage play. Kathy  found her voice and is now an inspirational speaker who hopes to use  her story to encourage others to join the fight.   Images of Kathy's horrific past linger on. She said:         Sites like Backpage have chosen to revictimize survivors       and keep us in bondage by refusing to remove images taken       against our will.    Kathy hopes that one day the voices of survivors will be heard. Well,  we hear Kathy today. Congress hears her. We hear the voices of the  victims remaining in physical and mental bondage.   So, in conclusion, let me say, as we hear the voices of the  survivors, we realize the importance of our First Amendment and the  ability of free expression. But we know that the torment that these  victims are going through, the PTSD that they are suffering, really is  a statement of importance for H.R. 1865 that allows States and victims  to fight online sex trafficking and to work with all of those who have  worked so hard on this bill, from our Judiciary Committee to the Senate  Judiciary Committee to the sponsors, and to go forward building on this  legislation with more legislation, more victims being able to work with  us, and, finally, Mr. Chairman, to be able to stomp out and extinguish  human trafficking, sex trafficking, and online trafficking.   This is a powerful nation. There is no reason why we cannot do this.  I look forward to that effort. With that, I ask for a vote of ``yes''  on this bill.   I want to say that Mrs. Maloney, who sounded as if she said vote  ``no,'' really meant to say she wants a resounding ``yes'' on this  legislation as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Goodlatte  amendment, and I thank the chairman along with our ranking member, Mr.  Nadler, for their hard work in working together.   I think this amendment is particularly important because it clarifies  that the restitution provision applies to victims of sex trafficking  and ensures that the affirmative defense applies to both of the  criminal offenses created in the underlying bill. These changes are  simple and reasonable.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Goodlatte Manager's Amendment,  which makes technical changes to H.R. 1865.   The amendment adds ``attempt'' language that was inadvertently  omitted from the bill and is consistent with, and tracks the typical  language used in the federal criminal code to define criminal offenses.   The amendment also clarifies that the restitution provision applies  to victims of sex trafficking and ensures that the affirmative defense  applies to both of the criminal offenses created in the underlying  bill.   These changes are simple and reasonable and maintain the overall  spirit of the bill   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chair, a 16-year-old was found beaten and  stabbed to death after being advertised as a prostitute on Backpage.   I might suggest that we follow one great philosopher in California  who asked: Can we all get along?   This amendment is needed in order to give enhanced powers to State  attorneys general that they can provide the extra litigation leverage  for individuals who are impacted in a devastating manner.   As I said, we have to be concerned about the First Amendment, but we  have got to protect our children. Every time I think of this precious  young lady, Desiree, and the tears of her mother who testified before  the other body in the Senate hearing, I think it is important that we  move forward. If we move forward, we can build on this legislation.   I intend to offer additional legislation that we will need so that we  can put a stop sign in front of the dastardly behavior of online sex  trafficking.   So I ask my colleagues to support the Walters amendment in order to  ensure that we can move forward and, as we move forward, make a  difference in the lives of these children.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Walters Amendment, which  addresses problems states and local law enforcement agencies,  prosecutors, and advocates have faced in their attempts to hold online  sex traffickers responsible for their despicable behavior.   Congress decided more than 150 years ago that no person--no woman, no  child, no boy or girl--deserves to be bought, sold, or owned by another  person.   And, as I have said many times before, trafficking in human beings  has no place in a civilized society.   Our country is facing a crisis that touches urban cities, rural  areas, and suburbs, and violates the fundamental American ideal of  liberty--which sets this country apart from so many others.   Traffickers hold their victims captive both physically and mentally,  employing extreme forms of psychological abuse and coercion to main  control over them and prevent them from escaping, while stripping them  of their humanity.   This is an ongoing battle with very high stakes. Several years ago,  I, along with Chairman McCaul, held the first field hearing on human  trafficking in Texas before the Committee on Homeland Security. At the  time of the hearing, a stash house was raided and 115 people were  rescued. I visited that location and saw first-hand, the atrocious  conditions in which those people were forced to exist.   Without the hard work of those Texas officers, I cannot fathom the  torment that might have befallen those poor souls.   As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, I support the  eradication of Human and Sex Trafficking. This vile cruelty must end.   Anyone who aids, assists, facilitates or promotes such behavior must  be held accountable.  [[Page H1304]]    Just last week, I sat down with a room filled with anti-human  trafficking advocates and representatives of anti-human trafficking  advocacy groups, including Real Beauty Real Women and Break the Cycle.  I heard stories of suffering and stories of frustrations.   Victims and survivors are crying out for a change in the law and they  are crying out for justice. They have tried to bring cases against the  people, websites, and online service providers, who contributed to  their suffering and profited from their victimization--to no avail.   Prosecutors have tried to bring online sex traffickers and the  companies who provide them safe harbor--and, unfortunately failed.   It is imperative that we do all that we can to provide for victims of  this disgusting crime, protect vulnerable members of society from  becoming victims as well, and tell websites like Backpage.com.   Sex trafficking is a callous and brutal crime that unquestionably  deserves the nation's upmost attention. It is particularly difficult to  see the victimization of the very young who are sold into the sex  trafficking market.   The SESTA amendment provides law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts  at every level with the tools they need to hold responsible, both  civilly and criminally, each and every bad actor who participates in,  facilitates, contributes to, or profits from sex trafficking.   Many of the groups that work with victims and survivors of sex  trafficking support passage of H.R. 1865 only if Ms. Walters's  amendment passes as well.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I have already raised the picture of  Desiree, who is dead. Her death was driven by being exposed as a so- called prostitute in the sex trafficking of a little girl on Backpage.   Or J.S., who, in fact, was victimized in Seattle. She was raped. She  was put on Backpage. Then she was rescued by her family. Since it was  before this legislation, it failed in court.   My legislation is very simple: Does this bill work? What more can we  do?   I am asking for a study where the GAO would be instructed to assess  the damages awarded to victims and restitution amounts imposed against  defendants as a result of this bill.   Victims of sex trafficking require a multifaceted response to rebuild  their life. That includes housing; counseling; job training; and, in  many cases, drug treatment and rehabilitation. We as Members of  Congress need to be able to know if it works.   A citizen-led movement called Fight for Us, along with a team of  influential citizens called The Houston 20, work to fill in the gaps  and strengthen the services for victims and survivors in the city of  Houston.   I was very proud to meet with them at the Community of Faith Church,  a socially motivated church, led by Bishop James Dixon. Jackie is the  lead. They were all committed, Children at Risk and many other  organizations, to eliminating some of the gaps for The Houston 20,  which will allow them to utilize resources for greater work.   So I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 1865 which  requests the Government Accountability Office to study the  effectiveness of the civil and restitution provisions enacted by H.R.  1865.   In an effort to determine if we are actually providing justice to  victims of sex trafficking through this legislation, GAO would be  instructed to assess the damages awarded to victims and restitution  amounts imposed against defendants as a result of this bill.   Victims of sex trafficking require a multi-faceted response to  rebuild their lives that includes: housing, counseling, job training,  and, in many cases, drug treatment and rehabilitation.   There are well-meaning, dedicated victim advocacy groups all over the  country, that offer their help and services that are dependent on state  and federal grants, charitable donations, and private funding.   A citizen-led movement called Fight For Us, along with a team of  influential citizens called the Houston 20, work to fill in the gaps  and strengthen the services for victims and survivors in my city of  Houston. I commend these selfless individuals and hope that they  continue their important work.   Fortunately though, H.R. 1865 creates a civil cause of action for  victims of the aggravated violation, and requires judges to impose  mandatory restitution orders in criminal cases involving such victims.   It is my hope that this measure will eliminate some of those gaps for  the Houston 20 and allow them to utilize their resources for even  greater work. Through this legislation, victims will be empowered to  take control of their own recovery and restoration.   My amendment will collect data on the civil awards and restitution  orders, to determine whether victims are actually receiving the relief,  assistance, and justice they require and deserve.   My amendment primarily asks GAO to:   (1) report the amounts of the damages awarded and the restitution  amounts ordered; but also   (2) report the amounts that are requested by victims and the  government, on behalf of victims;   (3) the nature and descriptions of the losses that are claimed and  proven; and   (4) the justifications for the amounts that are requested and  eventually ordered to be paid.   My amendment further asks GAO to report cases that are dismissed and  provide information describing the reason or reasons for the  dismissals.   While it is Congress's duty to address the needs of our citizens by  enacting sensible legislation, we are also responsible for monitoring  the legislation we enact and determining whether we have truly  responded to the needs of our citizens.   For this reason, and all reasons previously stated, I ask my  colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Chair, does the gentlewoman have any additional  speakers?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I will close at this time.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewomen from Ohio and from New York. I  thank Congresswoman Wagner. I thank Congresswoman Lofgren for her  concern, as evidenced by her statement, but I want to focus on building  blocks, and I want to say to fight for us in the coalition of 20 that I  met with.   My promise is that we are in building blocks. We are going to build  on what we are doing today, and we are going to continue to mount the  assault on sex trafficking and human trafficking, and we are going to  literally wipe it out.   We are going to wipe it out because of Shaundra. We are going to wipe  it out because of this young, beautiful lady, 16 years old, Desiree. We  are going to wipe it out because of Desiree. We are going to wipe it  out because of J.S. We are going the wipe it out because Desiree was  found beaten, stabbed to death, after being advertised as a prostitute  on Backpage. We want her mother to know that we are outraged that  children are treated in this way.   My amendment will be the guidepost: Is what we are doing working? It  will provide a report on the amounts of damages awarded, the  restitution awarded, report the amounts that are requested by victims  and the government on their behalf, the nature and description of the  losses that are claimed and proven, the justification for the amounts  that are requested and eventually ordered to be paid.   My amendment asks GAO to report cases that are dismissed and provide  information to describing the reason for those dismissals. We don't  want anything to go under the rug. Our children are too important. I  would ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   And in conclusion, I would say to those who I met with, to those  groups around the Nation meeting in local communities thinking that  they are alone fighting this dastardly act of sex trafficking and human  trafficking, and, of course, a moneymaker like Backpage, you are not  alone, we are starting today, we have done work before, and we are not  going to stop. I will work with you for the ongoing blocks that are  going to continue to stamp out online sex trafficking and human  trafficking. With that, I ask for support of the legislation and my  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the question is: When? In 2017, there  were 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence. In 2017, nearly four 911  attacks. There were more than 15,000 killed by gun violence in 2016.  There were 383 mass shootings.   The United States ranks number one in the world in terms of firearms  per capita. The problem is so epidemic that gun violence is now the  third leading cause of death of our children, which includes those dear  souls who died in Florida just a couple of weeks ago. We heard those  children's voices. We have heard many voices.   So let me explain to the American people: no one is grabbing the  Second Amendment. I honor the amendments of this Nation. For your  information, in order to change an amendment, you need a two-thirds  vote of both the House and the Senate and three-quarters of the States.  The last time we changed an amendment was 1933, where we repealed the  prohibition amendment.   This is a cause of the heart and the mind. It is not a Second  Amendment debate. It is a debate on sensible gun legislation to save  lives.   Ban bump stocks.   Extend the waiting period.   Ensure that multiple munitions are banned and automatic weapons are  banned.   When is there going to be, Mr. Speaker, the coming together of a  bipartisan effort to save the lives of our children? Enough is enough.  We need to answer the call. Our children are dying.                            ____________________
