 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the gentleman. I want to  thank him for all those Americans out there who have waited decades for  this, for the hours that he has listened, for the numerous hearings he  has gone through to get us to this day.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before this body, but I want to speak to the  people watching us at home right now and who will hear us in the hours  and days to come. I want to speak to the people who stretch their  budgets to get to the next paycheck. I want to speak to the people who  are starting to wonder if the American promise no longer applies to  them.   You need a comeback. America needs a comeback.   If we are successful today and in the weeks to come, you will keep  more of the money that you earned. You will have more in your paycheck.  Your life will improve. If we succeed, you will succeed, but if the  leaders and obstructionists on the other side of the aisle win, you  will lose. You see, they want Washington insiders and bureaucrats to  keep more of your hard-earned income. They think it is theirs to spend.  We think it is yours.   Now, I have tried my best to understand their opposition, and I have  listened to the pessimistic leaders of a party that once upon a time  claimed they stood for the common man.   Without a shred of evidence, they are certain our plan won't work.  They drum up a stale argument from 30 years ago, saying all this bill  does is help the rich. They call it a middle class tax hike.   That same paper our colleague just held also has fact checkers, but  the fact checkers gave them not one, not two, not even three, but the  most Pinocchios you can give, four, for that lie.   Every honest person sees this as a tax cut for hardworking Americans.  This bill increases the child tax credit, increases the standard  deduction, increases wages, and is already bringing back jobs to  America.   The fact is the first $55,000 an average family of four earns will  not face a single penny of income tax, not a single penny.   So what are these party leaders defending by their opposition?   It is not the people. After all, there is not a single person I have  ever met in this Nation who wants higher rates, lower wages, fewer  jobs, and a more complicated Tax Code. No, they aren't defending the  people.   They are defending loopholes for the special interests, corporate  welfare, and carve-outs for lobbyists. They are defending the abusive  tactics of the status quo at the IRS.   You know what I find most absurd? They are defending the reckless  tax-and-spend policies of broken States across this country. They have  made it their mission to increase taxes on our fellow citizens. My  friends on the other side of the aisle have the audacity to call this a  tax increase. In the end, they are defending a broken status quo.   You know what I think, Mr. Speaker? I think that voting ``no'' on a  plan with lower taxes, higher wages, more jobs, and a simpler system,  that isn't about Republicans and Democrats. Voting ``no'' is telling  the American people you do not have faith in them to rise if they are  given a fair shot.   Mr. Speaker, I have a simple question for this House and for everyone  who is watching at home: Do you want higher taxes and less money in  your pockets or do you want lower taxes and more money?   I think we have sent a message to the doubters and the critics. The  American people do not want hard work to be punished. We do not accept  decline. We do not accept that Washington knows how to spend our money  better than we do.   I have a different message for the American people: To those trying  to find a job, that long search is coming to an end. This is your  comeback.   To those sick of just getting by and fighting for a raise, this is  your comeback.   To those struggling to keep your small business afloat, to pay your  employees, to help your neighborhood, this is your comeback.                                time  1300    To every American who ever dreamed of being an entrepreneur and  owning a small business, this is your comeback.   To every mother and father starting a family, raising your kids, and  trying to give them more of an opportunity than you ever had, this is  your comeback.   Now, I put hope in the American people. This bill puts hope in our  American people because we trust the people. That is the start of  America's comeback.
