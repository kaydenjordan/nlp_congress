 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Jonathan Marquess on his appointment as the Georgia Pharmacy  Association vice president of the Academy of Independent Pharmacy.   A graduate of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, Jonathan has  enjoyed a distinguished career and is well deserving of this  appointment.   He is currently the president and CEO of the Institute for Wellness  and Education in Woodstock, Georgia, and owns many pharmacies across  the State. In addition to owning and managing many pharmacies, Jonathan  has served as president of the Georgia Pharmacy Association and vice  president of professional and clinical affairs for the American  Pharmacy Cooperative. Jonathan has served as the third, fourth, and  fifth vice president for the National Community Pharmacists Association  since 2017.   Jonathan has dedicated his career not only to bettering his patients  but also working to improve the lives and practices of pharmacists  nationwide as well.   His illustrious career of service makes him more than suited to fit  this role, and we are excited to see what else he can accomplish.                            ____________________
