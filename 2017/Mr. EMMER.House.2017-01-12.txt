 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate three small  businesses in Elk River, Minnesota, who have been recognized by the Elk  River Chamber of Commerce for their outstanding track record over the  past year.   I want to congratulate the First National Bank for being named  Business of the Year, Serrano Brothers Catering for being recognized as  the New Business of the Year, and Sportech for being honored as the  Employer of the Year.   Small businesses are a huge driver of our economy in the State of  Minnesota, and they are what make each city and town unique. Running a  small business is no easy task, and the entrepreneurs who open these  businesses take a personal risk to bring jobs, commerce, and excellent  products and services to our communities.   We cannot thank them enough for their valuable contribution, which is  why I am proud today to thank and congratulate First National Bank,  Serrano Brothers Catering, and Sportech for everything they do for our  community and for the great State of Minnesota.                            ____________________
