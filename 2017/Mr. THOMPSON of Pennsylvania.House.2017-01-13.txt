 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I will honor  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, legacy by volunteering my time to help  veterans in my community. Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania's  Fourth District and I will be at the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank in  Harrisburg to pack boxes for the MilitaryShare program.   MilitaryShare is a program that serves fresh, nutritious meals to  families with at least one member who has served in the military. This  program assists area veterans and their families to ensure they do not  go hungry.   Our veterans have numerous needs when they leave the military, and  many of them are life-threatening challenges as a result of combat such  as post-traumatic stress injury. When we help meet the nutritional  needs of military families, it allows them to focus on other pressing  issues such as joblessness or treatment for combat-related health  issues.   MilitaryShare serves more than 4,000 households in central  Pennsylvania, which translates to about 10,000 people a month.   Mr. Speaker, to serve one's country is a noble and selfless act. The  very least we can do is to help our veterans transition to civilian  life when they return home.                            ____________________
