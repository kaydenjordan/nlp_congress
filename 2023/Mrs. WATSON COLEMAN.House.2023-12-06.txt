 Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I want peace. I  want a decisive victory over Hamas and an end to its hateful and  destructive reign. I want Israel and Palestine to coexist safely,  securely, and with prosperity for generations to come.   It is difficult to talk about peace during wartime, but that is  exactly what we must do. We cannot be distracted by disingenuous  messaging bills that do nothing but grab headlines with no plan  forward.   As a person of faith, I have been taught not to hate, but I must  admit that I have hated what I have seen in this Chamber recently. For  as I hate anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and racism, as I despise  homophobia and transphobia, as I reject and revile hatred and bigotry  of any kind, I am also disgusted by the way those prejudices have been  weaponized in our Chamber.   We voted yesterday on yet another nonbinding messaging resolution  denouncing anti-Semitism, H. Res. 894.   To be clear, I have supported efforts to push back against anti- Semitism. That is why I am supporting Mr. Nadler's plan to combat anti- Semitism. It is why I am supporting Mr. Green's two-state solution  resolution. It is why I signed on to Ms. Wasserman Schultz' letter  regarding the safety of students on college campuses.    Let's face facts. That was not what this resolution was about. This  resolution offers no solutions. It does not seek to bring people  together. This resolution was a cynical attempt to weaponize the very  real fears of some of our Jewish friends and our neighbors to push a  specific political agenda, one that is strikingly disrespectful to the  Palestinian state, the State of Israel, and others who support the  cause of free and sovereign Palestinian and Israeli states.   On Monday, my colleague, Mr. Nadler, laid out how reckless and  uninformed clause 4 of this resolution is. By making it the official  position of this Congress that ``anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism,'' we  are labeling the thousands of Jews in this country who don't believe  their deeply held faith is intrinsically tied to the modern State of  Israel as anti-Semitic.   There are very real steps that we as the United States Congress can  and should take to combat anti-Semitism in a productive and bipartisan  manner. Condemning anti-Semitism wherever it rears its ugly head is  critical, but continuing to vote on nonbinding resolutions week after  week after week to score political, partisan points does not get us  closer to a solution. It is disrespectful to the seriousness of this  situation.   Until Republicans are willing to address rising hate and fascism, we  will be sitting here waiting without being able to accomplish anything.  It is no better than moments of silence or thoughts and prayers with no  substantive action to back it up, which were offered during the mass  shootings in our schools, malls, and places of worship.   We have work to do for the American people. The rise of anti- Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, and xenophobia are a threat  to the American experiment in multicultural democracy, and there are  Members of this body who are putting in the work to defend the more  perfect Union that we built over the last 250 years.   When Republicans who have been obsessed with these messaging bills  are ready to join us, we will welcome them with open arms.                            ____________________
