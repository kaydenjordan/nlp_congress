 Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to speak in  opposition to Governor Powell's nomination to serve as Chair of the  Federal Reserve Bank.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.    Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to speak in  opposition to Governor Powell's nomination to serve as Chair of the  Federal Reserve Bank.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.    Mr. President, I am concerned that as Chair of the Fed,  Governor Powell will roll back critical rules that help guard against  another financial crisis, and that is simply a risk we cannot afford.   While big banks have bounced back from the 2008 financial crisis and  are posting record profits, many American families are still trying to  rebuild their lives 10 years later. Yet Governor Powell seems to think  that the No. 1 problem with our current financial system is that we are  too hard on the banks. In his confirmation hearing, he said that he  would ``continue to consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory  burdens.'' When I asked him if there were a single financial rule he  thought should be stronger--just a single provision in one of the Fed's  dozens of rules where there might be an unintended loophole or where an  innovative product has introduced a new risk into the system--he  couldn't name a single one. Not one.   In my questions for the record, I also asked Governor Powell about a  report that the Treasury Department put out last June. This report was  really just a cut-and-paste job of the banking lobbyists' wish lists  for rule rollbacks. Governor Powell could not identify any  recommendations in that report that he disagreed with. Again, not a  single one.   That is not all. At Governor Powell's confirmation hearing, when my  Republican colleague Senator Kennedy asked him about whether there are  any institutions today that are too big to fail, Governor Powell said:  ``I would say no to that.'' Governor Powell expanded on that statement  in his answers to my written questions, saying that ``we have made  enough progress that the failure of one of our most systemically  important financial institutions, while undoubtedly posing a severe  shock to the economy, could more likely than not be resolved without  critically undermining the financial stability of the United States.''   First of all, that is an incredibly narrow definition of what too big  to fail means. But second of all, and more importantly, Governor  Powell's view is out of step with the mainstream of serious experts.  Giant institutions still have the ability to blow up our economy, and  that is the biggest problem facing the Fed and other regulators.   I am deeply concerned that as soon as Governor Powell unpacks his  boxes in the Chairman's office, he will begin weakening the new rules  that Congress and the Fed had put in place after the 2008 financial  crisis, and he will have help. Right down the hall will be his close  friend, Randal Quarles, the Fed's new Vice Chair for Supervision.  Governor Powell told me when we met that he intended to rely a lot on  Vice Chair Quarles on regulatory issues. That is a really dangerous  prospect.   Before coming to the Fed, Vice Chair Quarles spent more than a decade  in private equity, where he made his mark arguing for weaker rules on  big banks--and he has gotten a running start now that he is in the Fed.  In a speech a few weeks ago at his old private equity firm, Quarles  announced that he was working on reducing capital standards for Wall  Street banks, weakening the Volcker rule, and making stress tests  easier for big banks to pass. In other words, he has already set up his  to-do list to gut measures put in place after the financial crisis that  are there to try to keep our economy safer.   So Governor Powell says that he will take his cues from a guy who  wants to get rid of as many rules as he can and take the teeth out of  the rules that he can't. No thank you. That will make American families  less safe. It will make the American economy less safe.   To make matters worse, Powell's gifts to the giant banks will come at  a time when banks of all sizes made gigantic profits last year and got  giant tax giveaways in the bill that was passed in December. Good  grief, when will enough be enough for these guys? But even with the  banks rolling in money, the army of lobbyists and executives have come  back, storming Capitol Hill and the halls of the Fed, spinning a story  that financial rules are throttling them and need to be cut back.   We need a Fed Chair who can stand up to Wall Street and think about  the needs of working families in this country. We need someone who  believes in the toughest rules for banks, not in weaker rules for  banks. That person is not Governor Powell.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  against the confirmation of Alex Azar to serve as Secretary of the  Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. When Congress confirms  somebody to be HHS Secretary, they are putting that person in charge of  some of the most important decisions made by the Federal Government-- decisions that touch the lives of every family in America. The safety  of the food inside our refrigerators, the quality of our nursing homes  where our grandmothers live, the price of our health insurance policy,  the government's response to a flu outbreak--on these issues and many,  many more, the HHS Secretary calls the shots.   When Congress debated Tom Price's nomination to be Secretary of  Health and Human Services 1 year ago, I said that we should not hand  over the keys to this agency unless we were absolutely sure that he  would put the American people first every minute of every day. And  let's be honest: Tom Price did not clear that bar; he didn't even come  close. No. When he was nominated, Tom Price already had a track record  of using his position in government to help exactly one person: Tom  Price. But Senate Republicans were so excited to get started gutting  the Affordable Care Act and ripping up Medicaid that they jammed his  nomination through without a single Democratic vote.   It turns out we are looking at someone whose record is a pretty good  way to judge how they are going to fight for the American people. Tom  Price didn't spend his time as HHS Secretary working for American  families; he spent it burning taxpayer dollars as he flew around on  private jets and military aircraft. During the 8 months Tom Price was  on the job, he put his own interests before those of the American  people--again and again.   Now President Trump has nominated Alex Azar to be Tom Price's  replacement as Secretary of HHS. Republicans have been trying to spin  Mr. Azar as a breath of fresh air--someone who can be trusted to stay  off private jets while he helps them carry out their plans to gut the  Affordable Care Act and Medicaid without attracting quite so much  unwanted attention.   The American people aren't fooled by the spin because in the ways  that matter most, Alex Azar is like Tom Price. Mr. Azar's resume reads  like a how-to manual for profiting off government service. About a  decade ago, he worked in government, helping regulate the Nation's most  profitable drug companies. When he left, he shot straight through the  revolving door and became an executive at Eli Lilly drug company. Last  year, they paid him more than $3.5 million. Not bad. Now he wants to  swing right back through the revolving door again and once again  regulate those same drug companies--regulate them at least until he  decides to spin through the revolving door again and make more money  from drug companies.   I don't think private sector experience should disqualify anyone from  serving. I am rooting as hard as anyone for an HHS Secretary who  actually cares about the job. But the American people deserve to know  that the person running HHS is looking out for them and not for his own  bank accounts or for the profits of his former employer or what makes  him more marketable to his next employer.   That is why Mr. Azar faced some very tough questions in his  confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee about whether he would  be willing to hold giant drug companies accountable when they break the  law. After all, he worked for Eli Lilly while they were cleaning up the  mess after being forced to pay the largest criminal fine of its kind in  U.S. history--a punishment for lying about one of its drugs and  peddling that drug to nursing homes as a treatment for dementia and  Alzheimer's with no proof that it worked. The word for that, by the  way, is ``fraud.'' Eli Lilly's scheme cost the government, and  taxpayers, billions of dollars.   Mr. Azar started out by saying the right thing about this. He said:         Oh, that sort of behavior is unacceptable. Of course,       anyone who breaks the law should be held accountable.   [[Page S461]]     Sounds great. But then I scratched the surface just a little. When I  pressed just a little bit harder and asked him to give the American  people something more than a polished talking point, he started dancing  around in his chair, bobbing, weaving, doing everything he could to  avoid answering the question. Mr. Azar said he believed lawbreakers  should be held accountable. I asked him five separate times during his  confirmation hearing whether he thought Eli Lilly's settlement  represented adequate accountability for the company's illegal  behavior--five times in a row. He dodged, he danced, and he refused to  give a straight answer. I asked him twice whether CEOs should be held  personally accountable when drug companies like Eli Lilly break the  law. Both times, he squirmed away from the question like it was some  kind of snake that would bite him.   The American people deserve better than an HHS Secretary who  struggles to answer the question of whether giant drug companies and  their CEOs should face the music when they cheat taxpayers and lie  about drugs.   On the topic of the Affordable Care Act, it is the same story all  over again. Mr. Azar spent his whole confirmation hearing before the  HELP Committee pretending that the Trump administration hasn't been  trying to rip up healthcare coverage for tens of millions of Americans.  He sat before the committee, like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth,  saying things like ``Oh, I don't think the Administration wanted fewer  people to enroll in health insurance coverage. I'm sure they just cut  the enrollment period in half because they thought it would improve  access to insurance.'' He actually said that.   When I heard that, I wondered if he thought we were stupid. His  answer was so ridiculous that I even asked him a followup question in  writing to make sure I had it right, and he responded--think about  this--that when the Trump administration cut the period of time that  people could enroll for health insurance, he said, ``I do not agree  with the characterization that the Administration or the Department has  made an effort to undercut open enrollment.'' You can't make this stuff  up.   Republicans want to pretend that Alex Azar is totally different from  Tom Price because Tom Price was a terrible HHS Secretary who didn't put  the American people first. I don't see the difference. I see someone  who doesn't want to say it out loud but who intends to behave exactly  like Tom Price when he sits down behind Tom Price's old desk. He will  support efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, gut efforts to  enroll people in health insurance, and take Medicaid away from people  who need it the most.   No one here should be fooled. This week is the 1-year anniversary of  Tom Price's confirmation hearing before the Senate, and we know how  that ended.   The American people deserve better. They deserve an HHS Secretary who  will put them first. I will be voting against Alex Azar because I don't  believe he meets that standard.   Mr. President, I yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
