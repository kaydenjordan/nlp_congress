 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3119) to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act  with respect to functions assigned to Assistant Secretaries, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3119         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Emergency Leadership       Act''.       SEC. 2. FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.         (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 203 of the       Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7133(a)) is       amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(12) Energy emergency and energy security functions,       including--        ``(A) responsibilities with respect to infrastructure,       cybersecurity, emerging threats, supply, and emergency       planning, coordination, response, and restoration; and        ``(B) upon request of a State, local, or tribal government       or energy sector entity, and in consultation with other       Federal agencies as appropriate, provision of technical       assistance, support, and response capabilities with respect       to energy security threats, risks, and incidents.''.        (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Energy shall ensure       that the functions of the Secretary described in section       203(a)(12) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (as       added by this Act) are performed in coordination with       relevant Federal agencies.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3119.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3119, the Energy Emergency  Leadership Act. This legislation and the two other energy bills that  will follow it are bipartisan bills that will protect our energy grid  from cyberattacks. All three of these bills passed the House last  Congress but were never taken up in the Senate. That must change this  year as the need for this legislation becomes more important by the  day.   We have heard repeatedly from security experts and regulators over  the last few years that our energy infrastructure and grid are being  attacked by state actors or other entities. Indeed, just 2 months ago,  large parts of this country suffered from gas shortages after a  ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline.   Former Energy Secretary Perry took the first step toward addressing  the increasing risk of cyberattacks on our energy infrastructure by  creating the Cybersecurity and Energy Security Emergency Response  office, or CESER, as it is pronounced. He then enhanced its stature by  making its leader an assistant secretary.   So H.R. 3119 would amend section 203(a) of the Department of Energy  Organization Act by establishing in statute the new assistant secretary  position responsible for cybersecurity and emergency response issues.   This bill also makes clear that this assistant secretary would have  jurisdiction over all energy emergency and security functions related  to energy supply, infrastructure, and cybersecurity.   It also vests the assistant secretary with the authority to provide  DOE technical assistance and support to State, local, or Tribal  governments upon request.   And it requires the assistant secretary and the Department of Energy  to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security and other  relevant Federal agencies in carrying out the bill's provisions. CESER  performed this role admirably in May when it coordinated the whole-of- government response to the Colonial Pipeline attack.   By codifying an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and emergency  response issues, this bill would go a long way in helping to protect  the Nation's electric infrastructure from hackers and other bad actors  who would attempt to disrupt our energy grid and harm our economy, our  daily lives, and our overall national security. It would also  appropriately raise the stature of the CESER office and provide more  accountability over the vital functions with a lead person tasked with  carrying them out.   I commend Energy Subcommittee Chairman   Bobby Rush and  Representative Walberg for their bipartisan effort to protect our  energy infrastructure. This bipartisan cooperation is essential as we  continue to work to defend our country from the threat of cyberattacks.  I also thank Ranking Member Rodgers and Energy Subcommittee Ranking  Member Upton for working with us to move this bill and the other two  cybersecurity bills that will follow.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank both sides of the aisle, Mr. Latta  and others, for their help in getting this bill moved.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would ask support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2931) to provide for certain programs and developments in  the Department of Energy concerning the cybersecurity and  vulnerabilities of, and physical threats to, the electric grid, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2931         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Grid Security       through Public-Private Partnerships Act''.       SEC. 2.

(c) Survey.--The Administrator of the Energy Information       Administration shall collect information on electricity       interruption costs, if available, from a representative       sample of owners of electric grid assets through a biennial       survey.       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In the Act, the following definitions apply:        (1) Electric reliability organization.--The term ``Electric       Reliability Organization'' has the meaning given such term in       section 215(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824o(a)(2)).        (2) Electric utility.--The term ``electric utility'' has       the meaning given such term in section 3 of the Federal Power       Act (16 U.S.C. 796).        (3) State regulatory authority.--The term ``State       regulatory authority'' has the meaning given such term in       section 3 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2931.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking my colleagues on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, Representative McNerney of California and  Representative Latta of Ohio, for their continued work and cooperation  on energy security issues and for introducing H.R. 2931, the Enhancing  Grid Security Through Public-Private Partnerships Act.   This legislation could not be more necessary. Our Nation is facing an  increasing number of physical and cyber threats to its electric grid  and infrastructure. This bill addresses those threats by directing the  Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Electric Reliability  Organization, States, other Federal agencies, and industry  stakeholders, to create and implement a program to enhance the physical  and cybersecurity of electric utilities.   It calls for cybersecurity training to mitigate supply chain risks  and improving the cybersecurity of third-party utility vendors. It also  encourages utilities to share best practices and data within the  electric sector.   The bill requires the Secretary of Energy to deliver a report to  Congress on general cybersecurity concerns and to coordinate with the  Department of Homeland Security and other relevant agencies to ensure  good communications and smooth implementation of this program across  the government.   Finally, the bill instructs the Secretary of Energy to update the  Interruption Cost Estimate Calculator, which is an electric reliability  planning tool for estimating electricity interruption costs and the  benefits associated with reliability benefits.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2931 is an important bipartisan bill that will help  address the security of our Nation's electric utilities, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney), the Democratic sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would also ask that all our colleagues  would support this on a bipartisan basis, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2928) to require the Secretary of Energy to establish a  voluntary Cyber Sense program to test the cybersecurity of products and  technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2928         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Sense Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CYBER SENSE.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy, in coordination       with relevant Federal agencies, shall establish a voluntary       Cyber Sense program to test the cybersecurity of products and       technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system, as       defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824o(a)).        (b) Program Requirements.--In carrying out subsection (a),       the Secretary of Energy shall--        (1) establish a testing process under the Cyber Sense       program to test the cybersecurity of products and       technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system,       including products relating to industrial control systems and       operational technologies, such as supervisory control and       data acquisition systems;        (2) for products and technologies tested under the Cyber       Sense program, establish and maintain cybersecurity       vulnerability reporting processes and a related database;        (3) provide technical assistance to electric utilities,       product manufacturers, and other electricity sector       stakeholders to develop solutions to mitigate identified       cybersecurity vulnerabilities in products and technologies       tested under the Cyber Sense program;        (4) biennially review products and technologies tested       under the Cyber Sense program for cybersecurity       vulnerabilities and provide analysis with respect to how such       products and technologies respond to and mitigate cyber       threats;        (5) develop guidance, that is informed by analysis and       testing results under the Cyber Sense program, for electric       utilities for procurement of products and technologies;        (6) provide reasonable notice to the public, and solicit       comments from the public, prior to establishing or revising       the testing process under the Cyber Sense program;        (7) oversee testing of products and technologies under the       Cyber Sense program; and        (8) consider incentives to encourage the use of analysis       and results of testing under the Cyber Sense program in the       design of products and technologies for use in the bulk-power       system.        (c) Disclosure of Information.--Any cybersecurity       vulnerability reported pursuant to a process established       under subsection (b)(2), the disclosure of which the       Secretary of Energy reasonably foresees would cause harm to       critical electric infrastructure (as defined in section 215A       of the Federal Power Act), shall be deemed to be critical       electric infrastructure information for purposes of section       215A(d) of the Federal Power Act.        (d) Federal Government Liability.--Nothing in this section       shall be construed to authorize the commencement of an action       against the United States Government with respect to the       testing of a product or technology under the Cyber Sense       program.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2928.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2928, the Cyber Sense Act of  2021. Grid security is a national security issue. Fortunately, there  has not yet been a broad cyberattack that has taken down large parts of  the electric grid in the United States. But as we learned from the  ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline earlier this year, we must  not let our guard down.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 2928, which gives the  electric sector critical tools and technologies necessary to protect  our grid from malicious harm.   This legislation gives the Department of Energy an important new  authority to facilitate the adoption of more secure technologies and  equipment in our Nation's grid. It does this by requiring the  Department of Energy to set up a voluntary ``Cyber Sense'' program to  identify cyber-secure products for use in the bulk-power system.   The bill also requires the Secretary of Energy to coordinate with the  Department of Homeland Security and other relevant Federal agencies in  order to ensure smooth and seamless implementation across the Federal  Government.                                time  1430    This program would also provide technical assistance to electric  utilities and product manufacturers to assist them in developing  solutions to mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in the grid.   I want to again thank my colleagues, Representatives McNerney and  Latta, for their hard work on this critical issue and for their  persistence in pursuing this bill for the last several years. Their  partnership and bipartisan leadership on cybersecurity issues continues  to benefit us all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1250) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to  issue reports after activation of the Disaster Information Reporting  System and to make improvements to network outage reporting.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1250.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1250, the Emergency  Reporting Act. This is an important and timely piece of legislation as  many of our Western States are currently experiencing devastating  wildfires, and as we enter another Atlantic hurricane season,  obviously, it is important in my area as well.   We rely on our communication devices every day, but it is critical  that we have a signal or a connection during an emergency. In our world  today, connectivity isn't a luxury; it is essential to ensuring our  collective safety. Often, it can be the difference between life and  death.   It is the responsibility of the Federal Communications Commission to  ensure that Americans stay connected when it matters most and that  communication providers are prepared for whatever disasters might come  their way. So if we want to improve the reliability of the  communication networks, we must begin with better data.   The Disaster Information Reporting Systems, or DIRS, was launched by  the FCC in 2007 so that the communication providers could report the  status of communications systems during disasters.   In some cases, DIRS is activated in advance of a potential storm as a  precautionary measure. In more extreme cases, DIRS is activated in the  lead-up to a disaster and stays active for days on end. That is because  networks can go on- and offline even after a storm's end.   Under this bill, the FCC would be required to conduct an analysis of  any disaster or event for which DIRS is activated by the FCC and stays  active for a minimum of 7 days.   First, the FCC would be required to issue a preliminary report within  6 weeks after the date DIRS is deactivated, and this report would  include detailed information about the number of outages, whether  communications infrastructure was affected, and how many 911 centers  were affected by service outages.   The bill would then require the FCC to hold a field hearing not later  than 8 months after the Commission deactivates DIRS. By making sure the  FCC gets out of Washington and sees and hears real stories from the  impacted areas, the FCC will get the opportunity to examine these  events, the outages they cause, and how we can prevent them from  happening in the future.   I commend Representative Matsui, a senior leader of our committee,  for her leadership on this bill and her passion for improving  communications resiliency and reliability.   I also thank my Republican colleagues for working with us to move  this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee and out of the full  House last Congress. This is a good bill that will help us make our  communication systems more resilient in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure and look  forward to its consideration by the Senate and the President, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    I have no speakers, so the gentleman from Ohio may  proceed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support this important legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1754) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the  Federal Communications Commission to consider market entry barriers for  socially disadvantaged individuals in the communications marketplace  report under section 13 of such Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1754         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Measuring the Economics       Driving Investments and Access for Diversity Act of 2021'' or       the ``MEDIA Diversity Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CONSIDERING MARKET ENTRY BARRIERS FOR SOCIALLY                     DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS.         Section 13(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.       163(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Considering socially disadvantaged individuals.--In       assessing the state of competition under subsection (b)(1)       and regulatory barriers under subsection (b)(3), the       Commission, with the input of the Office of Communications       Business Opportunities of the Commission, shall consider       market entry barriers for socially disadvantaged individuals       in the communications marketplace in accordance with the       national policy under section 257(b).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1754.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1754, the Measuring the  Economics Driving Investments and Access for Diversity Act of 2021, or  the MEDIA Diversity Act of 2021.   This bill promotes much-needed diversity in the communications  marketplace. It does this by requiring the Federal Communications  Commission, with the input of its Office of Communications Business  Opportunities, to consider market entry barriers for socially  disadvantaged individuals in the communications marketplace.   Currently, there are vast inequities in the communications  marketplace. While women and people of color make up over 50 percent of  our population, broadcast ownership by them is only about 10 percent.  That is extremely concerning, Mr. Speaker, when you think that media  outlets can influence people's opinions and perceptions through the  programming decisions that are made.   Diversity in ownership of media outlets helps to ensure that  programming offers different perspectives and that viewers have access  to programming that is relevant to them. Experts have also found that  ownership diversity can provide financial and competitive benefits. But  in a concentrated communications marketplace, barriers for entry still  exist, and the Federal Communications Commission is already tasked with  studying what those barriers are. This bill asks the FCC to also  consider market entry barriers for socially disadvantaged individuals.   Creating ownership parity to reflect this country's diversity is a  worthy goal, and this bipartisan effort is a step in identifying market  entry barriers.   To be clear, there is so much more that we need to do, Mr. Speaker.  While incremental steps are critical, we must do more. I look forward  to working with my colleagues to take additional steps to diversify our  media market.   I commend Representatives Long and Veasey for their bipartisan work  on this legislation. I hope we can now come together in a bipartisan  fashion to do the additional work that is needed to finally eliminate  the barriers so that the owners of our media outlets begin to look more  like the communities that they serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the MEDIA Diversity  Act of 2021, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 277) reaffirming the commitment to media  diversity and pledging to work with media entities and diverse  stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to eliminate barriers  to media diversity.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 277         Whereas the principle that an informed and engaged       electorate is critical to a vibrant democracy is deeply       rooted in our laws of free speech and underpins the virtues       on which we established our Constitution, ``in Order to form       a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic       Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the       general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to       ourselves and our Posterity . . .'';        Whereas having independent, diverse, and local media that       provide exposure to a broad  [[Page H3645]]       range of viewpoints and the ability to contribute to the       political debate is central to sustaining that informed       engagement;        Whereas it is in the public interest to encourage source,       content, and audience diversity on our Nation's shared       telecommunications and media platforms;        Whereas the survival of small, independent, and diverse       media outlets that serve diverse audiences and local media       markets is essential to preserving local culture and building       understanding on important community issues that impact the       daily lives of residents;        Whereas research by the American Society of News Editors,       the Radio Television Digital News Association, the Pew       Research Center, and others has documented the continued       challenges of increasing diversity among all types of media       entities;        Whereas with increasing media experience and       sophistication, it is even more important to have minority       participation in local media to ensure a diverse range of       information sources are available and different ideas and       viewpoints are expressed to strengthen social cohesion among       different communities; and        Whereas the constriction in small, independent, and diverse       media outlets and limited participation of diverse       populations in media ownership and decision making are       combining to negatively impact our goal of increasing local       civic engagement and civic knowledge through increased voter       participation, membership in civic groups, and knowledge of       local political and civil information: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity as a core tenet       of the public interest standard in media policy; and        (2) pledges to work with media entities and diverse       stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to eliminate       barriers to media diversity.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 277.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 277, reaffirming the  commitment to media diversity and pledging to work with media entities  and diverse stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to  eliminate barriers to media diversity.   This resolution promotes much-needed diversity in the communications  marketplace where we continue to see vast inequities. For example, the  owners of broadcast and cable media outlets do not reflect our diverse  population. Owners of these media outlets make critical decisions about  the educational, political, entertainment, and news programming  Americans watch. These decisions can influence people's opinions and  perceptions.   Mr. Speaker, diversity in viewpoints and diverse ownership of media  outlets promotes programming that offers different perspectives and  enables viewers to access programming that is relevant to them. A  diverse media marketplace is also central to an informed and engaged  electorate which is essential to a vibrant democracy.   Committing to a diverse media marketplace--one that reflects our  Nation--is a worthy goal, and this resolution reaffirms that goal.   Today's resolution is a good step forward, but there is much more we  need to do. The numbers and statistics are clear: our media marketplace  does not resemble the people we serve.   I want to commend Representative Demings for her work on this  resolution and for continuing to bring attention to not only the lack  of diversity in our media outlets, but also the impact that it has on  our communities and on our Nation. I hope we can come together to do  the additional work that is needed to improve the state of diversity  today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), who is the sponsor of the  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3003) to direct the Assistant Secretary for Communications  and Information to take certain actions to enhance the representation  of the United States and promote United States leadership in  communications standards-setting bodies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3003         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting United States       Wireless Leadership Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REPRESENTATION AND LEADERSHIP OF UNITED STATES IN                     COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS-SETTING BODIES.         (a) In General.--In order to enhance the representation of       the United States and promote United States leadership in       standards-setting bodies that set standards for 5G networks       and for future generations of wireless communications       networks, the Assistant Secretary shall, in consultation with       the National Institute of Standards and Technology--        (1) equitably encourage participation by companies and a       wide variety of relevant stakeholders, but not including any       company or relevant stakeholder that the Assistant Secretary       has determined to be not trusted, (to the extent such       standards-setting bodies allow such stakeholders to       participate) in such standards-setting bodies; and        (2) equitably offer technical expertise to companies and a       wide variety of relevant stakeholders, but not including any       company or relevant stakeholder that the Assistant Secretary       has determined to be not trusted, (to the extent such       standards-setting bodies allow such stakeholders to       participate) to facilitate such participation.        (b) Standards-Setting Bodies.--The standards-setting bodies       referred to in subsection (a) include--        (1) the International Organization for Standardization;        (2) the voluntary standards-setting bodies that develop       protocols for wireless devices and other equipment, such as       the 3GPP and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics       Engineers; and        (3) any standards-setting body accredited by the American       National Standards Institute or Alliance for       Telecommunications Industry Solutions.        (c) Briefing.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary shall brief       the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Foreign Affairs of       the House of Representatives and the Committees on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation and Foreign Relations of the       Senate on a strategy to carry out subsection (a).        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) 3GPP.--The term ``3GPP'' means the 3rd Generation       Partnership Project.        (2) 5G network.--The term ``5G network'' means a fifth-      generation mobile network as described by 3GPP Release 15 or       higher.        (3) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary''       means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications       and Information.        (4) Cloud computing.--The term ``cloud computing'' has the       meaning given the term in Special Publication 800-145 of the       National Institute of Standards and Technology, entitled       ``The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing'', published in       September 2011, or any successor publication.        (5) Communications network.--The term ``communications       network'' means any of the following:        (A) A system enabling the transmission, between or among       points specified by the user, of information of the user's       choosing.        (B) Cloud computing resources.        (C) A network or system used to access cloud computing       resources.        (6) Not trusted.--The term ``not trusted'' means, with       respect to a company or stakeholder, that the company or       stakeholder is determined by the Assistant Secretary to pose       a threat to the national security of the United States. In       making such a determination, the Assistant Secretary shall       rely solely on one or more of the following determinations:        (A) A specific determination made by any executive branch       interagency body with appropriate national security       expertise, including the Federal Acquisition Security Council       established under section 1322(a) of title 41, United States       Code.        (B) A specific determination made by the Department of       Commerce pursuant to Executive Order No. 13873 (84 Fed. Reg.       22689; relating to securing the information and       communications technology and services supply chain).        (C) Whether a company or stakeholder produces or provides       covered telecommunications equipment or services, as defined       in section 889(f)(3) of the John S. McCain National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232;       132 Stat. 1918).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3003.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3003, the Promoting  United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2021. This legislation will  help ensure the U.S. continues to lead the world in advanced  communications technologies and deployments. It does that by directing  the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA,  to encourage participation by American stakeholders and standards- setting bodies, such as the Third Generation Partnership Project,  better known as 3GPP, and the IEEE.   The legislation also calls on the NTIA to offer technical assistance  to U.S. stakeholders that do elect to participate in developing  standards for 5G networks and future generations of communication  networks.   Other governments around the world are engaged in the standards- setting process for advanced telecommunications technologies, and  discussions about 6G are already underway. This legislation will give  our stakeholders the ability to better engage in policy choices that  are being made today by the standards-setting bodies. These policy  choices will have far-reaching implications for the development of 5G  and other advanced communication technologies in the future.   By ensuring that globally developed standards meet the needs of the  U.S. and our partners, this bill will help the U.S. continue to  innovate. It will also help us guard against nontrusted actors  hijacking standards-setting processes, which is an important component  of our continued engagement on future communications technologies.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend this bipartisan effort from  Representatives Walberg, Dingell, Johnson, and Kuster. I also want to  thank our colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee and Chairman  Meeks, in particular, for working with us to bring this legislation to  the floor.   I hope we can come together on this important issue, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Pallone: I am writing to you concerning, H.R.       3003, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of       2021. This legislation contains provisions that fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        In an effort to work cooperatively and to expedite the       consideration of the aforementioned bill, the Committee on       Foreign Affairs will waive referral of H.R. 3003. This,       however, is not a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by       the Committee on Foreign  [[Page H3647]]       Affairs over this or its subject matter. The House Foreign       Affairs Committee has already passed through Committee its       own legislation on 5G issues and will continue to legislate       and provide oversight on diplomatic and foreign policy       aspects of global telecommunications issues. Additionally, I       ask that you support the appointment of Committee on Foreign       Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference convened       for this legislation.        Finally, thank you for agreeing to include a copy of our       exchange of letters in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 3003.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2021.      Hon. Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3003, the       ``Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2021'',       so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 3003 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 678) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for  a moratorium on number reassignment after a disaster declaration, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(d) Order of Amendment Execution.--If this Act is enacted       before October 17, 2021, section 3(a) of the National Suicide       Hotline Designation Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-172) is       amended, effective on the date of the enactment of this Act,       by striking ``adding at the end'' and inserting ``inserting       after paragraph (3)'', so that the paragraph (4) that is to       be added by such section to section 251(e) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251(e)) appears after       paragraph (3) of such section 251(e) and before the paragraph       (5) added to such section 251(e) by subsection (a) of this       section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H.R. 678.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 678, the Preserving  Home and Office Numbers in Emergencies Act or the PHONE Act.   The PHONE Act is a bill that Representative   Mike Thompson was  inspired to write because of stories he heard at home in his district  in the aftermath of devastating wildfires in northern California. After  being evacuated by the Atlas and Tubbs fires a few years ago,  Representative Thompson's constituents returned to their homes  determined to rebuild what was lost; however, when it came time to hook  up their telephone service again, they were rightly outraged to  discover that the phone company had rescinded their phone numbers and,  in most cases, reassigned them to different subscribers.   Nobody should have to worry about losing a phone number they have had  for years because their home or their small business was left  uninhabitable by a natural disaster like a wildfire or a hurricane.  This legislation makes sure that that doesn't happen again.   The PHONE Act prohibits providers from reassigning phone numbers of  subscribers within an area subject to a major disaster declaration.  Specifically, if the President has issued a major disaster declaration  and a Governor has designated the area to the FCC, the phone numbers in  that designated area cannot be reassigned for 1 year. And then, if a  subscriber needs more time, this bill allows them to get a year-long  extension.   The legislation would also allow consumers whose homes are  inaccessible or uninhabitable to cancel their service without a  cancellation fee or resubscription fee when they get phone service  somewhere else in the area during that covered period.   What we are doing here, Mr. Speaker, ultimately is ensuring some  stability for people who have lost their homes or businesses after a  major disaster hits their community. This is one less thing that a  resident or a small business will have to worry about as they work to  pick up the pieces. In the age of robocalls, our phone numbers are how  our friends and family know exactly who is trying to reach them when we  call, and that is why this legislation is necessary.   When disaster strikes, our constituents should know they won't lose  their numbers; especially the seniors and the small businesses who rely  on landline telephones more than others.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Thompson for his tireless  leadership on this issue, as well as my Republican colleagues, for  working with us to improve the bill before it passed the House last  Congress. This is a really good bill, the same bill we passed and sent  to the Senate last fall.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will finally take up  the PHONE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  [[Page H3649]]  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Before we conclude this series of bills under the jurisdiction of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, I want to say that this is a bittersweet  day for me. After 25 years of outstanding service, Jeff Carroll, who is  sitting behind me here, who has been my longtime chief of staff and is  now the staff director of the committee, will be leaving the House at  the beginning of August, in just another 10 days or so.   It would be an understatement to say that Jeff has been my most  trusted adviser for almost my entire time in Congress. He is known to  Members and staff on both sides of the aisle for his candor, political  savvy, and commitment to the little guy.   He has never forgotten his roots back in New Jersey. That, again,  would be an understatement. Many of you know that he is a diehard fan  of Bruce Springsteen, but also the Mets, the Giants, and the vaunted  pork roll. He is a Jersey guy through and through. I don't think  anybody would argue with that.   He joined my staff as an executive assistant in 1997 after graduating  from George Washington University. I won't tell you how many people  from GW he has hired in the office and on the committee. Before that,  he briefly served as a staff assistant to New Jersey's then-Senator,  Robert Torricelli.   Shortly after joining my staff, Jeff took on the added responsibility  of serving as my legislative aide on both labor and defense issues. It  was here that he began his longtime work of protecting New Jersey  military installations from closure.   He was my defense staffer on 9/11 and during the debate on the  Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq. I valued his  counsel at the time, and my vote against that authorization and the  invasion into Iraq remains one of my most proud moments as a Member of  the House. But I have to tell you, without Jeff, it might not have  turned out that way.   Within 6 years, he became my chief of staff, serving with distinction  the people of New Jersey's Sixth Congressional District for 12 years.   Without a doubt, the largest crisis that we confronted during his  time as my chief of staff was Superstorm Sandy in 2012. My  congressional district is along the coast of north Jersey, and was one  of the hardest hit districts in the country by Sandy. For more than a  year, Jeff led my team in response and recovery, literally being out  there. Both in New Jersey and here, they worked around the clock,  helping families and small businesses pick up the pieces.   Jeff also fought relentlessly, along with me and others in New Jersey  and New York, to make sure we received the Federal assistance that our  States needed and deserved.   In 2015, when I was elected the ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee--and that was certainly in large part because of  Jeff--he became the Democratic staff director. Then, 4 years later,  when I became the chairman of the committee, Jeff became the committee  staff director.   As staff director of the committee, Jeff has led the committee staff  in all the committee's accomplishments over the last 6 years. I am  going to list some of them, but I have to tell you, it is an incredible  list of accomplishments through Jeff's efforts, including, of course,  the latest, the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe economic downturn.   Jeff helped shepherd four bills through the House to help combat the  coronavirus that became law. These laws ensured Congress provided the  tools and resources needed to bring an end to this terrible pandemic  while also providing relief to struggling American families.   Besides responding to the pandemic, Jeff was instrumental in our  efforts, and I want to list some of the very important bills: to end  surprise medical bills; to reduce and block robocalls; to phase down  the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons and mandate the  repair of methane leaks; to protect Americans from suspected foreign  communications network equipment; to reauthorize the Safe Drinking  Water Act for the first time in 20 years; to expand treatment for  people fighting opioid use disorder; to invest in new medical  treatments and cures for some of the most debilitating and life- threatening diseases; to modernize the Toxic Substances Control Act,  which took about 14 years, to better protect public health and the  environment; and to extend critical funding for programs that improve  the health and welfare of millions of children, families, and seniors  across the country. That is not an exaggeration, Jeff's role in all of  that.   He has been by my side through my greatest trials and achievements in  office. My congressional office, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the  Congress, and the Nation have benefited enormously from Jeff's  commitment to achieving meaningful progress for the American people.   It means time away from his family. There have been a lot of long  nights, late-night phone calls, which I am known for, and weekends  spent working to move forward.   I don't know what to say other than to acknowledge the unwavering  support that Jeff has received from his wife, Shannon; his daughter,  Lizzie; and his son, Ryan. I thank them for sharing Jeff with all of us  for all these years.   I know I am going to be talking to Jeff and getting advice from Jeff,  but when I say bittersweet, I really mean it. I don't know how we are  going to do without him, but I guess we have to continue. That is the  way it goes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by saying that the American people  have benefited from Jeff Carroll's 25 years of public service. I am  going to miss him tremendously, and I wish him nothing but the best in  his future pursuits.    I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.  [[Page H3650]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
