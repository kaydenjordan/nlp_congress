 Madam Speaker, we should take a moment to honor an  outstanding organization, Alpha Kappa Alpha. This is their Founders  Day--112 years old.   Isn't it interesting that young women who were in the shadow of the  Emancipation Proclamation and the shadow of slavery, in the midst of  Jim Crow-ism and on the precipice of World War I, organized at Howard  University to be able to give African American women a place for  leadership and civic-mindedness?   As we are on the precipice of a great historic moment dealing with  protecting the Constitution here in the United States Congress and the  United States Senate, I am glad to honor these women that included  Ethel Hedgeman, Margaret Flagg Holmes, Marjorie Hill, Lillie Burke,  Beulah Elizabeth Burke, Anna Easter Brown, and many other young women  who decided to take a stand for what is right in this Nation and the  opportunities of diversity and leadership.   Congratulations to our national president, Dr. Glover, and  congratulations to all of our Alpha Kappa Alpha members throughout the  United States of America. Happy Founders Day 112.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia  for yielding. And I thank the sponsors of this very important  amendment, Mr. Davis and Ms. Pingree.   I rise to support the underlying bill, the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act that I am very proud to have been a  cosponsor of.   What kind of thanks are we giving to hardworking Americans who,  because of the growth of this population senior citizens, older  Americans, they are ready to work in the workforce and provide their  experience, their thoughtfulness, and their leadership.   Unfortunately, a Supreme Court decision in the 2000s turned this  upside down by requiring those older Americans to be burdened by the  responsibility of saying, it is only the fact that we are old or that  there are not multiple reasons why I could have been fired. How  dangerous that is when an older American feels vulnerable?   The underlying amendment is also very important, dealing with women  who may have had to get out of the workforce to raise their children or  to not get promotions so they can tend to their children or other  matters or be a caretaker for other family members.   This is an important initiative to equalize the playing field, to  value those older Americans with experience who are ready to work, who  have been giving their best, and who are ready to be the kind of  experienced mentors in the workplace that really make America great.   I rise to support this legislation. It is vital to both impact and  correct a very bad decision by the United States Supreme Court, and I  believe that this will give the kind of affirmation to the value of all  Americans, and particularly our older Americans.
