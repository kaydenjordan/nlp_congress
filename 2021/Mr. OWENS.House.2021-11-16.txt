 Madam Speaker, I am proud to be here today with the Utah  House delegation to say a few words ahead of the Thanksgiving season to  those we are so fortunate to represent here in Washington. We all agree  that it is a blessing, as a team, to represent the great State of Utah.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart), my  friend from Utah's Second District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Curtis), my friend from Utah's Third District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Moore), my friend from Utah's First District.    Madam Speaker, before I get started, I just want to say  what an honor it is to serve with my friends from Utah. They are  remarkable men.   As the holiday season approaches and families across our great Nation  gather for these special moments, I am reminded of what brings us all  together as Americans: Not our creed, race, or ZIP Code, but the  gratitude for one another that lifts us higher and brings out the best  in each of us.   I am the father of 6 children and 15 grandchildren. My pride doesn't  come from my years on the football field or decades in the corporate  world. It comes from the joy of watching them grow up and start  families of their own. I am so deeply thankful for them and the entire  Owens family.   To my fellow Utahns: I am thankful to call Utah's 4th District my  home. It is the honor of a lifetime to represent our State. I am  constantly inspired by the resiliency of our communities.   We have faced a couple of very difficult years. The COVID-19 pandemic  kept us from our friends, families, and loved ones. Disruptions from  work, school, and worship made everyday life very different. There are  empty seats at the table this year. We pray for comfort and healing for  those families as they navigate this time of grief.   With the current economic crisis at home, rising prices at the gas  station, grocery store, and everywhere in between, more and more Utah  families are worried about losing a job, keeping the doors of their  small business open, paying their mortgage, and making ends meet.   Even during the toughest of times, I know the spirit of Utahns. I  have seen how families across our State have helped each other through  dark times toward better and brighter days.   I am wishing all Utahns good health, especially the men and women who  have put on the uniform to serve in our great State, across the  country, and abroad. They make the world and our country a safer place.   Especially during the holidays, I think Norman Rockwell's Four  Freedoms are very appropriate: The Freedom of Speech, the Freedom to  Worship, the Freedom From Want, and the Freedom From Fear. This is the  American way. This is the American Dream. As Americans, we hold these  freedoms incredibly dear and commit to protect them for future  generations.   It is within our DNA to confront our crises and weather rough storms  to leave our country a little bit better than we found it for our  children and our children's children.   This season of thanksgiving, I hope that we can continue to support  one another and unite in our shared gratitude. Despite our daily  struggles, we have so much to be thankful for. I pray that Utahns  across our beautiful State will continue to be blessed this holiday  season.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the senior member of our delegation, Chris  Stewart.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
