 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  rise today in support of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act.   Children are our future teachers, doctors, police officers, and  Members of Congress. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are  able to live, learn, and grow in a safe environment.    My home State of Georgia ranked fifth in the Nation for the highest  number of child abuse-related deaths in 2017 and third for calls to  hotlines to report abuse.   I was proud to introduce an amendment in the Education and Labor  Committee with my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Stefanik), that would establish a national child abuse hotline.   Stronger CAPTA is bipartisan legislation that will provide critical  protections and resources to families and children across our Nation to  prevent and end child abuse. Together, we can and we should ensure the  safety of our Nation's children.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
