 Madam Speaker, I rise today because the American people  have the right to know the truth regarding Russia's interference in our  democratic process.   I am a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and the message  I hear from our military leaders is consistent: Russia is a top threat  to the United States and our interests.   Russia has not only used its military to destabilize regions around  the world, but it has completely undermined and disrupted the  democratic values of this country.   This is unacceptable. And yet my colleagues from the other side of  the aisle refuse to do their job as an oversight body and establish a  bipartisan, independent commission to investigate Russia's egregious  behavior.   We have a responsibility to be transparent with the American people.  I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to not only immediately  establish an independent investigation into Russia's interference in  our election, but I also call for the release of President Trump's tax  returns.   America's security and values are on the line. Any treasonous and  unlawful relations with Russia cannot be tolerated.                            ____________________
