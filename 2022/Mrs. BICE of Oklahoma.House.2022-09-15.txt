 Madam Speaker, last night I had the honor of  being one of the co-captains for the Congressional Women's Softball  Game which, for the first time since 2015, we beat the press.   As was mentioned, this game is vital in raising awareness for the  Young Survival Coalition, and for women who face the challenges of  breast cancer.   I again thank Natalie, Tori, Jim, and Atalie, and everyone else on  the organizing committee, as well as the sponsors that made the game  possible.   But lastly, I especially thank Coach Perlmutter. This team--where is  Ed? There you are. This team would not have gotten the win without you,  and you, my friend, will be missed.   It is always a good day when the Members of Congress get a victory  over the press. And if they say they won, it is fake news.
