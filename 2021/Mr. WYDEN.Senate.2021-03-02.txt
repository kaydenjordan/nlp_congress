 Mr. President, 10 years ago Bahraini citizens joined many  others across the Middle East in what became known as the Arab Spring,  an eruption of popular protest and a call for reform and democracy that  spread across the region.   In Bahrain, the Arab Spring took the form of peaceful protest.  Families marched together and protestors gathered in Manama's Pearl  Roundabout urging the King to grant greater economic and political  rights, particularly for Bahrain's Shia majority.   The King could have responded to these peaceful protests with  dialogue or discussion. He did not. The regime deployed state security  forces against the demonstrators, unleashing a wave of violence and  repression.   Journalists and human rights advocates documented the regime's use of  tear gas and rubber bullets against the unarmed crowds. Security forces  beat a number of protestors and arbitrarily detained many more,  targeting even the physicians who volunteered to tend to the wounded.  Security forces shot one young protestor, Ali Mushaima, in the back,  killing him.   Bahrain's authorities made clear that day that they had no intention  of conducting a meaningful dialogue or adopting significant reforms.  They have held to that position for the last decade.   Even the Trump administration, which made no secret of its desire to  downplay or overlook human rights abuses, documented in its most recent  human rights report Bahrain's ongoing ``restrictions on freedom of  expression, the press, and the internet, including censorship, site  blocking, and criminal libel; substantial interference with the rights  of peaceful assembly and freedom of association . . . restrictions on  freedom of movement, including revocation of citizenship; and  restrictions on political participation, including banning former  members of al-Wifaq and Wa'ad from running as candidates in  elections.''   Bahrain has long been a valued security partner in a volatile region  of the world. In addition, Bahrain hosts the Navy's 5th Fleet. This is  precisely why the United States needs to engage Bahrain on these issues  and to encourage reforms.   If Bahrainis come to associate the United States with their  government's cruelty and repression, this security partnership could  become much less reliable. If the Monarchy were overrun by Bahrainis  who had come to hate the United States due to our inaction in the face  of gross human rights abuses, what would happen to our military base  and the thousands of Americans who live in the country? It is a  question I think we would all rather not have to answer.   Mr. President, the Arab Spring of 10 years ago has long since given  way to an Arab Winter in Bahrain and across much of the Middle East. In  2011, tens of thousands of Bahrainis took to the streets with hopes of  a more inclusive and representative society. They are sadly still  waiting for those hopes to be realized.   I am heartened that President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken  have already taken steps to reprioritize human rights as a cornerstone  of U.S. foreign policy. That must include working to hold our  adversaries accountable but also speaking hard truths when allies lose  their way.   It is with this in mind that on the 10th anniversary of the Arab  Spring, I call on the Biden-Harris administration to urge Bahrain's  King to release political prisoners, including human rights defenders  and members of the political opposition, and to engage them in a  credible dialogue about a more inclusive future for all Bahrainis.                            ____________________
