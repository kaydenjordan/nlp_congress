I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to say  farewell to a friend and a public servant who served my State of  Illinois and our Nation well. His name was Charles Carroll Smith, but  his friends called him Charlie. He died on the day after Thanksgiving.  Our paths crossed often over the years.   Charlie served as Illinois' deputy secretary of state under then- Secretary of State Alan Dixon. When Alan Dixon was elected to the U.S.  Senate in 1980, Charlie came to Washington with him. He was a key  member of the Dixon staff, serving as both legislative director and  senior national security adviser. When Alan Dixon left the Senate,  Charlie joined the staff of Kentucky Senator Wendell Ford, then the  Senate's Democratic whip. Charlie was Senator Ford's legislative staff  director and a trusted adviser to Senator Ford on matters involving  national security and foreign relations.   He helped craft and pass many important pieces of legislation,  including the 1990 law establishing the Defense Base Closure and  Realignment Commission in 1990. He went on to serve as executive  director of the 1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission-a  massive task to try to realign America's military bases with the  realities of the post-Cold War world.   The work of the Base Closure Commission was necessary, complex, and  historic, and Charlie's intricate understanding of both the Defense  Department and the security needs of America and our allies was  critical to the commission's success. Despite the gargantuan task,  Charlie was never too busy to listen. I and all of the Members of the  Illinois congressional delegation appreciated his willingness to always  consider fairly our explanations about the national security importance  of the military bases in our State. He never put his thumb on the scale  for Illinois, but he made sure that we received a fair hearing. The day  the commission announced its recommendations in 2005, Charlie called me  to explain in layman's language just what the recommendations meant for  Illinois and for America. I have never met anyone with a greater  understanding of the workings of the Defense Department and the ability  to translate that knowledge into plain English. He was a rare one.   Charlie came by his political and legislative skills the old- fashioned way. He inherited them. He grew up in an Irish Catholic  Democratic family on the North Side of Chicago. His father was in  politics; his mother was a professor. Charlie was the first-born and  only son in the family of three children.   The Smith family took politics and democracy seriously. Charlie and  his father were both named Charles Carroll Smith, senior and junior.  Family legend has it that they were descended from Charles Carroll, one  of the signers of America's Declaration of Independence and a member of  the Continental Congress. Whether it was true or not--  [[Page S7209]]  this was before at-home DNA testing--the Smith family strove to live up  to Charles Carroll's patriotic example.   When Charlie was about 11, his father decided that the Smith family  home should be a laboratory of democracy. They would discuss important  events at the dinner table, and once a week, they would have a meeting  to vote on matters involving the family. After just one or two of these  family meetings, Charlie had an epiphany. He told his sister Sheila:  ``You know, if we three kids stick together, we can outvote Mom and  Dad.'' He said: ``I want a bike. What do you want?'' Charlie figured  out what both of his sisters wanted and how to deliver it. At the next  family meeting, the girls supported Charlie's proposal to buy him a  bike. The kids won, and Charlie got his bike. The Smith family never  held another family vote, but Charlie would go on to use his coalition- building skills in the interest of public service for the rest of his  life.   In 1968, Charlie joined the U.S. Army and served as an intelligence  officer in Vietnam during the Tet offensive.   He left public service in 1999 and began his second career as a  lobbyist. He was respected by members of Congress on both sides of the  aisle as a straight shooter and a good man.   Besides his family, politics, and public service, Charlie loved the  Chicago Bears and the Cubs and playing golf. Every Christmas season,  Charlie hosted a party for his friends at the Army Navy Country Club in  Arlington, VA. It was always a great, bipartisan celebration. This  Friday, Charlie's friends will gather by Zoom to remember him on what  would have been his 26th annual Christmas party. He will be missed  there, and he will be missed in the halls of Congress, in his old  neighborhood in Chicago, and many other places.   Loretta and I send our condolences to Charlie's wife Patti Turner;  his sisters, Sheila Smith and Catherine Wilson; and his many, many  friends.                            ____________________
