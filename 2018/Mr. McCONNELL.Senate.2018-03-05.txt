 Mr. President, there is a simple reason nearly every  Kentuckian looks forward to March--college basketball. I would like to  take a moment to recognize several teams that are already making the  State proud by winning their conference tournaments.   This weekend, the women of the University of Louisville won their  first-ever ACC tournament title. Finishing the regular season with a  record of 29 to 2, the Cardinals are currently ranked third in the  Nation. Led by ACC Coach of the Year Jeff Walz and ACC Player of the  Year Asia Durr, these talented women are looking to add yet another  title.   So are the Murray State Racers. Its men's team won the Ohio Valley  Conference championship and earned its first NCAA tournament appearance  since 2012. It will look to build on the longest winning streak in the  Nation.   Also in Louisville, the Bellarmine Knights men's team earned its  second straight conference championship and a two-seed in the NCAA  Division II tournament.   At Thomas More College, both the men's and women's teams are  celebrating conference championships which earned them spots in the  NCAA Division III tournaments.   Lindsey Wilson College won its conference title and is headed back to  the NAIA Division I tournament for the first time since advancing to  the Fab Four in 2013.   The Union College men's team clinched its fifth consecutive  conference title. The Kentucky Christian Lady Knights took home the  Mideast Region title as well.   I congratulate all of these conference-winning Kentucky teams, their  coaches, and, of course, their dedicated fans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, we will vote on the  nominations of three more talented individuals today whom the President  has asked to serve as Federal district judges: Karen Scholer for the  Northern District of Texas, Tilman Self for the Middle District of  Georgia, and Terry Doughty for the Western District of Louisiana. These  are three excellent nominees, and I encourage all of our colleagues to  vote in support of each of them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, it has been 73  days since President Trump signed historic tax reform into law.   It feels as though it has been longer than that because, practically  every day, another major national employer announces a new commitment  to invest in American workers because of tax reform. Every day, we hear  about more local businesses realizing new savings and putting it toward  equipment, expansion, and employees. Every day, we hear about how  bonuses, rising wages, expanded benefits, and lower taxes are giving  middle-class families a whole lot more breathing room. Yet, every day,  we are reminded that some of our friends across the aisle are still  desperately trying to minimize this good news. Democratic leaders have  tried to say that these new jobs, raises, bonuses, and business  expansions amount to no more than ``crumbs.''   I leave the final verdict to the hard-working families across the  country, including the many Kentuckians from whom I hear. In the  meantime, the economic data are painting quite an optimistic picture.   Last week, the Labor Department announced that weekly jobless claims  had reached a 48-year low. Let me repeat that. Fewer Americans are  filing for unemployment today than at any time since 1969. The labor  market is tightening; employers are competing for talent; and workers  and their families are coming out on top.   In January, Americans' real disposable income rose more quickly than  it had since April of 2015. That is the biggest jump in spending money  available to American families, accounting for tax rates and inflation,  in nearly 3  [[Page S1326]]  years. That is more money to save for a home purchase or a college  fund. It is more to save for retirement or to spend on a family  vacation. U.S. consumer confidence is higher today than it has been  since the year 2000, and, last week, news broke that U.S. manufacturing  is expanding at its fastest pace since 2004.   Look, it is not complicated. The bill passed by the Republicans in  Congress last year was designed with a very simple philosophy in mind:  that when we put more of Americans' hard-earned money back in their own  pockets, they will know what best to do with it, that when we level the  playing field and take weight off the shoulders of small businesses,  they will help their communities thrive, and that when we welcome  investment from entrepreneurs and job creators, instead of discouraging  it, the economy will respond in kind.   The idea was simple enough, but as we are already seeing, because the  Republicans in Congress and the President were able to overcome  lockstep partisan opposition on the other side and get tax reform  across the finish line, that simple idea is having an extraordinary  impact.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination, Executive  Calendar No. 397.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.  [[Page S1336]]     Mr. President, it is my privilege to highlight the  50th anniversary of the founding of Northern Kentucky University, NKU.  I am proud to join with NKU's more than 14,000 students, its faculty  and staff, and its supporters in marking the history of the  institution.   As northern Kentucky was previously the only region in the State  without a traditional public university, many students lacked the  opportunity to attend a local 4-year institution of higher education  that students in other regions of Kentucky enjoyed. In response, a  bipartisan group of State legislators from the region worked with  Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn to establish a new school in 1968.  Originally named Northern Kentucky State College, the school proved to  be an attractive option for local students from the region. Less than a  decade later, as the campus continued to expand its programs and  services to accommodate a growing student population, the school became  a university, changing its name to Northern Kentucky University, NKU.  Since that time, NKU has continued to thrive, adding more  undergraduate, graduate, and even doctoral programs, which have  attracted a broader base of students to the university. These  advancements, coupled with the region's population growth and economic  development, have been an immense benefit to Northern Kentucky.   NKU has also expanded athletic opportunities for its students and has  built a number of strong teams. Having dominated NCAA Division II play  with two women's basketball national championships and one men's soccer  national championship, the Norse recently transitioned into NCAA  Division I. With this new reclassification, the Norse teams have  continued to excel. Winning the Horizon League tournament last year,  the men's basketball team earned their first trip to the NCAA Division  I tournament. This year, the team's hard work earned their title as the  Horizon League's regular season champions. In addition, the Norse have  many other impressive teams and dedicated fans.   On its golden anniversary, NKU has so much to be proud of. Under the  leadership of Interim President Gerard St. Amand, the school continues  to grow in both size and prominence. It has matured into a  comprehensive university that delivers innovative, student-centered  education and engages in impactful scholarly and creative endeavors,  all of which empower its graduates to have fulfilling careers and  meaningful lives.   With successful alumni who have entered a wide range of careers, from  government leaders to entrepreneurs, to artists, and to coaches, NKU  has helped more than 60,000 students achieve their dreams. For a half  century, NKU has had a tremendous impact on the economic, civic, and  social vitality of the region, and all Kentuckians are benefiting from  having such an outstanding higher education institution in our  Commonwealth. I would like to congratulate the entire Northern Kentucky  University community on reaching this Founders Day milestone, and I  urge my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing its  accomplishments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to S. 2155 with the time until the cloture vote equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees; further, that following  disposition of the Doughty nomination, the Senate resume consideration  of the motion to proceed to S. 2155; finally, that the Senate recess  from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. and that all time during recess,  adjournment, morning business, leader remarks, and the Doughty  confirmation vote count postcloture on the motion to proceed to S.  2155.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Casey.
