 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate my colleagues  on voting to remove Representative Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   Agreeing to H. Res. 76 sends a strong message that we support Israel  and the Jewish community.   I urge the 118th Congress to now stand together, proudly upholding  every single American--no matter race, pedigree, religion, nor creed-- as no less American than their neighbor; that Jewish Americans are  patriotic Americans; and that we all have a role in fighting bigotry  and anti-Semitism in our country.   We must make sure that the House of Representatives reflects such  principles as a united body.                            ____________________
