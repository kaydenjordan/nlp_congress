 Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his leadership on  this issue. It has been a pleasure to lead a subcommittee in the  Foreign Relations Committee with Senator Merkley. We have always worked  in a constructive fashion on some consequential issues and none more  consequential than the one before us today.   With respect to the crisis in Burma, we recently met with the lead  person on an international NGO who just returned from camps in  Bangladesh. He briefed us on some of the horrible circumstances facing  these individuals who have been forced out of Burma.   This last Friday, as Senator Merkley indicated, we also led a letter  to Ambassador Haley regarding the Burma crisis. I would also note that  we had an important hearing on this topic yesterday in the full Foreign  Relations Committee. I commend our leadership for putting that  together.   I want to share some of my thoughts about this crisis. Before I do, I  would like to acknowledge folks back home in the State of Indiana. I  happen to represent a significant number of Burmese Americans. These  are patriotic fellow Hoosiers, who have played an instrumental role  helping to educate me and members of my team on this crisis, and I am  happy we can be responsive to their concerns.   It is important for all Americans to understand what is happening in  America and everything outside our shores. Burma is a country that  doesn't typically capture the imagination or attention of people in the  United States, but, right now, in light of this humanitarian crisis, it  requires all of our attention.   The Burmese military has conducted a deplorable campaign of violence  against the Rohingya Muslim minority, including the systematic use of  arson, murder, and rape. Our State Department tells us that nearly 300  villages have been either partially or completely destroyed by fire  just since August 25 of this year by the Burmese military. That is more  than half of the approximately 470 Muslim villages in northern Rakhine  State.   Ambassador Haley has indicated that the Burmese military's actions  constitute a sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic  minority--ethnic cleansing. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights  has referred to this situation as a textbook example of ethnic  cleansing.   We have seen more than 600,000, who are mostly of the Rohingya ethnic  minority, flee the violence in the Rakhine State and seek refuge in  Bangladesh. They travel on foot for days, carrying what they can of  their belongings, carrying their young children. It is mostly women and  children who make this trek. Upon arrival in Bangladesh, we have been  briefed that many of them require immediate lifesaving assistance.   To put this severity in some measure of context, yesterday, our  Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development  characterized the resulting population movement as ``almost  unprecedented''--almost unprecedented--amidst all of the other  challenges we have seen in recent years, including the migrant crisis  coming out of the Middle East and across the shores of the  Mediterranean. Some research suggests the refugee flow from Burma has  been swifter than the exodus from Rwanda in 1994.   Many Americans will say: You know, honestly, we have a lot of  challenges in the world. Why should I care about this one? Well, here  is why: In Burma, we see a group of people--the Rohingya--being  systematically targeted because of their ethnicity. This, of course,  runs afoul of our basic values, the principles upon which our country  was founded. These principles inform the rules of the international  order that has existed for some number of decades now. These rules are  the mortar that holds the order together. We simply cannot allow  certain rules of international behavior to be violated or that will  encourage other bad actors, and they will continue to be undermined,  thus, undermining our national interests.   Recent history demonstrates that the systematic violation of  fundamental human rights sooner or later engenders security threats to  Americans, to our allies, and to our collective interests--think of  Tunisia, think of Syria, think of the countries of Yemen or Nigeria.  There are almost countless examples just in recent history where we  have seen or are seeing right now the depravation of basic human  rights. That, in turn, is undermining our values and our national  interests.   Let me apply this observation about the linkage between our values  and our interests--not just domestically but internationally--to the  situation in Burma. We know the past and present Burmese Governments  have systematically deprived the Rohingya population of their most  fundamental human rights. Not surprisingly, this has compelled a small  number to join the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, ARSA.    The most recent wave of ethnic cleansing began after ARSA conducted a  coordinated attack on Burmese security outposts, and the Burmese  military responded with disproportionate military actions and  deplorable attacks on civilians.   Here is a point the Burmese Government and the Burmese military must  understand. By refusing to treat the Rohingyas as full, equal citizens  and by attacking their own people who just want to live in peace, the  Burmese military is only going to increase the number of Rohingyas who  will be radicalized, exacerbating the very problem the Burmese military  says it is trying to address. So this is not in Burma's interest. I  can't emphasize that enough.   Before the most recent iteration of this crisis, in December 2016,  the International Crisis Group--an international nongovernmental  organization--issued a report titled ``Myanmar: A New Muslim Insurgency  in Rakhine State.'' The report said a number of things, among them that  the ``continued use of disproportionate force that has driven tens of  thousands from their homes or across the border to Bangladesh . . .  could create conditions for further radicalizing sections of the  Rohingya population that transnational jihadists could exploit.''   As we saw in Syria--to choose just one comparative example--when the  government fails to respect the basic human rights of their citizenry,  then conflict ensues. It can lead to far wider radicalization. The  conflict becomes a magnet, a magnet for international terrorists. It  becomes a factory that creates more international terrorists.   In short, when governments commit systematic and large-scale  violence, oppression, and injustice against its own people, it creates  a fertile ground for Islamist terrorist recruitment and radicalization.  This is contrary to the interests of everyone, including the Burmese  Government.   Further, if left unaddressed, the humanitarian and security situation  in Burma and Bangladesh will worsen and increasingly threaten regional  stability and U.S. national security interests.   The United States must continue to lead. There has to be an  international response in Burma. We need other partners to step up and  participate in that response, but the United States must continue to  lead. Part of leading comes down to clarity. What do we want of the  Burmese Government? I see at  [[Page S6798]]  least four things the Burmese Government must do.   First, the Burmese Government and their military must immediately end  its ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingyas. Second, the  Burmese Government must address the root of this conflict by  implementing the recommendations of a U.N. panel, the so-called  Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. Third, the Burmese Government  must permit safe access for journalists, for humanitarians, and for a  United Nations fact-finding mission and all of their personnel so we  can figure out precisely what is going on and who is responsible.  Finally, the Burmese Government must facilitate the safe and voluntary  return of all these individuals who have been displaced.   When I leave the Senate floor today, I am scheduled to immediately  visit with Burma's Ambassador to the United States. The points I just  mentioned are points I intend to reiterate directly to that Ambassador.   Moving forward, the United States should lead efforts to document  atrocities in Burma however we can so the perpetrators can be held  accountable. I also support the administration's announcement yesterday  that it is exploring accountability mechanisms that are already  available under U.S. law, including the so-called Global Magnitsky  targeted sanctions.   I call on countries like China and Russia to support the suspension  of all international weapons sales to the Burmese military. They should  not be transferring weapons to this murderous regime.   In conclusion, as Senator Merkley and I stated in our letter on  Friday to Ambassador Haley, now is the time. Now is the time to take  bold and effective actions against the Burmese Government to end the  violence, not just to help the Burmese people but to help stabilize the  region and protect U.S. national security interests. Now is the time to  uphold our fundamental values, the values, frankly, of civilized  nations. Now is the time to work with this administration and  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure we can reach as  peaceful and as positive a resolution to this horrible situation as  possible.   I want to close by once again acknowledging the tremendous leadership  of Senator Merkley. I thank him for his partnership in this effort.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am saddened to report the recent  passing of Marjorie Counsilman, a treasured member of the Bloomington  and Indiana University community. Mrs. Counsilman passed away on August  17, 2017, at the age of 93. I join her family and friends in mourning  the passing of a beloved Hoosier, who was a dedicated mother and mentor  to countless Indiana swimmers.   Mrs. Counsilman, or ``Marge,'' as she was affectionately known by her  colleagues, friends, and family, helped lead IU's swim team to a string  of national and Big Ten titles. Marge was the wife of the late IU  swimming coach, James ``Doc'' Counsilman, who led the Hoosiers to six  consecutive NCAA championship victories, 23 Big Ten titles, 52 broken  world records, 154 American records, and 106 individual NCAA records.  In 2013, Marge and Doc were inaugurated into the Monroe County Sports  Hall of Fame. Trophies aside, Marge was best known for her compassion  towards her fellow coaches, customers at her family-owned restaurant in  Bloomington, and the countless young swimmers she encountered over her  decades of service. Her impression on the sport stretches well beyond  the swimming lanes of Indiana. In 2004, she was honored by the  International Swimming Hall of Fame as a ``Grande Dame'' for her  leadership and influence.   In 2012, Mrs. Counsilman received the Bill Orwig Award, which  recognizes exceptional contributions made by nonalumnus to IU's  athletic program. Marge was constantly hosting team dinners, running  swim meets, and keeping the official records. Throughout her husband  Doc's 33 years at IU, Marge acted as a substitute mother for all the  collegiate swimmers, either providing help with assignments or offering  her famous lasagna and pecan pie.   In her memory, I would ask that we take a moment to reflect on her  exemplary life and model of service. It is a privilege to honor  Marjorie Counsilman, and I want to offer my condolences to her two  daughters, Cathy Counsilman and Jill Morris, and to the many friends  and family members she leaves behind. We will continue to honor her  legacy and generous spirit.                            ____________________
