 Mr. President, Wendy is a constituent of mine from  Stanford, CT, and she tells a story that is going to sound incredibly  familiar to folks who have been part of this healthcare debate over the  last 10 years in this Chamber. She said:         When my daughter was 15, she was diagnosed with a type of       bone cancer and underwent a year of treatment. We were       hopeful that she was cured, but exactly 1 year ago--it was 2       months after she graduated from college and was about to move       across the country to begin her career when she underwent a       routine checkup and found out that the cancer had returned.       The past year has included more chemo, surgery, and       immunotherapy.        My daughter is now 23 years old, and she is the definition       of a preexisting condition. She is still on our health plan,       but we are already looking at the time in about 2 years when       that will no longer be possible. Although she is at least       feeling well enough to begin the job search again, there is       no security for any of us without the existence of the       Affordable Care Act as an option should she not have       employer-based healthcare. She is a young woman who has       already gone through so much in these short years. There are       enough unknowns. Please continue--    This is her writing to me--       to protect the Affordable Care Act so she knows she has       healthcare.    President Trump last night contested the idea that 100 million  Americans have preexisting conditions. Well, maybe he is right because  most data suggests that the number is 130 million Americans who have  some form of preexisting condition that, if insurance companies were  allowed to, would either result in rate hikes for them because of their  diagnosis, or insurance would be made unavailable to them entirely.   Now, it has almost been 10 years since we lived in a world where  insurance companies could deny you healthcare because of a preexisting  condition or could raise your rate simply because you are a woman. So  for many Americans, it is even hard to remember those days in which you  could be discriminated against just because of a childhood cancer. But  those days are about to come back. We are literally months away, if  President Trump is successful in ramming through this Supreme Court  nominee, from insurance companies once again being able to deny  coverage to anybody they want based upon their gender, based upon their  medical history, based upon their prior diagnosis.   This isn't hyperbole because I have been in the Congress long enough  to know two things. One, Republicans will stop at nothing in order to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we will talk this afternoon about  what that means beyond the 130 million Americans who will have their  rates increased. But I know something else as well, which is that there  is no replacement. There is nothing coming from the Republican majority  in the Senate or from this administration to replace the Affordable  Care Act. Do you know why I know that? Because I have been waiting for  the replacement for a decade, and it has never shown up because it  never will.   Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act here the first  year of the President's term. A lot of people said it was a foregone  conclusion--of course, after having pledged to repeal the Affordable  Care Act for 5 years, Republicans now, with control of the Senate and  the House and the White House, will of course make good on their  promise. Of course, we know how that turned out. They couldn't because  the American people rose up. Phone lines lit up, townhall meetings  exploded, and Republicans in the end  [[Page S5914]]  could not find the votes, even with majorities in both Houses and  control of the White House, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Well, then, Republicans said, let's find another way. If we can't use  the most democratic process--legislation--in order to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, then let's go to the courts.   So Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn  the entirety of the Affordable Care Act on a legal premise that most  mainstream scholars thought had no shot, but they weren't counting on  this President being able to pack the Court with enough extreme,  rightwing jurists to accept the flawed argument. So the President  started by putting Neil Gorsuch on the Court. He continued with Brett  Kavanaugh. Now, one vote away from being able to overturn the  Affordable Care Act, he now has a chance, with the nomination of Amy  Coney Barrett, to finally get what he couldn't get done in the elected  branch of American government--the full repeal and elimination of the  Affordable Care Act with nothing to replace it.   It is not hyperbole because there is literally that case that I  described getting ready for argument before the Supreme Court a week  after election day. So guess why it is so important that we confirm a  Justice before election day--because they need the votes to invalidate  the Affordable Care Act shortly after the election occurs, and it  becomes a little bit harder if that Justice is not there to hear the  arguments in mid-November.   Take Republicans at their word: They want the Affordable Care Act  gone. Take Republicans at their word: They don't have a replacement.   It will be a humanitarian catastrophe in this country, in the middle  of a pandemic--a pandemic that is killing 1,000 people a day; 44,000  new infections that we know of on a daily basis--if 23 million  Americans lose access to insurance.   Remember, this lawsuit doesn't ask for the Affordable Care Act to be  eliminated in pieces or over time; the remedy it seeks is the  Affordable Care Act gone, all of it, overnight. There are 23 million  Americans who rely on that and 260,000 in my State--the equivalent of  62 different towns in my State alone losing their health insurance.   Don't think that States are going to be able to pick up the pieces  here. A lot of these folks are on Medicaid. Theoretically, States could  decide to pick up the bill themselves, but they can't because the  President has forced States to foot the lion's share of the bill for  fighting COVID because of the failure to stand up a national response.  So States have no money lying around in order to make up for all the  people who are going to lose Medicaid access. There are 23 million  people who can lose their insurance, potentially by the end of the year  or early next year, if this Justice gets confirmed to the Court.    But then, all those people with preexisting conditions--and,  remember, we now have a new preexisting condition. That is COVID. What  we are learning about COVID-19 is very, very worrying. Researchers have  observed changes to the heart, the vascular system, the lungs, the  brain, the kidneys in those who have gotten sick, and even in many  people who are asymptomatic. In fact, there is a study out there right  now that Dr. Fauci noted before the HELP Committee recently that shows  70 to 80 percent of people who have had COVID have some lasting damage  to their heart. COVID is a preexisting condition.   Now, you may think, I haven't had COVID, so I am not at risk of that  preexisting condition causing my rates to go up if Amy Coney Barrett  gets confirmed to the Court. Well, you don't know if you have had COVID  or not, and let me tell you that insurance companies are not going to  play dumb. If they are allowed to discriminate against you because you  have COVID, then they are going to require you to prove that you  haven't had it before you get a policy. Millions and millions of  Americans are going to have their rates increased or be denied  healthcare at all because they had COVID, whether they were  asymptomatic or symptomatic. That, in and of itself, is a healthcare  crisis in this country.   So the stakes of this debate over the nomination of this new Supreme  Court Justice couldn't be higher. Senator Klobuchar talked about the  fact that this Supreme Court may decide the outcome of this election,  and that is a subject that we should explore at a different time. But 1  week after the election, the Court will hear a case asking for the  invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. Republicans in the  Senate and the White House have no plan to replace it, and if that case  is successful, 23 million people are at risk of losing their health  insurance: 11 million who are on the exchanges; 12 million who are  covered by Medicaid; 133 million Americans, roughly half of America's  population under the age of 65, could have their rates increase because  of preexisting conditions; 2 million young people under the age of 26  could be kicked off their parents' health insurance; and 9 million  people who receive Federal subsidies, tax credits, to buy private  insurance would lose that coverage.   In the midst of a global pandemic, a COVID diagnosis would possibly  render you ineligible for insurance. That is a nightmare--a nightmare  on top of the pandemic nightmare that we are living through currently.   So we are on the floor today to make sure that our Senate Republican  colleagues don't distract the American public, don't try to create  controversies around this nomination that don't exist, and don't try to  put words in Democrats' mouths. Listen to what we are saying. What we  are saying is that this nomination is about the future of the American  healthcare system, and every single Senator who votes to confirm Amy  Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, I believe, is voting to take  insurance away from over 20 million Americans, voting to render COVID a  preexisting condition that requires you to pay more for healthcare for  the rest of your life, and going back to the days in which any  preexisting condition could cause you to lose your health insurance and  then lose everything that you have saved up over decades and decades.   Betty Burger is one of those people, and I will finish with her  story. Betty Burger had good insurance through her husband her entire  life. He changed jobs, and he had about a week's period of time in  which he didn't have a job in between those two jobs and did not have  healthcare. During that week, one of their kids was diagnosed with  cancer, and it became a preexisting condition, such that the husband's  employer's healthcare plan wouldn't cover it, and the Burgers lost  everything--everything. They went bankrupt. They went through their  savings. They went through the college fund. They lost their house.  They lost everything.   It has been a decade since any American has had to face that kind of  financial ruin because of a diagnosis for them or their child. It is  hard for us to remember those days, but they are coming back. They are  coming back--I tell you this now--if this Supreme Court Justice is  rammed through over the course of the next month.   I yield the floor.
