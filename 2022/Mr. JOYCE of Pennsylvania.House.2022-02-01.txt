 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  crisis that is causing energy prices to skyrocket and hurting  Pennsylvanians.   This year it is estimated that Americans will pay 32 percent more to  heat their homes than they did last year. This sudden spike in prices  is the result of President Biden's war on affordable energy sources,  sources like oil, natural gas, coal, and the Marcellus shale that is so  readily available in Pennsylvania.   Instead of promoting these affordable baseload power sources, the  Biden administration has doubled down on their failed policies. So far,  President Biden has canceled projects, including the Keystone XL  pipeline. He has refused to sign new drilling leases that would  ultimately lower the cost of energy for my constituents.   President Biden and his far-left administration are fighting against  American businesses and against American families.   The dead of winter is not the time to implement the Green New Deal.  The coldest months of the year are no time to raise heating costs.  These reckless policies must end.                            ____________________
