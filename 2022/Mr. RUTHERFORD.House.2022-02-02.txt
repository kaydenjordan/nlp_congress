 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Uncle  Sam, also known as Pastor Terry Horn, on his longstanding and excellent  work serving the children of our northeast Florida community.   Pastor Terry and his wife, Cynthia, run an organization called Metro  City Kids, which teaches hope, healing, and patriotism to at-risk youth  in inner-city Jacksonville. They teach a faith-based program that is  focused on Biblical truths, moral values, good manners, and  citizenship.   Uncle Sam and Cynthia are truly making a difference.   In fact, after the first 5 years in ministry in Jacksonville's public  housing, juvenile crime, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's  Office, dropped 40 percent on those properties where they minister.   Thank you to Uncle Sam for making northeast Florida a safer and  happier place for our youth.                            ____________________
