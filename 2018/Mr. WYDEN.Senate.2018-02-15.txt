 Madam President, right now it is estimated that 700,000  Dreamers face the very real threat that they may be ripped from the  only life and the only country they have ever known. These are young  people who have grown up in America. They go to school here. They work  hard here. Often, they work at multiple jobs. They get terrific grades.  They give back to their communities. They have done everything right.   I have met with them at home. My colleague Senator Merkley and I have  met with many of them at joint meetings. A number of them say point  blank: We like to serve America. We believe in America.   That is all they have known. They serve in the military. They want to  do police work. They want to be first responders.   In fact, to earn their DACA status, they had to come forward, give  their information to our government, and then submit to a background  check. Now they are living under this cloud of  [[Page S1139]]  uncertainty because the President, on his own, stamped an expiration  date on the DACA Program.   What I wish to do for a few minutes is to talk about these terrific  young people--these special young people, the Dreamers--and what they  contribute to our country.   I was very pleased recently to have Esli Becerra join me at this  year's State of the Union speech because in my view he and his younger  brother Kevin embody the very best about our country. Esli came to  Oregon when he was 8 months old. He got his first job before he was 10  in order to support his family. I am going to talk a little bit about  these two terrific young people because, literally, for years now, each  of them would take turns working to support the other, so that between  them they were always saying: We want to do it the American way. We  want to do it by dint of hard work and thrift and in the spirit we have  in this country, where if you work hard, there aren't any limits to  what you can achieve. They are two very, very special young men.   Esli wanted to get a higher education. So his younger brother put in  the sweat equity to make it happen. Kevin, who is a U.S. citizen,  worked more than 80 hours a week after he graduated from high school to  help pay for Esli to go to Lane Community College in Eugene.   Let me repeat that. Kevin, a U.S. citizen, who worked in our office,  as well, worked more than 80 hours a week after he got out of high  school because he said: I want to help my brother get ahead.   Esli has now built a real professional career. He is a visual effects  artist in Portland. So he has turned around, and he is stepping up to  help pay for Kevin's college education. We have these two remarkable  brothers who, year after year, were either working or going to school  in order to help each other get ahead in the way that we hope young  people will do by dint of hard work and discipline and supporting each  other. They are brothers, and they have been in each other's corner and  supportive of their families their whole lives. We need more people in  America like the Becerra brothers.   They are not alone. Another of Oregon's estimated 11,000 Dreamers is  a young man named Daniel Kim. He immigrated legally to Beaverton, OR,  from South Korea, but he learned that his immigration lawyer never  filed the paperwork needed to get permanent legal status. So without  this information, he found out very abruptly that he was considered  undocumented.   Thanks to DACA and a special military recruitment program, Daniel had  the opportunity to serve our country. He seized the opportunity and  joined the U.S. Army the first chance he got.   I will state that I just find it painful to hear the disparaging talk  about immigrants. Unfortunately, the President uses that kind of  language too often. Maybe it is easy for people in Washington, DC, to  forget that these debates are about real people. They are not just  about acronyms and numbers. Daniel and Esli are the types of young  people this debate is about--a soldier on the frontlines defending our  country, a young man working hard at home in Oregon and supporting his  family. These are the young people whose lives have been turned upside  down by a Presidential decision, and they are just pawns in this raging  political battle.   Young people like Esli and Daniel signed up for DACA so they could  work and give back to the country. Dreamers are integral parts of their  communities. They pitch in and help those communities grow. If all DACA  recipients lost their protections, it would be a massive economic hit  to our country--$280 billion lost. Even going beyond the humanitarian  impact of breaking up families, that is what DACA recipients mean from  a dollars-and-cents standpoint.   The crisis Dreamers are facing began last year when the President  made the decision to terminate the program. Senators from both parties  have now been working to fix it. Time after time, Senators have brought  bipartisan ideas forward, and I would like to note at this point that  Senator Schumer went to the President and put the border wall on the  table for discussion, making it clear that this was something that he  didn't support but that he would put it out there just to try to  generate some goodwill and to try to find a way to get folks working  together. Throughout this discussion, sometimes it seems the President  just will not take yes for an answer.    So Senators from both sides keep working in the best tradition of  this body. On the healthcare front, we sure showed here recently what  could be done when there is bipartisanship and Senators are working  together. He sits right over there--Chairman Hatch of the Finance  Committee. He and I worked together. I am the ranking Democrat on the  committee. We now have a 10-year authorization to the Children's Health  Insurance Program. Nobody would have ever imagined that a year and a  half ago. We have made a transformative set of changes in Medicare to  update the Medicare guarantee to cover chronic illness, cancer,  diabetes, heart disease, and stroke--where most of the healthcare  spending is. We got that done, as well as the biggest change in child  welfare policy in the Families First Program, an approach that  Democrats and Republicans had been dreaming about for 30 years. I bring  it up only by way of saying that bipartisanship can break out here in  the Senate.   Right now, as I am on the floor, I know we still have a big group of  Democrats and Republicans who are saying that this is too important to  just have another political food fight. They are working on a  compromise plan--Democrats and Republicans--that would bring this DACA  crisis to a close, invest in border security, make some changes to our  legal immigration system, and particularly do justice to the Dreamers,  like young Esli Becerra.   The reality is that when we are doing something like that, it is  pretty obvious that nobody gets the bill they would have written.  Nobody gets the bill they would have written for themselves if they  were to go back to their office and take out a sheet of paper and write  down from A to Z, but that is pretty much what we have to recognize if  we are going to find some common ground. That is how the bipartisan  process is supposed to work.   Colleagues, bipartisanship is not about taking each other's dumb  ideas. Anybody can do that. Bipartisanship is about taking each other's  good ideas. That is where we have a big group of Senators--Democrats  and Republicans--working together on this issue.   Unfortunately, it seems that recent reports indicate that the  President and his team are working to derail this bipartisan solution.  They are insisting on some kind of approach that will make radical  changes to the legal immigration system, for example.   I wish to note for a second that this is very important in the Wyden  household. My parents fled the Nazis in the 1930s. Not all got out. My  dad basically talked his way into the Army. They weren't all that  interested in my dad. He was overweight, and he had health problems.  But my dad convinced them that he was a German kid, and he could write  propaganda pamphlets that we could drop on the Nazis, telling them that  they were going to die and they were going to freeze. My dad was the  most patriotic person I ever met. We are better because of legal  immigration in this country. Yet in order to get this compromise, we  have now seen proposals to radically change the legal immigration  system.   I see my colleague, an outstanding member of the Finance Committee,  who knows so much about these immigration issues on the floor, and I  look forward to his remarks.   The fact is, the President is demanding an approach that goes way  beyond DACA and border security, which are two natural bookends for  bipartisanship, and it is where this debate begins. Unfortunately, what  the President is really pushing breaks up families and severely cuts  back legal immigration, and I just noted that I have seen why legal  immigration makes our country better and stronger. What the President  is talking about would, on top of this, do enormous economic harm to  this country and is certainly not going to get the votes here in the  Senate to proceed with 60 votes. The bipartisan solution on which both  sides have worked hard together is the best opportunity that the  Chamber has to end the DACA crisis.   The Senate really cannot come up with sustainable solutions when we  [[Page S1140]]  just play to those who take the most extreme view. We can't get a  sustainable solution. By the way, that is how debates in the Senate are  supposed to work--two parties, hand in hand, bringing their ideas  forward and finding solutions both sides can agree on. That is why I  mentioned Chairman Hatch and our finally getting the major health  reforms recently that people never dreamed were possible.   On this debate at hand, the question of justice for the Dreamers and  reasonable border security--two bookends that I happen to think could  fit and produce principled bipartisanship through this group of  Senators who are working together--this is our opportunity. Millions of  families across the country are following this debate, and they are  hoping to get some good news on this issue where there has been  gridlock for so long.   Passing the bipartisan proposal is our opportunity to give it to  them. This is the time for the Congress to come up with a permanent  solution for Dreamers. This is not something to be deferred any longer.  It is time to act now. I urge my colleagues in the strongest way  possible to support the bipartisan proposal--Democrats and Republicans  coming together--when there is an opportunity to vote on it, which I  believe will be shortly.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in a truly dubious distinction, this week  marks the 7th year since tens of thousands of Bahraini citizens took to  the streets of Manama in protest.   These brave men and women put themselves at great risk to demand  greater access to their political system and more accountability from  their government.   Rather than engage these protestors in meaningful dialogue, the  regime responded with violence, tear gas, and rubber bullets.   After much international attention, Bahrain's King agreed to set up  the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, or BICI, and to fully  implement its recommended reforms.   I say to the Senate today, on the seventh anniversary of the  demonstrations, that the regime has not upheld this fundamental  commitment.   In fact, the situation has only grown worse over the past 12 months  as the regime has actually taken a number of huge steps back.   In January of 2017, the regime restored arrest and detainment powers  to Bahrain's National Security Agency, despite that agency's past  involvement in torture and coercion of political prisoners.   Later in the year, the King approved a constitutional amendment  allowing military courts to try Bahraini citizens, a move Amnesty  International called ``disastrous'' and warned would be used to crack  down on political opposition.   These policies are fundamentally at odds with the BICI  recommendations and make clear what folks in international human rights  community have long said, that the regime has no intention of upholding  its commitment.   The State Department last certified in 2013 that the regime had fully  implemented a mere handful of the BICI recommendations. The last State  Department update, in 2016, failed to identify any further progress  taken.   Last year a panel of UN human rights experts noted a ``sharp  deterioration of the human rights situation in the country . . . aimed  at muzzling any discordant voice and suppressing dissent.''   The State Department's most recent Human Rights Report details the  Bahraini regime's willingness to revoke citizenship as a punishment,  often without providing a concrete justification and without an  opportunity for basic due process.   A Washington Post story from last year indicated the regime revoked  citizenship from more than 100 Bahrainis  [[Page S1160]]  in the first half of 2017, and reports indicate the regime issued  deportation orders to eight Bahrainis just last month after stripping  them of citizenship.   A number of organizations, including Human Rights Watch and Americans  for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain, have echoed these  observations.   Regrettably, the Trump administration has done almost nothing to push  Bahrain's leaders to fulfill their commitments and do better by their  own citizens.   Why would they when the Embassy of Bahrain is throwing lavish parties  at the Trump Hotel right here in DC?   As I try to make clear every year, these observations, which have  become a sad tradition of mine, are not an attempt to undermine  Bahrain's government.   Bahrain has been a longtime U.S. ally and a partner in a region where  partnership can be difficult to come by, but precisely because of our  close ties, I feel compelled to speak out when I see such blatant  repression of basic human rights.   Oregonians--indeed, Americans--expect their elected officials to hold  our international partners to a higher standard. And that is what I am  doing here today.   I renew my call on the Bahrain's monarchy to halt its deliberate  campaign of silencing peaceful opposition, to stop the indefensible  revocation of citizenships, and to release political prisoners like  Nabeel Rajab and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja.   I fear that only then will Bahrain be able to move forward together  in peace and prosperity, and I look forward to that day.                            ____________________
