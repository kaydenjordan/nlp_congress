 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Maloney, who is the chair of  the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and the LGBTQ+ Equality  Caucus for their work and support for the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act.   As we celebrate Pride Month and remember the 53rd anniversary of the  Stonewall riots, we recognize the progress, lived experience, and  suffering of the LGBTQI+ community.   In many ways our Federal Government is falling short on the promise  to craft and implement inclusive public policy, in part, because we  lack the necessary data to address the issues affecting the LGBTQI+  community.                                time  1500    While some data is currently collected and Federal agents have made  progress, far too many LGBTQI+ individuals remain overlooked in many  Federal data collection efforts.   As the Center for American Progress has calculated, more than five in  six LGBTQ adults cannot be identified by existing questions in non- experimental survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau such as the  American Community Survey and the Census, which only accounts for  cohabitating same-sex couples.   That is why I introduced this legislation, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion  Act, to ensure we have robust and accurate data.   The bill would require Federal surveys to include data collection on  sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations of sex  characteristics on a voluntary basis. Again, let me emphasize what the  Chair emphasized, this bill would only collect voluntary, self- disclosed data.   An individual will not be required to disclose this information, nor  would this information be used in a manner that would adversely affect  any individual.   It would ensure that lawmakers and Federal agencies have the  comprehensive data they need to address the LGBTQI+ issues.   We cannot craft policies that remedy the disparities faced by these  individuals, particularly people of color, in issues of discrimination,  unemployment, healthcare, housing instability, and more if we do not  have the adequate and correct data.   We have seen how the pandemic has impacted many Americans, and we are  still learning how the LGBTQI+ community were disproportionately  affected by the COVID-19 crisis. This is just one of many areas that  our Federal Government lacks knowledge in how to respond to these  issues.   In many ways, the tireless work of LGBTQ organizations in gathering  this information has provided a better scope of the problems and  disparities than the Federal Government itself.   The LGBTQI+ community deserves to be visible and heard so public  policy can better reflect their needs. It is critical to close the data  gap that often invalidates their lives.   Perhaps more importantly, this bill comes at a time when Republican  State legislatures across this country have introduced more than 300  anti-LGBTQ bills that target youth and their families. This bill would  force those individuals focused on denying rights to LGBTQ individuals  to have a reckoning.   It will allow the community to be counted and, therefore, heard.   Not only is this bill necessary, it is a top priority of President  Biden.   During his first day in office, President Biden issued numerous  executive orders to strengthen the rights and improve the lives of  LGBTQI+ people across this country.   He directed all Federal agencies that enforce Federal laws  prohibiting sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination based on  sexual orientation and gender identity.   Just last week, he established a new Federal coordinating committee  on sexual orientation and gender identity for data which will lead  efforts across agencies to identify opportunities to strengthen this  data collection, while safeguarding privacy protection and the civil  rights of individuals.   These are all great initiatives, but we need to go further and codify  them into law. This is why this bill is so important.   In addition, this bill includes implementation of a process for  Federal agencies to routinely assess changes needed in the collection  of this data. This will provide enough flexibility for Federal agents  to use the most effective data collection methods for their agency.   We are grateful for the invaluable support and input of more than 200  LGBTQI+ groups and allies that have helped get this legislation to  where it is today. It could not have been done without them.   This is an important piece of legislation for each and every LGBTQI+  individual in our Nation. As a proud ally, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill so that all our constituents are seen, heard, and  counted.   We are not ignoring the current challenges facing Americans. They are  not being ignored, as was brought up. Rather, we are treating all  Americans equally and being inclusive.   And in this great legacy of our Nation, one of the great legacies  that all of us who take pride in being part of this Nation, who take  pride in being Americans, one of the great legacies is that this Nation  offers, under the rule of law, an inalienable right of equality; an  inalienable right of access, and for public policy to reflect the needs  and respond to the needs of all individuals.   This bill takes us one step further in this direction. This bill is  not punitive; it is inclusive. This bill is not mean-spirited; it is  welcoming. And this bill, above all, is American for all Americans.
