 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a  problem that is plaguing our great country.   Americans and the rest of the world woke up on October 7 to horrific  scenes in Israel, and the ensuing news reports of Hamas's terrorist  attack brought to light even more gruesome details--thousands of  innocent Israelis slaughtered, babies decapitated, people burned alive,  horrific scenes of brutality and brazen disregard for humanity by Hamas  terrorists. Israel and American hostages are still awaiting rescue.   These past few weeks following the terrorist attack, there has been a  frightening rise of anti-Semitism, particularly on college campuses and  from  [[Page S5412]]  younger generations in America's major cities.   Jewish students at Cooper Union in New York City had to shelter in a  library while pro-Palestinian students banged on windows and doors in a  frightening incident. Anonymous posters on a Cornell message board  threatened violence, all while a Cornell professor proclaimed Hamas  terrorist attacks to be ``exhilarating'' and ``energizing.'' Countless  videos show students and even teachers tearing down missing posters for  Israeli hostages. The list goes on and on.   Some may be surprised by these incidents, but for those who have been  paying attention, it is anything but shocking. For years, the American  left has embraced identity politics--DEI and critical race theory. For  years, students at some of this country's most elite colleges have had  this race essentialism, this oppressor-versus-oppressed ideology,  hammered into their heads.   They have tried to make moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas.  Every single situation or issue is viewed through the lens of race or  other immutable characteristics.   If you don't rank high enough on the totem pole of grievances or  score well on the oppression matrix, well, then your views aren't as  important. Being right has taken a back seat to your skin color.   DEI and CRT are fruit of the poisonous tree of cultural Marxism, and  it is playing out right now in our streets. The proof is in the numbers  as well. A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll states that when voters were asked  whom they sided with in the Israeli-Hamas conflict, 95 percent of  voters age 65 or older said Israel, while only 5 percent said Hamas. In  the 18-to-24 age range, 52 percent said Israel, while 48 percent said  Hamas. That is a startling generational divide and shows just how  entrenched this divisive ideology is.   This ideology completely strips people of their individuality. Ideas  don't really matter as much as what the person speaking looks like. It  is completely antithetical to the core tenets of our Constitution and  the American experiment. It places an unhealthy emphasis on race. It  strips people of their dignity and the many layers that define us. It  rips away the ties that bind us, and that is exactly the point for  these cultural Marxists.   We need to return to the American idea--equality of opportunity, not  certainty of outcome or so-called equity. We need to prioritize merit  over characteristics that people have no control over. We need to push  back against the poisonous DEI and CRT ideology--an ideology that has  even made its way into grade schools, where school-age kids are being  forced to participate in things called a privilege walk. Until we do  that, we will continue to see more race essentialism from groups like  Black Lives Matter and more chants of ``from the river to the sea.''  That is not what America is about, but we better get real about the  problem before it is too late to fix it.                    Nomination of Ramon Ernesto Reyes, Jr.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, the Biden administration is constantly  trying to sell Americans that the economy is improving. They offer  miniscule morsels of improvement. The big picture shows an economy that  is struggling mightily, and Americans are struggling along with it.   The Biden administration wants to tout Bidenomics as a success. Young  Americans, families, elderly Americans, and everyone in between are  being crushed under the weight of economic stagnation. According to the  New York Times, 81 percent of Americans rated economic conditions as  ``fair'' or ``poor.'' CBS News states that 66 percent of Americans rate  the national economy as ``bad.'' ABC News has a poll that says 76  percent of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction.  About two in three Americans say their household expenses have risen in  the last year, but only one in four says their income has increased in  the same period, according to an AP poll.   Higher prices, stagnant wages, and skyrocketing interest rates are  hammering the American people across all demographics.   Typically, young Americans are looking to buy a house, condo, or  property, and build some equity. It is a staple of building a fiscally  healthy future and the foundation of the American dream. Not only can  young people not afford homes with the current obscene interest rates,  they can barely afford to keep their heads above water.   While Biden tries to distract young voters with his climate alarmism  and that the Earth is going to boil, it is actually Biden's woeful  mismanagement of the economy that is the real existential threat to the  economy, the real existential threat to the American dream, the real  existential threat to their future. Furthermore, it is Biden's insane  energy policies that have stifled domestic energy production and made  everything more expensive.   For families, it is even tougher in this economy. Household goods and  food costs are more expensive now. Families are dipping into their  savings and incurring more expenses and credit card debt, which is now  at record levels.   Overall prices have risen 17 percent and are costing the average  American household $940 more per month. For elderly Americans who are  retired or who are about to retire, this economy poses a dire threat.  Higher prices on everything doesn't bode well for those on a fixed  income, and with people dipping into their retirement savings just  [[Page S5415]]  to cover the costs, it doesn't bode well for those hoping to retire  soon either.   It turns out that, when you spend trillions and trillions and  trillions of dollars you don't have and declare war on domestic energy  production, inflation runs rampant. The cost of everything goes up.  That is what Americans are living through. They don't need slogans.  They are not buying it. No matter how many times he says Bidenomics is  working, the American people are struggling with higher costs, and they  know it is not.   The antidote to the Bidenomics' poison is clear: Stop deficit  spending. Become energy dominant to ease the burden on working  families.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding leader from Missouri, Mr. John Richards. John is the CEO  and general manager of Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative out of  Marshfield, MO.   In March 2023, John announced he would be retiring at the end of the  year to close out a long and distinguished career of over 48 years with  Sho-Me Power. He began his career with Sho-Me Power in September 1975  as a supervisor trainee in their accounting department. Less than a  year later, John was promoted to an accountant, and in 1979, he became  the manager of finance, later referred to as chief financial officer, a  position he would hold for 37 years. In 2016, John was appointed by  Sho-Me Power's board of directors to become the Cooperative's fifth CEO  and general manager.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5424, November 8, 2023, in the third column, the  following language appears: In March 2023, John announced he would  be retiring at the end of the year to close out a long and  distinguished career or over 48 years with Sho-Me Power.
