 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, during my time this  afternoon, my colleagues and I will address the burning issues that are  on the hearts and minds of all our constituents back home--really, all  Americans--and that is the numerous self-inflicted crises of the Biden  administration and the House Democrats' increasingly radical leftwing  legislative agenda.   Madam Speaker, Democrats may narrowly control the House, the Senate,  and the White House, but over the past several weeks, it has become  abundantly clear that they just cannot govern.   America is in crisis. Everybody knows that, and everybody can feel it  in so many areas.                                time  1630    Today, the White House spends its days doing damage control on all  these multiple crises of their own making.   Just think of what we are facing right now. We have an economic  crisis where jobs remain unfilled, prices for basic goods continue to  rise, and the shelves sit empty.   We have got an energy crisis that has led to the highest gasoline  crisis since 2007, and we know the projections for warming our homes in  the winter are off the charts.   We have multiple foreign policy crises, and we have on the southern  border humanitarian, national security, and public health crises like  we have never seen before.   These really are existential kinds of threats to the country. I know  our colleagues like to throw that word around, but it really does apply  here. And while all Presidents confront crises beyond their control,  that is not what is happening here. These crises--the things we are  talking about today--are the direct result of this administration's own  actions.   We know that inflation is rising because Democrats are flooding the  economy with money and supply is down because of labor shortages caused  by the Democrats' so-called pandemic policies. Gas prices are up thanks  to a steady assault on our energy producers by the Biden  administration. Our foreign policy is in crisis because of the Biden  debacle in Afghanistan and all the other fumbles that they have made.   The border problem is simple. They opened the border. They put a  welcome mat there and told everybody around the world to come on in.  The Democrats opened it, and so we should not be surprised or shocked  at the result of that invitation.  [[Page H5708]]    Here in Congress the picture is no better. If you think about this,  the Democrats have a mere three-seat majority in this House. We have a  fifty-fifty deadlock in the Senate. There is no objective person in  this country who could look at those numbers and say that the Democrats  have any mandate to ram through the most partisan and most expensive  legislative package in the history of this Nation using the slimmest  majority possible.   If you ask the Democrats what is in the bill, Madam Speaker, they  can't tell you because they don't know.   Is amnesty in it?   Well, the House certainly worked to add it.   Taxpayer funded abortion? A carbon tax? A tax on prescription drugs?   They have been working very hard to include all those things. The one  thing they do know for sure is that they are deadlocked. They are  insistent that they want to spend $5.5 trillion of hardworking  Americans' tax money while inflation goes through the roof and while we  are trying to recover from a pandemic. This is the worst possible time  to be doing what they are doing.   The American people expected competence in the White House. They  wanted bipartisanship in Congress. They have received instead the most  incompetent White House of our lifetimes and a Democrat-led Congress  trying to push the most extreme agenda in our history.   This is not hyperbole; these are facts. And my colleagues are going  to lay out many of the reasons, many of the facts, and much of the  evidence that proves what every American now knows intuitively. If  House Democrats drop their radical, dangerous agenda right now, I  promise you, Madam Speaker, they would find so many Members of this  party on our side of the aisle who would be ready to work with them in  a bipartisan fashion tomorrow. We have so many challenges facing the  country. But they won't do that. They are dug in. And their votes prove  over and over now that they are determined to be Big Government  socialists and not the Democratic Party of our parents' generation.   This afternoon we will highlight what this agenda is doing to our  country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson).    Madam Speaker, this is such an important  issue in Louisiana, my home State. We are a big energy State. We were  so excited to have achieved not just energy independence under the  Trump administration but energy dominance. We were a net exporter, and,  of course, all that has been reversed, as my friend just explained.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's  effort, and I thank him for sharing his insights this afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the great gentleman from the big State of  Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  comments, and that clarity and conviction is so necessary right now. I  love how the gentleman is articulating the stark differences between  the two competing visions for this country right now. The chasm is so  wide between the Republican and Democratic Parties, and we say that  without any pleasure at all.   It is a sad development in our politics that this is not--listen to  us at home--this is not your parents' and your grandparents' Democratic  Party.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to move from Texas and move over to  Alabama.   I yield to the gentleman from a Alabama (Mr. Carl), a good friend of  mine.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and  appreciate him being here tonight and articulating that so well.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for those  insights.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett).    Madam Speaker, I thank my always friend.  The gentleman's metaphor paints a real picture. We are headed for a  crash if we don't change course.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens), my good friend and Super Bowl champion.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments. The gentleman is right. It does appear to be purposeful.  The chaos, there is just too much of it, and that is what people back  home say. This has to be intentional.   There is no way that we could have these many dilemmas piled upon  each other this quickly unless there were some ulterior motive. It is a  rhetorical question, I suppose, for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for doing  all he does to save this country, and we have a lot of work still to  do.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser), who is my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that  really good explanation of what we are facing right now. People back  home are scratching their heads, how can it come to this? Well, you  see, it is the result of policies that are being implemented by this  administration.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen),  also my good friend.    Madam Speaker, it is nonsense indeed.   Madam Speaker, as they say, everything in Texas is bigger, including  the representatives.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), also my good  friend.    Madam Speaker, Mr. Pfluger said it so well.  We feel this acutely in energy States like Texas and my home State of  Louisiana, the Permian Basin and Haynesville Shale, but all across this  Nation. We benefit from domestic energy production. It is not only the  cleanest and the most efficient, it benefits us here at home. It is  that America first idea that this administration is abandoning too  quickly.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  those insights. It is so important that people recognize what is  happening here.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. He is  right. We better wake up.   Just by way of a quick reminder, over 1.2 million illegal immigrants  have been apprehended at the border since February alone. We know that  number is grossly undercounted because of all the got-aways and people  who came totally undetected across the totally open border.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, Mr. LaMalfa is exactly  right. It has been only 9 months. It is only going to get worse.   Madam Speaker, what you have heard tonight is a quick summary from a  number of our friends. We could go on for hours if we had the time, but  I know we are almost out of time.   We talked about the economic crisis, energy crisis, foreign policy  crisis, border crisis. It goes on and on and on. I will summarize and  close with this: We have two competing visions for America. It is now  very clear: It is free-market capitalism v. Big Government socialism.   I think the American people see the results of the latter. I hope we  have an opportunity very soon in the next election cycle to get back to  the former.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
