 Madam Speaker, I rise today on International Women's  Day to honor a woman who has been a pillar of strength in my community  during a particularly difficult time.   Last month, in Aurora, Illinois, we had five neighbors killed in a  terrible act of gun violence. If you watched the news following that  tragedy, you saw a woman, Chief of Police Kristen Ziman, exuding  strength, compassion, resolve, and leadership following an event we  never imagined would happen in our community.   Chief Ziman leads the second biggest police department in our State  of Illinois--no small feat considering that  [[Page H2591]]  there are only 219 female chiefs in the more than 14,000 police  departments nationwide.   Chief Ziman's compassionate leadership and barrier-breaking approach  to law enforcement inspires us all across the Fox Valley region. We  truly are Aurora strong.   Her strength and her service to our community makes us so proud, and  I look forward to watching all the little girls in our community grow  up knowing they can be anything they want to be, from a police chief to  a Congresswoman, because they grew up seeing it firsthand.    There are women like Chief Ziman lifting all of our communities all  over the 14th District and all over our country, and I am so glad to  celebrate them today.                            ____________________
