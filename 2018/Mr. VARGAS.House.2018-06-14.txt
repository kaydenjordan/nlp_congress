 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of a very  serious threat against a member of the Society of Jesus in Nicaragua by  reading in the Congressional Record a declaration from the Jesuits West  Province of the Society of Jesus.   It is a letter written by Father Scott Santarosa, father provincial  of the Society of Jesus for the West Province, and it reads like this:         ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called       children of God.''--Matthew 5:9.        As many of you know, Nicaragua is currently experiencing a       serious and increasing political crisis. The people who       demand democracy, freedom, and justice are firmly committed       to seeking a peaceful solution. There are already more than       153 Nicaraguans who have lost their lives in just over a       month of struggling toward such a resolution.        The Society of Jesus, present in Nicaragua since 1916, has       joined the people in this commitment. Our human, ethical, and       Christian conviction requires us to share support and defend       a peaceful solution to the conflict.        We still have time to avoid more polarization, more       bloodshed, and more pain. Honest dialogue and serious       negotiation are vital in order to achieve it, for whoever       wants peace does not assault, persecute, mistreat, or       intimidate.        We have been informed by a reliable source that the life of       Father Jose Alberto Idiaquez, S.J., rector of the Central       American University, the UCA of Nicaragua, is in serious       danger.        Father Idiaquez has been threatened for participating in       the National Dialogue convened by the Bishops' Conference,       for standing alongside the students, for defending the human       rights of those who are demanding respect for their       constitutional rights, for making continuous calls to the       Nicaraguan Government to give concrete signs that they too       seek justice and democracy, and for involving the university       in the efforts of the Nicaraguan people.        Father general of the Society of Jesus, Father Arturo Sosa,       S.J., resident in Rome, has been informed of this threat.       With his support and on behalf of all of the Jesuits and       committed lay collaborators in Jesuits West, we stand with       the Jesuits of Central America and all of the lay people that       make up the 40 Jesuit institutions that serve the people of       Central America.        We join Father Rolando Alvarado, S.J., provincial of       Central American Province, in holding the Nicaraguan       Government responsible for any aggression or attack that may       be suffered by Father Jose Alberto Idiaquez, S.J.        I call on the national and international human rights       organizations, the Organization of American States, the U.N.,       the European Parliament, and all Jesuit universities of the       world, the different churches, the U.S. Government, and all       of those committed to basic human dignity, to strongly       support the peaceful negotiations of a solution to the tragic       situation that the country is experiencing and demand respect       for the physical safety of all Nicaraguans who, like Father       Idiaquez, S.J., and the Bishop' Conference students, and       other members of the civil society who are participating in       the National Dialogue, are working for a lasting peace that       is borne from justice.    It is signed by Father Scott Santarosa, S.J. He is, again, the  provincial of the western province.   As many of you will recall, back in 1989, a very similar threat was  made against Father Ignacio Ellacuria of the UCA of El Salvador.  Unfortunately, that threat ended in the death of Father Ellacuria,  along with five other Jesuits at the UCA, the Central American  University, as well as two lay people.   I think this is a very serious threat that our country has to take a  look at and demand that steps be taken to protect the life of all  Nicaraguans, and particularly the students and the rector of the  Central American University, the Jesuit institution there.                            ____________________
