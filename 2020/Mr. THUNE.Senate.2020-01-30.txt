 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from South Dakota.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senators Moran, Daines, Ernst, Scott of Florida, and Crapo.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senator Thune and the other Senators  ask the counsel for the President:   [[Page S700]]              On March 6, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ``impeachment       is so divisive to the country that unless there's something       so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think       we should go down that path because it divides the country.''       Alexander Hamilton also warned in Federalist 65 against the       ``persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the       House of Representatives'' with respect to impeachment. In       evaluating the case against the President, should the Senate       take into account the partisan nature of the impeachment       proceedings in the House?    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of  the Senate.   Absolutely you should take that into account. That is dispositive.  That should end it. Based on the statements that we heard the last time  from our friends on the Democratic side, that is a reason why you  shouldn't have an impeachment. Speaker Pelosi was right when she said  that. Unfortunately, she didn't follow her own advice.   We have never been in a situation where we have the impeachment of a  President in an election year with the goal of removing the President  from the ballot. As I have said before, that is the most massive  election interference we have ever witnessed. It is domestic election  interference; it is political election interference; and it is wrong.   They don't talk about the horrible consequences to our country of  doing that, but they would be terrible. They would tear us apart for  generations, and the American people wouldn't accept it.   Let me address, in that context, the importance of the vote for their  inquiry, which also had bipartisan opposition. Now they said: Well, we  were fine when Speaker Pelosi announced it. We didn't need a vote. The  subpoenas were authorized.   Then why did they have a vote? They had a vote because they  understood they had a big problem that they needed to fix. But what is  more important about the vote than the procedural issue? The important  thing about the vote is that if you are going to start an impeachment  investigation, particularly in an election year, there needs to be  political accountability to the American people. You can't just go have  a press conference. If you are going to say that the votes of the  American people need to be disallowed and that all of the ballots need  to be torn up, then at the very least you need to be accountable to  your home district for that decision, and now they are--and now they  are.   If the American people decide--if they are allowed to vote--if the  American people decide that they don't like what has happened here;  that they don't like the constitutional violations that have happened;  that they don't like the attack on a successful President for purely  partisan political purposes, then they can do something about it, and  they can throw them out. That is why a vote is important.   We should never even consider removing the name of a President from a  ballot on a purely partisan basis in an election year. Important? I  will say it is important. For that reason alone and for the interest of  uniting our country, it must be rejected.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
