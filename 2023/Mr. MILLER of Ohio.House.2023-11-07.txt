 Mr. Speaker, I rise today at what I think is a  very serious moment for our country and for the world.   Hate and anti-Semitism are on the rise. Our strongest ally and great  friend, Israel, is under siege at the hands of brutal terrorists. As a  member of the United States Marines, I know when a Member of the House  of Representatives is echoing a line that is a clear call to murder  Jews and push Israel off the map--``from the river to the sea.''   To be clear, ``from the river to the sea,'' as someone who is Jewish,  means to exterminate my people. Never again.   Mr. Speaker, the ADL recently reported that anti-Semitic incidents  rose by roughly 400 percent in the 2 weeks following Hamas' evil attack  on Israel, which began 1 month ago today.   There is no question that these incidents are a direct result of the  hate-filled lies and anti-Semitic rhetoric perpetuated by Members of  this body--``from the river to the sea.''   What exactly does that mean, ``from the river to the sea Palestine  will be free.'' I am happy to educate all of you. It means the  extermination of the Jewish people.   I understand that my colleague, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib), thinks that this is some kind of aspirational message. It is a  joke.   Mr. Speaker, I do think that this is an aspirational message. But it  is not an aspiration of peaceful coexistence. It is an aspiration to  the erasure of the State of Israel and its people, the Jewish people  who call it home and who have been refugees since the very beginning of  time.                                time  1530    It is an aspiration to the genocide of Jews.   Mr. Speaker, I believe strongly that Members of this body should be  able to speak their minds freely, but I also think there should be  consequences for those who would use their platforms to perpetuate  garbage that puts any American at risk especially because of their  religion.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that actions have consequences, and I believe  that after a long string of anti-Semitic remarks and hate-filled  rhetoric, censure is an appropriate consequence for the gentlewoman  from Michigan.   Never again, damn it, means never again.
