 Madam President, the American Academy of  Pediatric Dentists, AAPD, last month named Dr. Heber Simmons, Jr., of  Jackson, MS, as its 2021 Pediatric Dentist of the Year. I commend him  for his decades of service and for the significant contributions he has  made to the dental profession. His lifetime commitment to the specialty  of pediatric dentistry has helped advance children's health in  Mississippi and around the country. Dr. Simmons' many years of clinical  practice, his dedication to improving academic dentistry, and his  passion for public policy make him a deserving recipient of the  Pediatric Dentist of the Year honor.   Dr. Simmons received his dental degree from the University of  Tennessee and completed his pediatric dentistry training there after  serving our Nation for 3 years in the U.S. Army Dental Corps. Following  his training and military service, Dr. Simmons practiced for 57 years  in Jackson before retiring recently from active practice. His passion  and dedication have made him a national leader in dentistry, proven by  his past presidencies of the AAPD, the American Academy of Dental  Practice Administration, the Pierre Fauchard Academy, and the  Mississippi Dental Association. Furthermore, he received the AAPD  Distinguished Service Award in 1994 and the Ann Page Griffin  Humanitarian Award in 2011. For many years, he served on the Board of  Trustees of the American Dental Association, ADA, serving as a  spokesperson for the ADA from 1981 to 2019. In this role, he was  featured on nationally televised programs such as ``60 Minutes'' and  ``Good Morning, America.''   Dr. Simmons currently serves as a special consultant to the AAPD  Board of Trustees after serving as the academy's congressional liaison  since 1997. As AAPD Congressional Liaison, he helped educate Members of  Congress and their staffs concerning oral health issues for children,  testified before Congress, and served in a key leadership role in AAPD  advocacy efforts. This includes helping to allocate more than $158  million for pediatric dentistry to the title VII program at the Health  Resources and Services Administration. For this work, Heber was awarded  an AAPD Presidential Citation in 2001, and more recently, his alma  mater, the College of Dentistry at the University of Tennessee Health  Science Center, recreated an endowed professorship in his name. Last  year, at the AAPD Pediatric Oral Health Advocacy Conference, Dr.  Simmons was the keynote speaker and received another Presidential  citation in recognition of and appreciation for his tireless and  dedicated national advocacy for his profession and the oral health of  America's children.   I commend Dr. Heber Simmons, Jr., for his many accomplishments and  well-deserved recognition of his advocacy, dedication, and leadership.  My State is fortunate to have him as a leader focused on the health and  wellness of all Mississippians. I congratulate him on being recognized  for his many years of service by being named the 2021 Pediatric Dentist  of the Year.                            ____________________
