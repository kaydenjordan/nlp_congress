 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for yielding,  and a special thank you to my colleague from New York, Lee Zeldin, for  his support of S.J. Res. 57.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 years since the Consumer Financial  Protection Board circumvented the formal rulemaking process by unfairly  denying consumers and small businesses the right to comment on guidance  that will directly affect them.   By executing this wrongful end run around the proper rulemaking  process, the CFPB created much uncertainty in the $1.1 trillion auto  lending market. In fact, in testimony before our committee, the former  Director, Mr. Richard Cordray, admitted to me in testimony that he had  to circumvent the rules to target auto lenders.   More than half of car buyers finance their purchases when acquiring  an automobile. These consumers have the ability to obtain great auto  rates through their dealer-assisted finance, otherwise known as  indirect lending.   I have personally met many highly credible auto dealers in my  district who are strongly committed to their communities and the  consumers who they serve. In fact, one auto dealer that I met with  specifically does not even take any form of picture ID when determining  lending just to avoid any kind of scrutiny that would actually suggest  that they were doing any kind of discrimination.   These auto dealers--and they are mostly small businesses--comply with  fair lending policies and practices while meeting the needs of their  consumers who desperately need to buy a car and often finance through  their auto dealer.   However, this flawed, unstudied guidance, through the statistics we  have heard from the other side, threatens to eliminate the flexibility  these small businesses, these small auto dealers need to  offer discounted interest rates to consumers who need to purchase a car  on credit with a very limited budget, especially in my community.    Last Congress, multiple bipartisan letters and bills called for the  CFPB to correct and reissue their guidance, which would bring clarity  to the market, and study the impact this digression would have on lower  income consumers. However, the CFPB refused to provide help on multiple  occasions.   It is indeed ironic that the very agency which is supposed to protect  consumers is, in fact, harming them with its flawed guidance rules.  Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Board to protect  consumers, not hurt them.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to emphasize that these small  businesses should be protected by the Consumer Financial Protection  Board, not targeted by them.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues and everyone join us in  supporting S.J. Res. 57 and finally rescind this flawed guidance by the  CFPB.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent from  the 22nd District of New York, Cooper Busch, better known as Super  Cooper.   Cooper Busch of Chenango Bridge, a spunky, fearless, and loving 4- year-old, an incredible fighter, born with Down syndrome, Cooper was  diagnosed in November of 2016 with acute myeloid leukemia.  [[Page H3826]]    On Sunday, May 6, sadly, sweet Cooper passed away. Cooper is survived  by his parents, Tara and Steve; his brother, Cole; and his sister,  Hope.   In Cooper's last month, he received a surprise total bedroom  makeover, he threw out the first pitch for the Rumble Ponies, and he  dropped the puck for the Binghamton Devils.   Volunteers organized fundraisers, sent in meals for the Busch family,  and sold Super Cooper t-shirts. A local artist even wrote and  illustrated a special book called, ``Super Cooper Saves the Day.''   Our condolences are with the entire Busch family during this very  difficult time. Cooper's enduring spirit and bravery are an inspiration  to all of us. Super Cooper's smile, lovable personality, and his zeal  to live each day to the fullest, no matter how challenging, no matter  how much time we may be allotted on this very dear Earth, will be his  eternal legacy to all of us.   May Super Cooper rest in peace.                            ____________________
