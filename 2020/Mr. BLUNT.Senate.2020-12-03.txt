 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Presiding Officer and I are here, and  we have been meeting today in Washington at, really, a groundbreaking  moment as we continue this battle for our health, for our economy, and  against the virus. What makes this such a critical moment are the  developments we have seen in the last 10 days regarding a vaccine.   Public health experts around the world have agreed, almost from day  one, that the way to really find the end of this pandemic--the ultimate  weapon--would be to develop a vaccine that worked. Less than a year  ago, which was in January and February of this year, we were hearing  that 2 years would set a record for developing a vaccine and that  sometimes a vaccine that has been developed on a new disease like this  has taken 3 and 5 and even 10 years or more. Yet here we are, less a  year from the discovery of COVID-19, with not just one vaccine but two  vaccines that have already applied for their use permits. Both vaccines  have shown an effectiveness of more than 90 percent, and a third  vaccine with a similar response is about to get to the place at which  it, too, can apply for use.   These are incredible numbers. It wasn't that many months ago that  healthcare experts were saying, if we get a vaccine that is effective  50 percent of the time or more, that the government should consider  accepting that vaccine and making it available to people, and here we  are with a 90 percent effective vaccine. I had the measles, and my kids  had the measles shot, which seemed to pretty much eliminate the  measles. It was 90 percent effective. This is the kind of vaccine that  has been the most effective among the most effective vaccines we have  ever had.   Pfizer and Moderna have both come forward and asked for their  emergency use authorizations. The emergency use doesn't really mean  they have cut any corners. The only thing we have failed to do is to  watch the 30,000 or so people for another 2 or 3 years who were in both  of these trials. That is why we can't say with certainty if this  vaccine will last for a lifetime or if this vaccine will be a 3-year  vaccine or even a 1-year vaccine. What we can say with certainty is  that, about 95 percent of the time, it will prevent you from getting  the disease. Of course, if people are prevented from getting the  disease, they can't spread the disease, and that is why a 90 percent  effective vaccine, like the measles vaccine, was basically 100 percent  effective as long as people took it.   So we need to step back, really, I think, and look at the  unconventional way we got here. How did we get from 3 to 5 to, maybe,  10 years to less than a year of discovering a virus for the very first  time to our having a vaccine?   The way that researchers have been able to move forward with this and  the way that Congress and the Trump administration have responded to  this pandemic has been extraordinary. In our country, Operation Warp  Speed has accelerated the development of this new vaccine through a  fast-track process that could be described, really, in one word-- unprecedented. Normally, vaccines take years. Researchers have to go  out and secure funding, get approvals, and study results step by step  to get to where we are today. Only then would a vaccine be determined  to be safe and effective, and only then would manufacturing begin.   Normally, with a vaccine, the day the vaccine is approved is the day  you start manufacturing. We know that this is not what is happening  here. In fact, in just a few minutes, I am going to mention that the  head of distribution is saying, on the day the vaccine is approved, we  will start shipping millions of copies of that vaccine all over the  country.   This all really started with Congress's deciding, as we put these  COVID relief packages together from the very first couple of packages,  that when it came to a cure, we were not going to let funding stand in  the way nor were we going to let it stand in the way of investing some  money somewhere that just simply didn't work because, by investing  money where it didn't work, it allowed us to invest money where it did  work. Congress appropriated $18 billion for vaccines and testing. About  $12.5 billion has gone into the vaccine side. Most of the rest has gone  into testing, with some going into therapy. This is a decision Congress  made. With this vaccine, we are going to become partners in developing  how we fight back.  [[Page S7207]]    There was a risk that some of the vaccine candidates we supported  wouldn't make it, but there was never a risk that the vaccine  candidates that did make it wouldn't be as safe as any vaccine has ever  been. In fact, many of these vaccines have had more people involved in  the studies than ever before. Because of the virulence of the virus,  the people in the studies, frankly, were more likely than not to be  exposed to COVID, and a bunch of them were more likely than not to  catch it. Of course, that is the moment when you decide if the group  that caught the virus was the group that had the virus--the group that  had the vaccine in these studies--or if it were the group that didn't  have the vaccine. What we found out was, 95 percent of the time, it was  the group that didn't have the vaccine, which is where you get that 95  percent number.   Congress provided that we would take some risk. We so often hear that  failure is not an option. In this case, if you didn't fail, you were  not trying hard enough. If all you wind up with are things that have  gotten approved, then you probably have left some things on the table  that you should have tried.   The Presiding Officer is a great businessman, and he knows, if you  are in a business that is growing, you are going to have some failures.  If you have never had failures in your business, you have not tried  anything new, which means you probably haven't grown. So we would have  failures not in a vaccine that we would give to people but by thinking:  This would appear like it would have a good chance of being approved,  so let's put it in the group of vaccines that we are working on.   President Trump and Operation Warp Speed stepped up and decided they  were going to move at a faster pace than ever before but with more  safety than we have had in most vaccine developments in the history of  the country. So we decided to support several vaccines that, again, we  thought had a better chance of being approved than not. Now, you take  some risk in that because all of the vaccines won't be approved, but  you take no risk if you are going to support a vaccine that is approved  but that is not safe. Yet that is not what happened at all. You just  put a lot of racehorses in the race.   The dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor  University says, if you are racing to get a vaccine quickly, one way to  do it is to put as many horses in the race as you can, and that is  exactly what we have done. We have invested in several potential  vaccines and, I think, three different paths to a vaccine, which means  that all of the vaccines that are approved will not be exactly the same  in how you have to store them, in how you have to transport them, and  whether you have to have one shot or two to have the full vaccine.   And we have signed contracts with six leading candidates already. We  have invested $2.5 billion to help develop and purchase 100 million  doses of the vaccine being developed by Moderna. That was jointly  developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  and the company.   We have dedicated $2 billion in a different pattern to purchase 100  million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and we have done that with that  investment in a way that allows us to shorten the processing time,  combining various study phases and clinical trials going on at the same  time and moving forward in a way that also allowed us to be  manufacturing vaccines while we were still studying and moving toward  final approval by the FDA.   So we have two vaccines standing and ready now for final approval,  another one to join them soon, and another one to join them quickly  after that. But all of them are already in the stage of manufacturing.   So what is the worst thing that could have happened to taxpayers? We  invest in a vaccine that turns out not to work, and, at that point we  step in, meet our commitment--in essence, buy the vaccine that didn't  work--be sure that it is effectively destroyed, and realize that that  was a chance that we took that didn't produce a result. But the other  vaccines that did work had a result and had vaccine available as soon  as they were approved.   In fact, General Perna, Operation Warp Speed's chief operating  officer, said the government would begin vaccinations within 24 hours  after a vaccine secures FDA approval. In the past, I would say you  would be closer to saying it will be 12 or 24 months after approval  before the first vaccine is ready to go to the first person, but now we  are saying 24 hours, and we are on the edge of that 24 hours.   I talked today with the Governor of my State, the Governor of  Missouri, Mike Parson, and the head of the Missouri Department of  Health and Senior Services, Dr. Randall Williams, about what they were  doing. They submitted a plan early. I was with the Governor--I think it  was in mid-August--when the Centers for Disease Control told all the  Governors: We want to have a plan by the end of October of how you are  going to distribute this vaccine when you get it.   I said at about that same time that if we failed in our effort to get  the vaccine effectively distributed after the effort we made to get it,  it would be one of the great government failures of all time.   But Governor Parson, Dr. Williams, and others who have worked hard on  this in our State put a plan in and put it in pretty early and now are  ready to execute that plan as soon as they have the vaccine available  to them.   About 2 percent of the population of the country lives in Missouri,  and so about 2 percent of every distribution will go to Missouri as  vaccines are ready.   Pfizer will have about 25 million vaccines to distribute almost  immediately. Moderna will have about 20 million to distribute almost  immediately. And we know that others are standing right behind them.   Another thing that Congress asked the Centers for Disease Control to  do was to come up with a recommendation on who the vaccine should be  given to. And just this week the CDC advisory committee made their  recommendation to the Centers for Disease Control. Either today or  sometime soon after today, the CDC, in all likelihood, will adopt those  recommendations as they have in this past.   The recommendations go something like this: First, you want to  prioritize healthcare workers and people most likely to have the worst  result if they catch the virus. So if you take all the healthcare  workers in America and all the people in a senior living kind of  condition in America, you are talking about around 15 percent of the  population.   Somewhere in there, either in that group or the next group, you  include all the first responders and police officers in the country,  who come into situations so often that they have no control over, and  then you go to the other essential employees in America--the childcare  center worker, the schoolteacher, the busdriver, the grocery store  clerk, the food processing person who is out there making this happen.   I think there has been some decision made on the healthcare workers  that we should include clergy in the healthcare workers because they  are so often present in hospitals and with people in circumstances  where they would like to see someone from their faith present, but that  person also is a healthcare provider in the healthcare network and,  just like others working in the hospital, will be able to get that  early vaccination.   But let's go back to the essential workforce. The essential workforce  of the groups we have talked about and others who come into lots of  contact with people are often least able to make arrangements in their  own time to even get a vaccine if it is for free. They are going to be  a bi priority.    When I go to the grocery store and I ask someone for help, which I  often need to do to find the one thing on my list I don't know how to  find, or when I go by to check out with the grocery store clerk, if the  grocery store clerk, no matter how big the shield is between them and  me, if they couldn't possibly get it from the person who checked out 2  days earlier or early that day, they can't possibly give it to me.   So every step of the way, the whole country becomes safer until,  hopefully, by the end of April or so, we are at a place where everybody  has access to the vaccine.   By the way, by the time you do the 15 percent of the population that  is most likely to have a bad result if they get the virus and  healthcare workers and  [[Page S7208]]  add that to the 35 percent of the population that is the essential  workforce, that is 50 percent of the population that could have the  vaccine if they chose to have it.   I think most people think that we are there, in our State and other  places, by sometime in April. In fact, Dr. Fauci said that Americans  determined to be at the highest risk--healthcare workers, frontline  workers, seniors, those with underlying conditions--could be vaccinated  by the end of the year.   Certainly, if there is a second shot, it might be by the end of  January, and you have 15 percent of the whole population vaccinated by  the end of January or sometime in January, and another 35 percent would  have the vaccine available to them by sometime in April.   Then we look at the rest of the population. But in each step of the  way--let me say again--every time you take somebody off the playing  field of where contact with the virus could successfully occur,  everybody else gets safer too.   If a person who has been vaccinated is where the germs happen to land  instead of the person standing beside them who wasn't vaccinated, the  life of that particular germ is gone, and eventually that is how you  emerge from a pandemic. There just aren't enough people left for this  to land on that either haven't had it or haven't had the vaccine to  prevent it.   It is a critical time. It is an important time. I think we have  written two new chapters in pandemic response, both in testing and in  vaccines.   Operation Warp Speed has done in months what typically can take 10 to  15 years and, even in an expedited way, can take 2 to 3 to 5 years.   Given the urgent need to beat this virus, I think Operation Warp  Speed, with the great scientific community--a lot of this is built on  research that was funded by NIH. One of the priorities of the Congress  for the last 5 years has been to increase NIH funding, at a time when  we know more about genetics.   Two of these vaccines are basically based on the molecular code that  is sort of the software for genetics. It is a different way than  vaccines have been developed before and would not have been developed  without government-encouraged research.   Having a diverse selection of vaccines means there are different  people producing vaccines at the same time in different places, and we  will have, more likely, a quick and fair distribution of any FDA- authorized vaccines.   Certainly, I have been frustrated, as many of us have, to think that  we have not been able to reach an agreement on what money we might need  to finish this vaccine effort, the distribution effort.   Hopefully, we can come to the next round of COVID relief sooner  rather than later.   As I said earlier this week, a targeted funding package now will have  a lot more impact than a much bigger package would have 4 or 5 months  from now. There is no reason we shouldn't be able to find common  ground. This is a time when we can make that effort to finish the job.  The pandemic is affecting Americans every day. I have talked to a lot  of people who have seen greater numbers of drug dependency and huge  declines in mental health because that support network is gone and  isolation has taken over, and worry about family, finances, and health  has become a big part of that.   Let's show the people we work for that we are going to be able to  continue this job, and let's praise the great researchers in our  country and others who stepped forward in incredible ways to do things  that just 9 months ago nobody thought could possibly be established in  the timeframe we are working on right now.
