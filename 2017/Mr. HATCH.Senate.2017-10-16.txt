 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator  from Florida be granted the floor as soon as I finish.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, over the weekend, the Washington Post ran  an article about a piece of legislation I helped negotiate last  Congress. It was entitled the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective  Drug Enforcement Act'' and was intended to encourage greater  collaboration between DEA and the regulated community in the fight  against opioid abuse. The Post article was sharply critical of this  legislation, suggesting that it effectively gutted DEA's ability to do  its job. It also suggested the pharmaceutical industry put one over on  Congress. I rise to set the record straight on these allegations and to  provide a fuller account of how this legislation passed the Senate and  became law.   First, some background. The Controlled Substances Act requires drug  distributors to obtain a ``registration'' from DEA in order to  distribute controlled substances, including prescription drugs. The act  further authorizes DEA to suspend a distributor's registration in  certain circumstances, such as where a distributor has been convicted  of a crime involving controlled substances or had a State license  suspended. Before suspending a registration, DEA must issue a show  cause order directing the distributor to explain why its registration  should not be suspended. A court then decides whether DEA has met its  burden to suspend the registration.   The Controlled Substances Act empowers DEA to bypass this standard  suspension process in cases where DEA determines there is ``an imminent  danger to the public health or safety.'' In such cases, DEA can issue  an immediate suspension order that immediately and without court  process terminates the distributor's ability to distribute prescription  drugs. Prior to last Congress, the Controlled Substances Act did not  define what constitutes an imminent danger to the public health or  safety. This left DEA's ability to immediately suspend a party's  ability to distribute prescription drugs essentially unfettered. Such  unfettered discretion concerned the patient advocacy and drug  manufacturing community because an immediate suspension order cuts off  all drugs from a distributor, including those intended for legitimate  users. A balance is needed to ensure that individuals who need  prescription drugs for treatment receive them but that such drugs are  not diverted for improper purposes.   So the bill I helped negotiate last Congress, for the first time,  defined what constitutes an imminent danger to the public health or  safety. In doing so, it created a standard for when DEA may suspend a  party's registration to distribute prescription drugs without any prior  court process, and that standard is that there must be a ``substantial  likelihood of an immediate threat'' that death, serious bodily harm, or  abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the absence of an  immediate suspension.   In both committee and floor statements, I made clear that this  standard is intended to cover situations where evidence of diversion  indicates there is a substantial likelihood that abuse of a controlled  substance or of any controlled substances will occur.   The Washington Post article glosses over much of this background. It  does not explain that the immediate suspension order is intended to be  an extraordinary measure. It does not explain that prior to the bill,  DEA had basically carte blanche authority to impose this measure. It  does not explain the DEA has other enforcement tools available,  including show cause orders which are supposed to be the agency's  standard operating procedure. Equally problematic, the article barely  even mentions the patient advocacy concerns that motivated the bill to  begin with.   I want to quote from a letter that a coalition of patient and health  advocacy groups sent to Congress in support of the legislation:         Federal agencies, law enforcement, pharmaceutical industry       participants and prescribers each play a role in working       diligently to prevent drug abuse and diversion. However, it       is also imperative that legitimate patients are able to       obtain their prescriptions without disruption. Your       legislation addresses both goals by fostering greater       collaboration, communication and transparency between       industry stakeholders and regulators, leading to more       effective efforts to combat abuse while protecting patients.    The letter was signed by, among others, the American Academy of Pain  Management, the Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Support Network, and the  Drug Free America Foundation.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 4, 2015.      Hon. Orrin Hatch,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Hatch and Whitehouse: On behalf of the       patient and health professional groups listed below we would       like to express our support for the Ensuring Patient Access       and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015 (S. 483). We       appreciate your leadership and commitment to combating the       inappropriate use of prescription medicines. Your legislation       will help improve the balance between effective enforcement       against prescription drug diversion and abuse, while ensuring       patients who are appropriately prescribed medications       continue to have access to their treatments.        As patient advocacy and health professional organizations,       we are committed to combating illegal use of prescription       drugs. Millions of Americans depend on prescription drugs to       treat and cure illness, alleviate pain, and improve quality       of life, yet prescription drug abuse remains a persistent       problem that requires collaboration from all those with a       stake in improving patient care and protecting against abuse.       In considering the burden on patients, it is important to       remember that the vast majority of patients who use       prescription drugs do so legitimately to address a variety of       health issues. Efforts to prevent drug abuse should also       consider legitimate users so that actions do not impede       patient access or lessen the effectiveness of patient care.        Federal agencies, law enforcement, pharmaceutical industry       participants and prescribers each play a role in working       diligently to prevent drug abuse and diversion. However, it       is also imperative that legitimate patients are able to       obtain their prescriptions without disruption. Your       legislation addresses both goals by fostering greater       collaboration, communication and transparency between       industry stakeholders and regulators, leading to more       effective efforts to combat abuse while protecting patients.       We commend you for including a report to congress, which will       illuminate the issue and ultimately benefit patient care.       Including patient advocacy groups in the process will ensure       those involved in patient care will be able to identify       challenges and will emphasize appropriate and workable policy       approaches to preventing diversion and abuse of controlled       substances.        We commend you for your leadership on this important issue.            Sincerely,        Alliance for Patient Access; American Academy of Pain       Management; American Pharmacists Association; American       Society of Consultant Pharmacists; American Society for Pain       Management Nursing; Center for Lawful Access and Abuse       Deterrence; Drug Free America Foundation, Inc.; Fibro       Warriors Living Life; Fibro Friends of Tennessee;       Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Support Network; Fibromyalgia-ME/      CFS Support Center, Inc; Florida Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain       Network.

Madam President, the Washington Post article discusses  virtually none of this. Rather, it baldly asserts that Congress cut out  DEA's legs from underneath it through a sinister conspiracy of deep- pocketed drug companies and their cunning allies in Congress. Nothing  could be further from the truth.  [[Page S6388]]    To begin with, I have spent 40 years of my life in the Senate  fighting the scourge of drug abuse. I stood side by side with Ronald  Reagan in the War on Drugs. In 2000, I coauthored the Drug Addiction  Treatment Act, or DATA 2000, one of the first efforts in Congress to  address the opioid epidemic. Last year, I led conference negotiations  on the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, a landmark piece of  legislation that is making a real difference in the fight against  opioid and heroin abuse. Currently, I am working on legislation to  address opioid addiction in the veteran community. I am no patsy when  it comes to drug abuse--prescription or otherwise--and neither are my  colleagues.   Indeed, forget me for a moment. Let's take Senator Whitehouse, who  helped me negotiate the bill with DEA and DOJ. Are we to believe that  Senator Whitehouse, a former Rhode Island attorney general and a former  U.S. attorney, a crusader against corporate interests, is somehow in  the pocket of the drug companies? Of course not. The charge is  laughable on its face.   How about the fact that this bill passed both Houses of Congress by  unanimous consent? Did the entire U.S. Congress decide to shield its  eyes to the true sinister intent of this legislation? Did the Senate  Judiciary Committee, which approved the bill by voice vote, decide to  look the other way? This is a committee that includes former  prosecutors, state attorneys general, and U.S. attorneys who, at the  time, included both the current Attorney General of the United States  and the current Senate minority leader.   Are we seriously to believe that Jeff Sessions, the toughest foe of  illegal drugs I have ever known in my entire life, sat on his hands  while Congress eviscerated the DEA's enforcement authority? No, of  course not.   To merely state these allegations is to make clear how utterly  ridiculous they really are. Not one Senator or Member of the House  opposed this bill. Do you know why? Because DEA, the very agency the  bill impacts, the very agency that supposedly can no longer do its job  because of this legislation, agreed to let it go forward.   Let me be clear. The DEA could have stopped this bill. They could  have stopped it at any time. In fact, they did stop a previous version  in 2014 that had different language. I spent months negotiating with  DEA and with DOJ until they were at a point they were comfortable  allowing the bill to proceed. If they had asked me to hold the bill or  to continue negotiations, I would have done so.   I brought the bill to markup only after DEA and DOJ agreed with me on  a path forward. Anyone who claims that I or anyone else steamrolled DEA  and DOJ on this bill is either ignorant or woefully misinformed.   That brings me to another point that was largely lost in all the  insinuations in the Washington Post article. The language that  purportedly eviscerated DEA's enforcement power--that is, the  requirement that the DEA show a substantial likelihood of immediate  threat before issuing an immediate suspension order--was written by DEA  and DOJ lawyers and provided to Hill staff as a proposed compromise.   So let's get this straight. Congress took language that DEA and DOJ  wrote, inserted it into the bill, and now Congress is the bad guy? I  should note that other aspects of DEA and DOJ's proposed language  changed, but that key phrase ``substantial likelihood of an immediate  threat''--the phrase that critics now point to as gutting DEA's  enforcement authority--came from DEA and DOJ. And lest we forget,  President Obama signed the bill into law on the advice of his own DEA  Administrator.    I think we need to be candid about what is going on here. Opponents  of the current administration are trying to derail the President's  nominee to be head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,  Representative Tom Marino, by mischaracterizing and trying to rewrite  the history of a bill that he championed. They are being aided in their  efforts by a group of former DEA employees who took an extremely hard  line against drug companies when they were at the Agency and who are  upset that the DEA chose to pursue a more collaborative approach after  they left. I don't fault these individuals for their passion, but I do  reject the notion that there was some sort of sinister conspiracy at  play. And I find it unconscionable that critics of the bill and of  Representative Marino would flat-out ignore the very real patient  concerns that motivated this bill and motivated my personal involvement  with it. You think this bill was a sop to the drug industry? Tell that  to the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Network. Tell that to the American  Academy of Pain Management. Tell that to the Drug Free America  Foundation.   If we are going to make this bill a political football and try to use  it to sink Representative Marino's nomination, let's tell the full  story. Let's be fair. Let's at least be honest. Let's not gin up a one- sided narrative based entirely on the statements of former Agency  officials who disagreed with the change of leadership.   No matter how you try to spin it, this is not the latest episode of  ``House of Cards.'' Rather, let's be clear that Members of this body  negotiated this bill in good faith with the DEA and the Department of  Justice. Let's be clear--the DEA and DOJ themselves generated the  language that critics now claim is so problematic. Let's remember that  this bill passed by unanimous consent and that every single Member of  this body and the House of Representatives agreed to it. Let's  remember, too, that the DEA and DOJ could have stopped this bill at any  time if they had wanted to but instead chose to allow it to proceed.  After all, they stopped an earlier version in 2014 that had different  language. They could have stopped it again. And even after the bill  passed Congress, they could have advised President Obama not to sign  on. Don't forget that the bill bears his signature. Let's not pretend  that DEA, both Houses of Congress, and the Obama White House all  somehow wilted under Representative Marino's nefarious influences.   Provocative headlines and clever framing may drive page hits, but  this body's decisions should be based on the full story. It should be  based on all the facts. A single news article that tells only one side  of the story should not derail a nominee who has a long history of  fighting illegal drug use and of helping individuals with chronic  conditions obtain treatment. Let's not ignore the full story here in  the rush toward easy politics.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
