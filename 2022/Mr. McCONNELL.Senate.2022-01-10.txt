 Madam President, this week on this floor, we are  poised to witness something that has never happened before in living  memory: an attempt to attack the core identity of the Senate by a  sitting majority leader.   The senior Senator from New York once said nuking the filibuster  would ``turn what the Founding Fathers called the cooling saucer of  democracy into the rubber stamp of dictatorship.'' He said it would  ``make the country into a banana republic . . . a doomsday for  democracy,'' he said. Now, he wants to trigger that doomsday himself.   When I was majority leader, some of my own party urged me to break  the Senate for our own party's short-term gain. My answer was a simple  word: ``no.''   Less than 4 years ago, the senior Senator from Illinois said nuking  the legislative filibuster ``would be the end of the Senate as it was  originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers.''  Now, he wants the Senate to end on his watch.   The last time Senate Democrats were in the minority, 32 of them  signed a letter demanding the legislative filibuster stay in place.  Now, many of them say they want to break this institution. The excuses  put forward for this behavior are entirely fake. The supposed  justifications are simply false. The Senate Democratic leaders are  trying to use a big lie to bully and berate their own Members into  breaking their word, breaking the rules, and breaking the Senate.   We are going to spend all week sounding the alarm on the radical  takeovers that some Democrats want to pull off. They want to silence  millions of Americans and take over the Senate so they can take over  elections so they can take over America.   Leading Democrats say they want to break the Senate because of the  sinister anti-voting plot that is sweeping America. Of course, this is  totally fake. It does not exist. The current control of Congress and  the White House were decided in 2020 by the highest turnout in 120  years. Ninety-four percent of voters said voting was easy. More  Americans say current voting laws are too lax than say they are too  restrictive.    Confronted by the facts, the Democratic leader says they are, of  course, irrelevant. He says the entire nuclear push is occasioned by  what a few States did in 2021. This is utter nonsense. The Senator from  New York has been publicly laying groundwork to nuke the Senate rules  since back in 2019, before the 2020 election. More than a year before  the 2020 election, the Democratic leader was openly flirting with  nuking the Senate rules if he got the power so he would be able to ram  through bigger changes. Now, none of this was occasioned by what State  legislatures did in 2021. This is actually a yearslong quest for power  in search of a pretext.   Their hysterical attack on State laws are fake as well. The State of  Georgia passed a voting law providing for more in-person early voting  than New York provides. It allows for no-excuse absentee voting, which  New York prohibits. If there was not a voting crisis in Democrat-run  New York 6 months ago, there is no crisis in Georgia now. If Georgia is  a banana republic today, then New York has been and still is a banana  republic. There is zero logic here, zero consistency.   In the State of Texas, Democrats are hysterical because the State  rolled back some unusual COVID-specific exceptions to their prior  procedures, such as universal drive-through voting and 24-hour voting.  So if the bar for voting rights now requires the possibility of voting  in person at 3 a.m., how many blue States in America meet that bar?  Neither of these things existed in Texas before 2020, and neither  widely exists in blue States.   Every hysterical claim that our democracy is in crisis rings hollow.  More Americans today say that President Biden's election was  legitimate--now listen to this--than said the same thing about the  prior President in late 2017. More Americans today say that President  Biden's election was legitimate than said the same about the prior  President in late 2017. Yet Democrats are trying to use their fake  hysteria to justify breaking Senate rules so they can seize control of  elections in all 50 States. That is what they are up to.   Historically, the Senate has taken up elections legislation on a  careful, bipartisan basis. We have made sure not to trample on the  rights of voters and the proper roles of local officials.   In 2002, we passed the Help America Vote Act by a vote of 92 to 2--92  to 2. Chris Dodd and I authored that bill. Interestingly enough, the  only dissenting votes came from then-Senator Hillary Clinton and the  current Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. Ninety-two to two.   Well, that is how you pass election reform if there are actual issues  that need tackling. You do it carefully; you do it thoughtfully;  bipartisan committee work; regular order. Our colleagues aren't doing  anything like that. They are trying to ram through a sweeping, partisan  legislation that they first drafted and introduced in its first  iteration back in 2019.   Democrats say they are concerned about efforts to disempower the  appropriate local elections officials. Well, it is actually their bills  that would disempower local officials, by Washington Democrats  appointing themselves the entire country's board of elections on  steroids.   Democrats say they are concerned about overturning election results.  Well, it is their bills that would overturn election results,  overruling the commonsense voting laws that citizens across the country  pick for their own States.   A case in point: The Democrats' latest bill would force the entire  country to adopt two practices--same-day registration and no-excuse  absentee voting--that the citizens of New York State had as ballot  measures last November. Deep-blue New York rejected them both. So you  have to ask yourself, why are Washington Democrats refusing to accept  the decision of New York voters? Why are they trying to set aside these  election results and overturn the people's will?   Our Democratic colleagues also talked about a so-called voting rights  bill. This is a bill to turn the partisan Attorney General into a  national elections czar. The Attorney General would no longer have to  sue States to win in court; he could end up doing an end run around the  legal system and push States around without having to persuade a judge  first. I am sure our Democratic colleagues would have reacted well if  Republicans had tried to break Senate rules so that Bill Barr could  micromanage elections in blue States. I am sure that would have gone  swimmingly on their side of the aisle.   But, ultimately, the issues at stake this week run even deeper than  this fake hysteria, even deeper than voting laws. Breaking the Senate  itself and nuking the filibuster would cause a massive political power  outage for many millions of American citizens, for entire States.   So the filibuster is not just about what bills are blocked; it is  also the sole feature that gives millions of Americans any voice at all  in the legislation that does pass whenever there is one-party control.  Annual appropriations, government funding bills, the NDAA, rescue  packages like the CARES Act--all of them could be done on a one-party  basis, thereby eliminating the influence of every State in America  represented by a Member of the minority.   For decades, both Senators and citizens have been able to take for  granted that everybody gets a voice, even when they don't have divided  government. If this unique feature of the Senate is blown up, millions  and millions of Americans' voices will cease to be heard in this  Chamber--a radical Senate takeover, for a radical elections takeover,  for a radical takeover of our Nation's future.    What the Democratic leader wants to do would not protect our  democracy or our system of government. It would destroy a key feature  of American Government forever, and the Senators on both sides know it.    Madam President, when Jack Brammer interviewed me in  1984 for one of the first profile pieces of my political career, I  quickly saw the high quality of his reporting. He was even-handed,  fair, and honest--and has remained so throughout his 43 year career as  the Lexington Herald-Leader's statehouse reporter. Jack has always been  among the best journalists in the Commonwealth. Today, in honor of his  retirement, I recognize him for standing at the pinnacle of Kentucky  journalism for over four decades.   Jack Brammer is a lifelong Kentuckian. A native of Maysville, he  joined the Lexington Herald-Leader in 1978 and has covered State  politics ever since. We met in 1984 during my initial race for the U.S.  Senate. Though many considered me an underdog, facing off against an  entrenched incumbent, Jack took extensive time to interview me for his  Herald-Leader profile. He even visited my parents in Shelbyville,  sitting with them for hours to discuss my background and upbringing.   In today's era of journalism, when so much reporting takes place via  text, tweet, and email, Jack's methods might seem startlingly old- fashioned. But he kept up his same dogged style, always going above and  beyond to deliver the complete, unabridged truth to Kentuckians. He is  a journalist in the best mold of the profession: unafraid to report the  facts, presented without editorializing, and allowing his readers to  come to their own conclusions. I will miss Jack's steadfast commitment  to the truth, which can often seem sorely lacking in today's fast- paced, cutthroat media industry.   In his 43 years on the statehouse beat, Jack covered nearly every  major  [[Page S114]]  moment in Kentucky politics. Like me, he has a deep passion for our  Commonwealth's history and has made critical contributions to the  historical record through his reporting. He had a front-row seat to 10  gubernatorial administrations, dozens of legislative sessions, and  countless significant political events. His deep, hard-won  understanding of Kentucky politics sets him apart from nearly every  other journalist in our State. I know everyone in the statehouse, from  other journalists to legislators, to the general public, will miss him.   During Jack's retirement, I feel confident he will continue to share  the wealth of wisdom he acquired over his legendary career. Jack has  always been an enthusiastic mentor for younger journalists, taking  generations of reporters under his wing to teach them the ropes of  Kentucky State politics. As a graduate of the University of Kentucky  and a member of their Journalism Hall of Fame, he has also spent time  imparting his knowledge to the Commonwealth's future communications  professionals. Even in retirement, he will continue to make a mark on  our State.   I will miss Jack's reporting dearly. He represents the best of the  journalistic profession, and Kentuckians have been fortunate to read  his writing for more than four decades. I wish him well in his upcoming  endeavors and look forward to learning what his future holds. I would  like to express my personal gratitude for Jack Brammer's many years of  service to the Commonwealth and encourage my Senate colleagues to join  me in congratulating him on his well-earned retirement.   Madam President, Jack Brammer recently wrote an article in the  Lexington Herald-Leader reflecting on his career. I ask unanimous  consent the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Jan. 2, 2022]     `They Say He Loved That Place.' Memories of Working 43+ Years in                             Kentucky's Capitol         My mamaw, Bessie Price, often told me as a kid growing up       in Mason County about once visiting a relative who had worked       in the Kentucky Capitol.        Mamaw, a tenant farmer's wife who was rarely seen without       an apron tied around her except when she was in church,       didn't travel far from home in her life but the journey to       the Capitol made a lasting impression on her.        ``Oh, my, it's a grand building,'' she would say with a       sparkle in her eyes. ``I'm not sure if he was a janitor or a       repair man. I once visited him there and I thought how       marvelous it would be to work there. How blessed that would       be.''        How marvelous has it been for me to work more than 43 years       in Kentucky's Capitol as a newspaperman for the Lexington       Herald-Leader.        I have enough memories of the place to last--and comfort--      me the rest of my days.                          SPECTACLES IN THE CAPITOL         The Capitol often is the scene of news spectacles with       hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people. Remember all the       teachers at the Capitol in 2018 and 2019 to advocate for       education funding and protest teacher pensions?        The most spectacular events at the Capitol are the       inaugurations of governors. I have covered 10 Kentucky       governors--from Julian Carroll to Andy Beshear.        Inauguration Day is filled with pomp and pageantry. The       morning parades with high school bands marching down Capital       Avenue. The dignified swearing-in ceremonies in the       afternoon, and the elegant inaugural balls in the evening.        When you see the new governor and first lady (or first       husband, as was the case with Dr. Bill Collins when his wife,       Martha Layne Collins, became Kentucky's first and only female       governor in 1983) swirl in an embrace about the Rotunda floor       to the melodies of a fine orchestra on inauguration night,       it's like seeing a fairy tale come alive.        Each Inauguration Day has its own personality.        Certainly no inauguration was like that of Gov. John Y.       Brown Jr. in 1979. Brown and his famous wife, Phyllis George,       invited a host of celebrities to their celebration. Who could       ever forget the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders in their certainly       warm-weather outfits in the middle of December in Kentucky?                     FAMOUS PERSONALITIES IN THE CAPITOL         Famous people sometimes visit the Capitol as guests of       governors or the legislature.        Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali came calling. He once       held court over a group of reporters outside the governor's       office. Soon the conversation turned to former Gov. A.B.       ``Happy'' Chandler, who, in a meeting of the University of       Kentucky's board of trustees on April 5, 1988 to discuss UK's       decision to dispose of its investments in South Africa, said,       ``You know Zimbabwe's all n----now. There aren't any       whites.''        Chandler's remark created a national firestorm. Ali       questioned the reporters in the Capitol on whether any of       them had ever uttered--or even thought--that controversial       word.        Other special guests at the Capitol over the years included       singer Billy Ray Cyrus leading the Kentucky House in a       rousing rendition of ``Achy Breaky Heart,'' Sally Ride as the       first American woman in space, songwriter Tom T. Hall       entertaining a group of lawmakers in the Speaker's office       with ``(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine,'' Andy       Williams launching into ``Moon River,'' and actress Jennifer       Garner speaking on the Senate floor about a charity for       children.        And then there was Victoria Principal, an actress on the TV       series ``Dallas'' that captivated audiences in 1986 when she       saw in a scene dubbed ``In Her Dreams'' her supposedly dead       husband in a shower.        During a news conference at the Capitol, Principal was       asked by a Kentucky reporter if she were going to continue       acting.        ``In your dreams,'' she purred as the reporter (with the       initials JB) turned as red as a Kentucky cardinal.        Once, an animal was a guest at the Capitol who became semi-      famous. The Newport Aquarium brought to the Senate in October       2013 a penguin that got excited and used the bathroom on the       floor next to the desk of then-Senate President David       Williams.        My first paragraph of the story summed it up: ``A penguin       pooped Tuesday on the Senate floor near the desk of Senate       President David Williams.''                       POWERFUL SPEECHES IN THE CAPITOL         Speeches are plentiful in the Capitol--from State of the       Commonwealth addresses by governors to pleas from lawmakers       seeking support for their legislation.        Two powerful speeches over the years come to mind. Both       were in the legislature. Both changed votes.        Bobby Richardson, a Glasgow attorney, was House majority       leader from 1976 to 1982 and House Speaker from 1982 to 1985.        One of his finest moments came when he gave a floor speech       on a bill to prohibit in vitro fertilization in Kentucky. It       is a complex series of procedures used to help with fertility       and the influential Kentucky Right to Life opposed it because       of the possibility that some fertilized eggs might be       destroyed.        Richardson took the lead on opposing the bill. He gave a       powerful speech, saying the technology was a wonderful way       for a childless couple to become parents. He was successful.        In the late 1980s, many legislators thought AIDS was an       affliction of homosexuals.        Belinda Mason changed minds about the disease when she       informed House members that she had contracted it from a       January 1987 blood transfusion during the birth of her second       child.        The daughter of Democratic state Rep. Paul Mason of       Whitesburg, who was a strong advocate for the poor, died in       1991 from AIDS.                           SAD TIMES IN THE CAPITOL         The most solemn events in the Capitol have been the lying       in state of famous Kentuckians in the Rotunda.        In my time, they have included Col. Harland Sanders in       1980, Gov. A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler in 1991, Gov. Bert T.       Combs in 1991, Gov. Lawrence W. Wetherby in 1994, Legislative       Research Commission executive director Vic Hellard in 1996,       Chief Justice Robert Stephens in 2002, Gov. Edward T. ``Ned''       Breathitt in 2003, Gov. Louie B. Nunn in 2004, Supreme Court       Justice William McAnulty Jr. in 2008, Gov. and U.S. Sen.       Wendell Ford in 2015 and state Sen. Georgia Davis Powers in       2016.        One of the saddest was in 2012, when Gov. Steve Beshear's       chief of staff, Mike Haydon, unexpectedly died of a heart       attack at age 62.        The saddest death I know of in the Capitol was in October       1983. Sy Ramsey, Frankfort correspondent for the Associated       Press since 1962, was found dead in his second-floor office.        Ramsey, 59, was a mentor. We had roomed together in New       York City to cover the 1980 Democratic presidential       convention.                            PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL         Oh, the people I've met along the way--from governors,       other constitutional officers, legislators, judges, state       employees from agency heads to janitors, lobbyists and my       media colleagues.        Mike Moloney of Lexington was a tough state senator who had       little sympathy for state officials who appeared before his       budget committee unable to answer questions about their       offices' spending.        One reporter dubbed him but never told him to his face that       his media nickname was ``the Bobby Knight of the Kentucky       General Assembly.''        But that reporter--also with the initials JB--will always       be indebted to the senator for being willing to meet with him       on Friday mornings in the Annex cafeteria during legislative       sessions to talk off the record about politics and       government. Those conversations provided good information       about the workings of the legislature.        Another favored legislator was House Speaker William       Kenton. He was nicknamed ``Boom Boom'' for his booming voice.       He wanted to be governor. He also regularly broke wooden       gavels when he pounded them at his desk to get order in the       House. Splinters flew everywhere. Maybe our affinity had       something to do with both of us hailing from Maysville.        A source of joy has been witnessing so many of my work       colleagues in the Frankfort bureau going on to stellar       careers. Diana  [[Page S115]]       Taylor was chief of staff for Gov. Brereton Jones from 1991       to 1993 and later formed her own successful consulting firm.       John Winn Miller became an editor, publisher, screenwriter,       indie movie producer and author. Cindy Rugeley is a political       science professor at University of Minnesota Duluth. Mary Ann       Roser runs a communications consulting company in Austin.       Jackie Duke became editor of BloodHorse Publications. Chad       Carlton is president of C2 Strategic Communications in       Louisville. Angie Muhs was an executive editor in Maine and       Illinois. Jamie Lucke became a compelling editorial writer.       Monica Richardson is now executive editor of the Miami       Herald. Ryan Alessi teaches journalism and media classes at       James Madison University in Virginia. Daniel Desrochers is in       the McClatchy news bureau in Washington.        Several of my former Frankfort colleagues still are       cranking it out as top-notch news reporters at the Herald-      Leader: John Cheves, Bill Estep, Beth Musgrave and Valarie       Honeycutt Spears.        Two of my partners in the Frankfort bureau became my       bosses: Peter Baniak is editor and general manager of the       Herald-Leader and John Stamper is deputy editor for       accountability. They always let me state my opinions.        My admiration for my Herald-Leader colleagues extends to       news people in other media outlets. They have been most       tenacious and competitive and I am proud to call them my       friends.        We all had a most wonderful building for our workplace.                           LIFE WITHOUT THE CAPITOL         I will miss the Capitol, even the late nights in the       frenetic final hours of a legislative session. I started       working there in my 20s. I leave it in my 70s.        Perhaps a future relative of mine some day will say       something nice about his or her next of kin who once       reported, pondered, wrote, laughed and cried in the Kentucky       Capitol.        I hope that person says of me and the place I worked,       ``They say he called it a grand building, filled with       spectacles and news and, most importantly, interesting       people.        ``They say he loved that place.''                            ____________________     I object.
