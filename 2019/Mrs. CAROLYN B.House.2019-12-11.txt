 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of this NDAA conference report, and particularly for its inclusion of  language from my bill, the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act. This  provision will provide 12 weeks paid parental leave for all Federal  employees for the birth of a child or adoption of a child.    For far too long, the United States has been behind the times. There  are only two countries in the entire world, according to a United  Nations' study, that do not provide paid parental leave for the birth  of a child, and those two countries are the United States and Papua New  Guinea.   When we pass this National Defense Authorization Act, we will no  longer be part of that infamous group. I thank, from the bottom of my  heart, chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, Adam Smith,  who worked selflessly and tirelessly with great determination to  include this provision that will help over 2.1 million Federal  employees. It will turn this priority of balance in family life into a  reality in millions of families' lives. I also thank my friend and  colleague, Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania, for her  partnership on this effort.   While this agreement is not perfect, it is an extraordinary first  step toward full paid family and medical leave for all American  workers. By providing this leave, studies indicate we could prevent the  departure of over 2,600 female employees per year and save the  government $50 million per year in costs associated with employee  turnover. On top of that, paid family leave also improves productivity,  boosts morale, and attracts more talent. It also provides a benefit to  families and the broader economy.   Paid parental leave is an investment in our future in American  families and the workforce. And that is why I am urging all of my  colleagues to support the NDAA, which includes this important  provision.
