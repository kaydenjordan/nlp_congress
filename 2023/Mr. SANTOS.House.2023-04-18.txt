 Mr. Speaker, the American people need tax relief, and I  rise today to share my unapologetic support for the FairTax Act.   Taxes continue to skyrocket in States like New York. Many of my  constituents pay nearly $50,000 in local taxes. Of that amount, $10,000  can be deducted from gross income. The rest gets taxed twice.   I have introduced two bills regarding tax deductions: H.R. 1260, the  SALT  [[Page H1795]]  Relief Act, and H.R. 2634, the Alimony Relief Act. Both of my bills  seek additional deductions for taxpayers forced to submit to  government-directed payments.   Regarding alimony, I hope to repeal the section of law within the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that places the tax liability of government- mandated payments on the person who makes the payment and not the  payee. Why should the person earning the money but not spending it pay  the tax liability?   Mr. Carter's FairTax Act ensures that we pay taxes on what we buy  rather than on what we earn. It would make both of my bills  unnecessary. The hours spent every year doing tax returns wouldn't be  necessary, and Americans would have more time to spend with their  families.   I hope we can make real progress on the FairTax Act, but in the  meantime, I would welcome my colleagues to support my efforts. I look  forward to the day when a simpler tax code is afforded to all of our  constituents.
