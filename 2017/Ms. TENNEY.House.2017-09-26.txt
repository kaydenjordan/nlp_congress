 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Deputy Kurt B. Wyman,  a Marine Corps veteran and Oneida County sheriff's deputy who was  killed in the line of duty in 2011 at only 24 years old.   Deputy Wyman served with distinction in Iraq, earning the Iraqi  Campaign Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Armed Forces Reserve  Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. During his  service in the Oneida County Sheriff's Office, he was named Rookie of  the Year and earned the Grand Cordon Medal twice.   Following his tragic death, the Deputy Kurt B. Wyman Foundation was  created to celebrate and honor his distinguished life of service to our  community and our Nation. Through the foundation's efforts, the Deputy  Kurt B. Wyman Memorial Park in Whitestown was constructed as a resource  for local families.   Each year, an annual fall festival and a motorcycle ride are held at  the park to honor and remember Deputy Wyman's legacy. I am honored to  be joined by so many others who are grateful citizens by riding my own  Harley-Davidson in this beautiful tribute to Deputy Wyman each year.   Please join me and our entire community today in celebrating the life  of Deputy Kurt B. Wyman, who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to  our community and this great Nation.                            ____________________
