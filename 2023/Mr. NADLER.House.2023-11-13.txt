 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1505, the No Stolen Trademarks  Honored in America Act.   H.R. 1505 would build on existing law to ensure that executive  agencies do not recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate the assertion  of trademark rights used in connection with a business whose assets  were confiscated by the Cuban regime unless the original owner  expressly consented to the transfer of that mark. It also makes  technical amendments to ensure that we are in compliance with certain  international obligations.   This legislation largely involves a long-running dispute over the  rightful ownership of a specific trademark that has played out over the  course of many decades. It is a tale with more twists and turns than a  John Grisham novel.   This bill is really about a much larger principle--that we stand with  the Cuban people whose property was seized by the Castro regime, and we  will not give the protection and benefits of the U.S. trademark system  to the holders of stolen property. Our trademark system must not be  allowed to be a vehicle for the perpetrators of stolen property to  profit from their theft.   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) and the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for bringing this legislation  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the cosponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a minor clarification  to our trademark laws while serving notice to corrupt regimes across  the world that America's intellectual property system must not be used  to further their efforts to steal property from their own people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1105, the Debbie Smith Act of 2023, would  reauthorize landmark legislation first enacted 19 years ago, in 2004,  which has been instrumental in addressing a backlog of untested rape  kits sitting in evidence rooms and crime labs across the country.  Nearly 20 years ago, when I helped lead efforts to help enact the  original version of this legislation, I said: ``It is imperative that  we eliminate the shameful backlog of untested rape kits.''   Despite our best efforts, the backlog still exists, and my thoughts  remain the same. It is imperative that we eliminate the rape kit  backlog; full stop.   For every rape kit that is yet to be tested, there is a victim of an  unspeakable crime who has yet to see justice or find closure. In some  cases, there is an individual languishing in prison who does not belong  there. It is for these reasons that we must continue the crucial  mission of this legislation and ensure justice for survivors and for  the wrongfully convicted.   Over the past two decades, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program  has been vital in supporting the processing and analysis of rape kits,  DNA evidence collection and analysis, and victim resources. Millions of  dollars have been allocated to increase the capacity of forensic  laboratories in countless jurisdictions, provide DNA training and  education to thousands of law enforcement personnel, and provide  support services to a multitude of victims. As a result of this  legislation, thousands of cases have been solved, and countless  survivors have finally received the justice they so rightfully deserve.   While we laud the numerous achievements made possible by this  legislation, ultimately, we know that funding is vital to the success  of this grant program. That is why I offered an amendment to similar  legislation during the 107th Congress that would increase the  authorization of funds to address the backlog to $150 million.   Although the Debbie Smith program was authorized to provide up to  $151 million in grant funds during the following Congress, the full  amount has never been appropriated, and it appears that the amounts  appropriated are decreasing each year.   Failure to fully fund this program limits the capacity to address the  backlog, which often numbers in the thousands and has worsened largely  due to the pandemic. If we really want to solve this problem, we will  appropriate $151 million, the full amount of the authorization, in this  year's budget. Delays in testing undermine public safety, allowing  dangerous criminals to evade apprehension and potentially commit  additional crimes. It is my hope that the appropriators will fully fund  this critical program going forward.   Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith program makes our communities safer.  By investing in DNA testing and forensic technology, this legislation  ensures law enforcement agencies are empowered to identify perpetrators  more efficiently and to link them to other unsolved cases. These  identifications and connections not only bring closure to victims and  their families, but they also prevent future crimes by removing serial  offenders from our streets. Above all, reauthorizing the Debbie Smith  program sends a clear message to survivors of sexual assault, domestic  violence, and other crimes that we stand with them.   While Congress has recognized the urgency of addressing the backlog  and disbursed millions of dollars in grant funds through the Debbie  Smith program and other grant programs in response to this problem, we  must be certain that these funds are put to good use. That is why H.R.  1105 would also reauthorize for 5 years the allocation of grants for  State and local governments that receive funding under the Debbie Smith  program to conduct an audit of sexual assault evidence that is in their  possession and awaiting testing.   This particular provision promotes the collection of data to help us  better understand the nature and extent of the backlog and why it  persists, while providing grantees with the resources they need to  perform the audit and comply with other conditions and requirements set  forth in the statute without reducing the total funds available to  carry out the primary purposes of the Debbie Smith program.    The Debbie Smith Act of 2023 is an important measure that ensures our  continued support of State and local governments in reducing the  nationwide backlog of untested rape kits, protecting victims, closing  cases, preventing crime, exonerating the wrongfully accused and  convicted, and holding perpetrators of crime accountable, while  promoting the thoughtful allocation and use of Federal funds.   Again, I emphasize that this will not work as well as it should. We  will not protect as many victims as we should; we will not exonerate as  many wrongfully convicted people as we should if we don't fully fund  the program and if we don't convince the appropriators to appropriate  the $151 million authorized in this bill.  [[Page H5679]]    I thank Representative Ann Wagner for introducing this legislation  along with Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee,   Steve Cohen, Wesley  Hunt, and Ben Cline. I encourage my colleagues to join me and a broad,  bipartisan coalition of cosponsors in support of H.R. 1105.   Mr. Speaker, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program has proven to  be a bipartisan beacon of hope, shining a light on justice sometimes  long denied. This legislation would reauthorize this crucial program  and other safeguards and emphasize our commitment not only to public  safety but also to survivor support and crime prevention. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the important responsibilities the House gives  the Judiciary Committee is to oversee the revision and codification of  the statutes of the United States. Keeping track of the new laws  Congress passes every session is a formidable challenge, but it is an  essential part of maintaining the rule of law in our country, and it is  a role we take seriously on the Judiciary Committee. I thank the  chairman of the committee for bringing legislation to the floor today,  on a bipartisan basis, to further this important duty.   The body of Federal law is so large and complex at this point that it  would be almost completely unmanageable without the United States Code.  Currently consisting of 54 titles, the code compiles the general and  permanent laws of the United States into coherent subject areas. This  makes our Federal laws accessible both to the government officials who  work to fairly administer them and to the private citizens who seek the  benefits and relief the laws provide them.   The painstaking and vital work of maintaining and updating the code  falls to the expert lawyers working under the supervision of the House  in the Office of Law Revision Counsel. We owe a great debt to these  attorneys  [[Page H5688]]  who ably carry out their statutory mandate to develop and keep current  an official and positive codification of the laws of the United States  while maintaining strict impartiality as to legislative policy.   H.R. 3496 is the first of four editorial reclassification bills that  we are taking up today that make conforming changes to statutes that  have been impacted by the Office of Law Revision Counsel's  reauthorization efforts while making no change to the meaning or effect  of any existing laws.   This legislation will help ensure that the code is an authoritative,  accurate, and accessible source of Federal law, and I urge all Members  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, like the previous bill, H.R. 3506 makes a  number of technical amendments to various provisions of the U.S. Code  but makes no substantive changes.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3578, which makes a number of  technical amendments to various provisions of the United States Code,  while making no substantive changes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ivey) for  introducing the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3571, which makes a number of  technical amendments to various provisions of the U.S. Code, while  making no substantive changes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) for  introducing the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 786.   This legislation would amend title 28 of the United States Code to  provide an additional place for holding court in the Western District  of Texas and in the Western District of Washington. These additional  courthouses are needed to better serve the 12.2 million people who call  these two districts home.   Both of these districts are comprised of wide areas of land. The  Western District of Washington takes up half of Washington State. The  Western District of Texas covers the western 68 counties of the State.  Citizens of these two districts often need to travel for hours to  access the courthouse doors.   On paper, our basic rights do not change depending on where we live.  In practice, that is exactly what is happening. It makes no sense that  just because someone lives in a more rural, broader district, they  should incur dramatically increased travel time and administrative  costs to seek justice. Adding courthouses is a small step in the right  direction toward making the courthouse doors accessible to all  Americans no matter where they live.   The Judicial Conference has recommended the addition of these two  courthouses, a recommendation that grew even more urgent after the  Western District of Washington's Bellingham facility had part of its  roof collapse.   This country cannot have a flourishing justice system when its  buildings are falling apart, its staff are underpaid, and there is a  perpetual shortage of judges to fairly administer the laws.   This bill will not fix all of these problems, but it will take a  small step to help millions of Americans gain equal access to justice.  I think it is a step worth taking.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Tony Gonzales, Rick Larsen, and  Suzan DelBene in the House, and Senators Cornyn, Murray, Cruz, and  Cantwell in the Senate for working on a bipartisan basis to introduce  this legislation to improve the lives of the residents of Texas and  Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a modest but important change to  help improve access to justice for millions of Americans. I thank the  sponsors, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1715
