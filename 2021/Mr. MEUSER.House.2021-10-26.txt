 Madam Speaker, I was in a grocery store on Sunday and  nearly a dozen of my constituents stopped me and were very upset about  product shortages and price increases.   According to the data, eggs are up 12 percent, bacon is up 20  percent, chicken is up 8 percent, gasoline is up 40 to 50 percent,  hamburger and beef are running short. I can assure you, Madam Speaker,  while these data points paint a picture, price increases are just  simply much higher, and my constituents are feeling the effects in  their family budgets.   An older gentleman with a half-full shopping cart that rang up for  $111 glanced up at me and said: This is ridiculous. There are people  filling their gas tanks now--before it was $50, now it is $80, $90,  $100 to fill up a pickup truck because, Madam Speaker, the President  and Members of this House--in fact, the leadership of this House--has  decided to attack domestic energy production, which is clearly driving  prices up through the roof.   With winter around the corner, it will cost 30 percent more to heat  an average person's home. Yet, the Democrats are trying to implement a  home heating tax--that is a wonderful idea--in the so-called Build Back  Better bill that will drive energy bills even higher.   Madam Speaker, how is this helpful? How is it helpful to raise costs  to tax our domestic energy while making it more competitive for Russia  and Saudi Arabia and all the other places in the world to sell us their  energy, so-called cheaper, when meanwhile a barrel of oil is over $80 a  barrel. It makes no sense.   And the thing is this, the American people get this. The American  people know it. They are paying the price for it. Members here will pay  the price at the polls because this bill called Build Back Better is a  disaster, Madam Speaker.   This is seventh grade economics. There is too much demand created by  Big Government policies and not enough supply, not enough workers  because we are providing far too much incentive for them not to work.  Why would they, if they are making more not working? We are not doing  anything to help our U.S. productivity to fulfill the demand that is  being created by these Big Government policies.   All the while, foreign imports are pouring in and creating a  bottleneck at our ports that we all see because we don't have the  capacity, number one, to build in the USA to fulfill the demand; but  number two, to unload the cargo ships and distribute the goods and then  put them in trucks and ship them around the country.   So even the Treasury Secretary is warning Americans that inflation  will be here throughout the next year, even though the President and  others have said: Oh, no, this is just a passing problem. Nobody has to  worry about it.   So what is the plan moving forward for the majority in this House,  for the Democrats? They want to prime the demand side of the equation  with a multi-trillion dollar spending bill  [[Page H5882]]  known as Build Back Better, and we are hearing all these wonderful  things about it.   Well, the problem is that all those wonderful things cost far too  much and are completely unaffordable and aren't being paid for by the  Members of this House; they are being paid for by my constituents who  are going to be worse off because of it, and they also know that.   And not to mention, Madam Speaker, what about all the fraud? We don't  hear much about that. Did you realize there was $87 billion in fraud  due to the unemployment compensation that was just sprawled out to  whoever asked with absolutely no work requirements at all, and none  exist in this bill either.   We will be building back--not better--we will be building back in a  manner that will be hurtful to my constituents and to my State and to  our country.   Madam Speaker, the holidays are around the corner. Demand always  increases in the holidays. So the situation is going to get further  exacerbated, without a doubt. You don't need an economist to know that  demand is going to continue to go up, supply will be minimal, inflation  will rise due to the Build Back Better, which means there will be less  workers. This is going to be the most expensive Christmas anyone can  remember.                            ____________________
