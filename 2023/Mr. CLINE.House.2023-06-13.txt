 Mr. Speaker, since our country's founding, the United  States Constitution has granted Congress the legislative authority to  decide major questions of nationwide policy.   Yet, since President Biden took office, his administration has  continued his assault on America's economy with costly Federal  regulations and executive overreach of power to advance his radical  agenda.   In its first year alone, the Biden administration finalized liberal  regulations that added more than $200 billion in new regulatory costs.  The Biden administration has acted unilaterally on several occasions to  circumvent congressional approval to pass policies that advance its  far-left agenda.   We saw this in the Biden administration's attempt to pass the  unconstitutional student loan giveaway plan, putting taxpayers on the  hook for others' heavy college debt. We saw this in the Biden  administration's cancelation of pending oil and gas lease sales, hiking  up energy costs for hardworking families. We saw this in the Biden  administration's proposed ESG investment rule that would put seniors'  hard-earned retirement savings at risk.   This is all unacceptable. American taxpayers deserve to know just how  much the administration's executive orders will cost them before they  go into effect.   As our Nation faces $31 trillion in debt, Congress must pass the  REINS Act. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________
