 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  accomplishments of Angel Sanchez of Fort Worth, who recently  represented Diamond Hill-Jarvis High School and made history by winning  the State's first track and field medal with a gold in the 1600.  Additionally, his accomplishments got him recognized as DFW's boys'  track athlete of the week.   I am very proud of Angel for representing the city of Fort Worth at  the State level, and I am proud of the entire Diamond Hill-Jarvis High  School for all of their recent athletic accomplishments.   Last year, Diamond Hill-Jarvis High School's boys' soccer team headed  to the State finals, making them the first-ever team in school history  to make it to the State UIL championship in any sport.   Once again, Angel, and everyone at Diamond Hill, you should be proud  of all of your accomplishments. Keep up the good work. Angel, I look  forward to seeing you race in Portland.                            ____________________
