 Show me where it says that protests are supposed       to be polite and peaceful.        President TRUMP. We believe in safe streets, secure       communities, and we believe in law and order.    Tragically, as we know now, the January--on January 6, a small group,  who came to engage in violent and menacing behavior, hijacked the event  for their own purposes. According to publicly available reporting, it  is apparent that extremists of various different stripes and political  persuasions preplanned and premeditated an attack on the Capitol. One  of the first people arrested was a leader of antifa. Sadly, he was also  among the first to be released.   From the beginning, the President has been clear: The criminals who  infiltrated the Capitol must be punished to the fullest extent of the  law. They should be imprisoned for as long as the law allows.   The fact that the attacks were apparently premeditated, as alleged by  the House managers, demonstrates the ludicrousness of the incitement  allegation against the President.   You can't incite what was already going to happen.   Law enforcement officers at the scene conducted themselves heroically  and courageously, and our country owes them an eternal debt. But there  must be a discussion of the decision by political leadership regarding  force posture and security in advance of the event.   As many will recall, last summer the White House was faced with  violent rioters night after night. They repeatedly attacked Secret  Service officers and at one point pierced a security wall, culminating  in the clearing of Lafayette Square.   Since that time, there has been a sustained negative narrative in the  media regarding the necessity of those security measures on that night,  even though they certainly prevented many calamities from occurring.   In the wake of the Capitol attack, it must be investigated whether  the proper force posture was not initiated due to the political  pressure stemming from the events at Lafayette Square. Consider this:  On January 5, the Mayor of the District of Columbia explicitly  discouraged the National Guard and Federal authorities from doing more  to protect the Capitol, saying:   [[Page S669]]              [T]he District of Columbia is not requesting other federal       law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional       deployment . . .    This sham impeachment also poses a serious threat to freedom of  speech for political leaders of both parties at every level of  government. The Senate should be extremely careful about the precedent  this case will set.   Consider the language that the House Impeachment Article alleges to  constitute incitement:         If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a       country anymore.    This is ordinary political rhetoric that is virtually  indistinguishable from the language that has been used by people across  the political spectrum for hundreds of years. Countless politicians  have spoken of fighting for our principles. Joe Biden's campaign slogan  was ``Battle for the Soul'' of America.   No human being seriously believes that the use of such metaphorical  terminology is incitement to political violence. While the President  did not engage in any language of incitement, there are numerous  officials in Washington who have indeed used profoundly reckless,  dangerous, and inflammatory rhetoric in recent years.   The entire Democratic Party and national news media spent the last 4  years repeating, without any evidence, that the 2016 election had been  hacked and falsely and absurdly claimed the President of the United  States was a Russian spy. Speaker Pelosi herself said that the 2016  election was hijacked and that Congress has a duty to protect our  democracy. She also called the President an imposter and a traitor and  recently referred to her colleagues in the House as ``the enemy  within.''   Moreover, many Democrat politicians endorsed and encouraged the riots  that destroyed vast swaths of American cities last summer. When  violent, leftwing anarchists conducted a sustained assault on a Federal  courthouse in Portland, OR, Speaker Pelosi did not call it  insurrection; instead, she called the Federal law enforcement officers  protecting the building ``storm troopers.''   When violent mobs destroyed public property, she said: ``People will  do what they do.'' The attorney general of the State of Massachusetts  stated:         Yes, America is burning, but that's how forests grow.    Representative Ayanna Pressley declared:         There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as       there's unrest in our lives.    The current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, urged  supporters to donate to a fund that bailed violent rioters and  arsonists out of jail. One of those was released and went out and  committed another crime, assault. He beat the bejesus out of somebody.  She said, of the violent demonstrations:         Everyone beware . . . they're not gonna stop before       Election Day in November, and they're not gonna stop after       Election Day. [T]hey're not going to let up--and they should       not.    Such rhetoric continued even as hundreds of police officers across  the Nation were subjected to violent assaults at the hands of angry  mobs. A man claiming to be inspired by the junior Senator from Vermont  came down here to Washington, DC, to watch a softball game and kill as  many Senators and Congressmen as he could. It cannot be forgotten that  President Trump did not blame the junior Senator.   The senior Senator from Maine has had her house surrounded by angry  mobs of protesters. When that happened, it unnerved her. One of the  House managers--I forget which one--tweeted ``cry me a river.''   Under the standards of the House Impeachment Article, each of these  individuals should be retroactively censored, expelled, punished, or  impeached for inciting violence by their supporters.   Unlike the left, President Trump has been entirely consistent in his  opposition to mob violence. He opposes it in all forms, in all places,  just as he has been consistent that the National Guard should be  deployed to protect American communities wherever protection is needed.   For Democrats, they have clearly demonstrated that their opposition  to mobs and their view of using the National Guard depends upon the  mob's political views. Not only is this impeachment case preposterously  wrong on the facts, no matter how much heat and emotion is injected by  the political opposition, but it is also plainly unconstitutional.   In effect, Congress would be claiming the right to disqualify a  private citizen, no longer a government official, from running for  public office. This would transform the solemn impeachment process into  a mechanism for asserting congressional control over which private  citizens are an are not allowed to run for President. In short, this  unprecedented effort is not about Democrats opposing political  violence; it is about Democrats trying to disqualify their political  opposition. It is constitutional cancel culture.    History will record this shameful effort as a deliberate attempt by  the Democratic Party to smear, censor, and cancel not just President  Trump but the 75 million Americans who voted for him. Now is not the  time for such a campaign of retribution; it is the time for unity and  healing and focusing on the interests of the Nation as a whole.   We should all be seeking to cool temperatures, calm passions, rise  above partisan lines. The Senate should reject this divisive and  unconstitutional effort and allow the Nation to move forward.   Over the course of the next 3 hours or so, you will hear next from  Mr. Schoen, who is going to talk about due process and a couple of  other points you will be interested to hear. I will return with an  analysis of why the First Amendment must be properly applied here, and  then Mr. Castor will discuss the law as it applies to the speech of  January 6. And then we will be pleased to answer your questions.   Thank you.   Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Schoen.   Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Leaders, Senators, throughout the course of  today, my colleagues and I will explain in some detail the simple fact  that President Trump did not incite the horrific, terrible riots of  January 6. We will demonstrate that, to the contrary, the violence and  the looting goes against the law-and-order message he conveyed to every  citizen of the United States throughout his Presidency, including on  January 6.   First, though, we would like to discuss the hatred, the vitriol, the  political opportunism that has brought us here today. The hatred that  the House managers and others on the left have for President Trump has  driven them to skip the basic elements of due process and fairness and  to rush an impeachment through the House, claiming ``urgency.''   But the House waited to deliver the Article to the Senate for almost  2 weeks, only after Democrats had secured control over the Senate. In  fact, contrary to their claim that the only reason they held it was  because Senator McConnell wouldn't accept the Article, Representative  Clyburn made clear that they had considered holding the Article for  over 100 days to provide President Biden with a clear pathway to  implement his agenda.   Our Constitution and any basic sense of fairness require that every  legal process with significant consequences for a person's life,  including impeachment, requires due process under the law, which  includes factfinding and the establishment of a legitimate evidentiary  record with an appropriate foundation.   Even last year's impeachment followed committee hearings and months  of examination and investigation by the House. Here, President Trump  and his counsel were given no opportunity to review evidence or  question its propriety. The rush to judgment for a snap impeachment in  this case was just one example of the denial of due process. Another,  perhaps even more vitally significant, example was the denial of any  opportunity ever to test the integrity of the evidence offered against  Donald J. Trump in a proceeding seeking to bar him from ever holding  public office again and that seeks to disenfranchise some 75 million  voters--American voters.   On Wednesday of this week, countless news outlets repeated the  Democrat talking point about the power of never-before-seen footage.  Let me ask you this: Why was this footage never seen before? Shouldn't  the subject of an impeachment trial--this impeachment  [[Page S670]]  trial--President Trump, have the right to see the so-called new  evidence against him?   More importantly, the riot and the attack on this very building was a  major event that shocked and impacted all Americans. Shouldn't the  American people have seen this footage as soon as it was available? For  what possible reason did the House managers withhold it from the  American people and President Trump's lawyers? For political gain?   How did they get it? How are they the ones releasing it? It is  evidence in hundreds of pending criminal cases against the rioters. Why  was it not released through law enforcement or the Department of  Justice? Is it the result of a rushed, snap impeachment for political  gain without due process?   House Manager Raskin told us all yesterday that your job as jurors in  this case is a fact-intensive job, but, of course, as several of the  House managers have told you, we still don't have the facts.   Speaker Pelosi herself, on February 2, called for a 9/11-style  Commission to investigate the events of January 6. Speaker Pelosi says  that the Commission is needed to determine the causes of the events.  She says it herself. If an inquiry of that magnitude is needed to  determine the causes of the riot--and it may very well be--then how can  these same Democrats have the certainty needed to bring Articles of  Impeachment and blame the riots on President Trump? They don't.   The House managers, facing a significant lack of evidence, turned  often to press reports and rumors during these proceedings, claims that  would never meet the evidentiary standards of any court. In fact, they  even relied on the words of Andrew Feinberg, a reporter who recently  worked for Sputnik, the Russian propaganda outlet. You saw it posted.  By the way, the report they cited was completely refuted.   The frequency with which House managers relied on unproven media  reports shocked me as I sat in this Chamber and listened to this.   (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. And there is a lot that we       don't know yet about what happened that day.        Mr. Manager RASKIN. According to those around him at the       time, reportedly responded.        Unidentified Speaker. Trump reportedly.        Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Reports across all major media outlets.

Reportedly.        Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Reportedly not accidental.        According to reports.        Unidentified Speaker. President Trump was reportedly.

According to reports.        Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Reported.        Mr. Manager LIEU. Reportedly.    As any trial lawyer will tell you, ``reportedly'' is a euphemism for  ``I have no real evidence.'' ``Reportedly'' is not the standard in any  American setting in which any semblance of due process is afforded an  accused. ``Reportedly'' isn't even ``here is some circumstantial  evidence.'' It is exactly as reliable as ``I googled this for you.''   And if you are worried you might ever be tried based on this type of  evidence, don't be. You get more due process than this when you fight a  parking ticket.   One reason due process is so important with respect to evidence  offered against an accused is that it requires an opportunity to test  the integrity, the credibility, the reliability of the evidence. Here,  of course, former President Trump was completely denied any such  opportunity. And it turns out there is significant reason to doubt the  evidence the House managers have put before us.   Let me say this clearly. We have reason to believe the House managers  manipulated evidence and selectively edited footage. If they did and  this were a court of law, they would face sanctions from the judge.   I don't raise this issue lightly. Rather, it is a product of what we  have found in just the limited time we have had since we first saw the  evidence here with you this week.   We have reason to believe that the House managers created false  representations of tweets, and the lack of due process means there was  no opportunity to review or verify the accuracy.   Consider these facts. The House managers, proud of their work on this  snap impeachment, staged numerous photo shoots of their preparations.  In one of those, Manager Raskin is seen here at his desk, reviewing two  tweets side by side. The image on his screen claims to show that  President Trump had retweeted one of those tweets.   (Video presentation.)   Now, Members of the Senate, let's look closely at the screen because,  obviously, Manager Raskin considered it important enough that he  invited the New York Times to watch him watching it.   What is wrong with this image? Actually, there are three things very  wrong with it. Look at the date on the very bottom of the screen on  Manager Raskin's computer screen when we zoom into the picture. The  date that appears is January 3, 2020, not 2021. Why is that date wrong?  Because this is not a real screenshot that he is working with. This is  a recreation of a tweet. And you got the date wrong when you  manufactured this graphic. You did not disclose that this is a  manufactured graphic and not a rea screenshot of a tweet.    To be fair, the House managers caught this error before showing the  image on the Senate floor. So you never saw it when it was presented to  you.   But that is not all. They didn't fix this one. Look at the blue  checkmark next to the Twitter username of the account retweeted by the  President. It indicates that this is a verified account, given the blue  check by Twitter to indicate it is run by a public figure. The problem?  The user's real account is not verified and has no blue checkmark, as  you can see. Were you trying to make her account seem more significant  or were you just sloppy?   If we had due process of law in this case, we would know the truth.  But that is not all that is wrong with this one tweet. House Manager  Swalwell showed you this tweet this week, and he emphasized that this  tweet reflected a call to arms. He told you repeatedly that this was a  promise to call in the cavalry for January 6. He expressly led you to  believe that President Trump's supporter believed that the President  wanted armed supporters at the January 6 speech--paramilitary groups,  the cavalry--ready for physical combat.   The problem is, the actual text is exactly the opposite. The tweeter  promised to bring the calvary--a public display of Christ's  crucifixion, a central symbol of her Christian faith with her to the  President's speech--a symbol of faith, love, and peace.   They just never want to seem to read the text and believe what the  text means. You will see this was reported in the media last evening  also.   Words matter, they told you. But they selectively edited the  President's words over and over again. They manipulated video, time- shifting clips, and made it appear the President's words were playing  to a crowd when they weren't. Let's take a look.   (Text of video presentations.)         President TRUMP. After this, we're going to walk down--and       I will be there with you--we're going to walk down. We are       going to walk down to the Capitol.        And we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're       going cheer on our brave Senators and Congress men and women,       and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some       of them because you will never take back our country with       weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be       strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right       thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully       slated--lawfully slated.        I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the       Capitol Building to peacefully and patriotically make your       voices heard.    ``And we are going to walk down to the Capitol.'' They showed you  that part. Why are we walking to the Capitol? Well, they cut that off:  to ``cheer on'' some Members of Congress, and not others, ``peacefully  and patriotically.''   The Supreme Court ruled in Brandenburg that there is a very clear  standard for incitement--in short, to paraphrase, whether the speech  was intended to provoke imminent lawless action and was likely to do  so.  [[Page S671]]    ``Go to the Capitol, and cheer on some Members of Congress but not  others''--they know it doesn't meet the standard for incitement, so  they edited it down.   We heard a lot this week about ``fight like hell,'' but they cut off  the video before they showed you the President's optimistic, patriotic  words that followed immediately after.   (Text of video presentations.)         President TRUMP. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight       like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.        Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet       begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our       children, and for our beloved country--and I say this despite       all that has happened--the best is yet to come.    There is that famous quote, like one of the House managers said: A  lie will travel halfway around the world before the truth has a chance  to put its shoes on.   Well, this lie traveled around the world a few times and made its way  into the Biden campaign talking points and ended up on the Senate  floor: the Charlottesville lie, ``very fine people on both sides,''  except that isn't all he said. And they knew it then, and they know it  now.   Watch this.   (Text of video presentations.)         President TRUMP. But you also had people that were very       fine people--on both sides. You had people in that group--      excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You       had people in that group that were there to protest the       taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and       the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.        Unidentified Speaker. George Washington and Robert E. Lee       are not the same.        President TRUMP. George Washington was a slave owner. Was       Georg Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now       lose his status? Are we going to take down--excuse me. Are       we going to take down--are we going to take down statues       to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do       you think of Thomas Jefferson? Do you like him? Are we       going to take down the statue? Because he was a major       slave owner. Now are we going to take down his statue?        So you know what? It is fine. You're changing history.       You're changing culture. And you had people--and I am not       talking about the neo-Nazis and the White nationalists       because they should be condemned totally. But you had many       people in that group other than neo-Nazis and White       nationalists, OK? And the press has treated them absolutely       unfairly.        Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but       you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the       black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball       bats. You got--you had a lot of bad--you had a lot of bad       people in the other group too.        Unidentified Speaker. Who was treated unfairly, sir? I'm       sorry. I just couldn't understand what you were saying. You       were saying the press treated White nationalists unfairly? I       want to understand what you're saying.        President TRUMP. No. No, there were people in that rally--      and I looked the night before. If you look, there were people       protesting, very quietly, the taking down of the statue of       Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad       ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough,       bad people--neo-Nazis, White nationalists--whatever you want       to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that       were there to innocently protest and very legally protest       because, you know--I don't know if you know, they had a       permit. The other group didn't have a permit.        So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story. I       thought what took place was a horrible moment for our       country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the       country.        Does anybody have a final--does anybody have a--you have an       infrastructure--    This might be, today, the first time the news networks played those  full remarks in their context. And how many times have you heard that  President Trump has never denounced White supremacists? Now you and  America know the truth.   Here is another example. One of the House managers made much of the  President's supposedly ominous words of ``you have to get your people  to fight.'' But you knew what the President really meant. He meant that  the crowd should demand action from Members of Congress and support  primary challenges to those who don't do what he considered to be  right. Support primary challenges, not violent action. I know what he  meant because I watched the full video, and so did the House managers.  But they manipulated his words. You will see where they stopped it and  to give it a very different meaning from the meaning it has in full  context. Let's watch.   (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. Manager NEGUSE. ``You have to get your people to       fight.'' He told them.        President TRUMP. You have to get your people to fight. And       if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the       ones that don't fight. You primary them. We are going to. We       are going to let you know who they are. I can already tell       you, frankly.    The ``people'' who need to fight are Members of Congress. Why do we  have to skip the necessary due diligence and due process of law and  any--that any legal proceeding should have? It couldn't have been the  urgency to get President Trump out of office. House Democrats held the  Articles until he was no longer President, mooting their case.   Hatred, animosity, division, political gain--and let's face it, for  House Democrats, President Trump is the best enemy to attack.   (Text of video presentations.)
