 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2379, a bill to  reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, and I would  also like to thank Mr. Pascrell for his work on this. This is something  that we have seen over many years, and I appreciate the chairman and my  friend from Georgia on the committee for bringing this forward as well.   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership, or the BVP, created by the  Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, is a unique U.S.  Department of Justice initiative designed to provide a critical  resource to State and local law enforcement. The goal of the BVP is to  support the purchase of body armor that has been tested and found to  comply with applicable ballistic and stab standards promulgated by the  National Institute of Justice.   For the past 20 years, the BVP has awarded more than 13,000  jurisdictions a total of $467 million in Federal funds for the purchase  of over 1.3 million vests.   From fiscal year 2015 through 2017, protective vests were directly  attributable to saving the lives of at least 129 law enforcement and  corrections officers. BVP funds helped purchase 21 of those vests.   In short, body armor saves lives. For 30 years, bullet-resistant body  armor has protected law enforcement officers from ballistic and  nonballistic incidents. As recorded by the IACP/DuPont Kevlar  Survivors' Club, more than 3,100 officers have survived potentially  fatal or disabling injuries because they were wearing their body armor.   The bill before us today permanently reauthorizes this vitally  important program. It will ensure our local heroes are protected from  those who try to do them harm.   When a law enforcement officer leaves home in the morning, there is  no guarantee he or she will return home safely that evening. This  program makes it more likely, though, that these heroes will see their  families again.   That is why I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 2379. As the son of a  Georgia State trooper, I know what that means.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I do appreciate this time. This is a special week for me personally  because it is recognizing something that I grew up with. It recognizes  something that I am that I can't get a part of who I am. And I  appreciate Mr. Pascrell, my friend from New Jersey, talking about this  and what that actually means.   But for what I will just term as a trooper's kid, this week means a  lot. And it would mean even more when we come here if really, we had  had more to do this week. I say that with respect, and I say that with  love, because this is a good bill, and I urge everyone to support it,  and I want to.   But just this past week, in Georgia, just as was recommended and said  in New Jersey, just in the past few days in Savannah, Georgia, we lost  another officer, Sergeant Kelvin Ansari, in an incident. He went to  work and did not come home.   For the past few years, I have been in this body, and we have worked  during Police Week, even beforehand, to bring up bills and to bring up  issues that involve our law enforcement community because I recognize,  and I know others in this body do as well, that on those mornings when  they get up to go to work, the ladies and gentlemen who serve us in our  law enforcement community, all of us, they are giving a gift of life to  go serve others.   And on many days, unfortunately, the headlines will show to us that  they don't return home; some through violence; some through activity;  some, as we have seen this past year in this country, ambushed in front  of their own police departments; cruelly murdered by those anarchists  in this country who believe that the police are the enemy; and  sometimes, fed by others who want a different version of what upholding  the law means. And that is sad.   My heart breaks, because when those officers don't come home, there  is a space left at the table. There is a void left in the hearts of  families and communities.   One of my earliest remembrances of my dad as a trooper, and one of  the biggest things that made an impression on me, was years ago there  was a trooper who had made a stop on 129 South out of Gainesville,  Georgia, T.C. Dillard. As he made that stop, a young man who was not in  his right mind through drugs, came over a hill and hit him.   I remember hearing about it. I was young at the time, and I remember  him being taken to the hospital. And I can remember my dad and other  officers all going to the hospital, and they were giving blood and  doing whatever they could. It was one of the first times I remember of  my earliest remembrances of watching my dad cry.   To a scrawny kid from north Georgia, who had a dad, and has a dad who  is 6 feet 2 inches, 250 pounds, carried a .357 on his hip, and wore the  badge of the Georgia State Patrol, he was and is my hero. To see him  cry was something I had not experienced. To watch him love another  officer and do anything for that officer is something that has impacted  me today.   As we move forward, and we look at the things today, I guess my only  thing--and I wanted to spend just a few more moments on this, because  this is our only chance. This is the only bill that we have dealing  with Law Enforcement Week this week.   I know that we are busy in the Judiciary Committee. I know that we  have got a lot of other things going on. I know that we have so many  things that we need to investigate, and I get that.   I am not--for once, I am just honestly speaking as much as a  Congressman as I am as a trooper's kid.   Thirty thousand officers will be coming to Washington, D.C. over the  next few days to honor those who have fallen, and to remember this  week. And this bill, which is a good bill, is it. It is all we are  offering. It is all we are discussing.   In years past, in 2018, we had six bills, including one rule bill. In  2017, nine bills, including two rule bills. 2016, eight bills,  including two rule bills. Protect and Serve, Thin Blue Line, Probation  Officer Protection Act of 2017, the Comprehensive Opioid and Abuse Act,  which gave our officers training in how they can actually help in an  opioid crisis.   I understand that we have a lot going on, but in our committee right  now we have H.R. 816, which would ensure certain law enforcement  officers on college campuses and their families are eligible for death  and disability benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefit  Program.   H.R. 816 is named in honor of Sean Collier, a police officer at MIT  who was  [[Page H3753]]  murdered by one of the Tsarnaev brothers after the attack at the Boston  Marathon. This is to make sure their family has security.   Another bill from my committee colleague, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), is his aim to prevent law enforcement  suicides. Other bills that we have pending for law enforcement by  helping them provide resources to combat opioid crisis or curb sex  trafficking. In years past, we have considered numerous bills, not all  of them, in fact, most of them noncontroversial. But we didn't seem to  have time to mark them up this year or to bring them forward.   I understand, and I am trying my best to just bring an honest  concern, because when you look at these officers--and I used to ride  with them; as I got older and I went to seminary and I was a chaplain  for the Gainesville Police Department--it never leaves you.   As I came here today, and I appreciate my friend from Georgia, we  have shared so many things together, we have done this, and Mr.  Pascrell and others who have talked about this.   But this is it. This is our only chance to actually say to these  people--instead of just saying we appreciate you; we love you; and we  are glad that you do what you do and offer them help in the things that  they do, we offer them bulletproof vests, which is good; but it is all  we are offering right now.   And I want to make sure, on this floor, for those kids whose dads and  moms didn't come home this past year, just a reminder that it is not  about what we say to those officers, it is also what we do.    I live each day, as best as I possibly can, to do as best as I  possibly can for the ones who have given me so much; my mom, who I lost  last June, my dad, who I still have, who taught me how to grow up; how  to love; how to care; taught me to serve my country in the military and  to serve my country here.   But when I come to a discussion today, and I heard my friend from New  Jersey so eloquently discuss those who lost their lives in New Jersey  and here in Savannah, the one thing that gets me up every morning, and  if I have had a bad day, or if I am thinking about it, and when I hear  all the discussion in this country about officers who are bad, or  officers who are not doing it right, and officers--I understand the  discussion that we need to have in our communities, and how we need to  come together as communities to help each other and to lift each other  up, from the poorest communities to the richest; the police are there  to take the law. And if there are bad ones, they need to be got out.  But they are 99.99 percent good, who honestly just want to do a good  job, and we need to honor that.   But when we talk about bulletproof vests, when we talk about other  issues of how we care for officers, just remember those this week,  especially those who didn't come home because, Mr. Speaker, except by  the grace of God, I would have not known my father, because on a  traffic stop, when I was still a small child, he walked up to a car. He  caught a glint of a gun laying on the shoulder of the driver. He,  fortunately, was able to pull his gun, and they stood there for many  minutes in a standoff until the gentleman threw the gun out of the car  window. That incident almost deprived me of knowing my hero.   When we talk about police, when we talk about law enforcement and the  other first responders on all sides, but the police we are talking  about today, I just humbly believe that there is more that we can do,  and I look forward to working with our committee to do more throughout  this year.   But on this week, it is worth pointing out that these folks stand in  the line, many of them not sleeping while we sleep, and they are worth  protecting, and they are worth more, frankly, than this one bill; and I  look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues to make sure that  we see more come across this floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am almost at the end, but as I was finishing up--and I appreciate  the gentleman from Georgia's words, and I agree that we can--but I  would be remiss if I didn't share what I just got in my inbox. I just  got this in my inbox.   It is a letter signed by my chairman of my committee and four other  members of our committee on Police Week. After I just talked about how  we can do more, this is what we are doing more.   ``As you know, the House Judiciary Committee exercises legislative  and oversight jurisdiction in the areas of civil rights and criminal  law enforcement. These areas continue to be subjects of intense  national concern in the wake of high-profile incidents involving the  fatal use of force by law enforcement against unarmed people in cities  such as Ferguson, Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago, Falcon Heights, Tulsa,  Pittsburgh, and Dallas. In 2018, 992 people were shot and killed by  police. In the first 2 months of this year, at least 265 people have  suffered the same fate.''  [[Page H3754]]    Mr. Speaker, I include the May 14, 2019, letter in the Record.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2019.      Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Barr: As you know, the House       Judiciary Committee exercises legislative and oversight       jurisdiction in areas of civil rights and criminal law       enforcement. These areas continue to be subjects of intense       national concern in the wake of high-profile incidents       involving the fatal use of force by law enforcement against       unarmed people in cities such as Ferguson, Baltimore,       Cleveland, Chicago, Falcon Heights, Tulsa, Pittsburgh, and       Dallas, In 2018, 992 people were shot and killed by police.       ``In the first two months of this year, at least 265 people       have suffered the same fate.``        Despite continuing concerns from civil rights and       community-based organizations, the Department has sharply       curtailed its statutory role in identifying and eradicating       civil rights abuses by law enforcement. Excessive force in       police-civilian encounters presents a crisis of trust       throughout our nation. Changes to Department policy and       failure to uphold the law run the risk of undermining federal       oversight authority in this space.        Congress identified the need for the Department and       community stakeholders to play a role in eliminating unjust       and discriminatory practices by law enforcement. With that       goal in mind, Congress has provided the Department with the       authority to identify and eliminate patterns and practices of       unconstitutional conduct in law enforcement agencies through       civil action and administrative authority. Additionally, it       provided the Department the ability to encourage communities       to have a voice in how they are policed through programs       offered by the Community Oriented Policing Services or ``COPS       Office.'' These tools must be used to promote Constitutional       poJicing practices that support public safety and respect       civil rights and civil liberties.        Accordingly, we write to request information related to the       manner in which the Department of Justice is currently       carrying out its statutory responsibilities to eliminate       patterns and practices of unconstitutional conduct in law       enforcement agencies. We respectfully request you provide       complete responses and produce the relevant documents and       communications listed below by no later than June 5, 2019:        1. Documents and communications dated from January 1, 2017       to March 31, 2017, relating to Attorney General Sessions's       March 31, 2017 Memorandum, ``Supporting Federal, State,       Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement.'' This should include any       prior drafts of the memorandum.

This should include any       prior drafts of the memorandum. Please include a list       identifying all individuals involved in the decision to       identify issues arising from the Department's ``civil       action[s] against a state or local government . . . by       consent decree or settlement agreement.''        3.

[[Page H3755]]           Sheila Jackson Lee,        Member of Congress.                                time  1600     Are you kidding me? We couldn't wait a week?   Look, vote for this bill. This bill is a good bill. But this shows  the dedication of the majority to Police Week right here. It is about  what my chairman of the committee did. It is about what we say and what  we do. This is what we did.   On the first part of Police Week, we sent to the Attorney General a  discussion about people who are shot by police, many of which in no  context here of how the accidents occurred or how it occurred or what  was actually happening; it is just that we need to go investigate, a 4- , 5-page letter.   Vote for the bill. The bill is a good bill.   This letter is embarrassing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Again, I will come back to the issue. This bulletproof vest bill is a  great bill. It needs to be permanent. In fact, if we can do better, it  would be great. We need to do more.   I made my point about this letter, and, unfortunately, this is a  stain on Police Week, and hopefully we can do better, and I know we  will.   I trust my friend from Georgia. I trust my friend from New Jersey. We  can do this, and we can do this better. I am sorry that this is the way  it has had to start, but actions do speak louder than anything else,  than words, like I said, and this is an action on Police Week that,  frankly, is unbelievable.   Support this underlying bill. Support this bill for bulletproof  vests. Support our officers not just with words, but with actions as  well, and I know the Members here on this floor are doing that. It is  just a shame that this had to come out with that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
