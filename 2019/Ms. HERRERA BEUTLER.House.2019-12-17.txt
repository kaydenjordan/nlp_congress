 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1865, which includes funding for the Legislative Branch.   The recommendation for fiscal year 2020 Legislative Branch Division  provides for $5.049 billion. This is a 4.4 percent increase above  fiscal year 2019.   The allocation provides the budget request for the Office of the  Congressional Workplace Rights and the Government Publishing Office, as  well as increases for the House of Representatives, Capitol Police,  Congressional Budget Office, Library of Congress, Government  Accountability Office, and the Open World Leadership Center.   I am really pleased that this bill supports the Capitol Police, as  well as funding for important Architect of the Capitol security  infrastructure improvements to keep the Capitol campus safe and to keep  its visitors safe, its staff, the Members, and the folks who work here.   I am also supportive of the funding that supports the Library of  Congress' Visitor's Experience enhancements and other programs that my  constituents, all of our constituents, enjoy regularly, as well as  upgrades to the Capitol complex facilities for visitors and staff with  disabilities, which will make it easier for the blind and the visually  impaired to access and enjoy the Capitol complex.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Ryan's  cooperation and support on several initiatives that are important to us  and this institution. I would like to thank Chairwoman Lowey and  Ranking Member Granger for their support and guidance throughout this  process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1865.
