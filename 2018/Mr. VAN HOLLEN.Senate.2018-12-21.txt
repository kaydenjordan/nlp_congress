 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from  Maryland, Senator Cardin, for his leadership on this issue, among many  others, and start by agreeing with him that, first and foremost, we  should avoid a government shutdown. That is exactly what this Senate  did on a bipartisan basis just a few days ago. We passed an agreement.  None of us loved it, but we all recognized that it was a better  alternative than shutting down the government. That, of course, went  over to the House, and we know what happened to it there. I hope we  will continue to work together to avoid a government shutdown.   The proposal that Senator Cardin and I are putting forward is very  simple. Federal employees should not be punished by the shutdown. They  have nothing to do with the dysfunction that would cause a government  shutdown, and they should not be the ones who have to bear the burden  and the penalty of something totally beyond their control--a government  shutdown. That is what this is about.   As Senator Cardin indicated, often after shutdowns are over, the  Congress and the White House do the right thing, and we provide  retroactive compensation to Federal employees, but it is not  guaranteed. It always could be changed. It might not happen. What we  are trying to do is to make sure that as Federal employees watch the  spectacle here on Capitol Hill and they are thinking about joining  their families for Christmas or other things over the holidays, they  don't have to have the uncertainty, if there is a government shutdown,  about whether or not they are going to get a paycheck to pay all of the  bills that will stack up over that period of time. Let's provide  confidence and certainty upfront that Federal employees don't have to  pay the penalty for dysfunction in Washington. That is what this bill  does.   I want to stress that if we go into a shutdown, Federal employees-- both those who are still working during the shutdown, as well as those  who are furloughed--go without paychecks. They have bills to pay. They  have mortgages. They have rent. They have all sort of costs that will  pile up. No matter what, they will bear a burden from the dysfunction  in a government shutdown, along with many other people in the country  who will see a disruption of Federal Government operations. They will  still bear an unfair burden.   I also want to thank our Republican colleagues for agreeing with this  in a unanimous consent request. What we are doing today is to say to  people, to hard-working Federal employees: Rest assured that after that  difficult period goes by, if there is a shutdown, you will be assured  and you will have the certainty that you are going to be able to get  your pay and make those payments to make sure that you don't fall  further behind.   It is the least we can do at this moment. Let's hope we don't have to  use this provision that we are passing in the Senate today, but it is  an important insurance policy, an important security blanket as the  hours tick by and we are not sure whether or not we will have an  agreement by midnight this evening.   I want to thank our colleagues, and I want to yield back to the  senior Senator from Maryland for the purposes of making the motion.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maryland  and the body and now urge the House of Representatives to take this up  immediately. This has now passed the U.S. Senate, and they now have an  opportunity to pass this over in the House, and I would urge them to do  it this evening or as soon as possible so that we can provide certainty  and confidence to hard-working Federal employees.   Again, we want to avoid a shutdown, but we need to provide an  insurance policy in the event that it does shut down.    Madam President, I wish to recognize an excellent  [[Page S8015]]  former member of my staff, Ian Jannetta, who is leaving Capitol Hill  after 8 years of service. Having worked for his home State Senator  Casey of Pennsylvania, on the Joint Economic Committee, as part of my  team in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and  finally with Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota, Ian has many friends on  Capitol Hill and will be missed.   During his time in my office, Ian never hesitated to roll up his  sleeves and get the job done. He worked tirelessly on issues ranging  from providing equal rights for all people, protecting our environment  and the Chesapeake Bay, to building an economy that works for all  Americans. His strong communications skills, coupled with his kindness,  calm presence, and sense of humor, served my team and the people of  Maryland well for over 4 years.   As Ian tackles his next project at the Washington Metropolitan Area  Transit Authority, he continues his commitment to public service, a  proud tradition set by his mother Heather and his father David, who  both started their careers in the U.S. Air Force and continued their  service in State government. I know he will make a tremendous impact. I  join his many colleagues, friends, and family to wish him well, and I  look forward to hearing about the extraordinary work he does next.                            ____________________
