 Madam Speaker, the President and Members of Congress  each take an oath to uphold the Constitution. When the President abuses  his Presidential power to upend the constitutional order, we have an  obligation to live up to our oath of office.   We have been presented with direct evidence about the President's  actions. They threaten our national security and undermine the  integrity of the next election. We now vote on Articles of Impeachment  for abuse of power and contempt of Congress as a result of that  evidence.   I have worked on Presidential impeachments as part of the Committee  on the Judiciary twice before. This third time brings me no joy.   President Nixon attempted to corrupt elections. His agents broke into  the Democratic Party headquarters to get a leg up on the election, and  then, just like President Trump, he tried to cover it up. Then, he  resigned. This is even worse.   President Trump not only abused his power to help his reelection, he  used a foreign government to do it. He used military aid provided to  fight the Russians as leverage solely to benefit his own political  campaign.   George Washington would be astonished since he warned ``against the  insidious wiles of foreign influence.''   The direct evidence is damning. The President hasn't offered any  evidence to the contrary. These actions constitute grounds for  Presidential impeachment.   What is before us is a serious abuse of power and obstruction of  Congress. These abuses strike at the heart of our Constitution.   The President's unconstitutional abuse of power, a high crime and  misdemeanor, is ongoing. He totally refused to provide any information  to Congress related to the impeachment inquiry.    It is our responsibility to use the tool our Founders gave us in the  Constitution to preserve the constitutional order. We must impeach.
