 Madam President.    I object.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the  Senate Resolution that is at the desk, expressing the sense of the  Senate that efforts to create a one-size-fits-all government-run  healthcare system referred to as ``Medicare for All'' should be  rejected.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I would just point out that what my  friend and colleague from Hawaii described as a distraction is one of  the key points of the Democratic Party.   Medicare for All, as they call it, is part of the so-called Green New  Deal, which would bankrupt the country, which is unaffordable,  unworkable. The fact is, this Medicare for All proposal, which so many  of the Democrats have signed on to, would cost a minimum of $33  trillion and maybe a lot higher after what we have heard from the  Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, as to the things he wants to do  going beyond just Medicare for All.   We know that taxes would increase significantly under their proposal.  We know that for Americans who have health insurance right now through  their work, over 150 million Americans would lose that. We know that  for people on Medicare, it would make their ability to use Medicare  much harder. Then, of course, there would be the issue of rationing for  care--the lines and the time to wait.   There was an article in the New York Times, an opinion piece by David  Brooks, on Friday, talking about why the so-called Medicare for All  will not work, and it made reference to healthcare in Canada.   I would say to the Presiding Officer that as a Senator who is also a  surgeon, I operated on people from Canada in my practice prior to  becoming a U.S. Senator and while practicing in Wyoming. People in  Canada--where the healthcare is paid for by taxes but is free--I have  taken care of people who couldn't afford to wait the amount of time it  would take to get their free operation.   The article in the New York Times on Friday made reference to the  fact that the waiting times are so long that after you are actually  seen by the primary care provider in Canada, the wait time to get to  see an orthopedic surgeon is 9 months--9 months. The Democrats are  proposing something that has given the people of Canada a waiting time  of 9 months.   So what we see under this Medicare for All proposal--and I have just  introduced today this Senate resolution saying that Medicare for All  should be rejected, and there should also be a rejection of the tax  increases, the loss of choice, and the long lines that will come from  this Democrat-sponsored proposal for Medicare for All.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I recognize the  distinguished career of Harry C. LaBonde, Jr., who, following decades  of service in the State of Wyoming, is retiring this week.   Harry began his career shortly after graduating from college with a  civil engineering degree. His first job allowed him to specialize on  issues related to water and wastewater treatment. In 1991, he became  the public works director for the city of Riverton. He went on to serve  in the same position for the city of Laramie, until he later became  city manager. For the past 15 years, Harry worked for the State of  Wyoming, first as Wyoming's Deputy State Engineer and, more recently,  as director of the Wyoming Water Development Office.   When at the State Engineer's office, Harry was involved with  addressing a backlog of coal-bed methane reservoir permits in the  Powder River Basin and transitioning the office from paper to  electronic records, which required the modernization of millions of  documents related to water and permits.  [[Page S1790]]  Wyoming was also facing severe water shortages due to an extended  period of drought, requiring Harry to make the difficult decisions  resulting from those shortages.   As director, Harry was instrumental in carrying out key  responsibilities of Wyoming's Water Development Office: developing  Wyoming's water resources through sound water planning and use. Water  is a precious resource in the west. It is key to maintaining an  excellent quality of life, economic security, and growth. Through  Harry's leadership, numerous water storage projects are underway in the  State, which will help Wyoming realize its water storage potential for  today and to serve communities tomorrow. Whether it is through the  reconstruction of the Middle Piney Dam or the storage enhancement  project at Fontenelle Reservoir, Harry understands the importance of  securing water resources in the State for future Wyoming generations.   In addition to reservoir planning and construction, Harry oversaw the  development of river basin plans, weather modification projects,  addressing watershed threats from wildfires, and carrying out the Small  Water Project Program. Water affects everyone. Making sure Wyoming's  water resources are used efficiently and responsibly for the benefit of  the people of Wyoming is a responsibility Harry takes very seriously.   Harry's expertise and the strong relationships he has fostered  throughout the basins we share with neighboring States is invaluable.  He has contributed to a number of regional water supply efforts,  including the Colorado River Basin States Salinity Control Program. He  also serves as Wyoming's representative on the Platte River Recovery  Implementation Program, a cooperative agreement with Nebraska,  Colorado, and the Federal Government, to maintain water usage and  development by implementing conservation practices for certain  endangered and threatened fish and birds.   We are fortunate Harry chose early in his professional life to use  his skills and talents to focus on water. He has dedicated his career  to being a water advocate for the people of Wyoming and to finding  long-term solutions to securing Wyoming's water needs. We are all  better for his efforts.   I invite all members of the Senate to join me in congratulating Harry  on his retirement, and wishing both him and his family much happiness  and success in the future.                            ____________________
