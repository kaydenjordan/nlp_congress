 I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for       the impeachment of the President of the United States of       America.         If we don't impeach this President, he       will get reelected.         If we don't impeach this President, he       will get reelected.    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. The goal is to eliminate a political opponent, to  substitute their judgment for the will of the voters.   Members of the Senate, our country needs to get back to work. I know  that you know that, but, instead, we are here. The majority party  promised to unify and deliver more COVID relief, but, instead, they did  this. We will not take most of our time today--us of the defense--in  the hopes that you will take back these hours and use them to get  delivery of COVID relief to the American people.   Let us be clear. This trial is about far more than President Trump.  It is about  [[Page S682]]  silencing and banning the speech the majority does not agree with. It  is about canceling 75 million Trump voters and criminalizing political  viewpoints.   That is what this trial is really about. It is the only existential  issue before us. It asks for constitutional cancel culture to take over  in the United States Senate.   Are we going to allow canceling and banning and silencing to be  sanctioned in this body?   To the Democrats, who view this as a moment of opportunity, I urge  you instead to look to the principles of free expression and free  speech. I hope, truly, that the next time you are in the minority, you  don't find yourself in this position.   To the Republicans in this Chamber, I ask when you are next in the  majority, please resist what will be an overwhelming temptation to do  this very same thing to the opposing party.   Members of the Senate, this concludes the formal defense of the 45th  President of the United States to the Impeachment Article filed by the  House of Representatives.   I understand that there is a procedure in place for questions, and we  await them; thereafter, we will close on behalf of President Trump.   Mr. President, we yield the balance of our time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.                            ____________________
