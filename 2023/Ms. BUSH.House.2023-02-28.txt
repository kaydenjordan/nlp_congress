 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, St. Louis, House Democrats, and I rise today to strongly  oppose H.R. 347, the Reduce Exacerbated Inflation Negatively Impacting  the Nation Act.   While Democrats passed numerous laws last Congress that are  successfully reducing inflation every month, House Republicans have  come up with nothing more than a study in response. This is  unbelievable.   The substance and process of this bill amount to nothing more than  political theater to distract from and undermine the immense successes  of congressional Democrats and the Biden administration.                                time  1730    If Republicans were serious about fighting inflation and cutting  costs for regular, everyday people, they would have joined with  Democrats to pass critical legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act  to rebuild American manufacturing and lower the cost of prescription  drugs, healthcare, energy, and other goods and services for the people  of our country rather than pushing an extreme MAGA messaging bill that  accomplishes nothing. Nothing. Not a thing.   The global spike in inflation has been caused by food and fuel  disruptions resulting from the illegal and unprovoked Russian invasion  of Ukraine, as well as auto part supply shortages connected to the  COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence that government spending or  executive orders by President Biden have increased inflation.   The President and congressional Democrats have taken steps to enact  policies; not studies, not reports, but actual, tangible policies and  dollars delivered to our communities to lower costs for regular,  everyday people. Yet, we understand that still much more work remains.   For over 20 years, while I was a single mother of 2, I experienced  countless times what it was like to see costs rise faster than my  wages. I know what it is like to have to choose between paying the  electric bill or paying rent.   I remember thinking to myself, who is it that is fighting for me and  for other people in my situation?   Lawmakers in Congress can help alleviate that pain. Lawmakers in  Congress can prioritize enacting policies to raise wages and lower  costs, and that is what congressional Democrats have done.   For so many people in my community of St. Louis and around the  country, skyrocketing rents and high utility costs are consistent  barriers to  [[Page H943]]  keeping families safe and fed, and that is a moral and policy failure.   We have seen how people's lives improved when the Federal Government  stepped up to enact a moratorium on evictions or sent urgently needed  stimulus checks to families or expanded the child tax credit or capped  insulin at $35 a month.   Those are the actions that saved lives. That is what we need, and we  need more of that now. Yet, here we have a report.   However, what my House Republican colleagues have demonstrated this  Congress and what they are demonstrating here today with this bill is  that they are not serious about governing. They have circumvented  regular order to bring this hollow bill to a vote on the House floor.  Even as people continue to suffer the consequences of inflation and  flawed responses that exacerbate unemployment, corporations, especially  in the energy industry, have capitalized on this crisis to raise prices  for everyday people and for families.   Last year, Exxon made $56 billion in profits, using inflation as a  cover to fleece regular, everyday people just trying to get to medical  appointments or to school.   I oppose this bill because I am aware of what it is. It is a  distraction from our work for our constituents. It is a waste of  government resources, and it is a squandering of time that we should be  using to rein in corporate greed and support those of our neighbors who  need our help the most. I oppose this bill because it isn't a  meaningful way to legislate. It is a political stunt.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the ranking member of the Oversight Committee,    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, over the past 2 years, through the Inflation Reduction  Act, the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, and other successes, Democrats and President Biden have made  historic investments in public transit, renewable energy, healthcare,  and economic stability.    We have created jobs. We have advanced justice. We have advanced  equity. We have reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and we have slowed  down inflation.   We put hundreds of dollars in people's pockets. We capped the price  of insulin. We invested in people.   As a result, when adjusted for inflation, wages have risen for so  many families over the last 7 months, and unemployment remains at its  lowest level since 1969.   However, we need to do so much more. Many of our neighbors,  particularly those with the greatest need, are suffering from the  consequences of high costs across the board.   I am glad House Democrats controlled the House during the pandemic.  This bill makes a mockery of people living in poverty who need  meaningful relief.   The Republicans' big idea, the big plan that we have been told about  and waiting on is to write a flawed bill that mandates--guess what-- more paperwork. Give me a break, as my ranking member just said.   I know what it is like to be at risk of eviction. I know what it is  like to be hungry. I know what it is like to be cold, so cold that you  don't know if you will survive the nights.   Never one time when I was living out of my car with my two babies did  I ask for a report from Congress for help. I needed diapers. I needed  food. You can't eat a report.   If this bill was to move forward, no one will be saying, I am so glad  I used this report to pay the rent. Let me take shelter with this  report because Congress did their job.   Let's take real care, real actual care of the people. I oppose this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
