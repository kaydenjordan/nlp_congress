 Mr. Speaker, February 1, 2003, was intended to be a day of  celebration to welcome back home seven brave men and women from their  mission to space.   Instead, that day of intended celebration turned quickly to tragedy  when Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over east Texas upon reentry,  an event captured on camera by local medical doctor, Scott Lieberman.   I rise today to honor those seven individuals who lost their lives in  pursuit of space exploration and to commend my fellow east Texans who  participated in the recovery efforts that followed.   I am proud to represent east Texans, who in the face of tragedy do  not hesitate to spring into action, whatever the cause and whatever the  need.   Please join me in honoring those astronauts who lost their lives 20  years ago: Rick Husband, William McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana  Chawla, David Brown, Laurel Clark, and Ilan Ramon.   We pray for their loved ones and remember with sympathy all impacted  by this disaster.                            ____________________
