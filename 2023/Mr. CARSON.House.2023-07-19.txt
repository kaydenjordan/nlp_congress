 Mr. Chair, I commend Chairman Graves and Ranking Member  Larson for their hard work to bring this bipartisan FAA Reauthorization  bill to the House floor.   I am very pleased that this bill includes some of my top priorities:   1. Implementation of my 2018 provisions requiring Secondary Cockpit  Barriers in Section 522 of the bill. This language will be made even  stronger with the passage of the Fitzpatrick/Carson amendment to speed  up the process and finally get these safety devices on all passenger  aircraft.   2. Including my bipartisan bill, the National Center for the  Advancement of Aviation in Sections 303, 264 and 308.   3. Improving minority and disadvantage business participation in all  FAA programs, in Sections 426 and 302.   I'm also appreciative of Chairman Graves' willingness to work with me  to improve Section 813 of the bill which changes the current rules  addressing Temporary Flight Restrictions. We had a lengthy colloquy  during our markup about unintended consequences of Section 813. I  remain concerned about the provisions in Section 813, which appear to  change current law and weaken Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs).  This is especially important to my district in Indianapolis, which has  benefited from the safety of Temporary Flight Restrictions to protect  NFL and NCAA Division 1 games, plus major Motor Speedway events like  the Indy 500 over the last 20 years.   Since the 9/11 terrorists attacks, FAA imposed TFRs over stadiums and  other locations. Subsequently, FAA began to issue some waivers, but  Congress imposed a statutory restrictions to maintain the safety of  major events, especially sporting events with high-capacity stadiums.  In this year's bill, we must make sure the language in Section 813 does  not have unintended consequences of undermining the safety at large  public gatherings, like major sporting events. This includes strong  collaboration with law enforcement and public safety officials to  resolve any conflicts with competing events that may require Temporary  Flight Restrictions.   I believe we can further improve the language and utilize a simpler  collaboration model that will be effective and timely.   I would like to include in the Record the following letter from a  coalition of sports organizations and the Statement of Administration  Policy which details concerns with the underlying language. I look  forward to continuing to work with Chairman Graves and Ranking Member  Larson to improve this language.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 3935--securing growth and robust leadership in american aviation                                    act         The Administration supports enactment of a Federal Aviation       Administration        (FAA) reauthorization bill and applauds the bipartisan work       of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The       Administration is focused on ensuring that the aviation       sector works well for the American people, and reauthorizing       the FAA in a timely manner will help achieve that goal. H.R.       3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American       Aviation Act, would enhance aviation safety; invest in, and       improve on-the-job safety for, our aviation workforce;       integrate into the national airspace system new entrants such       as Advanced Air Mobility and Commercial Space operators;       strengthen passenger rights; and improve our aviation       infrastructure.        The Administration looks forward to working with the       Congress to address the Administration's concerns with this       legislation, a number of which are outlined below.        Protection of Aviation Consumer Rights and Promotion of       Competition. The Administration is strongly committed to       protecting the rights of aviation consumers and promoting       competition in the aviation industry. The Administration       opposes provisions in the bill that would reverse important       gains made by this Administration to combat junk fees in the       airline industry and would eliminate longstanding consumer       protections. The Administration believes that the disclosure       requirements currently in place for passenger tickets are       necessary to help consumers comparison shop for a ticket. The       Administration encourages the Congress to include the       Administration's proposals to expand consumer protections by       banning family seating junk fees, requiring up-front       disclosure of add-on fees, and requiring automatic refunds       and additional compensation for controllable flight       cancellations and delays. The Administration further supports       opening up airport gate access and preventing anticompetitive       practices that block new entrants.        International Commitments. While the Administration       appreciates the language aimed at ensuring continued U.S.       implementation of Open Skies agreements while promoting labor       standards for U.S.-based aviation sector workers, the       Administration also urges the Congress to add provisions to       implement U.S. international commitments and ensure our       aviation partners follow suit. The bill should be amended to       include provisions for U.S. implementation of global       marketbased measures of the International Civil Aviation       Organization, and to establish U.S. leadership relating to       the understanding and mitigation of the non-Greenhouse Gas       climate impacts of aviation.        Agency Restructuring. While the Administration supports the       goal of improving the efficiency of the organizational       structure of the FAA, it does not support the proposed       changes in FAA rulemaking review and the weakening of the       Administrator's ability and authority to determine the       appropriate size and allocation of the air traffic controller       workforce. The Administration also has concerns with       provisions that would make fundamental changes to the       agency's structure, eroding the discretion of the       Administrator to manage the agency in the most efficient       manner.        Implementation Timelines and Program Changes. The       legislation includes multiple rulemakings, reviews, reports,       and other requirements with aggressive timelines, along with       the creation of numerous programs that are not conditioned on       the availability of appropriations. The Administration is       also concerned that proposed major structural changes to       airport infrastructure programs are untested, and may be       difficult to implement depending on the level of resources       made available. The bill would also reduce the amount of       competitive airport grant funding, which would reduce the F       AA's ability to address important safety and capacity issues.        Standards for Airport Service Workers. The Administration       urges the Congress to include provisions that will improve       job quality for, and therefore aid in the recruitment and       retention of, those who clean planes, handle baggage, assist       passengers who use wheelchairs, and provide other services       critical to safe, stable, and timely operations for aviation       customers.        Age Standards for Pilots. The bill includes a provision       that would raise the retirement age for pilots in commercial       operations. Making this change without doing research and       establishing any necessary policies would be outside the       international standard.        Maintaining Safe and Secure Airspace During Major Sports       Events. While the Administration supports the goal of       providing accessibility to and public use of the national       airspace, it is concerned that provisions proposed in the       bill could introduce unnecessary risks to those attending       major spotting events if the effectiveness of safety and       security buffers currently provided by temporary flight       restrictions were to be decreased. To the extent that the       proposed provisions are intended to accommodate airshows, the       Administration urges the Congress to consider alternative       methods to deconflict airshows and major sports events rather       than potentially put aviation operations in close proximity       to events attended by millions of Americans each year.                                   ____                                                      July 18, 2023.        Dear Members of Congress: We write to urge you to oppose       the weakening of a law that protects the millions of sports       fans and spectators who attend professional and collegiate       sporting events each year. The current statutory ban on       aircraft including unmanned aircraft systems (``UAS'') or       drones--flying over large stadium sporting events throughout       the country provides necessary safety and security       protections against real and potential threats.        We are deeply concerned about section 813 of the House       version of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'')       Reauthorization Act. If adopted, the language would establish       a broad and complex waiver program that would permit       countless aircraft to fly near and over stadiums during       games, putting millions of fans at risk, and unnecessarily       so. Congress wisely eliminated a similar waiver program back       in 2003, after discovering troubling and persistent failures,       gaps, and vulnerabilities in the process for conducting       background checks and issuing waivers.        The FAA first established flight restrictions over large       stadium sporting events immediately following the terrorist       attacks of September 11, 2001, in response to concerns about       terrorists using aircraft as weapons. Congress subsequently       twice codified and strengthened these restrictions,       providing specific criteria for aircraft operations       permitted within the flight restricted area. Section 813       would effectively eliminate the specific criteria and       replace it with an openended waiver program.  [[Page H3718]]         The long-standing, congressionally mandated flight       restriction enhances the safety and security of large stadium       events, while minimizing the disrnption to the National       Airspace System (``NAS''). Specifically, airspace over large       stadiums--with a seating capacity of 30,000 people or more       and where a NFL, MLB, and NCAA Division 1 football games or       major motor speedway events, such as NASCAR and INDYCAR       races, are taking place--is closed to all aircraft from one       hour before until one hour after a major sporting event. The       flight restrictions extend to three nautical miles from the       center of the stadium and from the surface to 3,000 feet       above the stadium. The flight restrictions do not apply to       authorized aircraft, such as Department of Defense, law       enforcement or air ambulance flight operations, or those in       contact with air traffic control for take offs and landings       at nearby airports, among others.        Having devoted substantial resources to secure our stadiums       on the ground, we regard the stadium flight restriction as       essential to safeguarding the airspace overhead. Moreover,       given the proliferation of UAS in our NAS, as well as the       continuing need to remain vigilant to other current and       emerging risks, the stadium flight restriction is as vital       now as ever to our national security and public safety. We       believe section 813 complicates the airspace over stadiums,       compromises public safety and security, and courts potential       disaster.        We, therefore, urge you to uphold current law and maintain       existing flight restrictions that protect the safety and       security of millions of fans who attend large stadium       sporting events every year.            Sincerely,      Cathy Lanier,        Chief Security Officer, National Football League.      David Thomas,        Vice President, Security and Ballpark Operations Major       League Baseball.
