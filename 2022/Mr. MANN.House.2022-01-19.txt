 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana  for hosting this today. There are a lot of things to talk about for a  year. We could talk about immigration. We could talk about inflation.  We could talk about crime. And we could talk about Afghanistan. The  list goes on and on.   But I want to talk for a little bit today about trade and  specifically our relationship with China.   I rise today to call the Biden administration to action regarding our  trade partnership, or lack thereof, with China.   China has proven to be a bad faith negotiator, and they are using the  United States as a doormat. Our country made a deal with China 2 years  ago on January 15, 2020, and China has failed to live up to their end  of the bargain by a long shot. As part of this deal, China committed to  importing $36 billion of U.S. agriculture products in 2020 and 2021  combined, but they have fallen short by nearly $7 billion. China sold  American farmers a bill of goods, and the Biden administration has made  no effort to rectify this egregious situation.   Now that phase one is expiring, farmers and ranchers are frustrated  to say the least. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, in a feeble effort to  reassure us, said:         Ambassador Tai, our U.S. Trade Representative, continues to       converse with China about the necessity of living up totally       and completely to the phase one trade agreement, making up       their deficit over the course of the next several years.    This is completely unacceptable. The next several years was never  part of this deal, which is not a complex one. China said that they  would purchase a certain amount of agricultural goods, and they have  fallen short by a margin that suggests that they never intended to live  up to their end of the deal in the first place.   Again, we have not seen any effort from this administration on behalf  of farmers, which is why I am standing here today to state the  obvious--the United States must either force China to comply with their  end of the agreement or punish them for failing to do so. That is how  deals work. At the very least, we need to see this administration  developing a new, comprehensive, realistic deal to collect the deficit.  The time for conversations already took place long before the deal was  signed January 15, 2020, when China signed the deal.   This administration at year end needs to step up and defend our  farmers, our ranchers, and our country from being financially  manipulated by China--yet another unnecessary crisis.
