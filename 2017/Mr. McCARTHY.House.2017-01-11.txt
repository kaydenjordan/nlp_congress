 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman for his work. I would also like to highlight a few  Members whose work is inside this bill. First, Congressman Marino,  Congressman Ratcliffe, Chairman Chabot, and Congressman Luetkemeyer  have all done a tremendous amount of work to make this bill here today,  and I appreciate that.    Mr. Chairman, we have a grave problem in our Federal Government. It  undermines our Constitution, it contradicts the will of the people, and  it is a deadweight on our economy destroying American jobs and costing  billions of dollars per year in paperwork and lost opportunities. I am  talking about the duplicative and unforgiving Federal bureaucratic  state.   But before I discuss the dangers that an overzealous bureaucracy  poses to our country, I want to be clear that the House has already  made great progress. We are engaged in a two-step approach: first, to  change the structure of Washington that deprives the people of their  power; and second, to repeal specific harmful regulations. We will get  started on the second part early next month.   We have already passed two bills last week to change Washington's  structure, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the REINS Act. Today, we  will pass the third, the Regulatory Accountability Act. This requires  agencies to choose the least costly option available to do what they  are charged to do and prohibits large rules from going into effect  while they are still being challenged in court. It also ends something  called Chevron deference where courts automatically bend to the  agency's interpretation of the rules. Under the current standard, that  means the agency will win almost every single time in the courtroom and  the people lose.   These three bills are about more than stopping bad regulations from  being made. They are about changing the process in Washington that  systemically prioritizes government over the  [[Page H329]]  common good instead of making government serve the common good.   Mr. Chairman, our Nation is based on a principle that power  ultimately comes from the people. Elections are the great foundation of  our Republic, and, as we saw so clearly this last November, through  them, the people can make their voices heard. But something has  changed. Some of the most significant decisions in Washington, those  that most affect the lives of the public, are made by those who don't  stand for election.   What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their  property rights, when the Department of Health and Human Services tries  to force nuns to violate their religion, or when the VA perpetuates a  system that lets veterans die while they wait for their care? The  people can't vote out bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or the  Department of Health and Human Services. They can't vote out bad  leaders of the VA.   These bureaucrats know it. They know they aren't accountable to the  people even as they exercise great power. Without elections, the people  lose. Washington is brimming with executive employees devoted to  preserving the status quo.   Then there is a revolving door of high-level Federal employees who  head to major consulting firms and lobbying arms to influence the very  agencies they came from. This breeds thousands of regulations that  further enrich the connected and powerful--sometimes at the great  expense of the average American.                                time  1415    It is our economy and the American workers who suffer the most.  Federal regulations written and enacted by these bureaucracies impose a  burden of about $1.89 trillion every year. That number is hard to make  sense of or to even imagine. It comes to, roughly, $15,000 per U.S.  household, or 10 percent of the American GDP.   The Obama administration alone has written regulations that require  over 583 million hours to comply with. That is an average of nearly 5  hours of paperwork for every single full-time employee in America. The  Federal Register is now the length of 80 King James Bibles.   When bureaucrats and agency heads cannot be held accountable and when  they keep their jobs regardless of corruption, incompetence, waste,  fraud, abuse, or the backroom deals they make with special interests,  that is the problem. That is the swamp, and we need to drain it.   There is a reason the House is restructuring Washington first. It is  that we made a commitment to the American people that we would drain  the swamp. Now we are today.
