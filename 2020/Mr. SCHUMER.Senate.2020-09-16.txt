Because of COVID-19, there will  likely be a historic increase in mail-in ballots.   Mail-in voting is a process that is well established in our country.  Several States have conducted elections this way for years without any  issue at all. Because of COVID-19, there may also be some delays in  determining the results of the election while every ballot is counted.  This, too, has happened before, but there is no doubt that this  election will be unique, and it means that leaders from both sides of  the aisle should be joining together now to ensure the integrity of the  election and the public's confidence in the result.   Sadly, there are some who are systematically undermining public  confidence in the voting process and irresponsibly fanning suspicions  and conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of election results. At  the top of the list here is, unfortunately, once again, the President  of the United States, who has exploited and capitalized on fears about  holding an election in the middle of COVID-19 to attack mail-in voting  and to advance comically false claims of widespread voter fraud. The  President has done both of those. He has attacked mail-in voting and  made these false claims of fraud.   We are talking about the integrity of our elections here. This is the  wellspring of our democracy. It is fundamental for our country,  something that American soldiers have fought and died for--and the  President trifles with it, and, of course, our Senate Republican  colleagues go along.   So, today, we are doing two things in this regard because we have a  responsibility to do everything we can to see that this election does  not mark the beginning of a new age when our election results are  doubted, conspiracy theories flourish, and our grand democracy is  tarnished around the world. If we allow this kind of malicious  tampering with the wellspring of our democracy in terms of people's  trust in it, it is the beginning of the end.   Donald Trump doesn't care. We know he only cares about himself. The  Senate Republicans don't say a peep. We know they are afraid of Donald  Trump. Even when they disagree with him, they remain quiet, and too  often they agree with him.   We cannot allow our people to lose faith in elections, and we must do  everything to ensure that they are conducted in a fair way that the  American people will accept, despite COVID and all the problems it  creates.   So, this morning, Senator Sanders and I have written a letter to the  Republican leader asking him to work with us to establish a special  bipartisan committee with equal representation from both parties to  guarantee the integrity of our election process.   The committee should focus on three issues: one, confirm the security  of and confidence in our mail-in systems, our vote-by-mail systems;  two, measures to ensure that every vote is counted; and three, discuss  and prepare for possible postelection scenarios.   The function of the committee would be to hold hearings about what is  being done around the country to make certain that our public  institutions are prepared to conduct a smooth and reliable election,  free from voter suppression and intimidation, that every vote will be  counted and there will be confidence in the outcome.   Senator Sanders and I and many in our caucus--including Senator  Klobuchar, whom I will mention in a minute--feel very, very strongly  that we have to do something, and this bipartisan committee can ensure  the American people that the Senate is on top of this.   We hope the Republican leader will accept our request. We hope he  will not run away from his responsibility to ensure there are fair  elections. We hope that he will not go along with Donald Trump's  dangerous rhetoric about the fairness of our elections.   Later today, the Senator from Minnesota and ranking member of the  Rules Committee, Senator Klobuchar, and I will be speaking with a  bipartisan group of secretaries of state. We will be getting a briefing  on the state of our election preparedness around the country. I expect  they will reiterate their call for another major priority being blocked  by Senate Republicans: election assistance funding.   I am hopeful we can still find agreement on a bipartisan basis to  help our States with critical funding to prepare for this historic  election. This issue is above partisan politics. It is the essence of  our democracy. It is disgraceful that Republicans are playing games  with this--perhaps for electoral advantage, perhaps for fear of  President Trump--but we will not let it happen.   We, as a caucus, repeat to the American people: The best way to  prevent an election from being manipulated or stolen is to vote. The  more people who vote and the earlier they vote, when they can vote  early, the better off our democracy will be    Mr. President, this morning the Republican majority of  the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee authorized  another smattering of subpoenas in what seems to be an ongoing effort  to disparage a former Vice President and his family.   While the rest of the country is busy fighting COVID-19, this is what  the Homeland Security Committee has been up to--using the powers of the  Senate to, in effect, conduct opposition research for President Trump's  campaign.   The Republican chairman has said he plans to release a report about  it next week--merely a month before election day. There is a dark  similarity here to the Republican effort in the House in the previous  election to discredit the Democratic Presidential candidate with the  Select Committee on Benghazi.   You may remember the now-minority leader of the House Republican  caucus bragging that the Republicans created the committee to bring  down Hillary's poll numbers. You know what they say about a political  gaffe: It is when politicians tell the truth.   Well, it seems like the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee has made the same gaffe that  Minority Leader McCarthy made in 2016. In a little-noticed interview  with a Wisconsin radio station last month, Senator Johnson said that  his probe would ``help Donald Trump win reelection,'' and yet somehow  the current activities of the Republican majority in the Homeland  Security committee are even worse than what the House Republicans did  in 2016, because in the rush to find scraps of information for these  investigations, Senate Republicans may have collected and propagated  disinformation that came from Putin's intelligence agents.   Some of the allegations that the Homeland Security chairman is now  pursuing are the same ones pushed by Andriy Derkach, a known Russian  agent who was sanctioned by President Trump's own Treasury Department  for interfering in our elections.   Powerful Senate Republicans are echoing the same claims that the  Russians are pushing, the same nonsense that Ukraine interfered in the  2016 elections and not just Putin.   We have all become so inured to scandal during this scandalous  administration, but the fact that a powerful Senate committee may have  fallen victim to misinformation from Moscow is appalling.    I will yield.    I am aware of it. Everything I have stated here is  factual--everything, every single thing.   So, this afternoon, my colleagues and I have drafted a simple  resolution that calls for the cessation of any Senate investigation or  activity that allows the U.S. Congress to act as a conduit for Russian  disinformation.   I cannot fathom how any Member of this Chamber could justify blocking  such a resolution. There must not be a single aspect of this Chamber  that wittingly or unwittingly furthers the propaganda machine of  Vladimir Putin.   Now, I know what my friend from Wisconsin might say. He will deny  receiving information from the particular Russian agent that I have  mentioned, Mr. Derkach, but Chairman Johnson has never provided a full  accounting of all the Russian- and Ukrainian-linked individuals he  sought information from. One of the chairman's subpoenas, for example,  targeted a Ukrainian national who is an associate of Mr. Derkach.   So anticipating his objection to this resolution, I would simply ask  the chairman to provide a full accounting of whom he sought information  from, so we can know who they are, what their motives are, and,  therefore, the Senate can see if they are trying to interfere with our  elections.   The chairman should have no issue furthering a complete accounting of  his contacts with Russian and Ukrainian sources. The American people  ought to know whether the U.S. Senate has been sullied by potentially  receiving information from discredited Russian agents. The American  people should expect the Senate to pass this resolution today.   What were our Founding Fathers most worried about? One of the top  things--top things--was interference by foreign powers in our  elections. Back then, their concerns were about bribery or treason or a  foreign actor who infiltrated our government. Today, in our information  age, the methods of foreign interference are different, but the risks  are the same.   Our chief adversaries--Russia, China, Iran, North Korea--have found  that disinformation and misinformation are a weak point in open  societies like ours. That makes it incumbent on us--all of us--here in  the Congress to be careful about the information we receive and repeat.   In the zeal for partisan advantage, we hope the Republican majority  on the Homeland Security Committee has not become a sympathetic  audience and a potential entrance point to foreign influence campaigns,  wittingly or unwittingly. What a disastrous and disgraceful state of  affairs. The Senate should pass this resolution today.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon.
