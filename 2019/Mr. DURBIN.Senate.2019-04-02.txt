 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the  floor for no more than 15 minutes.    Mr. President, there is an issue coming up before the  Senate this week which really goes to the heart of this institution and  why it exists. The Constitution spells out responsibilities for  Congress and specific responsibilities when it comes to this Chamber.  The 100 men and women who serve today, among other things, have a  responsibility to advise and consent on nominations that have been sent  by the President for our consideration. The Constitution assigns the  Senate the role of questioning these nominees, of checking into their  backgrounds, and then of deciding whether to approve or disapprove  their nominations.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen many of the guardrails in this  process disappear. For example, the Republican majority has stopped  respecting blue slips on circuit court nominations. Blue slips, which  are a Senate tradition, say that if a person is nominated to serve on  the circuit court, which is the second highest court in the land, the  Senators from the State within which that person would serve would  decide with a thumbs up or a thumbs down as to whether the nomination  will go forward--the so-called blue slip. For a number of years now,  that has been the U.S. Senate's standard practice, its tradition. The  Republican majority has decided to stop the blue-slip process when it  comes to circuit court nominations.   It also has stopped moving bipartisan board and commission  nominations in pairs. We used to say: We have a more trusting  relationship if you get your Republican nominee and if we get our  Democratic nominee. Let's do it together. That used to ensure that both  parties would be equally represented on important Agencies, such as the  Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board,  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to name a few.         Now we have a rules change before us that is being proposed       by the Republican side of the aisle--again changing the       rights of Senators by limiting the debate time on       nominations. This would further tilt the balance of power       away from the Senate, away from Congress, and back towards       1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Executive. It runs the risk, of       course, of diminishing our constitutional responsibility.    When it comes to executive branch nominations, this administration  has had a different approach than what we have seen before. We have a  President who says he likes to have administration officials serve in  an acting capacity.   In January, President Trump said:         I sort of like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you       understand that? I like acting.    Given that approach, perhaps it is no surprise that we have seen long  delays in filling leadership positions in important Agencies and  ambassadorial posts. We have also seen the highest rate of turnover in  modern time with these administration positions. People aren't placed  in these positions, and if they are, they are looking for the exit way  too soon.   We also have suffered from a lack of proper vetting and examination  of a person's background before a nomination is approved, and we have  seen a lack of bipartisan cooperation in moving board nominations when  there is supposed to be an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.  Despite that, we are trying to do the work we were assigned by the  Constitution to advise and consent.   If the majority wants to move Executive nominations faster, it can do  what all administrations have done in the past and start working with  the minority to negotiate packages of nominees. As long as I have been  here, that has been done by the leaders of both political parties-- fair, bipartisan packages of Executive nominees who have been well  vetted. None of us wants the embarrassment of putting a person in the  position for which one is not qualified or when there is any question  of one's ethical standards. That bipartisan  [[Page S2176]]  work can lead to less debate time on the floor if we agree at the  outset to work together.   I am particularly opposed to the Republican proposal before us to  shorten the time for debate on President Trump's nominees who will  serve lifetime appointments in Federal district court. Imagine serving  a lifetime appointment on a court--beyond this administration--and  making day-to-day decisions, some fundamental to the criminal justice  system and some to the civil justice system.   We understand what is really going on here. We understand when the  other side says we are obstructing it from confirming judges. The facts  don't tell the same story. In fact, my Republican colleagues have been  bragging for months about what Senator McConnell called the ``record  number'' of judges the Senate has confirmed under this new President  Trump.   In President Trump's first 2 years in office, the Senate confirmed 85  article III judges. During the first 2 years of President Obama's  Presidency, it was 62. Eighty-five to sixty-two. The number of judges  confirmed in the last Congress was nearly four times as many as the  number confirmed under President Obama in the previous Congress.   The pace of judicial nominations and confirmations has been extremely  fast. So why are the Republicans now pushing for a change to the Senate  rules to make it even faster? It is not like the Senate has been busy  with legislation here on the floor.   Senator McConnell had a moment of candor last November after the  election.   He said:         I think we'll have probably more time for nominations in       the next Congress than we've had in this one. . . . I don't       think we'll have any trouble finding time to do nominations.        Senator McConnell, McClatchy News, November 7, 2018.    Of course, Senator McConnell was frustrated that one Senator put a  blanket hold on judicial nominees at the end of last year, and he  expressed his frustration publicly. That Senator, incidentally, was not  a Democrat; he was Republican Senator Flake of Arizona.   It seems the real reason the Republicans want to change the rules now  on district court nominations is so, in the words of Senator McConnell,  they can ``plow right through'' with confirming nominees whose records  and views are incomplete or extreme.   The reality is that all too often, these judicial nominees just don't  stand up to scrutiny. Already, under President Trump, we have had six  judicial nominations in which the American Bar Association's peer- review process found these nominees sent by President Trump to be ``not  qualified.'' I might add that there were no--zero, none--``not  qualified'' nominees under President Obama.   Last year, two nominees, Thomas Farr and Ryan Bounds, were withdrawn  on the floor by the Republicans after the Senate had voted to move  forward on their nominations. Disclosures about their backgrounds led  Members even on the Republican side of the aisle to say they wouldn't  vote for them. They were withdrawn because information came to light  that caused these Senators to change their minds about confirming them  to lifetime appointments. That shows the importance of having some  time--30 hours currently--to debate these nominations and to make sure  that a lifetime appointment is not going to someone who is unqualified  or who shouldn't be in that position.   So who are the district court nominees for whom Senator McConnell  wants to change the rules so as to move them through more quickly? Let  me tell you about a few of them.   There is Texas district court nominee Michael Truncale, who called  President Obama an ``un-American impostor'' and described the Shelby  County case, when it came to voting rights, a ``victory.''   There is Nebraska nominee Brian Buescher, who ran for elected office  in 2014 and said: ``I will focus on fighting ObamaCare.''   There is Texas district court nominee Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has  repeatedly written in his personal capacity about his opposition to  LGBTQ rights and the Obergefell case.   There is Oklahoma district court nominee Patrick Wyrick, who is a  protege of disgraced former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's. He  allowed an energy company to ghost-write a letter from Pruitt's office  when he was Oklahoma's attorney general.   These are just a few. There are many other Trump judicial nominees  whose views are far outside the legal mainstream, and Republicans are  determined, with these rule changes, to speed up the process so we  don't ask questions.   I have to say it is stunning to listen to Republicans complain about  obstruction of judicial nominees after watching the unprecedented  Republican obstruction of nominees under President Obama.   Under Senator McConnell, Republicans would not even give an  appointment for an interview, let alone a hearing, to a well-qualified  Supreme Court nominee--Merrick Garland.   In 2013 Republicans pledged they would filibuster anyone who  President Obama nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the  second highest court in the land. No matter how qualified the nominee,  they pledged to block him or her because President Obama was making the  choice.   Republicans filibustered President Obama's judicial nominees 82 times  in the first 5 years. Under all Presidents before President Obama,  there had been a total of 86 judicial filibusters combined with all  Presidents. Under President Obama, in the first 5 years, there were 82,  and throughout history leading up to that, 86.   Now that the Republicans control the White House and the Senate, they  want to rip up the rules and change the traditions and guardrails on  the judicial nomination process on a regular basis.   They are pushing through nominees who have not been found qualified  by the American Bar Association. They are pushing through nominees over  the objection of home State Senators. They are pushing these nominees  without making sure that they have seen their complete records.   In the case of a North Carolina district court nominee, Thomas Farr,  his nomination was pulled when critical documents were finally  disclosed while his nomination was pending on the floor of the Senate.   It is no secret what is happening here. There is no emergency that  justifies changing the Senate rules. Senator McConnell himself admitted  the Senate has plenty of time to consider nominees. This is all about  avoiding close scrutiny for extreme ideological nominees that  Republicans want to pack onto the Federal courts for lifetime  appointments.   I oppose the rules change. Let's do our job when it comes to  conducting due diligence and providing informed advice and consent for  lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. It can be done.   I will tell you that in the first years of the Trump administration,  we have been able, by and large, to work out bipartisan agreement on  filling judicial vacancies in the State of Illinois, even at the  circuit court level, to the point where Senator Duckworth and I gave  blue-slip approval to circuit court nominees based out of our own  State, and to the point where we have reached a basic agreement when it  comes to filling the district court vacancies to this point. It has  been bipartisan all the way, and I believe we have found qualified  people. It took some time and some bipartisan cooperation, but we did.  It can be done. We didn't ask to have the rules changed in the Senate.  We used the existing rules to do our job under the Constitution.   All the issues we care about are impacted by these nominees in my  State and others. The Senate deserves to take the time to make sure we  get this right. We should not be putting men and women into lifetime  appointments without close scrutiny as required by our Constitution.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from New  Hampshire for being my ally in showing real leadership on this issue.   As a member of the HELP Committee, you will be sitting there in those  key hearings when we discuss the reauthorization of higher education.  That will be our opportunity to bring in some of these reforms that  make a difference in terms of this industry of for-profit colleges and  universities. I thank you for that, and I join you in this PROTECT  Students Act, as I have come to the floor so many times to talk about  this sector.   Most Americans don't know what we mean by for-profit colleges and  universities. Who are they? Well, some of the familiar names are the  University of Phoenix, DeVry University and others like it, which  portray themselves as institutes of higher education, and in  [[Page S2181]]  some respects, they bear similarity. Yet when it comes to the actual  performance of these schools, it is much different. Many families don't  know the difference.   I find in the city of Chicago, IL, that students--particularly when  they reach their junior and senior years--are inundated with all this  advertising on social media about for-profit colleges and universities.   I would say to Senator Hassan, there was a time in Washington before  she arrived where you could find television ads that showed a young  lady who appeared to be about 20 years old, in her pajamas, saying: I  am here in my pajamas going to college at a for-profit college and  university.   They tended to make it sound like it was a pretty easy formula. All  you needed to do was log on, and the next thing you knew, you had a  diploma, a certificate, and you were off for employment. That is not  the real-world of for-profit colleges and universities. The real world  is a much starker place.   I have often said that you can define this issue between for-profit  colleges and universities and non-profit and public universities and  colleges in America with two very simple numbers. This will be on the  final. The numbers are 9 and 34. For-profit colleges enroll 9 percent  of all postsecondary students. Nine percent go to for-profit schools.  Thirty-four percent of all Federal student loan defaults are students  from for-profit colleges and universities.   Nine percent of the students and 34 percent of the loan defaults.  What is going on here? The answer is very obvious, and it really tells  the story about for-profit colleges and universities.   They charge too much. All the surveys we looked at say their tuition  is higher than you might run into at a local community college or a  public university or a not-for-profit school. They charge too much  tuition.   Secondly, too many students drop out before they finish. They are in  so much debt, they can't continue.   Third, those who do finish and get a diploma find out it isn't worth  much. They don't really end up in a job where they can pay off their  student loans, so they stumble and fall despite their best efforts,  deep in debt from these for-profit colleges and universities. Along the  way, they learn something interesting: These credits they are  supposedly earning at the for-profit colleges and universities often  can't be transferred anywhere. No one recognizes them.   These students have been lured into something called a ``college'' or  ``university,'' lured into deep debt, and if they finish, they find  they have something that isn't worth a job in the future. Senator  Hassan and I are trying to protect these families and these students  from this type of exploitation.   We know and I think most Americans know that going to college can be  an expensive experience, but it can be a life-changing experience for  the better. If you pick the right school and get yourself a college  education, you will be in a better position, in most cases, when it  comes to your future life. Right now, we are finding that when it comes  to these schools, there is a much different outcome.   Throughout this higher education debate, you are going to hear a  common refrain from this industry. They often say that different types  of institutions of higher education shouldn't be treated differently  under the law, that everybody should play by the same rules. They go on  to say that any regulations or requirements that apply only to for- profit colleges discriminate on the basis of tax status.   Last week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos accused me of  discriminating based on tax status, for-profit versus nonprofit. I  couldn't care less, from my point of view, whether it is for-profit or  nonprofit; the question is, What are they giving to these students?  What are the students receiving for the money that is being paid?   In her final report to Congress, retired Department of Education  Inspector General Kathleen Tighe wrote: ``The [for-profit college]  sector continues to be a high-risk area for the department.'' She went  on to say that the industry's own practices and performances ``provide  a clear demonstration of the need for particular accountability.''   Let's start with the basics. As I said, 9 percent of the students; 34  percent of the student loan defaults. Students at for-profit colleges  graduate with an average debt of nearly $40,000; students at nonprofit  and public colleges and universities, $28,000. In 2014, more than half  of the top 25 schools whose students held the most cumulative student  loan debt were for-profit colleges. Eight of the top 10 students with  the most debt were for-profit colleges. The average cohort default rate  over 5 years at these eight colleges was 33 percent. Over 5 years, a  third of the students were going to default on their student loans.   The average, incidentally, for the two not-for-profit institutions in  the top ten was 6 percent. So, at the end of 5 years, one-third of the  students who graduated from for-profit schools in the top ten for  cumulative student debt had defaulted. For the students from the  nonprofit schools in the top ten for cumulative student debt, it was  only 6 percent. These for-profit schools are notorious for luring these  students and sometimes their families into debt, and then the students  can't find the jobs to pay off the debt.   A basic reminder: Of all of the debt you can incur in the United  States of America--think about it--that being for your home, your car,  your boat, whatever it happens to be--there is one category of debt you  can never discharge in bankruptcy: a student loan. You are going to  carry student loan debt with you for the rest of your life.   We have a case in which a grandmother literally cosigned a note so  her granddaughter could go to college, and the granddaughter defaulted  on the student loan. Guess what happened to the grandmother's Social  Security payment. The government came and took part of it in order to  pay off that student loan.   It never, ever goes away. It is a loan--a debt--for life. That is why  it is different. We can make a mistake on a home; we can lose a job or  have an illness in the family and default on a mortgage and have the  debt we owe discharged in bankruptcy, but it is not so when it comes to  student loans.   In a 2017 letter to Secretary DeVos and congressional leadership, 19  State attorneys general, led by then-Illinois Attorney General Lisa  Madigan, wrote: ``Over the past 15 years, millions of students have  been defrauded by unscrupulous for-profit postsecondary schools.''   These chief State law enforcement officers noted the specific risks  to students from the for-profit college sector.   The recent closures of so many of these schools have left these  students stranded. Imagine if your son or daughter were going to one of  these for-profit colleges or universities, and then it went out of  business. Would that mean you would have to pay off your student loan?  Technically, yes. In order to be relieved from your student loan, you  would have to submit a borrower defense claim to the U.S. Department of  Education.   How often do these schools fail? Let me read to you a list of some of  these for-profit colleges and universities that have gone failed:  Corinthian, ITT Tech, Education Corporation of America, Vatterott, and  Dream Center.   How many students who attended these schools were left high and dry  when the schools went out of business? There were 140,000 students. Of  the more than 218,000 borrowers who have sought discharges from the  Department of Education as a result of being defrauded by their  institutions, the vast majority have been students from for-profit  colleges.   The for-profit colleges promised them jobs that never materialized.  The for-profit colleges said: If you take the following course, you can  become a computer technician of some kind. It never happened. They were  defrauded by these schools. They signed up for the loans, and then the  schools went out of business. So here they are with the loans and no  jobs.   We have this borrower defense process by which the students can go  through the Federal Government to try to be relieved of their student  debt. Yet I can't understand this. The U.S. Department of Education is  not processing these students' borrower defense applications. When we  said to Secretary DeVos, ``Come on. Give these young kids a break.  Their lives are on hold until they figure out what has happened to  their student loan debt  [[Page S2182]]  from their for-profit schools,'' she hasn't gotten around to it, and we  have been waiting patiently for that to happen. I thank Senator Hassan  for putting a finger on it.   The people who are running this Department of Education are former  executives of these for-profit schools. So, it's no surprise.   So, no, Madam Secretary. Meeting our obligation as lawmakers to focus  accountability and protections where there is the greatest risk to  students and taxpayers is not discriminating based on tax status; it is  acknowledging reality.   The bill we are talking about today doesn't target for-profit  colleges, and it doesn't seek to put an end to for-profit education. It  is not a witch hunt or a liberal conspiracy; it is a response to the  objective risks to students and taxpayers that the for-profit college  industry represents today.   The PROTECT Students Act would close the 90/10 loophole.  Incidentally, can you imagine that these are so-called for-profit  colleges and universities and that they are the most heavily federally  subsidized businesses in America? We took a look around. We looked at  defense contractors and everything we could think of. The highest level  of Federal subsidy goes to this industry.   Imagine, a student signs up. The student may first qualify for a Pell  grant of $6,000. The for-profit college takes that Federal money in.  Then the student still owes some debt. They say: Well, you need a  government loan. So the student borrows from the government. At that  point, all we have seen across the table are Federal dollars that are  directly out of the Treasury. The student still carries the debt, but  the money to this so-called private business is all straight out of the  Federal Treasury--hardly a hearty example of capitalism at work.   The 90/10 rule was designed to prevent for-profit colleges from  depending on more than 90 percent of their revenue coming straight from  the Federal Treasury. It didn't work. Unfortunately, a loophole in the  law only counts the Department of Education's title IV funds as Federal  revenue while counting billions from the Department of Veterans  Affairs' GI bill and the Department of Defense tuition assistance as  non-Federal funds.   Here is what it means: If you are serving in our military and are  entitled to GI bill education benefits that are going to help pay for  your education, for-profit colleges have a financial incentive to  aggressively target and recruit you. It turns out they can take  virtually 100 percent of their revenue directly from the Treasury by  enrolling large numbers of students eligible for Federal benefits that  are not included in the 90/10 rule. We think that is wrong. We think  the 90/10 rule should count these veterans' benefits and other Federal  education benefits as Federal funds.   I see there are others on the floor, and I am not going to make this  any longer. I will bring it to a close because Senator Hassan has  covered the elements of this bill that I think are very important.   To my friends who serve with me in the U.S. Senate, here is what it  boils down to: Do we care about these students and their families? Are  we worried about the fact that 9 percent of the postsecondary students  end up at for-profit schools and account for over one-third of all  student loan defaults? Are we willing to hold these schools accountable  and every school accountable so they treat students fairly?   Are we willing to say, for example, the University of Illinois has a  relationship with its students who enroll? The University of Illinois  does not have a mandatory arbitration clause, but many for-profit  schools do. What does it mean? If you feel you have been mistreated by  the school, those at the school will sit down and decide your fate  through an arbitration process, which students virtually always lose.  Most schools don't do that to their students, but these schools look at  them as cash-paying customers, and that is how they treat them when it  comes to arbitration.   There are a lot of things we can do in this bill to protect the  students who are currently being exploited. What is more important than  making sure these students don't get off to a bad start in life but are  treated fairly and honestly and not exploited at the expense of their  families and the expense of American taxpayers?   I thank Senator Hassan for being the lead sponsor of this  legislation.   I yield the floor.
