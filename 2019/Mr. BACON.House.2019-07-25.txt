 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 25th  anniversary of Home Instead Senior Care.   Since 1994, when Lori and Paul Hogan founded Home Instead in Omaha,  Nebraska, it has provided personalized care, support, and education to  aging adults and their families.   Today, this network is the world's leading provider of in-home care  services for seniors, with more than 1,100 independently owned and  operated franchises that provide more than 75 million hours of care  throughout the United States and 12 international markets.   Home Instead Senior Care offices employ 75,000 caregivers worldwide  who provide basic support services that enable seniors to live safely  and comfortably in their own homes for as long as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the  dedicated men and women of Home Instead  [[Page H7387]]  Senior Care, who for 25 years have enhanced the lives of seniors and  their caregivers in the United States and throughout the world.                            ____________________
