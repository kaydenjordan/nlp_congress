 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8296.   First, I would like to say, as a physician, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle need to focus on what their bill really does.  Stop talking about ectopic pregnancies, which are a surgical emergency;  fetal demise, where, for unknown reasons, the fetus has passed away;  and miscarriages, which, clearly, in many cases, are surgical  emergencies and are tragic. That is not what this bill is about.   I have heard claims the bill only codifies provisions of the now- overturned Roe v. Wade decision. That is simply not true. H.R. 8296  would create a national standard to allow abortions at any time up  until birth.   As a practicing heart surgeon for 15 years prior to coming to  Congress, I operated on children in the neonatal intensive care unit as  young as 23 weeks gestation. Even at 650 grams, or 1.4 pounds, and  about 6 inches long, I saw life in my tiny patients' little bodies.   This abortion on demand until birth act bill doesn't only allow  abortions at any point in the pregnancy. It would also preempt and  repeal State laws that require informed consent, ultrasounds, or other  testing and counseling before undertaking an elective abortion.   The American people deserve to know the facts about what is really in  this bill. I find it troubling the supporters of this bill, most of  whom have never taken care of a patient, continue to mislead the  American people about what constitutes healthcare.
