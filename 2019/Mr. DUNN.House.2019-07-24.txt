 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local hero from  Jackson County, Florida.   Mr. Edd Sorenson is known internationally for his courageous and  skillful ability to rescue and retrieve cave divers. Just this past  March, he was called upon in the Dominican Republic to retrieve two  bodies that were on the brink of never being recovered due to the  dangerous conditions.   His most recent courageous rescue took place in Tennessee, where he  was called upon, in the middle of the night, to save the life of a  professional cave diver, Josh Bratchley, widely known as the man who  saved the Thai soccer team last year from their cave incident.   When Edd is not answering a call for the next cave rescue, you will  find him managing his cave diving business in Marianna, Florida, where  he is a cave dive instructor.   Edd is a truly remarkable individual. Mr. Speaker, please join me in  recognizing Mr. Edd Sorenson for his heroic and selfless actions that  have saved the lives of many and brought closure to families that,  otherwise, would never have been possible.                            ____________________
