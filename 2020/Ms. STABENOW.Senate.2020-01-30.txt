 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  [[Page S715]]    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Cortez  Masto, and Senator Rosen.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question for the House managers from Senators  Stabenow, Cortez Masto, and Rosen to both parties:         In June 2019, Ellen Weintraub, then-chair of the Federal       Election Commission, wrote in a statement that ``It is       illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive       anything of value from a foreign national in connection with       a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept. Electoral       intervention from foreign governments has been considered       unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation.'' In a 2007       advisory opinion, the FEC found that campaign contributions       from foreign nationals are prohibited in federal elections,       even if ``the value of these materials may be nominal or       difficult to ascertain.'' How valuable would a public       announcement of an investigation into the Bidens be for       President Trump's reelection campaign?    Begin with the White House Counsel.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  the question.   The idea that these investigations were a thing of value--something  that was specifically examined by the Department of Justice--as I  explained the other day, the inspector general for the intelligence  community wrote a cover letter on the whistleblower complaint, in which  he had actually exaggerated in the complaint--the idea that there was a  demand for some assistance with the President's reelection campaign.  That was forwarded to the Department of Justice. They examined it, and  they announced back in September that there was no election law  violation because it did not qualify as a thing of value. I think that  that issue has been thoroughly examined by the Department of Justice  here.   I just want to clarify one thing. The other day there was--yesterday  there was a question about information coming from overseas, and I was  asked a question about that. And I want to be very precise; that I  understood the question to be about was there a violation of a campaign  finance law, would there be one if someone simply got information from  overseas? And the answer is no, as a matter of law.   Think about this. If pure information--if information that came to  someone in a campaign could be called a thing of value, if it comes  from overseas, a thing of value is a prohibited campaign contribution;  it is not allowed. If it comes from within the country, it has to be  reported.   So that would mean that anytime a campaign got information from  within the country about an opponent or about something else that maybe  would be useful in the campaign, they would have to report the receipt  of information as a thing of value under the campaign finance laws.   That is not how the laws work, and there would be tremendous First  Amendment implications if someone attempted to enforce the laws that  way. So that is simply the point that I wanted to make.   Pure information that is credible information is not something that  is prohibited from being received under the campaign finance laws.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. How valuable would it be for the President to get  Ukraine to announce his investigations? And the answer is immensely  valuable. And if it wasn't going to be immensely valuable, why would  the President go to such lengths to make it happen? Why would he be  willing to violate the law, the Impoundment Control Act; why would he  be willing to ignore the advice of all of his national security  professionals; why would he be willing to withhold hundreds of millions  of dollars from an ally at war if he didn't think it was going to  really benefit his campaign? You have only to look at the President's  actions to determine just how valuable he believed it would be to him.   Now, how would he make use of this? Well, if we look in the past, we  get a perfect illustration of how Donald Trump would have made use of  this political help from Ukraine.   Let's look at 2016, when the Russians hacked the DCCC and the DNC,  and they started dripping out these documents through WikiLeaks and  other Russian platforms.   What did the President do? Did he make use of it? Did he condemn it?  Oh, he made beautiful use of it. Over 100 times in the last 3 months of  the campaign, the President brought up time after time after time,  rally after rally after rally, the Clinton Russian stolen documents.   We have had a debate since then. What was the impact of the Russian  interference in 2016? In an election that close, was it decisive? No  one will ever know. Was it valuable? You only have to look at Donald  Trump's actions to know just how valuable he thought it was. He thought  it was immensely valuable.   And you can darn well expect that if he had gotten this help from  Ukraine, he would be out there every day talking about how Ukraine was  investigating Joe Biden, and Ukraine is conducting an investigation  into Joe Biden. It would be proof of his argument against his feared  opponent.   You are darn right it would be valuable. What is more, it is illegal.  And do we have to go through all the turmoil of the Russian  interference perhaps to have the President do it all over again?   One of the things I found so significant was the day after Bob  Mueller reached his conclusion that this President was back on the  phone asking yet another country to help cheat in another election. You  are darn right that would have been valuable.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
