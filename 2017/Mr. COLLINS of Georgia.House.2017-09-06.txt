 Mr. Chairman, I have become increasingly  aware of the problem with hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.   Research shows millions of people suffer from this condition and that  60,000 hospital patients a year die because of this painful ailment.  Eleven percent of those affected are our veterans.   Their suffering is tremendous, and the cost of this condition to our  health system could be as high as $25 billion. However, with proper  commonsense prevention and better management of these infections, the  number of those suffering and the cost of treatment can be greatly  reduced.   I have reached out to CMS about doing a pilot program that promotes  better prevention and management methods, and I have discussed the  problem with innovative Georgia companies. I rise today to make other  Members aware of this issue and ask for your continued support in this  process.    As always, the gentleman is gracious, and I  do appreciate it. Mr. Chairman, I will work with the administration.
