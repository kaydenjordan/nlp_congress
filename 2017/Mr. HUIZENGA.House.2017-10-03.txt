 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1624) to require the appropriate Federal banking agencies to  treat certain municipal obligations as level 2A liquid assets, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1624         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Municipal Finance Support       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 18 of the Federal Deposit       Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828) is amended--        (1) by moving subsection (z) so that it appears after       subsection (y); and        (2) by adding at the end the following:  [[Page H7705]]         ``(aa) Treatment of Certain Municipal Obligations.--        ``(1) In general.--For purposes of the final rule titled       `Liquidity Coverage Ratio: Liquidity Risk Measurement       Standards; Final Rule' (79 Fed. Reg. 61439; published October       10, 2014) (the `Final Rule') and any other regulation which       incorporates a definition of the term `high-quality liquid       asset', the appropriate Federal banking agencies shall treat       a municipal obligation that is both liquid and readily       marketable (as defined in the Final Rule) and investment       grade as of the calculation date as a high-quality liquid       asset that is no lower than a level 2B liquid asset.        ``(2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:        ``(A) Investment grade.--With respect to an obligation, the       term `investment grade' has the meaning given that term under       part 1 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations.        ``(B) Municipal obligation.--The term `municipal       obligation' means an obligation of a State or any political       subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of a       State or any political subdivision thereof.''.

Reg. 61439; published October 10, 2014) to implement the       amendments made by this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of much-needed legislation that  would simply fix a 2014 rule by financial regulators and allow  municipal bonds to be considered as level 2B liquid assets, at a  minimum, for purposes of calculating total high-quality liquid assets,  or HQLAs, under the liquidity coverage ratio. The Municipal Finance  Support Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation that passed  unanimously out of committee, showing its clear need.   Municipal securities are frequently issued by the transportation,  housing, and healthcare authorities of State and local governments to  raise funds to pay for projects ranging from bridges and schools to  hospitals and recreational facilities. Excluding municipal securities  from treatment as HQLAs will result in higher borrowing costs for State  and local governments during times of economic stress.   Furthermore, there is no reason why high-quality liquid bonds issued  by the United States and municipalities should receive a lower standing  than foreign sovereign debt with equivalent or, frankly, even lesser  credit quality and market liquidity.   Finally, disincentivizing financial institutions from holding  investment-grade municipal securities could cause banks to retreat from  the $3.8 trillion market, thereby forcing State and local governments  to scale back pending projects on roads, schools, and other  infrastructure projects financed with the bonds. Classifying  investment-grade municipal securities as HQLAs will ensure low-cost  infrastructure financing remains available for State and local  governments.   Although the Federal Reserve has issued an amended rule allowing  municipal bonds to count as HQLAs for some banks, neither the OCC nor  the FDIC have acted to follow the Fed's lead in amending their HQLA  definitions to include these municipal securities. Their inaction  creates a split regulatory system in which the treatment of municipal  securities for the purpose of measuring the liquidity of the bank's  holdings depends entirely upon who the regulator is.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1624, offered by Mr. Messer and Mrs. Maloney,  represents a bipartisan effort to ensure that certain financial  institutions will continue to hold municipal securities, while also  supporting the spirit of an important bank guardrail in the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   Bank regulators promulgated the liquidity coverage rule to ensure  that megabanks have a minimum number of assets that they could sell,  even in the worst markets. The rule permits banks to count assets like  Treasury securities, GSE debt, and investment-grade corporate  securities towards the pool. Regulators found that these securities  could be sold even in stressed environments, thereby allowing a  megabank to weather the storm of an economic crisis. This rule, known  as the liquidity coverage rule, is an important tool for banking  regulators to guard against the type of contagion we saw during the  financial crisis.   However, the bank regulators excluded all municipal securities  because they concluded that municipal securities, as a class, are  difficult to sell in stressed markets. This may be generally true, but  the investment-grade debt of my State of California has lots of buyers  and sellers and has a liquidity profile similar to many corporate  securities. So it makes sense that, if there are municipal securities  like California's debt that meet the same eligibility standards as  other corporate securities, they should also be counted toward a bank's  liquid assets under the rule.   The Federal Reserve quickly recognized this problem and has since  adopted a correction to permit bank holding companies under its  jurisdiction to treat municipal securities that are liquid, market  ready, and investment grade the same as similar corporate securities.   This bill, as amended, takes the relief adopted by the Federal  Reserve and extends it to banks regulated by the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation. It isn't clear to me just how many municipalities will  benefit from this legislation, and I imagine most would not, but even  if only a handful of our States and cities qualify, the bill is worth  passing because it could help to reduce financing costs for those  governments.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Maloney's hard work and bipartisan  efforts on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1624. I commend  my ranking member from the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities,  and Investments, Mrs. Maloney, as well as the work from my colleague  from Indiana.   This is a commonsense, no-nonsense, bipartisan solution to a mistake  that was made by regulators. We need to grant clarity and harmony to  those who are borrowing those dollars, those municipalities, States,  and cities, as well as the investors and those who hold these bonds.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I am pleased  that we can support H.R. 1624, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1624, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require  the appropriate Federal banking agencies to treat certain municipal  obligations as no lower than level 2B liquid assets, and for other  purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
