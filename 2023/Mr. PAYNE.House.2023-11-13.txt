 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the dangers of  diabetes for Black Americans.   November is National Diabetes Awareness Month. Today, more than 37  million Americans suffer from diabetes, and that number includes almost  5 million Black Americans. Right now, one of every five Black Americans  over 20 years of age has diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes. Black  Americans are far more likely to develop diabetes than White Americans.   Diabetes is the most expensive chronic health condition in our  country. The $35 cap on insulin for Medicare beneficiaries in the  Inflation Reduction Act helps our seniors afford this lifesaving  medication. However, we need to pass the bill to make the $35 cap on  insulin available to all Americans. If we can cap insulin payments, we  can help millions of Black Americans afford this critical medication.  No diabetic in this country should have to choose between food or  insulin every month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Illinois and  the gentlewoman from Florida for the opportunity to speak. I absolutely  thank my colleague from the great State of Ohio for bringing this issue  to the forefront and having a press conference this afternoon to  discuss this dreaded disease.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the problem of diabetes in Black  communities nationwide. It is an honor to do it during National  Diabetes Awareness Month.   As a diabetic, daily life is a constant challenge. I will have to get  up at 4 clock tomorrow morning to go to dialysis, a treatment that I  need three times a week to survive. That means I risk exposure to the  coronavirus or any other ailment when I receive treatments in rooms  full of other patients. It is a problem that many of America's 37  million diabetics face every day, and that figure includes 5 million  Black Americans with diabetes.   In addition, almost 80 million Americans could develop diabetes due  to poor diet and health or family history of diabetes. That is one  reason that diabetes is the most expensive chronic health condition in  our Nation.   These health issues are even worse for Black Americans. We are 60  percent more likely to develop diabetes than our White counterparts,  and we are twice as likely to die from it than our White counterparts.   Right now, one in every five Black Americans over the age of 20 has  diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, and the prevalence of type 2  diabetes for Black and Hispanic youth has doubled since 2001.   The risks are so high that Black Americans are less likely to donate  a kidney because they fear future health issues. That is why Black  Americans are twice as likely to receive a kidney transplant from a  deceased donor than a live one. This can lead to health issues that do  not happen to patients who receive a kidney from a living donor.   The more prominent issue is the price of insulin in America. The  monthly average cost of insulin is almost $650 per month. That is 10  times higher than the price in other countries. Nevertheless, there is  hope. There is a $35 cap on insulin in the Inflation Reduction Act for  Medicare beneficiaries. It helps our seniors save money on this  lifesaving medication, and they do not have to make the choice between  food or insulin every month.   Nonetheless, we need to do more. We need to pass bills like the  Affordable Insulin Now Act. This bill would cap out-of-pocket costs for  insulin to the same $35 for all Americans.   President Biden is working to make that $35 insulin price cap  permanent for all Americans in other legislation, as well. If we can  cap insulin payments, then we can help millions of Black Americans  afford this critical medication.   That is why this Special Order hour is so important. It brings  awareness to the fact that minorities are more likely to face diabetes  and other kidney-related issues.   In addition, public talks like today's event remind people that  diabetes is still a serious medical issue. When we increase awareness,  we increase funding for new treatments and cures. Eventually, we will  find the new treatments that will make it safer for diabetics.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot wait for those new treatments to happen. That  will be the day when I can walk out of the dialysis treatment clinic  for the last time.
