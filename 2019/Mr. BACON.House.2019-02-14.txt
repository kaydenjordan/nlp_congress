 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Judge William Mark  Ashford of the Fourth Judicial District Court of Nebraska who was known  for his jovial smile, gregarious nature, and being a fearless voice for  justice. February 14th marks what would have been his 67th birthday.  His untimely passing is a great loss for his family, friends, and for  the people of our community whom he served with the highest level of  commitment, integrity, and honor.   Appointed to the bench in 1988, Judge Ashford's work ethic and  uncompromising professional integrity quickly garnered the respect of  most and ruffled the feathers of some. Armed with a sharp legal mind  and even sharper focus on the public he served, Judge Ashford was a  stalwart judicial advocate, fighting for transparency in and out of the  courtroom.   His eternal faith in humanity and in the power of justice will  continue to serve as an unyielding example. Nebraska Supreme Court  Chief Justice Mike Heavican noted that Judge Ashford's work with the  young adult treatment court and his pioneering efforts to establish the  Douglas County Veterans Treatment Court would be sorely missed.    Veterans treatment courts are tapping into the unique aspects of  military and veteran culture and using them to the benefit of the  veteran. According to the Omaha World Herald: ``Ashford felt a calling  to oversee veterans court because his father was a World War II pilot  who once flew a fighter plane called the Aksarben Knight.''   I extend my deepest condolences to his friends and family members,  especially his wife, Deb Ashford; sons, Steven and Sam Ashford;  stepsons, Keith, Kristopher and Kent; and brothers, Brad and Carl  Ashford.                        African American History Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the occasion of African  American History Month to recognize two key figures in Nebraska  history, Will Brown and George Smith, both murdered by lynching at the  hands of lawless mobs. This is not a past Nebraskans are proud of, but  it is a story we must continue to tell so we never forget them or allow  acts of hate like these to ever be repeated.   Nearly 100 years ago in the summer of 1919, Black people were killed  amid violent race riots occurring across the country. Omaha, Nebraska,  was not immune during that Red Summer and regrettably became known for  one of the most heinous acts of hate and racial violence in American  history.   According to research, the destructive flames of hatred and racism at  the time were fanned by a series of politically motivated articles  published in newspapers like the Omaha Bee. Alarmed at the Bee's  promotion of racial prejudice, Reverend John Albert Williams, first  president of the local chapter of the NAACP and minister of St.  Philip's Episcopal Church called upon the editors of the Bee to stop  their propaganda.   On September 28, 1919, a raucous crowd of more than 4,000, emboldened  by the destructive rhetoric, grew violent and set fire to the Douglas  County Courthouse. When Omaha Mayor Edward Smith tried to calm the  crowd, he was assaulted and nearly killed by the mob before being  rescued by local law enforcement. Without a trial, the riotous horde  seized Mr. Brown, who had been accused of rape and robbery. Despite his  exclamations of innocence, and physical evidence supporting his claims,  Mr. Brown was brutally murdered. His body was paraded through the  streets as a form of racial terrorism.   Equally disturbing was the lynching of George Smith, also known as  Joe Coe, 28 years earlier in October of 1891. Mr. Smith was falsely  accused of raping a young girl, despite having a valid alibi and  witnesses who attested to his innocence. Again, unchecked hatred fueled  the unjustified lynching without any judicial process.   By shining light on these horrid shadows of injustice in America, we  can begin to speak truthfully about this difficult history so that  reconciliation can be achieved. It also allows us to honor the  inspirational leaders who rise up to promote equality and eradicate  racial subjugation. The work of the NAACP was tremendously effective in  awakening the Nation to the urgency of stopping lynching.   Today in my community a coalition has been formed called the Omaha  Community Council for Racial Justice and Reconciliation, to coordinate  efforts to memorialize victims of lynching and raise awareness of  racial violence in Douglas County.   I call on all who hear these words to stand against hate, racism, and  injustice whenever and wherever it may be found. We must ensure acts  like these are never allowed to occur again and that the lessons of  Will Brown and George Smith's deaths are never forgotten. We are a  nation that respects life, liberty, equality, and the rule of law.                            ____________________
