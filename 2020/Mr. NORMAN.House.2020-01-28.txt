 Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and nominate  today's guest, Father Jeffrey Kirby, to serve as guest chaplain for the  noon prayer.   Father Kirby, pastor of Our Lady of Grace Parish in South Carolina  and the adjunct professor of theology at Belmont Abbey College, is a  devout follower of Jesus Christ and lives his life as a light unto  others.   Father Kirby received his bachelor of arts and master's degree from  Franciscan University of Steubenville before receiving his doctorate in  moral theology from Holy Cross University in Rome.   His selflessness led him to enlist in the National Guard during his  studies, and he even served on a relief effort for Hurricane Mitch.   In 2002, he entered seminary in Rome and was ordained a Catholic  priest. He has since served parishes across South Carolina, from  Clemson to Walhalla to Seneca to Columbia and now Lancaster.   Governor Nikki Haley selected him in 2016 to receive the Order of the  Palmetto, our State's highest civilian honor.   In His word, and one that exemplifies Father Kirby's life, the Book  of Malachi 2:7 reads: ``For the lips of a priest should guard  knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is  the messenger of the Lord of hosts.''   In light of his many years of ministry, it is my honor to welcome  Father Kirby as the guest chaplain of the United States House of  Representatives.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership on  this issue and for what he has done over a long period of time to help  this all-important issue.   Let me just echo what has already been said. I am a real estate  developer. I have felt the effects of the bureaucratic overreach of the  Endangered Species Act. I have seen where a heelsplitter snail can slow  up projects for as many as 4 to 5 years.   I have been watching from a distance, and now, finally, we have  decided to take action. I rise in support of the long-overdue efforts  to modernize the Endangered Species Act and specifically my bill that  would help continue protections for species while, more importantly,  protecting the rights of individual property owners. My bill, the  Property Rights Protection Act, would do just that.    Everyone agrees that it is important to protect these species that  are threatened or endangered, but far too often, it comes at the  expense of the constitutional rights of landowners.   This vital piece of legislation would ensure that we achieve both  goals. We protect species, but we also protect our rights as property  owners.   If the Federal Government deems land to be critical habitat because a  species is endangered, then they ought to compensate the landowners,  plain and simple. I believe that there needs to be a more equitable way  to treat property owners who far too often find themselves in this type  of situation. This legislation will be an excellent step in that  direction.   Many landowners cannot afford the litigation costs that so many of  these groups put before the landowners to get the rights that they  deserve.   I really hope that all of my colleagues can come together to support  this important piece of legislation to protect our rights and species  and, more importantly, come together to update an antiquated law that  is the Endangered Species Act that has been in need of modernization  for far too long.
