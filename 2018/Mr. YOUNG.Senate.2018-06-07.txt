 Mr. President, today I wish to thank Dr. Linda L.M.  Bennett for her remarkable career as president of the University of  Southern Indiana, USI. Dr. Bennett started with the university in 2003  and became its third president on July 1, 2009. She will be retiring on  June 30, 2018, after 15 years of dedicated service.   Dr. Bennett truly exemplifies the university's vision, ``shaping the  future through learning and innovation,'' and her work hasn't gone  unheeded. Under her leadership, the University of Southern Indiana  established its first two strategic plans, raising the academic  standards, community engagement, and faculty development.   Throughout her career, President Bennett has served with the American  Association of Colleges and Universities, Indiana Campus Compact Board,  the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference Council of  Presidents, and the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities  Executive Committee. During her tenure as president, USI implemented  its first doctoral program, doctor of nursing practice, and expanded  its engineering and MBA programs.   In addition to her time as president, Dr. Bennett has contributed to  a wide variety of local organizations, including the Southwest Indiana  Chamber of Commerce, Leadership Evansville, the Diversity Lecture  Series, the Indiana University School of Medicine Advisory Board of  Directors, the Red Cross, the Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra, United  Way, Mesker Park Zoo Planning Committee, Holly's House, Joshua Academy,  the Wellborn Baptist Foundation, the Mayor's Education Roundtable, the  Economic Development Coalition of Southwest Indiana, and the Rotary  Club of Evansville. Over the past few years, Dr. Bennett has received  several awards, including the 2015 Rotary Civic Award, the Boy Scouts  of America Buffalo Trace Council Distinguished Citizen Award, 2017, the  Indiana Commission for Women Torchbearer Award, 2017, and the Girl  Scouts of Southwest Indiana Women of Distinction award in 2018.   Although Dr. Bennett's retirement marks the end of a chapter, it also  presents the opportunity for an exciting new beginning. I congratulate  her on all of her achievements as USI's president and look forward to  her further contributions to the Hoosier community.
