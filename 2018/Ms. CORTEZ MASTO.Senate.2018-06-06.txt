 Mr. President, today I am honored to  recognize one of Nevada's most dedicated and exceptional educators, Mr.  Scott Ginger of Green Valley High School, who has served thousands of  students with the utmost dedication. Mr. Ginger, as his current and  former students continue to call him, has remained committed to his  students' success for 29 years. He began his career at William E. Orr  Middle School in 1989 and moved to Green Valley High School 2 years  later, where administrators, faculty, students, and families have  revered him. He has won the Green Valley High School Golden Gator Award  17 times and has been inducted into the Clark County Teachers' Hall of  Fame.   Nevadans who know Mr. Ginger are eager to highlight his impressive  skills as a speech and debate coach, a role that has given him and his  forensics team at Green Valley High School the county championship 24  consecutive times since 1995 and the State championship a record 16  times. In 2018, the National Speech and Debate Association named him  Nevada Educator of the Year. Although a very skilled competitor, Mr.  Ginger has always emphasized that speech and debate are primarily ``a  vehicle to build character, to be ethical, to be kind, to think big  picture and think about others.'' Students who were fortunate to learn  from Mr. Ginger agree. Those in the professional world claim Mr.  Ginger's classroom lessons still help them keep calm and collected when  speaking in public. Most importantly, those students also give Mr.  Ginger credit for their ability to make lasting connections and  friendships.   The sense of community belonging that Mr. Ginger has given his  students is perhaps his most important legacy. He has allowed some of  his most talented students to teach within the classroom and has  provided an opportunity for former students to come back and speak  about the multiple benefits they have reaped from forensics. Thus, a  community of skilled debaters  [[Page S3030]]  has grown in southern Nevada, including those who have become leaders  in a variety of fields all across the country. No matter where their  career paths lead them, Mr. Ginger's former students will always  remember and cherish the life lessons they learned in his classroom.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Scott Ginger for  his 29 years of service as an educator in the Clark County School  District. I admire Mr. Ginger for his incredible ability to inspire and  shape the lives of his students and for encouraging cooperation and a  sense of community that should be held as a model for all classrooms in  our Nation. I celebrate Mr. Ginger's impact in Nevada, and I am proud  of his work to enhance young Nevadans' ability to succeed and  thrive.                            ____________________
