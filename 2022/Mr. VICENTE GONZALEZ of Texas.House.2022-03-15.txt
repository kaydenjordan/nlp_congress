 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of Congressman Filemon Vela's bill, H.R. 268, which would add Fort  Brown to the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park located in  Brownsville, Texas.    By including this fort, we are creating a national monument for the  only standing architecture in the United States associated with the  Mexican-American War.   In 1845, after the annexation of Texas, President James Polk sent  soldiers to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to proclaim the boundary of  the United States at the Rio Grande River.   In 1846, General Zachary Taylor ordered the construction of the fort,  which consisted of a six-sided earthwork. Once finished, General Taylor  left to procure supplies and gave command of the fort to Major Jacob  Brown.   On May 3, 1846, Mexico sought to capitalize on the depleted resources  and bombarded the fort for 6 straight days. Major Jacob Brown and the  American troops fought valiantly, forcing Mexico to retreat. American  forces only lost two soldiers, one of which was Major Brown himself.   Today, the city of Brownsville and Fort Brown serve as a testament to  Major Brown's valor, patriotism, and sacrifice. By passing H.R. 268, we  as a Nation will honor Major Brown and the Americans who stood their  ground at Fort Brown.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Congressman  Vela and I in preserving this important part of south Texas' and our  entire country's history.
