 Madam President, I rise today in support of my  resolution to convey strong bipartisan opposition to Russian President  Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression against the United States'  partner, Ukraine. I was proud to lead this resolution with Senator Rob  Portman, in addition to Senators Durbin, Cornyn, Menendez, and Risch,  and was pleased to see 38 Senators join this resolution and push for  its passage.   As the Senate prepared to adjourn for the next week, Senator Portman  and I believed it was absolutely critical that we deliver this message  of strong bipartisan support for the brave and resilient people of  Ukraine. It is important to send a message of bipartisan resolve and to  stand up to Putin in response to his continued aggression and  especially given recent indications that he is increasingly likely to  eschew the diplomatic path available and further invade Ukraine. And as  I join a large bipartisan delegation to the Munich Security Forum this  weekend, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed that it was  paramount that the Senate pass this resolution. This resolution  demonstrates the fierce bipartisan support for the NATO, for the  transatlantic alliance, for our democratic partners in Ukraine and in  repudiation of Putin's efforts to violate Ukraine's sovereignty.   This Senate has a long history of supporting an independent and  democratic Ukraine. Since Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014,  this Congress has provided more than $2.7 billion in security  assistance and supported critical reforms to help Ukraine on its  journey to greater euro-Atlantic integration.   I am proud to have been involved in a number of bipartisan efforts to  support Ukraine. Last month, I traveled to Ukraine with Senator Portman  as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian  President Zelenskyy and his national security team to discuss the  Russian threat and how the United States can help our Ukrainian  friends. In January, I reaffirmed the United States' commitment to our  democratic partners, which I also shared during a congressional  delegation visit last June, that our Nation believes fervently that  Ukraine and Ukraine alone should determine its future.   In our meetings, the message from the Ukrainians was clear. They see  their future in partnership with the West. They share our democratic  values, and their people are proud of their hard-won independence. I  would like to make one point perfectly clear: The unprecedented Russian  threat to Ukraine's sovereignty is on Vladimir Putin and no one else.  He has designed this crisis to advance his own revanchist agenda. The  global community is not blind to his malign ambitions. He wants to  reconstruct the Soviet Union and recreate his own sphere of interest.  And he--wrongfully--sees Ukraine as part of this authoritarian future.   Putin wants to diminish the U.S. presence in Europe and to rewrite  the European security order for his benefit and in blatant disregard  for previous international agreements and treaties that Russia signed.  And Putin has shown repeated attempts to subvert democratic  institutions in the United States, threaten our election security,  attack our infrastructure, and compromise the sovereignty of our allies  around the globe.   This is why what happens in Ukraine matters to the United States. How  we respond to Putin's aggression against Ukraine will have implications  for our national security and global stability for decades to come. It  is important that we stand up for our values. It is necessary that we  stand up to protect our national security. And it is critical that we  continue to uphold and protect the European security order that has  afforded us peace and prosperity for over 70 years. As Putin tries to  dismantle and divide the very alliance that has kept us safe for over  70 years, it is all the more important that we strengthen our resolve  through a strong message of unbreakable unity.   This is why the passage of today's bipartisan resolution on Ukraine  is so important. I want to covey my appreciation to Senator Portman for  his work and leadership. Especially on this issue, we believe that  bipartisanship is critical in advancing U.S. foreign policy, especially  in support of our partner, Ukraine. And we must lead by example and  convey, as we have done to our Ukrainian partners and our transatlantic  allies, that we must not leave any space for Putin to sow further  discord.   On Monday, I spoke on the floor and said that the Senate does not  have a choice; we must send a message of strong, unequivocal bipartisan  resolve. And today, we did just that.   Along with my fellow Senators, I wish to send an unequivocal message  to Putin; you will not divide this Senate. You will not divide this  country. And you will not divide the transatlantic alliance. Diplomacy  remains an option to deescalate this situation and pursue a peaceful  resolution. But if Putin decides to further invade Ukraine, he will  only succeed in uniting us all--Democrats, Republicans, Americans, and  the transatlantic alliance--in sending a message of unmistakable  resolve against his belligerence.                            ____________________
