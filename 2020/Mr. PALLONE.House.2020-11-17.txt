 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4499) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide that  the authority of the Director of the National Institute on Minority  Health and Health Disparities to make certain research endowments  applies with respect to both current and former centers of excellence,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4499         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NIMHD Research Endowment       Revitalization Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. RESEARCH ENDOWMENTS AT BOTH CURRENT AND FORMER                     CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.         Paragraph (1) of section 464z-3(h) of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285t(h)) is amended to read as       follows:        ``(1) In general.--The Director of the Institute may carry       out a program to facilitate minority health disparities       research and other health disparities research by providing       for research endowments--        ``(A) at current or former centers of excellence under       section 736; and        ``(B) at current or former centers of excellence under       section 464z-4.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4499.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4499, the NIMHD Research Endowment  Revitalization Act of 2020.   This bill authorizes the National Institute on Minority Health and  Health Disparities, or NIMHD, to facilitate research on minority health  disparities through research endowments at current or former Centers of  Excellence.   The NIMHD Research Endowment Program was established by the Minority  Health and Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000. By  supporting the endowments of certain academic institutions, the program  promotes minority health and health disparities research capacity,  increases the diversity of the scientific workforce, and enhances the  recruitment and retention of underrepresented individuals in science.   Congress expanded the eligibility of the program to include  institutions of higher education with an active NIMHD Center of  Excellence, and this expansion inadvertently resulted in  [[Page H5804]]  schools such as Morehouse School of Medicine, Georgia State University,  and Morgan State University being ineligible.   As our Nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an  even more urgent need to support additional research into minority  health and health disparities, and to bolster the recruitment and  retention of underrepresented individuals in science.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the lead sponsors, Representatives Barragan,  Carter, and the late John Lewis, and their staffs, for their work on  this legislation. I also thank the Democratic and Republican members of  our committee, as well as bipartisan committee staff, for working  together to move this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4499, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional Members who would like  to speak on the bill, and so I urge support for the legislation. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5668) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  modernize the labeling of certain generic drugs, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5668         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5668.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5668, the MODERN  Labeling Act.   Prescription drug labels contain the most authoritative drug-related  information available to prescribers. These labels let prescribers know  about approved uses for a drug and important patient safety  information.   However, over time, labels can become outdated as more information  becomes known about a drug, but a manufacturer may not update the label  with the Food and Drug Administration to identify new uses for drugs.  This is especially likely to happen with some older generic drugs where  there may be commonly accepted off-label uses but no FDA-sanctioned  method of communicating those safe uses.   In some cases, a generic drug may have an outdated label due to a  loophole in the law. Under this loophole, if a listed brand drug leaves  the market while a generic competitor remains, there is no way for the  generic drug to update its label with approved new uses. This is  because generic drugs must maintain the same drug information on their  labels as their branded counterparts, even when their branded  counterpart has left the market.   This bipartisan legislation, Mr. Speaker, would fix this problem.  H.R. 5668 would allow FDA to identify drugs that have out-of-date  labels and pursue revised labeling, allowing new uses and new  indications to be listed. This will allow FDA and generic drug  manufacturers to ensure that drug labels, the most trusted source of  drug use information, include the best information available.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that both brand and generic  manufacturers have the responsibility to work with FDA to update drug  safety information that becomes known and that does not change under  this bill.   Amendments adopted through our committee process ensure that, when a  manufacturer needs to update a label solely with new safety  information, manufacturers and FDA must pursue such changes through the  current process. Drug safety is paramount, and we want patients to have  certainty that they will have up-to-date safety information.   As Dr. Jeff Allen from the Friends of Cancer Research said at our  hearing on this bill: ``Preserving the accuracy and reliability of  labeling may be viewed as tantamount to preserving trust in and the  relevance of the drug approval system.''   And I cannot agree more, Mr. Speaker. Maintaining our trust in the  FDA approval process is critical, and this bill will help strengthen  the system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I believe we have a speaker on the other  side, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the gentleman has any  additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of our Members to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4712) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with  respect to limitations on exclusive approval or licensure of orphan  drugs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4712         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on H.R. 4712.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4712, the Fairness in  Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, a bill that will close a loophole in the  orphan drug program to ensure generic drugs are not unfairly being  blocked from entering the market.   Since it was first passed in 1983, the Orphan Drug Act has been  successful in driving research and discovery of new therapies to treat  and even cure rare diseases. The law creates two pathways for  manufacturers to be designated as an orphan drug and to gain certain  incentives, including 7 years of market exclusivity.   The first and most commonly used pathway is for developing drugs  approved to treat diseases with patient populations of 200,000 or  fewer. There is also the rarely used cost-recovery pathway, where the  drug research and development costs are not expected to be recouped by  sales of the underlying drug.   Now, under certain circumstances, a manufacturer may also receive  additional rounds of exclusivity for drugs in their portfolio if they  treat the same conditions and have the same active ingredient, even if  the second drug does not meet the orphan drug qualifications. This  provision has allowed some manufacturers to circumvent the original  intent of the Orphan Drug Act, which was to incentivize creation of  novel drugs for small populations, all the while blocking generic  competitors from coming to market.   An example of this recently occurred when a formulation of  Buprenorphine, a drug to treat opioid use disorder, was approved in  2017. It was allowed to carry the orphan drug designation granted to  its manufacturer's original Buprenorphine drug more than 20 years  earlier, in 1994.   When the original 1994 orphan drug designation was granted, it was  expected that Buprenorphine would not be prescribed frequently;  however, as the opioid crisis worsened and our response to the crisis  evolved, millions were eventually prescribed the drug, generating  billions of dollars in sales.   Clearly, we knew in 2017 that Buprenorphine was not an orphan drug.  Nevertheless, the drug was granted orphan drug status and exclusivity,  delaying additional forms of generic competition. So while the Food and  Drug Administration eventually recognized this issue with this  particular drug and revoked its orphan drug designation, its  exclusivity delayed generic competition that otherwise would have been  on the market.   We need every tool available to us to combat the opioid epidemic, and  loopholes like this one should not be allowed to limit access to  treatment, Mr. Speaker.   H.R. 4712 will stop this from happening again in the future by  requiring drug manufacturers to demonstrate in their application to the  FDA that each drug application considered under the cost recovery  pathway would fail to recoup development costs.   This bill is narrowly tailored. It is a fix for a small but very real  loophole in the law, and I want to thank Representative Dean for  introducing the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5808]]                                     time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), who is the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, I urge  passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2466) to extend the State Opioid Response Grants program,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2466         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Grant program for State and Tribal response to substance                use disorders of significance.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2466.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2466, the State Opioid  Response Grant Authorization Act of 2020.   While the coronavirus pandemic is at the forefront of our minds, the  opioid epidemic and evolving drug crisis also continues to be a public  health emergency that we must also address.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more  than 750,000 Americans have died since 1999 from a drug overdose, and  in 2018 two out of three drug overdose deaths involved an opioid.  Recent data from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  indicates that over 20 million Americans have a substance use disorder  and, unfortunately, only a fraction of those Americans receive the care  they need.   Building upon congressional efforts like the 21st Century Cures Act  and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, this bill would  authorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, or SAMHSA, State Opioid Response, SOR, grant program  and align the authorization with authorities in the 21st Century Cures  Act to meet the current needs of States. Assistant Secretary for  Health, Admiral Brett Giroir, testified before our committee, Mr.  Speaker, that SAMHSA's SOR grants provide a high degree of flexibility  to States working to combat the drug epidemic.   The SAMHSA SOR grant program has been funded through appropriations  legislation since fiscal year 2018, but it does not have a statutory  authorization. With this bill, we are ensuring that both the Federal  support and flexibility continue into the future.   Currently, SOR grants help communities tackle the drug crisis by  reducing barriers to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use  disorder, effectively chipping away at the treatment gap. The grants  aid in reducing drug overdose-related deaths by supporting prevention  and recovery activities across the States. This program also supports  evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery support services to  address stimulant misuse and use disorders, which is a growing issue,  also, in many regions of the country.   So I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation, Representatives  Trone, Armstrong, Sherrill, and Riggleman, and their staffs for their  tireless work on this bill. I also thank the Democratic and Republican  members of the committee, as well as bipartisan committee staff, for  working together to move this bill. I hope that the Senate will act on  this legislation sooner rather than later.   Mr. Speaker, the drug crisis continues to affect all walks of life.  They are our friends, our family, and our neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), who is the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2281) to direct the Attorney General to amend certain  regulations so that practitioners may administer not more than 3 days'  medication to a person at one time when administering narcotic drugs  for the purpose of relieving acute withdrawal symptoms, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2281         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Easy Medication Access and       Treatment for Opioid Addiction Act'' or the ``Easy MAT for       Opioid Addiction Act''.  [[Page H5812]]            SEC. 2. DISPENSATION OF NARCOTIC DRUGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF                     RELIEVING ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS FROM OPIOID                     USE DISORDER.         Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Attorney General shall revise section 1306.07(b) of       title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, so that practitioners,       in accordance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws       relating to controlled substances, are allowed to dispense       not more than a three-day supply of narcotic drugs to one       person or for one person's use at one time for the purpose of       initiating maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment       (or both).       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2281.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2281, the Easy  Medication Access and Treatment for Opioid Addiction Act, or the Easy  MAT for Opioid Addiction Act.   As we have highlighted on the floor today, the opioid epidemic is a  public health emergency that we must continue to address. Millions of  Americans have been impacted by the drug crisis. A 2019 National Survey  on Drug Use and Health shows that 1.6 million Americans have an opioid  use disorder. This is a chronic, treatable disease that patients can  and do recover from.   While the number of Americans with opioid use disorder was declining  prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it is still alarming that less than  one out of five of these Americans actually receive treatment.   The Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction Act is a bill that makes it easier  for patients to access medication-assisted treatment in the emergency  room. For many patients, whether it be those experiencing an overdose  or those seeking substance use disorder treatment, the emergency room  can be the first or only point of care.   Buprenorphine is one of three FDA-approved medications for treating  opioid use disorder. In emergency situations, it may be dispensed from  an emergency room by certain practitioners for up to 3 days. This  policy is otherwise known as the 3-day rule.   This rule is intended to help healthcare providers address acute  withdrawal symptoms while a patient awaits arrangements for longer term  medication-assisted treatment. But, unfortunately, there are several  burdensome restrictions tied to this authority. For example, there is a  limitation that not more than 1 day's medication be given to a patient  at one time, forcing the repeated return to the emergency room.   Mr. Speaker, in testimony before the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, Dr. Shawn Ryan, an emergency physician and addiction medicine  specialist, cited the burden for a patient having to return to the  emergency room after an initial visit, particularly for patients with  substance use disorder. He stated that transportation can be an issue  for these patients but also that repeat visits can be a burden for the  emergency departments.   This bill would direct the Drug Enforcement Administration to update  regulations to allow a practitioner to dispense up to 3 days' supply of  buprenorphine. This will give patients and families a better  opportunity to get connected to adequate treatment on the road to  recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Ruiz, a member of  our committee, and his staff for leading this bill. I also thank  Ranking Member Walden and his staff for working with us to move this  bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation that will help more substance use disorder patients access  the treatment they need, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2281, the Easy       MAT for Opioid Addiction Act, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2281 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 2281, the ``Easy Medication       Access and Treatment for Opioid Addiction Act,'' that fall       within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting       with us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no       objection to your including them in the bill for       consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 2281, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers at this time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2117) to improve the health and safety of Americans living  with food allergies and related disorders, including potentially life- threatening anaphylaxis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome,  and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2117         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Food Allergy Safety,       Treatment, Education, and Research Act of 2020'' or the       ``FASTER Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2117.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2117, the Food Allergy  Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research Act, or the FASTER Act.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 32 million Americans, including  approximately 1 in every 13 children, are affected by food allergies.  These allergies pose risks to millions of families, and these risks  grow dramatically when inaccurate labels fail to warn consumers about  the presence of some of these allergens.   Under current law, eight allergens are considered major food  allergens. They include milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat,  peanuts, and soybeans. Due to their status as major food allergens,  manufacturers must clearly state the presence of any of these  ingredients on labels.   Notably missing from this list of allergens is sesame. That is  concerning, considering it is an allergen of growing concern and its  inclusion in food products has more than doubled over the last decade.  In some cases, sesame may not be listed at all on ingredient labels,  being referred to instead through nonspecific terms like ``flavors'' or  words that may not easily be recognized by consumers as containing  sesame, such as tahini.   While it may seem like a small issue to some, this lack of  information could mean life or death for those who are allergic to  sesame. Clearly, this information should be prominently featured on  packaged food labels.   This is an issue we have been working on for quite some time. Several  years ago, I introduced a bill that would list sesame as a major food  allergen, and although the Food and Drug Administration opened a docket  to solicit feedback about the sesame labeling and recently released  guidance recommending voluntary labeling of sesame, the agency has not  been able to require the listing of sesame due to overly long  regulatory processes.   As we learn more about food allergens, our regulations should be able  to adapt to align with the latest science. This process should not take  years.  [[Page H5814]]  Families should have reliable access to this information, and they  should have it now.   Today we are taking action, Mr. Speaker. The appropriately named  FASTER Act would quickly move this process along by recognizing sesame  as a major food allergen, requiring its listing on new food labels  after a phase-in process.   Importantly, the bill would also streamline processes at FDA to allow  for additional allergens to be listed as major food allergens based on  scientific criteria, including the prevalence and the severity of the  allergens.   The bill would also help develop quality research into food allergens  by directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand  and intensify its collection of data on food allergens and by directing  FDA to report on its use of patient experience data.   I want to thank Representative Matsui for her tireless efforts in  support of families affected by food allergens and for introducing this  bill.   I am a strong supporter of the bill, and I encourage all Members to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5855) to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a  grant program supporting trauma center violence intervention and  violence prevention programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5855         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``SEC. 399V-7.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5855.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, trauma is a pressing public health epidemic. In 2016  alone, trauma accounted for 29.2 million emergency department visits  and 39.5 million physician office visits in the U.S.   Tragically, homicide is the leading cause of death for Black males 1  to 24 years old and the second leading cause of death in Hispanic males  1 to 24 years old.   Regardless of race, among those who survive a single violent trauma,  it is estimated that up to 45 percent will experience a second violent  trauma. This is where H.R. 5855 steps in to provide critical data- driven interventions.   The Bipartisan Solution to Cyclical Violence Act of 2020 identifies  patients at risk of repeat violent injury and connects them with  hospital and community-based resources. The bill bridges tragedy with  hospital-based violence intervention programs by providing intensive  case management to individuals who have experienced at least one  violent trauma. These programs have been shown to successfully reduce  injury recidivism and help those at risk for violence live safer lives.   I want to commend my colleagues, Representatives Ruppersberger and  Kinzinger, for spearheading this initiative and the University of  Maryland Hospital for establishing its shock trauma unit, which  established the first cycles of violence intervention program.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger), the sponsor of the legislation.   (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I also urge all of my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3878) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify the  process for registrants to exercise due diligence upon discovering a  suspicious order, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3878         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Block, Report, And Suspend       Suspicious Shipments Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF PROCESS FOR REGISTRANTS TO EXERCISE                     DUE DILIGENCE UPON DISCOVERING A SUSPICIOUS                     ORDER.         (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 312(a) of the       Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 832(a)) is amended to       read as follows:        ``(3) upon discovering a suspicious order or series of       orders--        ``(A) exercise due diligence;        ``(B) establish and maintain (for not less than a period to       be determined by the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement       Administration) a record of the due diligence that was       performed;        ``(C) decline to fill the order or series of orders if the       due diligence fails to resolve all of the indicators that       gave rise to the suspicion that filling the order or series       of orders would cause a violation of this title by the       registrant or the prospective purchaser; and        ``(D) notify the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement       Administration and the Special Agent in Charge of the       Division Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration for       the area in which the registrant is located or conducts       business of--        ``(i) each suspicious order or series of orders discovered       by the registrant; and        ``(ii) the indicators giving rise to the suspicion that       filling the order or series of orders would cause a violation       of this title by the registrant or the prospective       purchaser.''.        (b) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, for purposes of section 312(a)(3) of       the Controlled Substances Act, as amended by subsection (a),       the Attorney General of the United States shall promulgate a       final regulation specifying the indicators that give rise to       a suspicion that filling an order or series of orders would       cause a violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       801 et seq.) by a registrant or a prospective purchaser.        (c) Applicability.--Section 312(a)(3) of the Controlled       Substances Act, as amended by  [[Page H5817]]       subsection (a), shall apply beginning on the day that is 1       year after the date of enactment of this Act. Until such day,       section 312(a)(3) of the Controlled Substances Act shall       apply as such section 312(a)(3) was in effect on the day       before the date of enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3878.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3878, the Block,  Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2020. This bill will  improve reporting an action on suspicious orders on controlled  substances.   Between 1999 and 2017, more than 700,000 Americans died from a drug  overdose. Many of those Americans were caught in the first wave of what  we typically describe as three waves of this epidemic.   This first wave began in the 1990s with deaths involving prescription  opioids. In 2010, we saw dramatic increases from heroin-involved  deaths. And most recently, we are seeing a third wave involving  synthetic opioids, like illicitly manufactured fentanyl.   During that first wave, Americans across the country became addicted  to opioids. Many of those opioids were prescribed to patients to treat  pain. However, throughout the years, we have discovered that many of  these opioids were diverted through a system meant to prevent  diversion.   The Drug Enforcement Administration requires entities that  manufacture or distribute controlled substances to register and report  their activities through ARCOS. This system is meant to track the  manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of these substances. In this  system, registrants are also expected to disclose suspicious orders of  controlled substances, such as orders of unusual size, orders deviating  from a normal pattern, or orders of unusual frequency.   As an effort to improve reporting and action on suspicious orders,  this bill would clarify the responsibilities of drug manufacturers and  distributors when discovering a suspicious order, and require  communications around that order to DEA. This will help all entities to  better identify suspicious activity and root out bad actors.   Madam Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that will make clear the  responsibilities for all entities in our supply chain and, hopefully,  help to deter opioid diversion and trafficking. I commend the lead  sponsors of this bipartisan bill, Representatives Dingell and McKinley,  and their staff for their work on this legislation. I also thank the  Democratic and Republican members of our committee, as well as  bipartisan staff for working together to move this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3878, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3878, the       Block, Report, and Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2020,       so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3878 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 3878, the ``Block, Report, And       Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2019,'' that fall within       our Rule jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us       on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection       to your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 3878, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the Democratic sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4806) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to authorize  the debarment of certain registrants, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H. R. 4806         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Debarment Enforcement of Bad       Actor Registrants Act of 2020'' or the ``DEBAR Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. DEBARMENT OF CERTAIN REGISTRANTS.         Section 304 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       824) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(h) The Attorney General may issue an order to prohibit,       conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or for such       period as the Attorney General may determine, any person from       being registered under this title to manufacture, distribute,       or dispense a controlled substance or a list I chemical, if       the Attorney General finds that--        ``(1) such person meets or has met any of the conditions       for suspension or revocation of registration under subsection       (a); and        ``(2) such person has a history of prior suspensions or       revocations of registration.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4806.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4806, the Debarment Enforcement of  Bad Actor Registrants Act of 2020, or the DEBAR Act of 2020, which  gives the Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, additional tools  to go after bad actors.   The DEA is charged with enforcing and implementing policies to  protect public health and safety through the Controlled Substances Act.   One important lever DEA has at its disposal to manage diversion or  noncompliance with the law is the ability to revoke or surrender an  individual's CSA registration, which is needed to handle controlled  substances. While this is an important tool, a recent Department of  Justice Office of the Inspector General report found weaknesses in  DEA's registration process and instances where the agency did not fully  utilize its regulatory authorities to address noncompliance.  Specifically, the inspector general found cases where entities have  been able to obtain a new license after having one that was revoked.   For example, the report outlined a case that included a doctor who  was engaged in serious misconduct and had his registration revoked, who  then moved to another State under the authority of a different DEA  field division. When the doctor reapplied for registration, it was  granted.   Another example, Madam Speaker, in the report included a dentist who  had voluntarily surrendered his medical license and DEA registration on  two separate occasions. The dentist also had been convicted of a  felony, which is grounds for suspension or revocation of an  individual's registration under the CSA. However, according to DEA, the  dentist was still able to obtain another DEA registration.   Now, these errors by the DEA are simply unacceptable, Madam Speaker.  Today, we are considering H.R. 4806, which would address these errors.  The legislation would authorize the debarment of any registrant that  either meets the criteria for temporary or permanent suspension or  revocation or has a history of prior suspension or revocations.   Again, I thank my colleague Representative Latta for leading this  legislation and Ranking Member Walden and his staff for working with me  on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4806, the DEBAR       Act of 2020, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor.

Dear Chairman Pallone: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 4806, the ``Debarment       Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 2019,'' that fall       with in our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting       with us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no       objection to your including them in the bill for       consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 4806, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6096.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6096, the Reliable Emergency Alert  Distribution Improvement Act of 2020, or the READI Act, as it is known.   In times of crisis, Americans rely on communication systems to stay  informed, check on loved ones, and access emergency assistance.  Emergency alerts, in particular, are an effective mechanism for  relaying lifesaving information to the American public in an instant.   The emergency alert system, or EAS, is one tool we have to issue such  messages. Typically, an EAS message is originated by officials from  local, State, Tribal, or Federal governments, known as alerting  authorities. The messages are disseminated to the public by operators  of broadcast cable and satellite TV or radio.                                time  1345    The Wireless Emergency Alert system, or WEA, on the other hand,  allows emergency managers and other alert originators to distribute  geographically targeted emergency messages to wireless customers'  devices at a moment's notice.   Over recent months, Madam Speaker, local and State officials in  California and Oregon have used geo-targeted emergency alerts to inform  residents about wildfires and evacuation orders.   Simply put, our emergency alerting systems save lives, but there is  plenty of room for improvement.   My colleagues may recall an incident that took place in Hawaii in  January 2018 when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency mistakenly  issued an emergency alert through the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System.   The alert warned the public of an inbound ballistic missile threat,  although there was no such threat. It was intended to be a routine test  of the system, but the supervising officer who dictated the language of  the drill mistakenly included the phrase, ``This is not a drill,''  causing confusion among the shift officers responsible for transmitting  the alert to the public.   With five words, Hawaii was sent into a frenzy, which lasted about 38  minutes, until a follow-up notice was sent out correcting the error.   Now, there are more than 1,000 alerting authorities across the United  States that rely on emergency alerting systems to notify the public of  everything from law enforcement situations to evacuation and stay-at- home orders, child abductions, and natural disasters.   While the Hawaii incident was deemed an accident caused by human  error, it is clear that there are gaps that must be addressed, and that  is what this bill does.   The READI Act will ensure that there is better coordination between  the Federal agencies that deal with emergency communications and their  partners at the State and local levels. Specifically, the bill calls on  the Federal Communications Commission to work with State Emergency  Communications Committees to develop and  [[Page H5822]]  update State plans to identify and close any gaps in protocol or  accountability.   The READI Act also requires the FCC to study and report to Congress  on the feasibility of expanding participation in the Emergency Alert  System to include streaming services and internet platforms and whether  such an action would increase the reach and reliability of emergency  alerts.   Madam Speaker, I commend Representative Jerry McNerney for his  leadership on this bill, especially as his constituents and neighbors  all across California continue to grapple with the fallout from these  historic wildfires.   Madam Speaker, I also thank Ranking Member Walden and subcommittee  Ranking Member Latta for working with us to move this legislation  through the Energy and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I also thank Senator Schatz, who is leading  this legislation in the Senate.   This is a really good bill that will make emergency alerts more  effective and reliable, to keep our friends and neighbors safe when it  matters most.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the READI Act,  and I reserve the balance of my time.          House of Representatives,                  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, November 10, 2020.      Hon.

There are certain provisions in this legislation that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6096, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on the bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this Committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 6096 and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor.

Dear Chairman DeFazio: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 6096, the       Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act       of 2020, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 6096 into the       committee report on the bill and into the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), the sponsor of the legislation and a member  of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6624.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6624, the USA Telecommunications Act.   Earlier this year, the House passed, and the President signed, my  Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act to create a program to  fund the replacement of suspect network equipment. Suspect equipment,  including that produced by Huawei and ZTE, could allow foreign  adversaries to surveil Americans at home or, worse, disrupt our  communications systems.   While we are still pushing for Congress to appropriate funds to that  end, it is important to recognize that my legislation was only half the  battle, even when it is funded. We also need to create and foster  competition for trusted network equipment that uses open interfaces so  that the United States is not beholden to a market for network  equipment that is becoming less competitive.                                time  1400    This bill before us today, the Utilizing Strategic Allied  Telecommunications Act, or the USA Telecommunications Act, does just  that.   The bipartisan legislation creates a grant program and authorizes  $750 million in funding for the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration to help promote and deploy Open Radio Access  Network technologies that can spur that type of competition. We must  support alternatives to companies like Huawei and ZTE, Madam Speaker.   Today, most network equipment is produced by a handful of companies  that provide a soup-to-nuts solution, locking our networks into one  single vendor at a time. That makes it hard for new competitors to  break into the market.   Currently, there are no American vendors for the network equipment  that fuels our wireless economy. However, this legislation would  authorize the funding of grants to support the promotion and deployment  of Open Radio Access Network equipment.   By using standardized open interfaces, this type of equipment will  allow network operators in the U.S. to piece together wireless networks  that are both secure and make sense for them. And because of that, many  American companies will be able to work directly with our network  providers, hopefully spurring a domestic market for network equipment,  and that is something we desperately need.   For all of these reasons, I want to thank Representatives Guthrie and  Matsui and Ranking Member Walden for joining me in leading this  bipartisan, bicameral bill. I also want to thank the Senate sponsors,  led by Senator Warner of Virginia.   This legislation is critical for our strategic national interest, and  I urge all Members to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I also  urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7310) to require the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for  Communications and Information to submit to Congress a plan for the  modernization of the information technology systems of the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7310.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT  Modernization Act.   This country has an ever-increasing need for access to the Nation's  airwaves, and that is as true for Federal agencies as it is for average  Americans.   We use the airwaves for so many critical things: military radars, air  traffic control, space communications, our cell phones, televisions,  WiFi routers, Bluetooth speakers, and the list goes on. That is why we  must do everything we can to ensure that we are making the best, most  efficient use of our Federal airwaves.   H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT Modernization Act, takes vital steps  toward being more efficient with our airwaves by making sure that the  Federal Government has the most up-to-date systems to manage its  frequencies, sometimes called spectrum. This bill makes sure that those  systems are compatible and interoperable between Federal agencies.   The Spectrum IT Modernization Act will also help to promote more  efficient use of our Nation's airwaves by encouraging spectrum sharing  and by updating our Federal spectrum management systems.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by Communications and  Technology Subcommittee Chairman  Mike  [[Page H5827]]  Doyle and Ranking Member  Bob Latta, as well as Representative Walberg  and Representative Larsen from Washington.   More specifically, this bipartisan bill would require the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, in  consultation with the Policy and Plans Steering Group, to identify a  process to modernize our Federal spectrum management infrastructure. It  would require the NTIA to examine ways to improve coordination between  Federal agencies and improve the ability of those agencies to meet  their mission requirements in congested spectrum environments--in other  words, share spectrum.   It would require the NTIA to report back to us in less than a year's  time to tell us what the plan is for updating and improving our Federal  spectrum management, because this is something that needs to be done  sooner rather than later.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would also require the Comptroller  General of the United States to conduct oversight of the implementation  of the modernization plan submitted by the NTIA and report to Congress  annually on that process.   By managing our Federal spectrum infrastructure and making it  interoperable, Federal entities and the NTIA will be able to increase  the efficiency of Federal spectrum use. This is a good thing for our  country, and it is certainly important that we do it now.   So I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me  in voting to pass this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

TITLE VI--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 601. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2610.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2610, the Fraud and  Scam Reduction Act. This bipartisan bill was introduced by  Representatives Blunt Rochester and Walberg and advanced out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee by a voice vote.   Reducing scams and fraud is an issue of utmost importance in every  community, and especially so during these uncertain and unprecedented  times. Right now, we are, fortunately, seeing the best of humanity, but  unscrupulous scammers and fraudsters still abound seeking to capitalize  on confusion and fear.   Seniors, Mr. Speaker, are especially vulnerable. According to the  most recent report from the Federal Trade Commission, older adults  reported nearly $400 million in losses from fraud in 2018. It is rare  to recover these losses. We all need to work together to protect senior  citizens from scams before they fall victim and suffer these monetary  losses.   This bill, originally titled the Stop Senior Scams Act, establishes a  new Senior Scams Prevention Advisory Council composed of relevant  government agencies and industry representatives to collect and  implement best practices to stop scammers before they can cause harm.  It establishes a new program to prevent fraud that targets seniors. The  bill will also improve educational materials on senior scams and make  sure they are publicly available.   I want to thank Representatives Deutch and Buchanan for introducing  the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act which was incorporated in H.R. 2610  during the full committee's consideration of the bill. That legislation  establishes an office at the FTC dedicated to preventing fraud  targeting seniors and monitoring the market for such fraud.   This bill also includes the Protecting Seniors from Emergency Scams  Act which was introduced by Representatives Kelly and Marshall. This  bill streamlines efforts to protect seniors from falling prey to scams  during national emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by  establishing a searchable database of scams targeting seniors.   One often overlooked area in Federal fraud prevention efforts are  scams targeting Indian Tribes and Tribal members. The scope and scale  of scams affecting Indian Tribes has not been well-documented,  hindering efforts to prevent them. So I also want to thank  Representative Lujan--soon Governor Lujan--and also Representative  Gianforte for their work on this issue and for introducing the  Protecting Indian Tribes from Scams Act, which was also incorporated in  this bill, H.R. 2610. The legislation that they sponsored requires the  FTC to issue a report on scams targeting Indian Tribes or Tribal  members and update its website to include information on these scams.   In addition, our State attorneys general play a critical role in  enforcing and complementing Federal consumer  [[Page H5830]]  protection laws. The FTC Collaboration Act, introduced by  Representatives O'Halleran and Hudson and incorporated also into this  bill, will help the FTC optimize its collaboration with States  attorneys general by studying the matter and issuing a report on how to  further promote collaboration.   So I want to commend Representatives Blunt Rochester and Walberg for  introducing this bipartisan legislation, as well as all of the other  lead sponsors of the bills that were folded into this larger  legislative package. I also want to thank Ranking Member Walden and  subcommittee Ranking Member Rodgers for working with us to move this  bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this bill incorporates a number of  important pieces of legislation. For all those reasons, I ask my  colleagues to support the measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a number of speakers from our  committee on the various bills incorporated in this, and I will start  with the sponsor for the main bill, H.R. 2610.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms.  Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who is the chair of our Subcommittee on  Consumer Protection and Commerce. The gentlewoman has done such a  wonderful job in trying to protect us from these frauds and scams,  particularly during the coronavirus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan). Again, I thank him for all that he has  done as our Assistant Speaker and all that he has done for our Indian  Tribes.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly), who is a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would also urge passage of this bill,  which, as we mentioned, includes a lot of other bills as well and makes  up an important package dealing with fraud and scams.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6435) to direct the Federal Trade Commission to develop and  disseminate information to the public about scams related to COVID-19,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6435         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Pandemic Scams Act       of 2020''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION ABOUT SCAMS RELATED TO COVID-19.         (a) Dissemination of Information.--        (1) In general.--As expeditiously as possible after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission, in       consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, the Postmaster General, the Chief       Postal Inspector, and the Internet Crime Complaint Center,       shall develop and disseminate information to the public about       scams related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).        (2) Requirements.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the       Commission shall--        (A) include--        (i) information regarding mail, telemarketing, and internet       fraud and illegal  [[Page H5832]]       robocalls related to COVID-19 that identifies the most common       scams; and        (ii) information regarding where and how to report       instances of scams related to COVID-19, including       instructions on how to file a complaint with the appropriate       law enforcement agency;        (B) disseminate information under such paragraph in a       manner that prioritizes, and that is easily accessible by and       user-friendly to, senior citizens and people with infirmities       and disabilities;        (C) disseminate information under such paragraph on an       internet website of the Commission that serves as a source of       information for the public about scams related to COVID-19;       and        (D) regularly update the information developed and       disseminated under such paragraph to keep pace with the       changing nature of scams related to COVID-19.        (b) Database.--As expeditiously as possible after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall, in       consultation with State law enforcement agencies, the       Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the       Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services,       and other relevant Federal officials, establish a       comprehensive national database, either within or separate       from the Consumer Sentinel Network, that tracks instances of       scams related to COVID-19.        (c) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Commission'' means the Federal Trade Commission.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6435.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 6435, the Combating  Pandemic Scams Act. This bipartisan bill was introduced by  Representatives Carter, Kuster, Hudson, and Blunt Rochester. I thank  them for introducing this measure to help stem the tide of scams and  fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic.   In July, the Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on  Consumer Protection and Commerce held a hearing on increased risks  during the COVID-19 pandemic. During that hearing, we heard about all  the ways scammers are taking advantage of the ongoing national  emergency for personal gain. Whether phishing for stimulus checks or  fundraising for fake charities, scammers are exploiting Americans  already struggling financially and diverting resources away from where  they could provide desperately needed help.   One new scam that has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic is the  contact tracing scam. This scam, which involves fraudsters posing as  contact tracers from public health departments, is exacerbating the  public health crisis by undermining one of the most effective tools we  have to keep communities safe.   Instead of documenting the spread of the virus or alerting those who  might have been exposed, these scammers are only interested in duping  Americans into turning over sensitive personal information or  downloading malicious software on their device.   H.R. 6435 will establish a comprehensive national database of scams  related to COVID-19 so that the public can differentiate the real  contact tracers from the imposters and learn how to identify other  scams on their own. It will also require the Federal Trade Commission  to inform the public about mail, telemarketing, and internet scams  related to COVID-19, including how to report such scams to the  appropriate agency.   Mr. Speaker, as the pandemic continues, we will continue to see more  scams unfold, unfortunately. But this bill will make sure that the  American public is regularly updated about scams so they can protect  themselves and their loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. It is going to protect  consumers during this pandemic, and I call on all of my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chair of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8121) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on injuries and deaths  associated with consumer products, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8121         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8121.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 8121. I want to begin  by thanking Representatives Cardenas and Davis for their leadership on  the bill, the Pandemic Effects on Home Safety and Tourism Act. This  bill advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee by a voice vote.   With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing us to spend more time at home and  finding new indoor and outdoor activities suitable for social  distancing, it is critically important that we keep track of any new  trends in injuries and deaths that might be occurring.   This bill will require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  provide quarterly updates to the American public regarding the effects  of COVID-19 on home safety, including any emerging threats from either  new products or new habits from working and playing at home. This  report will assemble data from a variety of sources, including media  reports and poison control centers, in addition to the CPSC's  traditional data sources.   The bill will also identify communities or groups that may be  disproportionately affected so that we can better target efforts to  protect those communities. We already know children are particularly  vulnerable during these times as parents struggle to work remotely and  supervise children at the same time. For example, there have been  increased reports of accidental poisonings and fractures related to  bicycle and trampoline usage. It is important to identify other groups  that may also be vulnerable.   I want to thank Representatives Castor and Upton for introducing  another bill, the Protecting Tourism in the United States Act, which  was incorporated in H.R. 8121 during the committee's consideration of  the bill.   Their legislation will rebuild the tourism and travel industry, which  has struggled under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. All sectors of  the travel industry have been particularly hard hit, including hotels,  restaurants, attractions, and passenger air, rail, and rental car  sectors.   This bill requires the Department of Commerce to conduct a detailed  study and report to Congress on the effects of the pandemic on the  tourism industry, including on jobs and revenue, so that we will know  how to best direct assistance to the 16 million American workers and  families who rely on the jobs that the travel industry supports.   Again, I thank Ranking Member Walden and Subcommittee Ranking Member  Rodgers for working with us to move this bill through the Energy and  Commerce Committee. I also commend our Subcommittee Chair Schakowsky  for her relentless commitment to fighting for consumers, and  particularly for seniors, I want to say.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
