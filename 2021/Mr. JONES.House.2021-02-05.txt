 Mr. Speaker, the economy has been left in ruins by the  prior administration's historic failure of leadership. Now, millions of  Americans are out of work and we must remember that it is people with  disabilities, people of color, and especially women of color, who have  been the hardest hit.   As Members of Congress, we must do all we can to ensure everyone--and  I do mean everyone--can live in dignity. That is why I support the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 which will create 1 million new  apprenticeships.   This bill includes the Apprenticeship Access for All Act, which I am  proud to have coauthored with my colleague, Congresswoman Alma Adams.  This legislation will help remove racist and ableist barriers to  employment of our national apprenticeship system, because everyone  deserves a good-paying job no matter your race or your ability.
