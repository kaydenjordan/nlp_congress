 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pandemic and All- Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act, also known as PAHPA.   It is a good thing we are here to vote on this bill today, but the  work on this issue has been going on for a while.   We held reauthorization hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee  in June of last year and were able to pass the bill through the  committee and out of the House shortly thereafter.   We again passed PAHPA in January, which has continued to be  championed by my good friend Mrs. Brooks of Indiana.   PAHPA is important legislation that will improve our Nation's public  health, medical preparedness, and response capabilities for  emergencies. Whether it is a natural disaster, an accidental  catastrophe, or a deliberate act of terror, it is the contents of this  bill that will keep Americans safe.   This bill will upgrade our preparedness by boosting our domestic  biological surveillance systems and help upgrade our medical  countermeasures.   This bill also takes a particular look at how we address  antimicrobial resistance so we can help protect future generations from  the threat of widespread pandemic.                                time  1500    Living on the Georgia coast, my district understands the threat of  natural disasters in the form of hurricanes all too well. This bill  improves our disaster response coordination, so we minimize the human  toll of these deadly storms.   Since funding expired on September 30th of last year, the House has  voted multiple times to reauthorize PAHPA. I look forward to President  Trump signing this vital, lifesaving legislation into law.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Jerry Watkins Dixon, who passed away on Monday, May 20, at the  age of 63.   A lifelong resident of the First Congressional District of Georgia,  Mr. Dixon was born in Waycross before moving to Blackshear as a small  child.   He was constantly serving the public in Blackshear, always lending a  helping hand and trying to make the city a better place to live.  Between the United Way, Red Cross, Pierce County Chamber of Commerce,  serving on the city council, and working at the local radio station,  his life touched nearly every corner of the community.   He not only took great pride in Blackshear but also his closest  friends, who would say that if you were a friend of Jerry, you were a  friend for life.   Those who knew him best could often be found enjoying history or  music with Mr. Dixon or listening to him speaking in his radio voice.   I am proud that Mr. Dixon lived in the First Congressional District  of Georgia. His family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
