 Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 66, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, last year, in certain fringe quarters of  the Democratic Party, it seemed popular to call for packing the Supreme  Court--for expanding the number of Justices on the Court--because you  don't like their political rulings. Now, obviously, all Republicans  opposed such a radical idea. Yet many Democratic politicians, to  include Joe Biden and to include a few Senators in this Chamber  tonight, contorted themselves to avoid taking a position on this issue.  They twisted themselves into pretzels on the campaign trail to simply  say that we ought not pack the Supreme Court because we don't like  their rulings.   I offer a simple amendment, an amendment that is backed by famous  liberals like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that we should not pack the Supreme  Court.   Now, I understand the Democrats are going to raise a point of order,  saying this is not germane--yet more contortions to avoid taking a  simple stance on this issue. So I would invite my Democratic colleagues  who have said they don't want to pack the Court to simply waive this  point of order, and let's have an up-or-down vote on one of the most  fundamental tenets of the rule of law--that you do not pack the Court  because you don't like the way they rule.   I yield back my time, and I encourage your support.    Mr. President, in accordance with section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of all  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 66.                           Vote on Motion to Waive    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
