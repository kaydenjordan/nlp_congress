 Mr. Speaker, as a proud member of the LGBTQ Equality  Caucus, I rise in strong support of the Equality Act, a bill championed  by my good friend and fellow Rhode Islander, Congressman   David  Cicilline.   Mr. Speaker, every person deserves to be treated equally, no matter  who they are or whom they choose to love. But the simple fact of the  matter is that LGBT Americans face discrimination in this country every  day, whether it is in the workplace, the foster care system or the  housing market.   Mr. Speaker, discrimination is never justified, and we cannot let it  stand. As a person who lives with a disability, I know what  discrimination feels like. I have experienced discrimination many times  in my life. I don't like it when it happens to me, and I don't want it  to be experienced by anyone else. It is just plain wrong.   So, Mr. Speaker, let's celebrate our diversity by promoting a culture  of tolerance, inclusion, and acceptance, instead of one of fear and  hate. Let's treat LGBT people with the dignity and respect that they  deserve. Let's honor the strength and the courage of the LGBT people  throughout history, and let's pass the Equality Act to forever secure  the civil rights of members of the LGBT community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Cicilline, for his  leadership on this issue.
