 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my very dear friend, Bill  Jones, of Paducah, Kentucky, upon his retirement from U.S. Bank. Over  his 37 years with U.S. Bank, Bill took on numerous leadership posts  with the company and thrived in each role.   His time in the financial business totaled 45 years and spanned  significant changes in industry operations. As a leader, he was  frequently forced to adjust to modern trends to ensure customer needs  were met. And time and time again he has passed that leadership test  with flying colors.   In addition to his work in the banking industry, he has also served  his community in the Commonwealth of Kentucky on numerous boards,  including Kentucky Educational Television, Mercy Health Hospital, and  other commissions geared toward economic development.   As someone who has spent a lot of time in the banking industry  myself, I know that the industry is better off thanks to Bill's  contributions and leadership.   Bill Jones is a west Kentucky legend. On behalf of all the residents  of the First Congressional District of Kentucky, I wish Bill Jones a  very happy retirement.                            ____________________
