 Madam Speaker, I am especially thankful to Chairman  Schiff for yielding me this time since I have reached a different  conclusion on the bill than he has.   I would like to quote from the American Civil Liberties Union letter  received today. The American Civil Liberties Union strongly urges us to  vote ``no'' on this bill.   They say: ``Over the last several years, it has been abundantly clear  that many of our surveillance laws are broken.'' But that,  ``disappointingly, the reforms contained in H.R. 6172 are minimal--in  many cases merely representing a codification of the status quo. In  addition,'' the ACLU says, ``the bill contains provisions that would be  a step back from even our flawed current law.''   The ACLU goes on to say that ``the bill fails to require that  individuals receive appropriate notice and access to information when  FISA information is used against them,'' that ``the bill fails to fully  address deficiencies with the FISA court that have led to illegal  surveillance,'' that ``the bill fails to appropriately limit the types  of information that can be collected under section 215,'' that ``the  bill fails to appropriately raise the standard for collecting  information under section 215,'' and that ``the bill fails to  appropriately limit the retention of information collected under  section 215.''   I agree with the chairman that the roving wiretap provision in the  act is important and should be renewed. But I cannot support the bill  that is before us today, and I say that with tremendous respect for  Chairman Schiff. We have had very candid and useful discussions. I  appreciate the effort that he has put into this.   I have put in a lot of effort, too. But in the end, we have a bill  that I think should not be supported. I intend to vote ``no,'' with  tremendous respect for the chairman and the effort that he has put into  this.
