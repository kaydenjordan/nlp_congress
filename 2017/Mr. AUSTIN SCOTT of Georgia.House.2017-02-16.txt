 Mr. Speaker, the assertion that removing  this rule would allow for egregious, cruel, and unsporting hunting  methods is just totally false. The people of Alaska, I trust them to  manage the game of that State. The idea, the accusation that this rule  allows for shooting of wolf pups in their den is totally false.  Disturbing wolf dens for any reason--hunting, trapping, or for wildlife  management--is illegal in the State of Alaska.   The 2016-2017 Alaska Trapping Regulations state:         The following methods are illegal for taking furbearers:       You may not disturb or destroy beaver houses or any furbearer       den.    Again, the people of Alaska can be trusted to manage their game.  [[Page H1266]]    Additionally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for the  use of airplanes or helicopters to hunt is totally false. Using  aircraft is illegal in the State of Alaska. The 2016-2017 Alaska  Hunting Regulations state:         You may not take game by driving, herding, harassing, or       molesting game with any motorized vehicle such as an       aircraft, airboat, snow machine, motorboat, et cetera.    Finally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for trapping  of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leghold traps, again,  simply totally false. Trapping or snaring big game is illegal in the  State of Alaska.   The 2016-2017 Alaska Hunting Regulations state:         You may not take game by using a trap or a snare to take       big game, fur animals, or small game.    As you can see, these claims are nothing but false rhetoric from  antisportsmen that think they know better how to manage Alaska's  wildlife than the good people of Alaska do. Alaska law already  precludes these practices, yet they are being used as an emotional  argument to hide what is clearly a bureaucratic overreach which  unfairly targets the citizens of Alaska.
