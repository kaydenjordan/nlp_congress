 Madam President, it is an honor to recognize the  enormously impactful life of Governor Peter M. Pino. The Pueblo of Zia,  and New Mexico as a whole, have lost one of our greatest leaders.   Peter M. Pino devoted his entire life to serving the people of the  Pueblo of Zia. For more than four decades, he served the Pueblo of Zia  as Governor, War Chief, Tribal council member, Tribal administrator,  and treasurer. He was also a traditional spiritual leader and held a  lifetime appointment as one of the Pueblo's Keeper of Songs. As a  traditional artist, Governor Pino employed techniques passed down to  him by his Puebloan ancestors to craft works in rock, tan deer hides,  and make moccasins, bows, arrows, digging sticks, rabbit sticks, and  bone tools.   He also played an instrumental role in the Pueblo's ongoing effort to  repatriate and protect a treasured part of Zia's heritage and cultural  property, its sacred sun symbol. Almost a century after the State of  New Mexico appropriated this sacred symbol on its flag, Pino helped  lead the Pueblo's actions to seek compensation, public education and  engagement, and permission for commercial uses. Thanks to this work,  Eastern New Mexico University changed the name of its women's athletic  teams, and multiple companies have voluntarily sought permission and  advice from the Pueblo on how they will depict the symbol and  contributed proceeds from sales to a scholarship fund for Zia youth.   Governor Pino also used his deep historical and archaeological  knowledge to serve on boards and committees that advised the Crow  Canyon Archaeological Center, Mesa Verde National Park, and the Native  American Rights Fund. Governor Pino also served as vice chair of the  New Mexico Office of Indian Affairs and was the first Native American  to serve on the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission.   On a personal note, Governor Pino was one of my first mentors in  public service in New Mexico and dear friend. He shared traditional  knowledge and perspectives with me that helped form the foundation of  my respect for Tribal governments, religions, and culture. I am  heartbroken that I did not spend more time learning directly from  Governor Pino because his generosity knew no bounds. I was, however,  fortunate enough to attend a number of feast days at the Pueblo of Zia  and left the Pino home with a tighter belt and great appreciation for  the delicious and healthy traditional food that Peter and his wife  Stella embraced.   When I began advocating for land conservation in New Mexico, Governor  Pino showed me how important sacred sites and cultural landscapes are  to the Tribal nations in our State. He was also an example of  statesmanship to whom I will always look. In fact, I was able to travel  to Washington, DC, with Governor Pino when I was just a city councilor.  Observing how he interacted with my State's congressional delegation  was a very formative experience.   Watching him work to protect the Ojito Wilderness and reclaim lands  from the Bureau of Land Management that contained cultural sites also  taught me how critical it is for Tribes to have a meaningful seat at  the table in conservation and land management decisions.   My thoughts are with Governor Pino's family and the Pueblo of Zia  during this time of mourning. His legacy will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
