 Mr. President, I would like to propound a unanimous  consent request. I think colleagues know we have run a little bit  behind. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be  recognized next for her remarks and that I be recognized to close the  debate on Mr. Jorjani and be allowed to speak for up to 15 minutes. I  think we would end up being about 10 minutes late or thereabouts,  between 20 of and quarter of.   I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for up to 15 minutes  after the Senator from Iowa has finished her remarks.    Mr. President, there is a job opening at the Interior  Department, and that can mean only one thing: another Trump nominee  who, incredibly, is already under investigation for misconduct, even  before his first day on the job. This time, it is Daniel Jorjani, a  long-serving Trump Interior official who is up for a powerful role as  the Department's Solicitor.   I say to the Presiding Officer and colleagues, I have put a hold on  this nominee. If anything, the case for withholding action on this  nominee has gotten greater in the last few days. Just in the last few  days, the Department's inspector general has made it clear that this is  an individual he is going to investigate. I will tell my colleagues  that, if you are putting somebody already under investigation on a fast  track to the Interior Department corruption hall of fame, right up  there with Ryan Zinke, I believe that is a mistake the Senate is going  to regret.   It probably doesn't take an inspector general investigation to  uncover why this is a mistake. I am going to explain it this morning,  briefly.   First, I believe it is important to start with an honest assessment  of what Donald Trump appointees have done at the Interior Department.  Under this President, it is often difficult for one agency's corruption  to stand out above the rest, but somehow Interior Department officials  manage to do that again and again.   Mr. Jorjani, a former industry adviser for Koch Industries, is an  example of just this type of behavior. The Office of the Interior  Solicitor is in charge of legal issues and ethics for the Department.  It is a big team with a lot of power. Mr. Jorjani has been a key member  of the Solicitor's office.   His own words indicate that he doesn't believe that his primary  function at Interior is to protect public lands and uphold ethical  standards. We have already heard discussion earlier this morning that  he wrote to agency colleagues--and we have been quoting it--saying  ``our job is to protect the Secretary.'' Those are his words, not the  words of anybody here in the Senate. What Senators may not know is that  Mr. Jorjani was talking about Ryan Zinke, who brought on a category 5  ethical hurricane during his brief time as Interior Secretary.   In the same email, Mr. Jorjani boasted about having impeded inspector  general investigations into the misuse of taxpayer funds for travel. It  wasn't just talk. The record shows that covering up dirty ethics and  potential lawbreaking is routine for Mr. Jorjani. By my count, there  are at least four investigations into wrongdoing at the Interior  Department that were closed or found inconclusive due to a lack of  cooperation or records production on Mr. Jorjani's watch.   These investigations covered a multitude of issues, from the  potential misuse of expensive chartered travel to a halted study on the  crucial health impacts of potentially dangerous Interior Department  energy policies.   Then there is the issue of the Interior Department's new policy under  the Trump administration with respect to the Freedom of Information  Act. The new policy--and again, this is a retreat from public interest  standards--gives political appointees unprecedented control over the  Department's response to Freedom of Information Act requests. In my  view, it looks like an effort to conceal the fact that Trump Interior  officials are spending their days doing the bidding of a host of  special interests.   There is clear evidence that this new secretive Freedom of  Information Act policy was implemented under the Trump administration,  that Mr. Jorjani knew about it, and that he was up to his eyeballs in  putting this in motion.   When I asked Mr. Jorjani about the Freedom of Information Act policy  during an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, Mr. Jorjani  actually claimed it didn't exist. He later told one of our colleagues,  the distinguished Senator from Maine, Mr. King, that he had no  involvement in Freedom of Information Act responses.   I want it understood that I believe Mr. Jorjani lied to the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee and perjured himself to that body.   Colleagues, I know that Members on both sides are concerned about  what has happened with the Freedom of Information Act under this  administration. I want to commend the several Republican Senators who  have said that they are troubled about what this administration is  doing with the Freedom of Information Act--the so-called ``awareness  reviews'' by appointees that really aren't hard to figure out. It is  about secretive political interference.   What we are seeing with the Freedom of Information Act is  inconsistent with the intent of Congress, and it is wrong. The  importance of government openness and honesty with the American people  ought to be a bipartisan proposition. It is in the interest of  everyone--Democrats and Republicans--to protect the Freedom of  Information Act from evasion and protect it from abuse. That is part of  why this new Interior policy on the Freedom of Information Act is so  troubling.   As I mentioned, on Friday, the Interior inspector general confirmed  to me that Mr. Jorjani is currently under investigation for his role in  this Freedom of Information Act policy. For colleagues who may be  following this, let's just understand what is going on: We are getting  ready to vote on whether to advance somebody who is under a formal  inspector general investigation. The fact that the inspector general is  investigating such a serious matter ought to be enough all by itself to  stop this nomination from going forward.   Certainly, Mr. Jorjani's own words about how he views the job--not  about protecting the public but about protecting someone like Ryan  Zinke--ought to be disqualifying. If Mr. Jorjani is confirmed, the  person who will be in charge of ethics at the Interior Department told  colleagues his job was to protect a crook. That is what he said.   Colleagues, this administration in too many instances has made deceit  and unethical conduct the norm at the Interior Department. Trump  officials have sidelined the Department's core purpose, which is to  protect our treasured public lands on behalf of all Americans. Too  often, it seems, they side with special interests that will pollute  America's air, poison the drinking water, fuel climate change, and  destroy the treasures that Americans all love.   At some point the U.S. Senate ought to draw the line. I think the  Jorjani nomination is such a place.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination. I urge my colleagues  to join me in voting no.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S5642]]         Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, Huawei presents a very real threat to the  security of every American, both individually and collectively. I have  long been concerned that the Trump administration was going to let  Huawei off the hook in order to get a politically useful trade deal. As  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has  jurisdiction over trade matters, that concerns me greatly. In addition,  I am concerned that the resolution being offered does not go far enough  to protect America's national security and hold the Trump  administration accountable.   Tomorrow there will be another bipartisan measure offered that, in my  view, will better address the concerns I have just mentioned, and  therefore I must object this afternoon.    Mr. President, our laws and rules don't work unless they  work for everyone. Individuals and small businesses should have the  same rights--and the same ability to enforce those rights--as big  corporations. I agree that individual creators are less likely than  Disney or Sony to reap the full benefits of the copyright system when  their creations are stolen for unfair commercial gain. That is a  problem. However, the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement  Act (CASE Act) of 2019 is not the right solution.   The CASE Act would create an extrajudicial, virtually unappealable  tribunal that could impose statutory damages of $30,000 on an  individual who posts a couple of memes on social media, even if the  claimant sustained little or no economic harm. Even the threat of such  a judgment could stifle the legitimate fair use of content and be a  boon to copyright trolls who harass and threaten innocent internet  users to win settlements. That is a terrible result for freedom of  expression, and it isn't even the type of activity the supporters of  this bill are trying to target.   Our copyright system is a careful balance between protecting our  First Amendment values and ensuring that authors, photographers,  graphic designers, and other creators can protect their works and earn  a living. The CASE Act does not get the balance right, and that is why  I am placing a hold on this bill.   For these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent agreement  to take up or pass the CASE Act by unanimous consent.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, scores and scores of my friends and  neighbors at home in Oregon have been grieving since they learned the  sad news about the passing of a remarkable woman, Mary Gautreaux, who  died at her home over the weekend.   Mary Gautreaux was an astounding bundle of energy and passion. She  had an incandescent smile, a huge heart for people who didn't have any  power and clout, and the ability to make just about everybody she met  more optimistic about the policies, opportunities, for the days ahead.   Mary came to our office back in the 1990s, after working at the U.S.  Forest Service, planting trees and fighting fires. I can tell you that  no resume or job title could have ever captured what Mary Gautreaux was  all about or how hard she worked to protect the qualities that make  Oregon different--the very special place she was proud to call home.   Mary Gautreaux, simply stated, was an all-star Oregonian. She loved  her family and her coworkers with fierce loyalty. All of Mary's friends  and neighbors knew, up close and personal, what an indomitable force  she was. It didn't matter where you lived--from Portland to Burns and  everywhere in between, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, the left,  the right, mayors, county officials, everybody liked being with Mary.  They liked working with Mary. They admired her professionalism, and  they were so impressed that she always tried to involve everybody. She  always wanted everybody to believe that they were special, that they  counted. That is something we will always remember.   My office saw her as an anchor, as I did personally. For the better  part of two decades, she and I traveled to hundreds of townhalls and  community meetings in every nook and cranny of our State.   Mary and I always shared a kind of special joke. At one of these town  meetings, somebody invariably would ask me something that I didn't know  a lot about, and I would always say the same thing. I would say: Folks,  I want you to know I am really digging into that issue, but Mary  Gautreaux is one of the leading authorities on the subject.   She would be rolling her eyes. Then I would say: Well, feel free to  call Mary on nights and weekends. She is always available for people.   My sense is that she got a kick out of it the first hundred times I  did that. It was a special kind of bond we had, and that was vintage  Mary Gautreaux.   But the fact is, she really did make herself available--always, any  time, any day. She was always ready to pick up the phone and travel the  State to solve a problem.   If I were to talk about all of the accomplishments and all of the  results she produced for the people of Oregon, we would be here until  New Year's Eve 2020. But I do want to talk about a handful that stand  out for their exceptional breadth and impact.   Mary Gautreaux was an early advocate of reopening the Willamette  River for the benefit of everybody in Portland. She knew it had the  potential to be a treasure for the community. She was out there  swimming every chance she could get, and she loved every time she could  get out into the Willamette. But she recognized that not everybody had  her physical abilities. So as was always her way, when Mary recognized  a problem that needed fixing, she got to work. She pushed locally with  the city and community activists to get a ladder installed at a popular  swim spot.   As a result of this kind of effort and, frankly, her imagination--I  don't know  [[Page S5671]]  that finding ladders is always in the job description, she just figured  out how more people could have the opportunity to get in and out of the  Willamette safely and take a swim in one of the country's most  impressive urban rivers.   The whole metropolitan area of my hometown has her to thank for other  important achievements. We have exceptional drinking water. Mary was  instrumental in the creation of Portland's Bull Run water reserve being  still, I believe, the only urban water source closed to people,  entirely, for its protection. Everybody in Oregon, as they learn about  this--because Mary never sought any publicity for herself--really has  to thank Mary Gautreaux for that effort.   She really went to bat for rural Oregonians. She recognized, because  I lived in southeast Portland and she lived in northeast, we loved  Portland, but we didn't have the job of representing the ``state of  Portland.'' Our job is to get into every nook and cranny of our State,  and, particularly, when so many rural communities are so hard-hit, Mary  would be there, helping small airports, tiny airports get bigger,  helping veterans who couldn't get over icy roads to get to healthcare  in the urban areas. She would help, from food pantries to rural  hospitals. She did everything to make sure that, in those small  communities, they would understand that they counted.   Sometimes people would point out to her: A lot of those communities  had more cows than people. I always thought to myself: I probably  didn't have the cows with me half the time, either.   That wasn't Mary's measure of public service. Mary's measure was to  make sure that nobody was left behind.   One of her recent accomplishments for rural Oregon is also going to  be treasured for a long time: the designation of the Frank and Jeanne  Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area.   Frank Moore and Mary had a wonderful bond. Frank is a World War II  hero. After the war, he came home to the Umpqua River. He has guided  generations of fishing families on the river for years and years. Now  he is 96. Mary made a judgment a few years ago. She was concerned that  Frank might not get the designation and recognition he deserved while  he was alive.   Mary basically pushed and pushed and pushed in order to make sure  that the legislation I just mentioned would pass and actually get done.  What a wonderful party we had for Frank Moore. If there was something  Mary Gautreaux loved, it was a good party. You will hear a little more  about that in just a moment.   On the national level, in southern Oregon, Mary's work on the  designation of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument created unique  wilderness protections, unique protections for ranchers and  environmental folks. It is something that is going to be a model for  generations to come. She was the key to the creation of the Badlands  Wilderness. I remember when Mary Gautreaux pulled it off, people said:  Because of Mary, it was a good day for the Badlands.   It is a wonderful accomplishment for folks in Central Oregon. In  eastern Oregon, Mary's work on the East Moraines in the Wallowas was  significant. She helped Oregonians everywhere, and she always tried to  look ahead. Mary was one of the first who recognized in our State that  recreation would be a powerful economic engine for years to come,  billions of dollars coming into the State. There would be jobs for  everybody from kayakers, to guides, to craft brewers. It was a huge  economic multiplier.   What did we get out of it? We also got a chance to have a new focus  on recreation. We have seen the creation of Oregon's Office of  Recreation. It is a State office borne out of Mary's tireless work,  organizing people all over the State to highlight the 7 Wonders of  Oregon. I am here to say tonight that Mary Gautreaux, for lots of us,  was the 8th Wonder of Oregon.   All of these achievements are part of her enduring legacy in our  State, places people will visit, lands that are protected, ranchers,  environmentalists. They are people who, before Mary showed up, might  hardly ever talk to each other, let alone work together. She figured  out a way to find common ground and achieve what I have just described.   I want to talk a little bit about travels with Mary, the laughs that  we had on the long car rides, bouncing around ideas, occasionally a  passionate debate on something that was important to Mary. She always  recognized--like Patton, Mary knew that an Army marches on its stomach.  She generously stocked our car with apples and oranges and fruits and  every manner of snacks--some healthy, some perhaps not so healthy--as  we drove around Oregon.   Let me tell you something, when Mary Gautreaux saw hungry folks as we  made our way through the State of Oregon, what she did along the way is  made sure the car--because she didn't want anybody to go hungry--got a  whole lot lighter because she gave away so much healthy food to hungry  folks who were hurting.   No task seemed trivial or thankless. I will tell you, when you rode  around in a car with her--and, you know, most of the time in  government, people are talking about bills and amendments or polls and  the like. What Mary was always talking about was how it might be  possible to help more people at the next stop. The key was, at the end  of a trip, she would always say to a person or two: Give me your phone  number. I want to be able to stay in touch. I want to check in.   That is the way she was, and sometimes, she would ask them to give  her a name or two of somebody else they were worried about who had  fallen on hard times--and Mary would reach out to them.   Another memory I wanted to share is a little bit raw, and the Senate  may know how it is going to play out in the months ahead. A few months  ago, while she lay in her hospital bed coming to terms with a fresh  diagnosis of terminal cancer, she learned that a group of young doctors  at the Oregon Health and Sciences University had been in training to do  a rotation in Ontario, OR, in Malheur County--a city of 11,000 people,  the gateway to the Owyhee Canyonlands, spectacular high desert  landscapes that were near and dear to Mary's heart. But it seemed these  young doctors never got to go outside.   Mary said: We better do something for all these young doctors. So she  began asking for their supervisor so she could help these young doctors  get out into the landscape.   I do want people to know that there is going to be an opportunity to  enjoy that landscape, work in that landscape, particularly in  traditional industries like agriculture, to a great extent because of  what Mary inspired in Malheur County. She dedicated her last days  talking to anyone and everyone who she thought could come together and  help stabilize the small community in eastern Oregon.   I want people to be able to picture it because Nancy and I went to  Mary's home in northeast Portland over these last difficult weeks. Mary  always managed to cheer us up, rather than vice versa. One of the  things that finally made us smile--and the hospice folks nearby--her  whole room was built around the maps of the Owyhee, where she was  looking at places for various uses that would be appropriate, how to  protect the beauty of this extraordinary part of Oregon.   You would talk to her about the beauty. She would always say that the  first time she saw it, it brought tears to her eyes when she viewed it,  and she so wanted to help the ranchers and folks in that area. She was  dedicated to preserving this part of the world.   It was Mary Gautreaux's dying wish that we could make this possible.  Many of my colleagues may have seen me waiting on the floor of the  Senate over the last few hours. Our chair, Senator Murkowski, has had a  busy schedule today. When I chaired the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, we worked very close together. Lisa Murkowski has a big  heart too. She is always interested in trying to bring people together.   I told Chair Murkowski that, very shortly, I was going to be  introducing legislation to recognize Mary's extraordinary work in  Malheur County. We were going to have a community board, a community  board to empower the ranchers and the small businesses and the families  that had been there for years and wanted to know that there was a  future. We wanted to call it the Mary Gautreaux Malheur County  Community Empowerment for Owyhee Act,  [[Page S5672]]  or the Mary Gautreaux Malheur County CEO Act.   Stay tuned because you are going to hear me talk more about Mary's  extraordinary efforts in this regard.   In the meantime, this weekend, we are going to do what Mary Gautreaux  wanted us to do. We talked to her about it. We said: Mary, we want to  make sure that we tell Oregon--and in this case, the country--about  your life and your accomplishments and how much we loved you.   The way we are going to show her how much we loved her, this weekend,  we are going to do what she wanted. We are going to have one heck of a  giant party in her neighborhood, at her home, in northeast Portland. We  are bringing together friends and family. She has so many of them.   I am looking down this row. I guess we broke most of the rules of the  Senate because you are only supposed to have a couple of people here.  As far as I can tell, the people I am honored to represent in the U.S.  Senate--there are more than 4 million of them--half of them would have  showed up and sat with the folks on that row if they could have.   This weekend, we are going to have a chance to tell each other  stories. We are going to have a chance to talk about all of the people  Mary helped. I am working now--because Mary loved bright colors--to  make sure that her home and everybody there really sees what she  wanted, was a lot of color and a lot of passion and a lot of friends  and a lot of people talking about what a special place Oregon is and  all these young people, who have done so much, are building on her  approach for bringing people together, her values of caring, standing  up for people who didn't have very much and were outside the power  circle of Washington.   This is a hard talk to give, but it is sure easy to always remember  what a wonderful person Mary Gautreaux was, how she represented the  very best our State has been able to offer.   I told her privately right before she died: Mary, we love you. We  will always be thinking of you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
