 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, while we are awaiting others to come to  the Senate floor, let me express my deep sorrow about learning of the  deaths of two more police officers who responded to safeguard all of us  in the Capitol on January 6.   My heart goes out to their families and their fellow officers, both  here on Capitol Hill and also in the District of Columbia police force.   I am wearing a button that was given to me several years ago after  the Capitol Police, once again, acted heroically. It says: ``Thank you,  Capitol Police.''   I hope each and every one of us will take time today to thank these  courageous men and women who are working so hard to keep us safe and  many of whom still bear the physical injuries and the emotional trauma  of that dark day in our Nation's history.                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, I would like now to turn to briefly speak about the  broadband provisions that are included in the infrastructure package.  My friend and colleague Senator Jeanne Shaheen, from New Hampshire, and  I worked with a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  craft this package.   The pandemic that we have endured for more than a year laid bear the  disparities in access to high-speed internet. It made it difficult for  children to be educated online, impossible for some individuals to work  at home, and removed the possibility of telemedicine consultations for  some of our sick and seniors.   The fact is that approximately 19 million Americans still lack access  to high-speed internet. We talk a lot in this bill about bridges and  building bridges, and we do need to do that. Well, it is time for us to  bridge America's digital divide and build a 21st-century broadband  infrastructure that will meet our country's needs not only today but  for years to come, to be future-proof, if you will.   The bipartisan infrastructure plan invests $65 billion to address our  Nation's digital divide once and for all, and I would note that that is  in addition to the previous funding that we provided in the COVID bills  to help bridge the digital divide.   Also, in the March $1.9 trillion bill, there is language that was  authored by Senator Manchin that allows States to use some of the  allocation that they receive to invest in broadband. In addition, I am  hopeful that we will consider and adopt an amendment that Senator  Cornyn has authored that will give more flexibility to States to invest  in broadband, using some of the allocation that they received.   Our bill, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,  would provide more than $42 billion in grants to States for deployment.  It does not favor particular technologies or providers, and projects  would have to meet a minimum download-upload build standard of 100 over  20 megabits per second.   The funding includes a 10-percent set-aside for high-cost areas, and  each State, territory, and the District of Columbia would receive an  initial minimum allocation, a portion of which could be used for  technical assistance and supporting or establishing a State broadband  office. In my State of Maine, the Governor has used some of those COVID  funds in order to establish a new Maine Connect Authority that will be  very helpful.   States would be required to prioritize deployment in unserved areas  first. That is so important. Then they could move to underserved areas.   I talked to a selectman recently from Swans Island off the coast of  Maine. They desperately need access to broadband services, and they do  not have it. I am thinking of what a difference it would make to the  lives of the people who live on that island. I have also talked to  people in Northern Maine, for example, in the town of Easton, ME, where  one family told me that it would cost $15,000 for them to be connected  to the internet. They don't have that kind of money. Few people in  Maine do.   That is why there is another part of our bill that speaks to  affordability, and in this provision, we plussed up to $14.2 billion.  Additional funds would be devoted to subsidize broadband service for  eligible households that meet needs-based criteria. An example would be  eligibility for school lunches. This allocation of funds is so  important to rural America as well as unserved areas in our inner  cities.   The bill that we have before us includes $2 billion to support  programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including  the ReConnect Program that provides loans and grants or a combination  to fund the construction, acquisition, and improvement of facilities  and equipment that provides broadband service in rural areas.   Supplementing that are private activity funds, where $600 million has  been allocated. This is based on a bill that was introduced by Senator  Hassan and Senator Capito, another bipartisan bill that is called the  Rural Broadband Financing Flexibility Act. It would allow States to  issue private activity bonds to finance broadband deployment,  specifically, for projects in rural areas where a majority of the  households do not have access to broadband.   We also included an additional $2 billion for the Tribal Broadband  Connectivity Program, which was established by the COVID bill that we  passed in December and is administered by the NTIA in the Department of  Commerce.   Grants from this program will be made eligible--will be made  available to eligible Native American, Alaska Native, and Native  Hawaiian entities for broadband deployment as well as for digital  inclusion, workforce development, telehealth, and distance learning.   Our bill also includes $2.75 billion for the Digital Equity Act,  which was introduced by Senators Murray, Portman, and King.   It establishes two NTIA-administered grant programs that would help  communities that have not yet secured the skills, technologies, and  support needed to take advantage of broadband connection.   In that regard, I would note an article that appeared this morning in  Roll Call that is entitled ``Industry groups, equity advocates applaud  infrastructure bill's broadband provisions.'' I am proud of that. We  worked very hard to make sure that there was widespread support for  this legislation, particularly the broadband provisions.   We also included additional funding, $1 billion, for the so-called  middle mile. This would create a State grant program for the  construction, improvement, and acquisition of middle mile  infrastructure.   And I would note that eligible entities include telecommunications  companies, technology companies, electric utilities, utility  cooperatives, a wide range of businesses and organizations that could  help us with that middle mile.   And that refers to the installation of a dedicated line that  transmits a signal to and from the internet point of presence.   Competition of middle mile routes is necessary--completion of those  middle mile routes is necessary to serve areas and reduce capital  expenditures and lower operating costs.   So originally we had $500 million for this; the final package has $1  billion, at the request of certain Members from the Presiding Officer's  side of the aisle.    So my point is that the broadband provisions in this bill are going  to make such a difference. We are in an era where, I think most of us  would agree, that access to high-speed internet is another way that we  connect, just as roads and bridges are ways that we connect. We connect  to family members; we connect to friends; we connect to our colleagues  at work; we connect to healthcare providers; we connect to educators;  and it is absolutely essential that we make this investment, and it is  a generous investment, so that we can eliminate the disparities that  were laid bare by the pandemic and bring high-speed internet to every  section of our country.   The technologies may differ, the providers will certainly not be the  same,  [[Page S5685]]  but this investment will make a real difference to so many Americans  who today still lack access to high-speed internet.   I see the Republican leader has arrived on the floor.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
