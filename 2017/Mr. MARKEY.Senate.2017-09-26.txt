 Thank you, Mr. President.   I would like to start my remarks today by offering my prayers and my  support to the people of Puerto Rico and to their family members and  friends here in the United States, many of whom have still not been  able to get information about their loved ones.   Massachusetts is home to the fifth largest Puerto Rican community in  the mainland United States. It is a vibrant community, an engaged  community, and since Hurricanes Irma and Maria, it has been a mobilized  community. They are horrified by the images that are emerging from the  island, pictures and videos of destroyed homes and of the massive  flooding and widespread devastation. These images are difficult for any  of us to see, and for those who have family there, these scenes beg for  immediate action. Thousands of families are homeless, infrastructure is  almost beyond repair, and much of the population will be without power  for an indefinite period of time going into the future.   We need to act now. We must treat Puerto Rico just like any other  U.S. State that is experiencing a natural disaster. That means that the  United States should continue deploying its military and civilian  assets to provide lifesaving search-and-rescue, food, shelter, and  power to residents of the island. Congress must also act to immediately  provide additional aid and funding so that the island can begin the  long process of rebuilding.   Puerto Ricans, like Texans, like Louisianans, and like Floridians,  are U.S. citizens. They are our sisters and brothers, and it is our  moral obligation to provide them with help and relief in this time of  their greatest need.   As we debate healthcare, let's remember that in the wake of these  devastating storms, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will have  enormous public health needs. They will be subject to an increased risk  of disease transmission from a lack of clean drinking water, to  physical injury from the storm, and to mental and behavioral trauma  from the remarkable losses they are suffering. For those who are  suffering from chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cancer and  heart disease, finding and accessing treatment will be a daily  struggle. Puerto Rico is a medical tragedy that is happening right  before our eyes. History will judge us by how quickly we respond to  this catastrophe.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, we should remember that this debate over healthcare is  not confined to just this week, and it is certainly not confined to  this building or even to this mainland.   Yesterday, I held an emergency roundtable with the leading healthcare  leaders in Massachusetts. These are the healthcare heroes who provide  compassion and treatment each day to their patients. They all spoke  poignantly about the devastation that would come from repealing and  replacing the Affordable Care Act.   Dr. Peter Slavin, president of Massachusetts General Hospital, said:  ``To repeal the [Affordable Care Act] would be a horrible sin for this  country.''   Yet that is exactly what the Graham-Cassidy bill is. It is a cruel  and inhumane sin that would damn millions of American families.   In some cases, this most recent TrumpCare proposal is even worse than  the failed bills before it. The bill proposed the use of a totally  subjective formula which was changed at the whim of the bill's sponsors  to entice more Republicans to vote in favor of it. The bill was nothing  more than something that had political plastic surgery that had been  performed, but it was fundamentally the same bill.   At the roundtable I held in Boston yesterday, Dr. Henry Dorkin,  president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, said: ``I fear that if  Graham-Cassidy were to pass, we would go back to attending more  funerals of children.''   There is simply no reason to go back to a time when people died of  preventable or treatable conditions simply because they did not have  access to insurance.   Just moments ago, we learned that the Republican leadership will not  hold a vote on this disastrous bill. They simply did not have the  votes. Right now, millions of Americans are again breathing a sigh of  relief.  [[Page S6113]]    I applaud my colleagues Senator John McCain of Arizona, Senator Susan  Collins of Maine, and others in this Chamber who are calling for a  bipartisan process to strengthen and improve our healthcare system. We  have done it before on the opioid crisis. We have done it on  Alzheimer's and other medical research funding. I still believe we can  do it here. We need to do what we have done so many times before and  focus on bipartisan solutions instead of partisan exercises.   I hope we can put Graham-Cassidy and other TrumpCare proposals behind  us and embrace bipartisan negotiations led by Senators Alexander and  Murray to stabilize the individual health insurance market.   Just last week, Senators Wyden and Hatch introduced bipartisan  legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for  5 more years. There are a number of bipartisan healthcare issues that  need immediate attention this week, such as the funding for community  health centers and extending the number of Medicare policies.   This bill was not our only option. It is not even really an option,  at least not for those Americans with preexisting conditions, who are  on Medicaid, or who need opioid treatment.   We need to work together in this Chamber to improve health in a way  that works for all Americans regardless of where they live or who their  Governor is. That is the responsibility of those who serve here, and  now let us have a new beginning, where we begin to work together to  solve those problems.   I yield the floor.
