 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express support for a  resolution I filed to honor the heroic women who have dedicated  themselves to serving our country with devotion and distinction by  designating March 10 through March 16 as National Women Veterans  Recognition Week. This observance would celebrate the achievement of  our female veterans and raise awareness to the unique challenges they  face.   Women are now the fastest growing segment of the veteran community.  Approximately 2 million women in the United States are veterans.   Florida hosts the Nation's largest segment of population of women  veterans, especially in Duval County, in my district, which has the  largest number of female veterans in the State.   I want to take this time to recognize one of my distinguished  staffers, Sherry Barfield, who was recently recognized as one of the  Northeast Florida Women Veterans Center's 2019 Women Who Rock.                            ____________________
