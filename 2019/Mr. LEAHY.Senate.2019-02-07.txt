 Mr. President, on Thursday, January 24, a good friend of  mine, former Daily News photographer Harry Hamburg, died. Both Marcelle  and I were in shock at the news. Harry is one  [[Page S1110]]  of our dearest friends, and Marcelle and I loved him.   I have lost count of the times we would share stories about his son  Bruce and daughter Aren, and, of course, his grandchildren, Sophia,  Ali, Dylan, and Will. Marcelle and I especially enjoyed the family  conversations and the deep love he had for his late wife Becky. I think  we knew more about each other's families than most people would. One of  us would tell a story, and the other would say, ``Oh, that reminds  me,'' and away we would go. Those of you who knew Harry Hamburg could  see that happening.   We also shared a love of photography. I have an office here in the  Capitol with a great view of the Mall and the Washington Monument, and  we would often meet there. We would talk about photography, current  events, and friends. We called it ``prayer hour with holy water.'' We  had our own particular choices of what holy water and what proof.  Occasionally, Marcelle was able to join us. Often, my policy adviser,  Kevin McDonald, was there.   And, of course, Harry was a welcomed friend at all of our holiday  parties and office gatherings.   Kevin McDonald went to the funeral in Pennsylvania. He filled me in  on how moving it was and the things he heard there. Even last night,  when we were at my grandson Patrick's birthday party, our daughter and  son-in-law, Alicia and Lawrence, talked about the conversations they  had with Harry at our last office gathering.   Those of us who enjoy or care about photography can understand the  certain bond we had. He had an uncanny ability to email me the perfect  picture at the perfect time. I could be coping with all kinds of things  here in the Senate, and a photo would arrive. There is one Harry took  in England, South Africa, or Pennsylvania. Some I called my warning  shot. It would be a picture he took as he walked into the Capitol to  come visit me. Every time, it made my day better.   Anyone can use a camera. Only an artist can take a picture that truly  lasts. He spent a lot of time in England. All of us could take pictures  of Big Ben, the Eye, Parliament, and all the rest. He would take  pictures of a shop on a small street or of people looking out at a bus  going by or of walking along a beach. You would look at that picture  and say: Wow, I was there.   He was an artist. When you saw his pictures, whether of a current  event or from his treasure of historical pictures, you were there. He  enveloped you in the moment.   Later, I am going to put into the Record--not quite yet--his  obituary. Of course, we will not be able to show the pictures.   I look at these pictures, and I remember he had one of Margot Kidder  and Christopher Reeve. They were filming Superman at the New York Daily  News building.   I know for a fact that Christopher Reeve liked that photograph, and  for those of us who saw the movie--millions and millions of dollars  making the movie--this picture captures as much as anything else in the  movie.   Or a serious one--Attorney General Ashcroft testifies before the  House, but he gets a picture as he raises his hand with the Great Seal  of the Senate behind him.   You know, we have all been to hearings, and we have heard people talk  about different things.   He had two pictures of Muhammad Ali and our friend Michael Fox  speaking at a Senate hearing, talking about research for Parkinson's  disease. They both suffered from Parkinson's, and they pretended to be  trading punches with each other. It was obviously in fun, but there was  not a person who picked up the paper and saw that photo who did not  read the article about Parkinson's and the need for research funding.   That is what he would do. He enveloped you in the moment. You were  there. That may seem like a cliche, but it was not. You knew what  happened.   Every one of us remembers most the photographs we have seen of  historical events. He had photographs of historical events, but he had  photographs of everyday life that made you think.   Marcelle and I knew he faced serious surgery. His good friend Paul  Hosefros made plans to come from England. He is a good friend of his,  and he was going to help take care of him--as well as his good friend  Pat and his son and daughter--when he recovered from the surgery.   We reminded him, of course, that Marcelle is a registered nurse. We  were ready to volunteer too. Before the surgery happened, he had a  massive attack and died. All of us were ready to care for him, have him  come back, take out the camera, compare photographs, have our prayer  hour, whether it was with me or with anybody else and his friends,  because he had so many.   Both Marcelle and I loved him. The tears we have shed are tears for  the loss of a true friend, and the memory of Harry will always be in  our hearts.   I know that no obituary could do justice to his talent, artistry, and  humanity, but I was struck by the obituary in the New York Daily News.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that obituary be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Daily News, Jan. 25, 2019]        Harry Hamburg, Longtime Daily News Photographer, Dies at 73                            (By Leonard Greene)         Former Daily News photographer Harry Hamburg, whose lens       captured all that is New York and the world for nearly 40       years, died Thursday. He was 73.        A longtime friend, Bill Auth, said Hamburg suffered a heart       attack.        Friends and colleagues said Hamburg had all the technical       and artistic skills to take a show-stopping picture, but what       made him stand out from the rest were his contacts. Access,       he said, was everything.        ``Harry was friends with everybody,'' said Auth, a fellow       photographer who had known Hamburg since the early 1980s.       ``He never burned a bridge. He was always, always making sure       whoever he was working with got treated right.''        Hamburg spent most of his career taking pictures in New       York. One of his most iconic snapshots was a picture       ``Superman'' stars Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder inside       The News' East Side building.        But when News editors decided they needed more original       content from the nation's capital, they dispatched Hamburg to       Washington, D.C.        Soon, Hamburg, who lived in New Jersey, was schmoozing with       Amtrak staffers, conversing with conductors on a first-name       basis.        Hamburg made another friend along the way--Joe Biden, the       Delaware senator who would go on to be Vice President.        Biden was famously an Amtrak regular who took the train       from Capitol Hill to his Delaware home every day. Hamburg       learned Biden's schedule, and made a point to be on the train       when Biden got on in Wilmington.        ``He was friends with senators and friends with elevator       operators,'' Auth said. ``Everybody really liked him once       they got to know him a little bit.''     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
