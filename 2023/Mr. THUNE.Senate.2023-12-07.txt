 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if Democrats were unsure about Republicans'  seriousness about including meaningful border security provisions in  the national security supplemental, yesterday's vote made it crystal  clear. Every single Senate Republican rejected Democrats' collective  attempt to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that what is  happening at our southern border isn't a threat to our security.   Border security is national security, which is why any national  security supplemental that moves through this Chamber must tackle this  crisis head-on.   On Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee and told Members:         I've never seen a time where all the threats or so many of       the threats are all elevated all at exactly the same time.    Senator Graham then asked Wray to comment on the threat environment  using the blinking red lights analogy often used about warnings before  the September 11 attacks. And Director Wray responded:         I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.    ``I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.''   It is against the background of this threat environment that  Republicans are asking Democrats to finally--and I say finally--help  secure our border.   We have endured 3, now, recordbreaking years of illegal immigration  at our southern border under President Biden, and the situation is only  getting worse.   Tuesday saw a staggering 12,000 migrant encounters at our southern  border--12,000 in just 1 day. That is 8 people per minute, and that  follows 2 days of 10,000-plus encounters. I am not sure how anyone can  look at these numbers and not think this is a crisis.   Plus, those numbers don't count any ``got-aways''--those are  individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend--who may  have made their way across the border during that same period. The  month of October saw an average of roughly 1,000 ``got-aways'' per day.  That is roughly 30,000 unknown individuals who made their way into our  country--30,000 in just 1 month. All told, there have been more than  1.7 million known ``got-aways'' on President Biden's watch, not to  mention an unknown number of unknown ``got-aways.''   These ``got-aways'' are not the migrants who are showing up, hoping  to be apprehended because they know they can game the asylum or parole  system. No--these are individuals bent on avoiding detection, which  should concern us deeply.   Anyone who doesn't think bad actors are attempting to exploit the  situation at our southern border needs to think  [[Page S5834]]  again. During fiscal year 2023, the Border Patrol apprehended 169  individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist attempting to make their way  across our southern border into our country. That number, by the way,  is more than the total of the previous 6 fiscal years combined.   FBI Director Wray noted at that same Judiciary Committee hearing that  since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the threat level has  gone to ``a whole other level.'' Abroad, American troops have been  attacked nearly 80 times since October 7. It is naive to think that  there aren't terrorists out there currently trying to make their way  into the United States to attack our country. Why wouldn't any  terrorist trying to enter our country take advantage of the chaos at  our southern border?   You don't have to take my word for it. The Department of Homeland  Security, in its threat assessment released in September, noted the  risk that ``terrorists and criminal actors may exploit the elevated  flow [of migration] and increasingly complex security environment to  enter the United States.'' That assessment was written before--before-- the October 7 attack or the many attacks on U.S. troops abroad that  followed it.   If there was a risk before, I think it is safe to say that there is  an even greater risk now.   This situation cannot continue. The massive flood of illegal  immigration at our southern border has to stop, and that is why the  national security supplemental must contain real measures to secure the  border--not cosmetic fixes, not superficial tweaks, real border  security measures.   I believe it is in our national security interests to support allies  like Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine, but we cannot support American  interests abroad while continuing to sacrifice the security of the  American people here at home.   For 3 years, the Biden administration has put out a de facto welcome  mat at our southern border. If we want to protect our country, that has  to stop, and it has to stop now.   I yield the floor.
