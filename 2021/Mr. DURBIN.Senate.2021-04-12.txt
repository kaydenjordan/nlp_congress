 Mr. President, today marks the first day of Ramadan. For  the second year in a row, Muslims around the world will be celebrating  Islam's holiest month in the midst of this pandemic.   Traditionally, Ramadan is an opportunity for families to gather in  prayer and break bread together after a day-long fast, but I know many  people of the Muslim faith will not have that opportunity this year. It  is a painful reminder of all the sacrifices all of us have been called  to make since the beginning of this pandemic.   For all of those who observe, may this holy month be a time of peace  for you and your loved ones, and I hope you will be able to break bread  together soon.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  is necessarily absent.
