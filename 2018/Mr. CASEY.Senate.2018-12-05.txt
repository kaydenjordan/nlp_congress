 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very special  child, whose photo you see here on my left. Her name was Scarlett.  Scarlett and her mother Stephanie are the people whom I will mostly  talk about tonight.   Stephanie was a former staffer in my Senate office, and Scarlett was,  as you can tell from the photograph, a ray of sunshine for her parents,  Stephanie and Ryan, and also for her extended family and for her many  friends. That is how they describe Scarlett. She was their sunshine.   Tragically, Scarlett passed away on January 8, 2017, at just 16  months old. Scarlett's mom Stephanie said the following about her  daughter:         Our little Scarlett lived up to her name. She was a little       spitfire, strong and determined. She took in the world around       her with such wonder. Her favorite things were books,       blueberries, and our pets. Her favorite song was ``You Are My       Sunshine.'' She was our sunshine. We lived and breathed for       her, but shortly after midnight, very early on Sunday,       January 8, all that ended. It didn't just end; it was       shattered. Every shred of happiness we had and any semblance       of the lives we knew before was demolished shortly after I       entered her room to check on her that night.    That is what Scarlett's mom, Stephanie, said in that horrific moment.   In the time since Scarlett's death, as I and my current and former  staff members who know Stephanie can attest, Stephanie and Ryan have  been consumed--consumed--by the loss of their little girl. They did  what any grieving parent would do. They sought answers about what  caused Scarlett's death. Sadly, despite an autopsy and genetic testing,  the only answer they got was that her death was ``unexplained''-- unexplained. They still don't know what caused her death.   Stephanie and Ryan have endured so much pain--first, of course,  because of their grief over losing Scarlett and, second, because they  still don't know what caused her death.   That means that Scarlett's death falls in the category known as  sudden unexplained death in childhood, known by the acronym SUDC. Many  people have never heard of sudden unexplained death in childhood, but  it is estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of death for children  between the ages of 1 and 4 years old.   We are not doing enough to learn why these children are dying, and it  is time that we take action.   Sudden unexplained death in childhood too often has been ignored. Of  course, the acronyms can be very confusing. Many of us are already  familiar with SIDS--s-i-d-s--or sudden infant death syndrome. After the  ``back to sleep'' campaigns of the 1990s that taught parents how to put  their babies to sleep safely on their backs, we learned a lot more  about that category as well.   SIDS is part of a broader category of sudden unexpected infant death  as opposed to unexplained. Unexpected is the broader category. I will  be speaking mostly about the sudden unexplained category.   The most prevalent cause of unexpected deaths in infants--and this is  children under the age of 1 year old--is SIDS. One in three unexpected  infant deaths is unexplained, and the remaining deaths are related to  unsafe sleep.   Similarly, sudden unexplained death in childhood--as I said before,  SUDC, what took the life of Scarlett disproportionately impacts  children between the ages of 1 and 4, beyond the age of 1, such that in  2016, more than half of all unexplained childhood deaths were in  children in this age group, like Scarlett.   We don't know why these infants and children have died, and we still  don't know how to prevent future deaths. We don't know how many  children are at risk even.   As a parent, these numbers are horrifying and terrifying. Each one  represents a beloved child, like Scarlett, who was taken from their  family too soon. That is why I introduced the Scarlett's Sunshine on  Sudden Unexpected Death Act, to shine light on this problem of  unexpected and unexplained infant and childhood deaths.   I am grateful to U.S. Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin for her  work  [[Page S7311]]  on this issue. I used her bill as a starting point for this new  legislation. Representative Moore introduced companion legislation in  the House of Representatives. I am also grateful that Johnny Isakson  and Sherrod Brown have cosponsored this new bill.   The bill, Scarlett's Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, will  bring light to the darkness of these tragic and unexplained deaths. The  bill provides resources to help standardize and improve investigations  into and reporting data from sudden unexpected child and infant deaths  and to enable full medical review of all--all--child and infant deaths.  The bill also directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  commission a study to advise on best practices for genetic testing that  may identify the cause of death.   We need this consistent and complete data about unexpected and  unexplained childhood and infant deaths in order to drive research that  can find the cause or causes and then to develop interventions and ways  to prevent future deaths.   The bill also creates a new grant program to support safe sleep,  since we know preventable, sleep-related, infant deaths are still  happening.   Finally, the bill requires an annual report to Congress on the  incidence of sudden unexplained infant and child deaths, a summary of  actions the Department of Health and Human Services has taken, and any  recommendations that the Department of Health and Human Services has  developed to reduce these deaths.   As Stephanie said at Scarlett's funeral: ``There is no measurement  for the size of our love for you or the hole you leave behind.''   Nothing we do will bring Scarlett or other precious children, lost to  unexpected death, back to their grieving families, but this legislation  will be a big step forward in figuring out why these children are dying  and what we can do to prevent it.   Stephanie and Ryan's daughter, Scarlett's younger sister, is named  Eliana. Eliana's name means ``daughter of the sun,'' and that is a  tribute to the big sister she never met.   To Ryan, Stephanie, Eliana, and to all the other families and friends  of children taken from us too soon, we say to you: Although we cannot  truly understand the awful gravity of your pain or the depth of your  loss, we are listening to you, and we are listening to your plea for  help. We want to bring the bright light of data, medical reviews,  genetic testing, and other research to this problem. In other words, we  want to bring some of Scarlett's sunshine to this cause.   We are summoned by little Scarlett and other infants and children to  take action. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the  Scarlett's Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, and I ask for their  support.   I yield the floor.
