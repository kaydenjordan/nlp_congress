 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California,  particularly for his extended leadership and work on behalf of the  Nation's veterans. I thank our manager, who is leading on the majority.   This is an important and bipartisan effort to ensure the promise that  we make to the men and women of the United States military that  ultimately serve--and I always use this term--particularly, for those  who have come from the city of Houston, and Texas, and then for the  Nation. These men and women put on the uniform unselfishly. They are  ready to serve. They own up to their responsibilities. They are going  away from their families, and they come back and are in need of  important services.  [[Page H4477]]    This bill is important because it extends from 3 to 5 years the  authority for additional licensed healthcare professionals to perform  medical disability examinations as part of an existing VA pilot program  related to the use of contract physicians for disability examinations.   If you do casework in your district, you are well aware of the  challenges of our veterans in getting assessed for disability. Some  feel unfairly treated and analyzed for the percentages that they get.   This is certainly extremely important with 18.5 million veterans in  the United States, and with 1.5 million of them from my own State of  Texas.   Several initiatives that I have designed in the past have aided  Active-Duty servicemen and servicewomen, along with veterans, such as  enforcing accurate reporting of maternity mortality rates among the  Armed Forces, addressing physical and mental health concerns, and  securing triple negative breast cancer funding.   This legislation is extremely important because it adds, if you will,  additional services, expands additional services, and it also reflects  our commitment to every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine that is  welcomed back with all the care and compassion that this grateful  Nation can show.   Our Nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the  men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this county.  Veterans continue to have unanswered needs.    Mr. Speaker, veterans continue to have many  unanswered needs, and I will continue to fight for their rights.   The reason why it is important to move quickly on the extension in  this bill is because in addition to the ability to assess one's  benefits, it is, of course, recognizing the myriad of issues they face,  such as homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by saying, should we not focus on their  service, their commitment, and realize that shutting down the  government is not in any way an expression of gratitude to those men  and women who serve us unselfishly?   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2795, and for us to  proceed in a way that honors this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2795, a bill to amend  title 38, United States Code, to extend and modify certain authorities  and requirements relating to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and  for other purposes.   S. 2795, a bill passed by the Senate on September 13, 2023, is an  important and necessary measure that I encourage all of my colleagues  to vote in favor of today because it will serve as a critical and  necessary source of support for our veterans by extending the  eligibility or applicability of various Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) programs and benefits.   First, the bill extends from three to five years the authority for  additional licensed health care professionals (i.e., physician  assistants, nurse practitioners, audiologists, and psychologists) to  perform medical disability examinations as part of the existing VA  pilot program related to the use of contract physicians for disability  examinations.   Currently, when an individual transfers fewer than 12 credits from a  program of education that is closed or disapproved, the individual is  deemed to have not received those credits, and no charge from the  individual's entitlement to education assistance may be made for that  period of enrollment.   Under the bill, this period of relief for those affected by a closure  or disapproval is extended by two years to apply to programs that close  or discontinue before September 30, 2025.   This bill also extends authorization for VA emergency preparedness  for public health emergencies through FY2028.   Additionally, the bill also extends the applicability of certain loan  fee rates under the VA's home loan program through November 15, 2031.   These proposed changes align with my longstanding support for  veterans.   Of the 18.5 million veterans in the United States, 1.5 million of  them are from my own state of Texas.   Several initiatives I have designed in the past have aided active- duty servicemen and women along with veterans, such as enforcing  accurate reporting of maternity mortality rates among the Armed Forces,  addressing physical and mental health concerns, and securing  authorization for Triple Negative Breast Cancer as well as Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder.   In 2015, I was also proud to introduce the H.E.R.O.E.S. Act which  offers assistance and materials to help veteran's transition from the  battlefield to the workforce.   I am very proud of the work Congress has done to address the health  concerns of active duty and veteran servicemen and women, but there are  still improvements to be made.   According to Texas State University researchers, the Center for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found ``a lack of effective  interventions persist for the veteran population from public agencies  such as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA) and private  organizations.''   In other words, although programs and resources have been implemented  to assist veterans, there is still work to be done, as the veteran  community is still suffering.   According to CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data,  ``the overall health of the average U.S. veteran is far worse than that  of the average American, with veterans suffering more from such  conditions as obesity, skin cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD), arthritis, kidney disease and mental health  disorders.''   Members of the armed forces are vital to our nation, and I am  committed to ensuring that veterans receive the quality healthcare and  other services that they deserve.   We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful  nation can bestow.   Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the  men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country.   Veterans continue to have many unanswered needs, and I will continue  to fight for the rights of our most patriotic Americans.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for yielding.   Madam Speaker, let me announce breaking news.   I don't want to see the government shut down.   Democrats don't want to see the government shut down.   The American people don't want to see the government shut down.   I am standing with the American people and cities and hamlets and  villages and counties and States.   What has failed to be enunciated, I say to my friend on the other  side, is that we had a deal. We should have been finished with this.   The Speaker of the House and the President of the United States  already agreed in the spring on what the numbers would be, what we were  going to do for the government to keep operating. It has already been  done.   We are here now because of the upheaval of MAGA Republicans talking  about undermining a deal that was made on behalf of the good people of  this Nation. We are facing an uphill battle.   We just came out of the Budget Committee where they are fighting to  eliminate $400 million in Medicare cuts and $2 trillion in cuts to  mandatory health spending.   The reason why we are on the floor now is because we believe in the  people back home. They can't afford another unfunded mandate. Cities  are now carrying over their fund balances with Federal dollars that  Democrats were able to give to keep them alive. If we have these  unfunded mandates, childcare goes out the window; Active-Duty military  have problems with getting paid, our veterans don't get their  [[Page H4483]]  services; Social Security payments may be up in the air; the burden of  having to pay money for unfunded mandates; the hanger-on amendments  that are being put into these bills are just tragic.   Law enforcement may be impacted negatively. Those who are in need of  getting violent criminals off the street may be put in jeopardy. People  who are working-class Americans going to community colleges are in  jeopardy of getting their resources.   Madam Speaker, let me just say this: No more unfunded mandates. Let's  do the deal that we have and save the American people.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule governing  debate on these four appropriation bills before us today: H.R. 4365-- Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2024; H.R. 4367--Department  of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2024; H.R. 4665--Department of  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act,  2024; and H.R. 4368--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024.   I oppose the Rule and the underlying legislation as it pertains to  H.R. 4365, for the following reasons:   The bill, which should be earnestly attempting to best support the  Department of Defense, is being used by Republicans to sneak partisan  and damaging policies under our noses.   The underlying bill does not reflect the input of nearly half the  Members of this body and is strongly opposed by the ranking members who  sit on the very committee this bill originated from.   In order to further promote a culture war, the members who oversaw  this bill are going to put many Americans at risk.   First, they are targeting the many brave servicewomen currently  employed by the Department of Defense by directly going against the  Secretary of Defense's promises for them to have access to reproductive  healthcare regardless of their station.   Women currently make up 1 in 5 members of our military.   Denying them their previously promised ability to check their  reproductive health is not only dangerous, but also grossly  irresponsible. The loss of these rights also increases the risk for low  retention amongst female servicemembers who need these benefits this  bill would strip away.   Second, the bill targets the LGBTQ+ community, who are increasingly  victimized by Republican agendas around the country.   Regardless of your beliefs, it is important to treat everyone with  respect and equality, which this bill does not do.   This bill would prohibit hormone therapy or surgical treatment for  gender affirming care, directly affecting those who experience gender  dysphoria. Individuals who feel they do not belong in their own body is  a serious issue and has led to 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary young  people attempting suicide in the past year.   Our priority as the legislative body of this country is to protect  the wellbeing of ALL citizens, regardless of personal beliefs and  ideologies.   The language in this legislation would further embolden those who  wish to commit harm and violence against a minority group already  facing so much hardship, both socially and legally.   This is unacceptable.   The lives and wellbeing of those who live across the country should  not be put at risk simply to push a regressive agenda that does not  promote the diversity of our nation but rather seeks to suppress it.   This brings me to my third point, which is the underhanded way  Republicans sought to eliminate ``Critical Race Theory?'' or ``CRT''.   Let me be clear: Republicans have a warped understanding of what this  term means, and they are using it as a means to remove any diversity in  education.   Critical Race Theory is a collegiate field of study that examines the  complex ways in which race fits into the structures of our society; it  is not an attack on white people for their history, just as it does not  victimize Black people based on ours.   Based on an incorrect definition, Republican leaders at all levels of  government have worked to eliminate all diverse viewpoints providing a  complete framework of the history of this country, and instead wash  over the negative to present a false narrative.   At the same time, legislation aimed at elementary schools against a  Critical Race Theory--which again, is only offered at the collegiate  level--deprives diverse students of hearing their voice reflected  accurately in the history of this multicultural nation.   Another issue with this Defense Appropriations bill is the cut of  $714 million to adapt military equipment to be more climate friendly.   Climate change is a crisis that requires global attention and  efforts.   The refusal to even allow for updating our military alternative  source of energy is regressive and promoted under a false message.   It was not Biden who indicated that he wanted an ``all electric''  fleet of tanks as is commonly stated, but rather the United States  Army.   This part of the bill stands directly in the way of innovation as  well as keeping us from doing our part in the world to strive towards a  net zero future.   In 2020 alone, the United States military was responsible for 51  million tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere; more than  most countries.   But now, when the U.S. Army decides for themselves that they want to  scale back on their emissions, certain members in Congress want to  limit their choice.   One bright spot of this bill--though it is short-lived--is the  Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 4365 that was made in order by the  committee.   The Jackson Lee amendment H.R. 4365 seeks to allocate $10 million to  fund triple negative breast cancer research.   This issue is extremely important, especially for the brave men and  women in the military, who are up to 20 to 40 percent more likely to  develop breast cancer.   I must offer my appreciation to both the military and the Biden  administration for making research into breast cancer a priority, but  there is still work to be done.   This amendment would allow for more research so we can one day  hopefully learn a way to reduce the number of military personnel  affected by breast cancer.   Several initiatives I have designed in the past have aided active- duty servicemen and women along with veterans, such as enforcing  accurate reporting of maternity mortality rates among the Armed Forces,  addressing physical and mental health concerns, and securing  authorization for Triple Negative Breast Cancer as well as Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder.   I am very proud of the work that I and Congress has done to address  the health concerns of active duty and veteran servicemen and women,  but there are still improvements to be made.   The men and women who are on the front lines or have already  completed their valiant service to this country have many pressing  issues and challenges they already must face; breast cancer should not  be one of them.   While this amendment is important, the negatives of this defense  appropriations bill vastly outweigh the positives.   As with all the additional appropriation bills on the floor today,  the Administration likewise strongly opposes the passage of this bill  for a myriad of reasons--including the following:   Border Management Funding: It is disappointing this bill does not  include funding for a new Southwest Border Contingency Fund. This fund  would enable DHS to respond more effectively to changing conditions on  the Southwest border and fulfill its critical and complementary  missions of securing the border, performing efficient and effective  screening and processing, and meeting the Nation's humanitarian  obligations.   Shelter and Services Program: It also shameful that this bill seeks  to eliminate the Shelter and Services Program, a priority grant program  for DHS that provides temporary food, shelter, and other services to  state and local entities and non-governmental organizations that  provide support to migrants who are released from DHS custody. This  grant program is a key mechanism for Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) to relieve overcrowding in short-term holding facilities.   United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Funding:  This bill further fails to provide appropriations for USCIS application  processing and grant programs. Without this funding, USCIS would be  unable to improve its operations and the application processing backlog  would continue to grow in FY 2024.   Targeting Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVFP) Grants: It is  absolutely abhorrent that this bill eliminates the TVTP grant program.  TVTP provides funding to nonprofits and to State, local, tribal, and  territorial governments to develop multidisciplinary targeted violence  and terrorism prevention capabilities in local communities, to pilot  innovative prevention approaches, and to identify prevention best  practices that can be replicated in communities across the Nation.   Immigration Enforcement Prohibitions and Requirements: I also stand  with the Administration in strongly opposing section 220 of the bill,  which would prohibit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  from using appropriated funds to carry out the Administration's  immigration enforcement priorities, as well as the requirement in the  bill for ICE to fill 41,500 detention beds and enroll all non-detained  migrants in Alternatives to Detention. These requirements are  unrealistic, pose implementation challenges, and would dilute the  Department's focus on protecting America from security threats.  [[Page H4484]]    Restrictions on Alternatives to Detention (ATD): This bill wrongfully  eliminates funding for the Young Adult Case Management Program, as well  as for Operation Horizon, and grant funds for a case management pilot  program. These restrictions would simultaneously strain limited  resources and remove valuable flexibilities in managing low-risk  populations.   Limiting Interior Transportation: Prohibiting the transport of  noncitizens to interior locations risks overcrowding at border  processing sites and other DHS facilities, threatening to exacerbate  life and safety concerns of those in custody.   Restrictions on Access to Healthcare: Section 222 of the bill is also  particularly harmful, which would make it more difficult to access  lawful reproductive healthcare. I stand in strong opposition to this  section, which targets LGBTQI+ individuals who are in ICE detention.   Prohibiting the Implementation of the Asylum Processing Rule: This  bill further prohibits the use of funds to implement the  Administration's Asylum Processing Rule--which serves as a key part of  the Administration's efforts to streamline the immigration system,  allowing USCIS Asylum Officers to hear and decide certain asylum claims  in the first instance.   Prohibiting the Implementation of the Legal Pathways Rule: I further  oppose the bill's prohibition on using funds to implement the  Administration's Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Rule. The Rule  encourages migrants to use lawful, safe, and orderly processes for  entering the United States; imposes conditions on asylum eligibility  for those who fail to do so or fail to seek protection in a country  through which they transit; and supports the swift return of migrants  who do not have valid protection claims. The bill would undermine DHS's  continued ability to safely, effectively, and humanely enforce and  administer U.S. immigration law.   Restricting the Use of the CBP One Application: I also strongly  oppose the bill's restrictions on using the CBP One application. A key  part of the Administration's efforts to foster fair and orderly  conditions at the border, the CBP One application allows border  officials to screen migrants seeking asylum along the Southwest border,  and issue them a document to appear in court upon their arrival.   Border Wall: Lastly, I oppose the homeland security appropration bill  for its rescession and reappropriation of $2.1 billion in border wall  funding. Building a border wall is not a serious policy solution nor is  it a responsible use of Federal funds.   While I am grateful the Rules Committee made my Jackson Lee Amendment  No. 16/No. 43 in order, I strongly oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.   I will, however, briefly recap why my amendment is important for this  particular measure should we be able to move forward with a feasible  appropriations bill that can accommodate this amendment.   The Jackson Lee Amendment increases funds by $1,000,000 and decreases  funding by $1,000,000 for the Global Health Programs account to  highlight and support the fight against the practice of Female Genital  Mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York  to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia,  or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.   For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are  mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to  be at risk of FGM/C, annually.   The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetic fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16/No. 43 prioritizes funding for foreign  assistance to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an  internationally recognized violation of the human rights of girls and  women comes to an end.   Lastly, as it pertains to the bill to determine appropriations for  the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and  related agencies for the 2024 fiscal year, I strongly oppose this rule  and the underlying legislation.   While I am again grateful the Rules committee made in order my  Jackson Lee Amendment, listed as No. 18 in the Harris (MD)--En Bloc,  this bill seeks to return America's agriculture back to 2006 funding  levels--with an allocation of $17.1 billion, nearly $8 billion below  last year's enacted bill.   The Jackson Lee Amendment increases funding that provides grant  research financial support for ``1890s Land Grant Universities,'' which  are 28 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This amendment  also proposes decreasing funding for the Office of the Chief  Information Officer.   The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities' (APLU) Council  of 1890s includes all Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HBCUs) that are land-grant universities.   Under the Morrill Act of 1890, at least 19 universities have been  designated with land-grant status. The Historically Black Colleges and  Universities--Excellence in Research HBCU-EiR program was established  in response to direction provided in the Senate Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Report  (Senate Report 115-139). That initiative was built on prior and  continuing efforts by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to  strengthen research capacity at Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs).   The Jackson Lee Amendment would provide sufficient funding and  guidance to enable the NSF to be successful with the HBCU Excellence in  Research program.   This amendment would further provide opportunities for both public  and private HBCUs, particularly for those who have not been successful  in competing with larger NSF Research & Related Activities.   Increasing Funding for the United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA) agency that provides grant research would help to stimulate  sustainable improvement in research and development capacities of  HBCUs.   By increasing funding for relevant agencies that provide appropriate  financial support for these historically underserved institutions, we  can ensure that federal funds are redirected toward more critical  funding needs of the American people.   However, the proposed underlying bill as is would mean a pull back on  investment, slashing the number of loans awarded to financially  distressed farmers.   H.R. 4368 rescinds $500 million from the Renewable Energy for America  Program (REAP), which helps farmers facing high input costs.   Many provisions in this bill seek to limit access to viable programs  and put many out of reach of energy efficient projects that help  American farmers to lower their energy bills and live decent lives.   For everyday rural Americans, the implementation of this bill would  have a substantially negative impact on their daily livelihood. These  communities rely on crucial infrastructure, from water and wastewater  systems to high-speed internet.   However, these infrastructure projects require huge upfront costs  that smaller tax bases of rural communities cannot bear alone.   H.R. 4368 would cut federal grants to community facilities by a  whopping 90 percent, obstructing the progress in bringing affordable  health care to underserved and rural communities, and it will cut rural  water and waste disposal loans by 30 percent and rural waste disposal  grants by 36 percent.   All these senseless cuts to funding amount to 325 crucial projects  for rural water and wastewater systems that simply will not have the  funding to be implemented.   This bill also seeks to eliminate funding for the Distressed  Communities program, which means hundreds of small local governments  will not be able to renovate their systems to meet EPA standards for  getting arsenic and lead out of their drinking water systems.   The cumulative and direct impact of these policies on the American  people will be devastating. Thousands of American families could lose  access to reliable sources of water, not knowing if they could turn on  the spigot and get clean, safe water to drink or complete a myriad of  other essential daily tasks.   H.R. 4368 further limits funding for Rural Electric Cooperatives that  help close the gaps in our power grid across the country. Over 900  rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million people across 48 states-- including 92 percent of persistent poverty counties--those who can  least afford to build and maintain this crucial infrastructure. These  Rural Electric Cooperatives play vital roles in ensuring that rural  communities have access to affordable energy.  [[Page H4485]]    Additionally, H.R. 438 will contribute to food insecurity in our  country. The bill calls for new work requirements for SNAP recipients,  which exacerbates the cycle of poverty--particularly in rural  communities.   We cannot deny the fact that SNAP recipients who are able to work, do  work. However, even with a full-time job, many Americans, especially  those in our rural communities, struggle to earn enough to escape  poverty.   This is not an issue of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, but of  limited job opportunities, cut-back work hours, and other extenuating  factors.   America cannot thrive if Americans are hungry, and this bill will  take food out of the mouths of over 6 million Americans who will lose  SNAP benefits due to the increased work requirements.   If this bill passes, it will rescind $500 million dollars in WIC  funding, underfunding the account for 2024 directly affecting nearly 5  million hungry women and children.   H.R. 4368 will reduce levels for WIC fruit and vegetable vouchers by  $1.2 billion--hurting both families and farmers.   As a result, 4.6 million of our people would lose out on produce and  our farmers would lose an expected $1.2 million dollars in revenue.   Not only that, the nearly 30 percent cut to single family direct  housing loans--from $1.25 billion in FY 2023 to $900 million in FY  2024--will make it harder for rural Americans to afford to buy a house.   This means that over 2800 rural families will not be able to get  financing to put a roof over their heads; our farmers, producers, and  rural communities deserve a more reliable partner in our Congress.   While it is without question that the USDA has a long and storied  history of discrimination, Congress, however, has always been a  steadfast partner and cornerstone of this country's agricultural  industry. This appropriations bill, H.R. 4368, however, seeks to  undermine enduring efforts of this Congress to ensure equal opportunity  and access for every American.   These appropriations should be a reliable means by which we help  Americans from all walks of life; unfortunately, the Republican  proposed bill before us today does not meet the moment.   Too much is at stake--from the food we eat, to the medicine and  medical devices on which we rely, and the fiber and materials that help  clothe and build our country, and our national security. Americans  deserve better.   America cannot permit a child, a family, or a small business that has  their potential to be limited, and opportunities curtailed simply  because they are located in a Rural Free Delivery (RFD) zip code.   This appropriations bill presented to us today takes food out of the  mouths of hungry people, creates barriers for women who need access to  medication, raises energy costs for rural Americans, and makes it  harder for small farmers and poultry producers to meet their basic  needs.   We can do better. We are better than this. The American people  deserve better.   I cannot support this bill as it stands, and I urge all my colleagues  to vote against this cruel proposal.   For all these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the  rule and the underlying legislation for all four appropriation bills.    Madam Speaker, I just got off the telephone with one  of my chief law enforcement officers in Houston, Texas, in Harris  County, who just simply begged us not to shut down the government.   As everyone knows, I was on the floor just an hour or so ago saying,  breaking news, I am against a government shutdown. We will fight  against the government shutdown. My good friend on the other side of  the aisle is complaining that the Senate did their work with such an  amazing, overwhelming majority.   Let me tell you how we can solve that before I get into discussion of  why we are standing here today. Put the Senate bill on the floor. That  is the rules that are the operational underpinnings of the House and  Senate. They send it over, and we put it on the floor. If you don't  like it, you change it and send it back. That way, you are engaged in  stopping the shutdown.   However, if we sit here tonight and do nothing, the government  shutdown, in particular, is going to impact the gross domestic product  from 2 to 6 percentage points or $2- to $6 billion in lost output. That  is people without jobs, resulting in the creation of 120,000 fewer  private-sector jobs.   In addition, things like Medicare and Medicaid are going to be in  jeopardy. Our economic security will be in jeopardy. Education and  training will be in jeopardy, infrastructure dollars; and,  particularly, my seniors and others in need of Social Security checks  are just going to be out in the cold.   Combining, however, the bills that my friends want us to move on,  they attack women's reproductive rights, they attack the LGBTQ+  community, who are continuously victimized for medical care that they  need. They talk about Homeland Security, and it is completely untenable  that they exclude funding for a new southwest border contingency fund  that would enable DHS to respond more effectively to changing  conditions on the southwest border. They cut out shelter and services  programs. It is shameful to eliminate those programs that provide  temporary food and shelter.    Madam Speaker, in addition--can you believe it?-- they slash or eliminate the number of loans awarded to financially  distressed farmers under the agriculture bill; and then targeting  violence and terrorism prevention grants, they take that out.   What are we talking about here? Let's deal with the CR from the  Senate. You don't like it, add something to it, and send it back. Today  is September 26. We will be able to say to the American people, we are  adults, and we can stop the shutdown.   Let's go to work. These bills have to go back to the table again. I  want to make sure we don't have a shutdown, and we can do it with the  Senate CR right now.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Bishop) and Mr. Harris for working together.   Every time I come to the floor, Mr. Chair, I am going to say that I  do not want a government shutdown, having been through them and seen  the desperation that comes upon the American people, and I will do  everything I can that is within reason to make sure we do not have it.   As I present this amendment and thank the committee for allowing this  amendment to be included, I have to take note of the cuts in SNAP  benefits, the funding cuts in rural electric cooperatives, and the  shocking cuts in WIC. That is what I think has to be fixed, so the  American people are aware.   I am grateful that my amendment, the Jackson Lee amendment No. 18,  increases funding that provides grant research and financial support  for the 1890s land grant universities, which are 28 historically Black  colleges and universities. This amendment would decrease funding in  another account.   The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities Council of  1890s includes all the historically Black colleges under the Morrill  Act of 1890. At least 19 universities have been designated.   The importance of this is how crucial it is to engage our  universities in research and, in particular, the National Science  Foundation. It strengthens the training of our young people. It  provides them with the doors to opportunity. Research is the economy of  the 21st century. Increasing funding for the United States Department  of Agriculture that provides grant research would help to stimulate  sustainable improvement in research and development.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment  that supports education and research in historically Black colleges.   Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment,  listed as No. 18 in Harris (MD)--EN BLOC No. 1 to H.R. 4368, the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Act of 2024.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making this  amendment in order.   The Jackson Lee Amendment [No. 18 in Harris (MD)--EN BLOC No. 1]  increases funding that provides grant research financial support for  ``1890s Land Grant Universities,'' which are 28 Historically Black  Colleges and Universities.   This amendment also proposes decreasing funding for Office of the  Chief Information Officer.   The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities' (APLU) Council  of 1890s includes all Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HBCUs) that are land-grant universities.   Under the Morrill Act of 1890, at least 19 universities have been  designated with land-grant status.   The Historically Black Colleges and Universities--Excellence in  Research HBCU-EiR program was established in response to direction  provided in the Senate Commerce and Justice, Science and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Report (Senate Report 115-139).   That initiative was built on prior and continuing efforts by the  National Science Foundation (NSF) to strengthen research capacity at  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).   The Jackson Lee Amendment [No. 18 in Harris (MD)--EN BLOC No. 1]  would provide sufficient funding and guidance to enable the NSF to be  successful with the HBCU Excellence in Research program.   This amendment would further provide opportunities for both public  and private HBCUs, particularly for those who have not been successful  in competing with larger NSF Research & Related Activities.  [[Page H4527]]    Increasing Funding for the United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA) agency that provides grant research would help to stimulate  sustainable improvement in research and development capacities of  HBCUs.   By increasing funding for relevant agencies that provide appropriate  financial support for these historically underserved institutions, we  can ensure that federal funds are redirected toward more critical  funding needs of the American people.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the  Jackson Lee Amendment [No. 18 in Harris (MD)--EN BLOC No. 1].                                time  2130
