 Mr. Speaker, I am a Black man living in  America, and that puts me at greater risk while living in America.   The fact that I served 30 years in the United States Army, an  institution that prides itself on being colorblind, doesn't change the  fact that I am Black and at greater risk.   The fact that I graduated from a good school with honors doesn't  change the color of my skin and the risk of living in America.   That I attended Harvard Law School and practiced law at a blue-chip  firm in Washington, D.C., doesn't change the fact that my family is  from Africa and that we are at greater risk, even today, in America.   Even being a Member of this august institution, the United States  Congress, doesn't shield me from the risks of being Black in America.   Mr. Speaker, 401 years after we arrived in bondage, a Black man in  America is more likely to be stopped by the police than a White man.  Mr. Speaker, 155 years after the signing of the Emancipation  Proclamation, a Black man is more likely to be arrested than a White  man.   Mr. Speaker, within my own lifetime of witnessing the first Black man  appointed to the Supreme Court; the first Black woman elected to the  United States Senate; the first Black man appointed chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff; and, yes, the Black first man elected President  of the United States, a Black man is still much more likely than a  White man to die at the hands of police.   Every day for the past 10 years, Mr. Speaker, I, like every parent of  a Black child, remind my Black boys, my sons, to be careful: Put your  hands in plain sight if approached by an officer. Don't move suddenly  when being questioned by the police. Be sure to ask permission before  reaching for your wallet. And always respond to police rudeness with  respect.   I do that because I don't want my children, anyone's Black child, to  be harmed by the use of excessive force. I don't want them to be the  victim of a police-involved shooting. They are good boys, and too many  good boys, too many good men, Black men living in America, have died at  the hands of police in America.   So today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to say: Enough. We have endured too  much, and the Congress has done too little.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Justice in Policing Act.  I thank my colleagues on the Congressional Black Caucus, former and  present, who have worked on these issues for far too long. I thank  House leadership for bringing the bill to the floor so that we can once  and for all bring an end to the injustice that is inflicted by those  who we look to as the first line of justice.   Mr. Speaker, systemic racism pervades our society, and the criminal  system, from police encounters to punishment, is racially biased.   This requires structural and transformational change in policing in  America: reducing militarization; removing bad officers; holding them  accountable for illegal behavior and gross misconduct; improving  training so officers are guardians and protectors of our communities,  not warriors acting aggressively toward our communities; increasing  transparency and the ability to investigate and prosecute, where  necessary; banning the chokehold; and outlawing racial profiling. But  that is not enough.   As we work in these days, weeks, and months ahead, we have to  acknowledge that, for far too long, we have neglected policies and  programs that meet the needs of our communities, and we need to address  the structural disparities heard in Black and Brown families. Instead  of criminalizing homelessness, addiction, poverty, and, yes, being  Black, we need to make the investments that will keep us safe and  address the inequities that exist in our country.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we will pass the Justice in Policing Act. But  tomorrow, we must take on other challenges: economic opportunity,  mental health, housing, pre-K, health disparities.   In this moment, we have a chance to not just transform policing but  make  [[Page H2424]]  our entire country more just and safer for Black Americans and every  American.                            ____________________
