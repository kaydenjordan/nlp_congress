 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, we received the news, the sad  news, that Justice John Paul Stevens passed away at the age of 99. He  was a son of the ``greatest generation,'' a code breaker in the U.S.  Navy at Pearl Harbor, a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, and a Shakespearean  scholar. What a combination.   John Paul Stevens was the third longest serving Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court in the Nation's history. The length of his tenure meant  the jurisprudence of Justice Stevens left a mark on nearly every area  of the law. Just as remarkable as the length of his tenure was its  quality.   Justice John Paul Stevens was a champion for civil rights, equality,  and accountability, who devoted his life to the ideal of equal justice  under the law. He worked to constrain the use of the death penalty,  defend abortion rights, articulate the bounds of Presidential power-- very needed today--and believed that unravelling the limits on  corporate campaign spending ``threatens to undermine the integrity of  elected institutions across the nation.'' He was so right.   The fact that Leader McConnell and all our Republican friends lead  the charge in allowing so much corporate money--money of the very  wealthy--to cascade into our system--well, Justice Stevens is in Heaven  reminding them of what they are doing to faith in our democratic  institutions.   Stevens was at times an iconoclast. He was willing to buck  conventional approaches and have his own views evolve. One constant,  however, was his courtesy. During oral arguments, he would begin with  the preface: ``May I ask a question,'' as if the counsel were doing him  a favor. Out of respect for the respect he paid to everyone who came  before the Court, on his last day on the Bench, lawyers and spectators  throughout the Supreme Court Chamber wore his signature bow tie in his  honor, a more fitting tribute than anything I could say on the Senate  floor.   Justice Stevens was a great man, a model jurist: wise, fair,  compassionate, and caring about the little guy and gal. Our judiciary  today needs more like him. There are too many on the Supreme Court who  are virtually the opposite of what Stevens stood for. He will be sorely  missed.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask that the 11 o'clock vote series  start now.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator McConnell and  offer my congratulations and my kudos--that is singular, as we learned  in our caucus lunch a few weeks ago--to my dear friend from Vermont,  Senator Pat Leahy, on his 16,000th vote as Senator. He is only the  fourth person to reach this milestone out of nearly 1,900 men and women  who have served in this Chamber. It is a great achievement and a great  mark on history. So many of his votes were so significant--on  healthcare, education, declaration of war, international treaties,  every issue foreign and domestic. They cover four decades, each vote in  some small way impacting the trajectory of our great Nation.   Just a little perspective. Imagine taking 16,000 pennies and stacking  them one on top of the other. They would surpass the height of the  Washington Monument. They would be more than double the height of the  Capitol dome. It is a reminder that a multitude of smaller actions and  the accumulation of smaller accomplishments over a lifetime of quiet  dedication can amount to a great monument of achievement.   Leader McConnell noted that Senator Leahy was the youngest Senator  ever elected from Vermont. He is still just as young at heart, at  dedication, and at conviction as he was the day he came to the Senate.   We welcome Senator Leahy and know that he will serve many, many more  happy, productive years in this Chamber.   (Applause.)    Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague and  friend, the Senator from New York, for the amazing work she has done to  get this bill to this point. She has worked long and hard on this for  years and years and years with compassion, dedication, intelligence,  and persistence. The bill wouldn't be here today without her hard work.  I thank her for that.   I also want to thank--I know there are police and firefighters in the  Gallery over here. I want to thank them  [[Page S4880]]  for coming. You are the people who got this done. You are the people  who made this happen more than any of us and more than anyone else. The  heroes of 21st century America have names like Zadroga and Pfeifer and  Alvarez, for whom this bill is named--three of the thousands who rushed  to the towers bravely and lost their lives because of their bravery and  selflessness.   I say to my friend from Kentucky: Throughout the history of America,  when our young men and women or older men and women volunteered in the  armed services and risked their lives for our freedom, we came back and  gave them healthcare, and we are still working on making it better. Why  are these people any different? They, too, risked their lives in a time  of war and were hurt by it--by diseases they didn't even know they  could get. How can we, for whatever reason, stop this bill from moving  forward?   We are going to have a defense bill on the appropriations floor. We  are not going to offset it. It has pay raises for our soldiers. It has  new equipment. We are not going to ask for an offset. Why this bill-- why is it different? It is not. This fund needs to be fully funded.   I say to Leader McConnell, the House leadership, hardly people who  aren't careful with the dollar--sometimes too careful--when Kevin  McCarthy and Scalise, the Freedom Caucus leader, Mark Meadows, all  voted for it, why are we holding this bill up? If we put it on the  floor today, we could pass it, and it would be on the President's desk  this week, and those brave people here and the many more who came would  not have to come again. They should not have to come again.   It is not that it will be a joyous day when this bill passes. They  are going to have to return to nurturing their brothers and sisters who  are sick and to worry if they might get sick from all the gunk that was  in the air that poisoned their systems, their lungs, their digestive  systems, their kidneys, and their livers.   The bottom line is very simple. You can come up with 10,000 reasons  not to do something, but you shouldn't come up with any reason not to  do something noble and right.   I urge my friend from Kentucky to withdraw his objection. I urge  Senator McConnell, the leader, to put it on the floor now, and we can  let these folks in the Gallery and so many others do what they need to  do--help their families, help their friends, and make sure their health  is given the best protection possible.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I promise to work with Senator Isakson to  ensure that the Tehran hostages receive the compensation they deserve  and provide equitable treatment for all victims of terrorism.                            ____________________
