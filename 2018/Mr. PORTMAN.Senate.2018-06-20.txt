 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30  seconds on the Baldwin-Portman amendment.    Mr. President, Senator Baldwin spoke a moment ago about  this amendment we are about to vote on.   It is $20 million to the National Nuclear Security Administration's  domestic isotope program. This is something this body voted for back in  2012. CBO says it has no budget authority impact. It is really  important because we are getting this all from overseas. We have no  domestic source. We want to get away from using highly enriched uranium  for national security reasons.   I encourage you to all vote for this.   I yield back my time.
