 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his leadership  on this important legislation, and I thank the ranking member.   The American people are fed up with spam calls. They are predatory,  incessant, and an invasion of privacy.   We need a comprehensive approach to root them out, and our Federal  Government plays an important role in that. Whether it is the FCC,  Department of Justice, Homeland Security, or FBI, these agencies should  have the authorities and tools to shut down these spammers' calls, and  these powers are maximized when they are coordinated.   That is why I included in this legislation the creation of the Spam  Calls Task Force. The task force will coordinate the Federal response.   Madam Speaker, I also thank Representative Darren Soto for his help  with this.   I am confident that by working together, we can all put a stop to  spam calls once and for all, and Americans will no longer have to fear  robocalls.
