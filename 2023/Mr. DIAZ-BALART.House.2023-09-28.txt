 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4665, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I am proud to speak on the fiscal year 2024 Department  of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill  for floor consideration today.   Anybody who has read the bill knows that it is pretty  straightforward. If you are a friend, an ally of the United States,  this bill supports you, but if you are an adversary or you are cozying  up to the adversaries of the United States, then, frankly, you are just  not going to like this bill.   I am extremely proud of this legislation, which was carefully and  thoughtfully developed over many, many months. In my judgment, it  reflects the values and the interests of most Americans. We carefully  reviewed all the organizations and programs that receive U.S. taxpayer  dollars in this bill. And among the key factors--let me be very blunt-- it is whether investments advance our national security interests,  whether they can show demonstrated results and our need to reduce the  national debt and to reduce spending in a responsible way.   So the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  bill totals $51.5 billion. It cuts $8.2 billion; that is a 14 percent  reduction, below the 2023 enacted level, and $17 billion or 25 percent  below the President's request. In fact, it is $2.7 billion below the  fiscal year 2019 enacted level, and it is even $288 million below the  fiscal year 2015 enacted level.   So because of those cuts, of those responsible reductions, we are now  able to prioritize funding for the national security threat posed by  the Chinese Communist Party.   Look, it is time that the U.S., that we get serious about that  maligned destabilizing negative actions of the Communist Chinese Party  around the  [[Page H4720]]  world. This measure, this bill does precisely that in an unprecedented  manner.   Let me talk a little bit about that. The bill includes $4.4 billion,  which is $1 billion above the President's budget request to fund  programs to counter the threat of the Chinese Communist Party around  the world.   For the first time, this bill includes half a billion, $500 million,  in foreign military financing for Taiwan--first time ever. These funds,  as everybody knows, are critical to support our friend and our  democratic ally, which is on the front lines of China's bullying and  China's constant threats. This bill provides unwavering support for our  democratic ally, Israel, and other key partners around the world.   Another priority is to strengthen efforts to counter fentanyl  production and trafficking. I don't have to tell you all that deadly  opioids, particularly fentanyl, are affecting every area, every  district, every neighborhood in our entire country. Madam Chair, three  hundred Americans die every single day because of fentanyl poisoning.  We must and we do use every tool to combat this horrific deadly  epidemic.   Obviously, the migration crisis at the southern border is really just  symptomatic of the administration's lack of a clear strategy toward the  Western Hemisphere. That is as nice as I can say it.   Mr. Chairman, for too long countries cozying up to our adversaries  have been rewarded, rewarded, and this bill puts a stop to that  practice. This bill also recognizes the growing threat of authoritarian  regimes even here in our own hemisphere and around the world.  Therefore, it fully funds democracy assistant accounts in support of  freedom and human rights where they are most threatened.   Now, before discussing funding for the United Nations, I just want to  remind folks, Members, and also anybody who might be watching, who is  running the show at the U.N. It would be hard to even make this stuff  up, but, unfortunately, remarkably what I am about to tell you is true.  So Russia was chair of the U.N. Security Council during the month of  April. Yeah, you heard me right. Iran is currently an elected vice  president of the U.N. General Assembly.   Communist China, whose genocide against Uyghurs and their bullying  around the world is notorious, and Cuba, one of the world's oldest,  most brutal dictatorships, both of those countries sit on the U.N.  Human Rights council. Yeah, you heard me right. North Korea--well, I  can't even begin to talk about the atrocities of that dictatorship--is  a member of the World Health Organization, while Taiwan, a responsible  democracy, has been blocked from membership of that institution by  Communist China. You can't make this stuff up. Therefore, it should  come as no surprise to anybody that no funds are included in this bill  for the U.N. regular budget.    Now, my dear friends on the other side of the aisle argue that by  cutting some of the funding to the U.N., the U.S. has given up its  leadership. I could not disagree in stronger terms. You see, simply  continuing to unconditionally channel funds to a deeply flawed  organization, despite multiple failures and, frankly, appalling, even  continuously antisemitic actions by that institution, that is actually  abandoning our responsibility to the U.S. taxpayer, and it ensures that  nothing changes in that institution that I just mentioned.   Actions need to have consequences, and the U.N. finally will feel the  consequences of their irresponsible actions because of how we deal with  them in this bill. This bill also prohibits funds for the Green Climate  Fund and the Green Technology Fund. We also address a frivolous  expansion of State Department bureaucracy. This bill eliminates funding  for special envoys and special representatives that are not authorized  or have not been confirmed by the Senate.   If they are that important, then for God's sake, have them authorized  by Congress or at least confirmed by the Senate.   Finally, this bill includes all longstanding pro-life protections,  which includes a prohibition on taxpayer funds from being used to pay  for abortions abroad, and it builds on those requirements by applying  the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy to all global  health funding.   It is not surprising that after this bill was released, my colleagues  on the other side immediately released a press release condemning it.  Now, what might surprise you is what the minority party in their  written press release actually chose to highlight that they are  objecting to in this bill. Their press release criticized that this  bill prohibits funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology--Heck, yeah,  we prohibit funding to that institution--or that we prohibit funding to  the EcoHealth Alliance or gain-of-function research. And quoting from  my colleagues on the Democratic side, their criticism of this bill,  that we reduce funding for ``any lab controlled by China, Russia, Cuba,  Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.'' I am quoting from their press  release.   Heck yeah, we are cutting funding for institutions from those  countries. These countries are, in essence, on the official list of the  United States foreign adversaries, and three, by the way, are on the  State Sponsor of Terrorism list. Does any taxpayer think that taxpayer  funds should be going to labs in those places? Really?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle also expressed in  writing concerns of what they call partisan riders that specifically  highlighted the provisions on funds in this bill to the government of  the PRC and the Chinese Communist Party; and, also, that we prevent  lending from international financial institutions to the PRC. They put  that in writing.   Well, one thing is true. They got that right. They caught me. We are  eliminating funding to adversaries of the United States of America. I  would argue it is about damn time we did that. I look forward to  hearing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle explain why U.S.  taxpayer money should be funding those programs, and, by the way, why  writing a blank check to any organization is a demonstration of  leadership. It is not.   Mr. Chairman, before I close, I thank the staff from the  Appropriations Committee for their amazing work on this bill: Susan  Adams, who is here with me; Craig Higgins; Jamie McCormick; Trey Hicks;  Meg Gallagher; John Muscolini; Clelia Alvarado; and Joe Cutler; and  equally from the minority side--and I always butcher her last name, and  I apologize because I will probably do it again--Erin Kolodjeski,  Laurie Mignon, and Lillian Wasvary.   I thank members of my personal staff from my office: Cesar Gonzalez,  Gisselle Reynolds, and Autumn Morley.   I thank our Chairman for bringing this crucial legislation to the  floor, which supports our allies and protects our national security in  a smart, efficient, effective, and thoughtful way.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a champion of human rights.    Mr. Chair, I want to be very clear that I have heard  now that somehow this bill damages the reputation of the United States.  No.   Do you know what damaged the reputation of the United States, Mr.  Chairman? That irresponsible withdrawal from Afghanistan that showed  the entire world what bad leadership is all about.   This bill confronts our adversaries--$1 billion more to confront  China than the President could do while we spend a lot less money. It  stands by our friends. It confronts our adversaries.   The problem about credibility is not with this bill. It is with the  President of the United States that, at best, is confused.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the ranking member of this  subcommittee because, I will tell you  [[Page H4724]]  what, she is consistent, and we have developed a very good  relationship.   You have heard it right now. Yes, this bill prohibits funding for the  Wuhan Institute of Virology, the EcoHealth Alliance, gain-of-function  research, and it also prohibits funding for any lab controlled by  China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.   We have a difference of opinion.   I believe that taxpayer money going to labs controlled by these  countries is just not something we should be doing. There is an  absolute difference of opinion on that. If anybody believes that U.S.  taxpayer money should be going for those things, then you are going to  have a problem with that part of this bill.   If you, however, believe that U.S. taxpayer money should not go to  fund those labs controlled by those countries, I would then ask you to  support this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think we have discussed some of the  issues in this bill. I think it is a very positive bill. It supports  our allies, and it confronts our adversaries. It also controls wasteful  spending. Wasteful spending is one of the reasons we have inflation at  the highest level we have had in decades.   Mr. Chairman, since the ranking member has yielded back her time, I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 723, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan en  bloc amendment, which represents amendments with support from both  sides of the aisle.   The amendment includes 15 noncontroversial amendments that advance  the priorities of both sides, including support for Taiwan and  addressing the passport processing backlog, which is happening  everywhere in the country.   Mr. Chair, I would respectfully urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we spoke on the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respectfully rise in opposition.   The gentleman from Arizona brings up, I think, really legitimate  reasons for his concern about the out-of-control spending and, frankly,  what this administration has done. However, because of that, the  operating account of USAID in this bill has been significantly reduced  below the FY 2019 enacted level.   As the gentleman is aware, we get to the point if we do further  reductions, that this account, frankly, stops our ability to actually  do some serious oversight.   While I agree with his concerns, I don't think this is the right way  to do that. Further reductions to this account would mean less  oversight, less efficiency, and, frankly, I think fewer positive  outcomes.   By the way, in the manager's amendment, we reduce it even further. I  totally understand and look forward to working with the gentleman about  his concern. I think we are addressing it in this bill.   Again, it is one of those issues that I understand where he is going,  but I think this is not the right way to do it, so I respectfully  oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment.   Look, this is a horrifying practice of literally just mutilating  women around the world. An estimated 200 million women and girls have  undergone this form of female genital mutilation, including, by the  way, ones who are 15 or younger.   Mr. Chair, I don't have to tell you about the extreme psychological  and physical harm that this does to these young girls and women.   I thank my colleague, Representative Jackson Lee, for condemning this  practice wherever--wherever--it is occurring. Anywhere in the world we  should object to minors, young girls, young women, having genital  mutilation performed for whatever reason.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Granger), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, something that has to be recognized on  this floor is that my colleague from Georgia who is presenting this  amendment has been transparent, open, and clear from day one, and that  is something that is not always seen in this body. I think we need to  recognize that, and I think that is something that has to be respected  regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with her. I think that is  something that has to be recognized.   Now, I just want to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about  the bill. I clearly recognize my colleague's frustration--and it is not  only her--about the administration's lack of transparency, lack of  articulation, lack of a strategy how the funds have been used, the  communication from A to Z, I get that.   While there are no funds directed for Ukraine in this bill, there are  a lot of directives in this bill for accountability for any assistance  going to Ukraine.   Let me just take a moment to read the list of requirements that must  be completed before one single penny would be used to go to Ukraine  from this bill now or later or whenever:   A strategy within 90 days. We have not gotten that from the  administration;   In-person monitoring of all programs;   Cost-matching requirements, making sure that other donors must do  more, more than the United States before one penny can go out;   A certification that comprehensive oversight mechanisms are in place;   A notification to Congress so we can assess how those funds may be  used;   An obligation report every 90 days accounting for all moneys  provided;   An oversight report every 90 days detailing any allegations of waste,  fraud, and corruption, and how those will be addressed;   Finally, and I think this is key, all reports must be clearly posted  on the internet so that every American can see where their taxpayer  dollars are going.   The reason that I am so optimistic and so gung ho about this bill is  that we need to pass this bill in order to have these requirements in  order to not have a blank check. I am looking at not only the short  term but also the long term. We need to have accountability. We need  conditions. We need oversight. We need to take away as much flexibility  from the administration. That is precisely what we are attempting to do  in this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  this amendment because he raises some very important issues regarding  the Paris Agreement.   Even if it were true that global emissions would result in this  global apocalypse in the distant future, the truth is that most  developing countries are irrelevant in any climate model used to  speculate about temperatures 100 years down the road.   These countries have emissions that are nearly undetectable when  compared to the real culprits, which are China and other countries in  Asia which, by the way, are exempt for the most part from this climate  accord. So while our bill already prohibits funds for the Green Climate  Fund, the Clean Technology Fund, and other vehicles that could be used  to carry out this Paris Agreement, I agree with the gentleman that we  should ensure that no parts of this wasteful spending, this virtue  signaling, is allowed to continue.   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time, and I strongly  support his amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Alford) having assumed the chair, Mr. Luttrell, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4665)  making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations,  and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding but  more importantly for bringing up this very important issue.   I think this particular czar, envoy, is really emblematic of a  serious issue. Here we have a person who travels the world, as the  gentleman has mentioned, in jets going to royal coronations, royal  weddings, lavish receptions in elite capitals around the world, and  then lectures the rest of us and pats himself on the back.   I thank the gentleman for bringing this issue up. That is why in this  bill we prohibit funding for all special envoys that are not authorized  in law or that have not been confirmed by the Senate. That eliminates  33 positions and their associated staff. This is potentially the most  dramatic example of wasteful spending, of virtue signaling while,  frankly, wasting taxpayer money. I commend the gentleman for bringing  this to our attention.   It is difficult to find a more obvious example of waste than the one  that we are dealing with here, so I strongly support the gentleman's  amendment, and I also thank him for emphasizing it, for bringing this  issue forward.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Granger), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to discuss a very serious  concern about the lack of cooperation from the Government of The  Bahamas. It is something that concerns me and Congressman Graves, my  colleague from Louisiana.   I greatly appreciate the gentleman's concern and his impassioned and  relentless search for answers that unfortunately still remain after a  horrific tragedy that happened to one of his constituents. Obviously, I  share his concerns, and I am grateful that he is standing up.   I am prepared to work with him so that we get the answers that he  deserves, that his constituents deserve, and that all of us are  entitled to. Again, I thank him for bringing this very important issue  to the attention of the House. This is something we will continue to  pursue.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chair, I again thank the gentleman for bringing  this forward. It is important that everyone realizes that we are going  to continue to work on this. There needs to be transparency and we need  to get answers.   The gentleman has my commitment that I will do everything and  anything that I can to work with him to get those answers and to make  sure that the family of this American who was lost much too soon  understands that everything has been done to get those answers.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this to the floor,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although  I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this  amendment, which would prohibit funds, as the gentleman said, to delist  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist  organization, very simply.   I would note that section 7041 in our bill contains substantially the  same limitation, one of several provisions designed to counter Iran's  nuclear program and its terrorist activities around the globe.                                time  2000    In addition, the bill provides funding to enforce a future agreement,  any future agreement, related to the nuclear program of Iran until such  an agreement is submitted to Congress and receives the advice and  consent of the Senate. It is not that complicated.   Let's be clear. With the administration's just recent decision to  waive sanctions and facilitate a transfer of $6 billion to fund the  mullahs in Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, this  debate, this issue, could not come at a more timely moment.   I applaud the gentleman for bringing this issue. It is an issue that  all of us should be on the same side on, as he mentioned, because we  have to continue to counter Iran.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge the support of this timely and important  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I respectfully rise in opposition to the  amendment, which would impose a blanket prohibition on the transfer of  cluster munitions to any ally or partner abroad.   Although the bill contains a longstanding limitation on the use  abroad of U.S. cluster munitions, it does permit the transfer of these  weapons where the dud rate is 1 percent or less. The bill also allows  the transfer of related assistance where the purpose is for  demilitarization or permanently disposing of such munitions.   This amendment, however, goes beyond the restrictions in this bill.  It would ban the transfer of those weapons to any foreign partner under  any circumstances, whether to respond to a conflict potentially in the  Korean Peninsula, to support Taiwan, or in the event of a Communist  Chinese invasion or other unforeseen potential issues.   I say this respectfully: It would, I think, unwisely tie the hands of  our military in any potential future conflict.   For those reasons, I respectfully urge defeat of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  [[Page H4837]]  Massie) having assumed the chair, Mr. Yakym, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4665)  making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations,  and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
