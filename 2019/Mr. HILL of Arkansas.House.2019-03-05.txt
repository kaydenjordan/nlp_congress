 Mr. Speaker, in recent weeks, it has been sad  to read that a judicial nominee, Brian Buescher from Nebraska, has been  targeted for his membership in the Knights of Columbus as a part of his  Senate Judiciary Committee's review of qualifications.   The assertion that being a Catholic and being a member of the Knights  of Columbus would prevent Mr. Buescher from properly and effectively  serving our Nation is preposterous.   Religion should not be a factor when measuring someone's ability to  serve their country.   I remind Senators that our Constitution, in Article VI, states that  ``no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any  office or public trust under the United States.''   The Knights of Columbus was originally founded over 120 years ago. It  is a society for working-class and immigrant Catholics and is still  true to its founding principles of charity, unity, and fraternity.   As a Catholic, my faith plays a significant role in every aspect of  life and fosters a respect for the religious rights and freedoms of  others.   I was encouraged to see last month that the Senate unanimously passed  a resolution confirming that membership in a religious organization  does not make a person unfit for public office.   Fundamental American values, among which are commitments to religious  freedom and human rights, will always be the cornerstones of U.S.  domestic and foreign policy.   I will continue to advocate for the rights of individuals to express  their feelings without living in fear of violence and persecution.                          Recognizing Matthew Zajac     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matthew  Zajac, a double amputee Army vet, for his remarkable service to our  country and welcome him to his new home in Little Rock, Arkansas.   In 2007, during a deployment to Iraq, Matt and members of his unit  encountered an IED, which exploded under their Humvee.   Matt lost both of his legs; shrapnel tore through his wrist; and  severe burns covered the right side of his body. He received the Purple  Heart for his injuries and was medically retired.   Mr. Speaker, 2013 marked the start of a downward spiral for Matt  after losing his grandmother and his dad, a man who had stood by his  side throughout the entire recovery process.   Matt came to Arkansas seeking more than just help. He needed a  community. Today, central Arkansas community groups, veterans support  organizations, and our VA hospital are helping Matt restart his life.   He is seeking proper treatment for his PTSD and acts as a spokesman  for our Second Congressional District veterans group, We Are the 22,  which offers assurance and hope for veterans who are considering  suicide.   Matt's sacrifice for Arkansas and America will never be forgotten,  and I join all Arkansans in offering Matt a heartfelt welcome to his  new house in North Little Rock.                       Humanitarian Crisis in Venezuela     Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the ongoing  humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and the ineffective, inhumane, and  irresponsible actions of the Maduro government.   For years, Venezuela's United Socialist Party has pushed a once- prosperous nation towards desperate poverty and open tyranny.   Today in Venezuela, Maduro celebrates while his people eat garbage.   For too long, the authoritarian regime has acted without  accountability. Water sanitation is nonexistent, and hospitals stand  without power or medicine, the results, Mr. Speaker, of 20 years of  irresponsible socialism under the Chavez and Maduro regimes--all this  while 200 tons of U.S. food and medical assistance sit unused at the  Venezuela-Colombia border, blocked by Maduro from entering the country.   I stand with the Organization of American States and over 50  countries  [[Page H2326]]  with interim President Juan Guaido and call on Maduro to step down so  that humanitarian aid can flow to the Venezuelan people, who are sick,  starving, and scared.   All Americans stand with Venezuelans, who want their republic back;  they want their rights back; they want their freedom back.                            ____________________
