 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the men and women who responded to the  horrific events of September 11, 2001, are among the great heroes of  American history. Whether fighting the deadly flames, rescuing people  who were injured or dying, or removing the destructive debris from the  9/11 attack sites, the 9/11 volunteers and rescue workers displayed the  courage and the sacrificial service that has earned them universal  respect and admiration.   Tragically, their heroism came at a cost. Their heroism, at exactly  these same dangerous sites we are describing, earned them, in addition  to great respect, also health challenges in the years since.   In 2001, in response to those challenges, Congress established the  September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to compensate both the  survivors of the attacks and also the residents who lived near the  site. It was authorized for 2 years, and it paid out about $7 billion  in benefits and then closed.   In 2011, Congress revived and expanded the program to cover a larger  universe of victims and responders, and it authorized that fund to  spend $2.7 billion over 5 years.   In 2015, citing a growing need, Congress reauthorized the fund for  another 5 years and an additional $4.6 billion. Of that $7.4 billion  authorized since 2011, the fund has now paid out $5.2 billion.   With money getting tight, in February of this year, the fund began  temporarily reducing the claimants' benefits until Congress  reauthorized and replenished it until such time as we can make those  beneficiaries whole.   I support that effort. I support it wholeheartedly. The bill before  us today authorizes the program not for 2 years, as it was in 2001, or  for 5 years, as we did in 2011 and 2015, no, it authorizes the program  for an additional 72 years and does not specify a dollar amount.   In Washington, this is a recipe for trouble. As we all know, finite  authorizations are how Congress ensures that taxpayer money actually  gets to its intended beneficiaries and not simply lost in government  bureaucracy somewhere. It is how we make sure this is about protecting  those who are supposed to benefit rather than government bureaucrats  themselves.   Since 2011, the 9/11 victims fund has always had finite  authorizations, and, by all accounts, it has had an excellent record of  avoiding waste and abuse. These two things are not coincidental. They  go together, and 9/11 survivors and first responders deserve no less  moving forward. They deserve no less than to make sure the program  created in their honor for their benefit, in fact, benefits them. This  is why I would like to offer a simple amendment to this bill that would  authorize $10.2 billion in additional funding for the 9/11 victims fund  over the next 10 years. That is the amount the Congressional Budget  Office has estimated is necessary for covering all valid claims between  now and 2029.   My amendment would further authorize an additional $10 billion beyond  that time. My amendment would not block or delay the bill's  consideration, let alone its passage.   This is something we could vote on in a matter of minutes, 15 minutes  or so, and then move on to final passage. We could, in fact, accomplish  this today before we adjourn for the weekend. This is, in fact, what I  prefer. I think finishing our work on this bill to protect victims and  first responders is worth 15, 20, 30 minutes of our time. That is what  I prefer.   I have had conversations with my colleagues, including colleagues  across the aisle. In order to accommodate requests from some of my  colleagues, I have agreed, with their mutual assent, to negotiate a  different arrangement--one that would make sure we get to final passage  on this bill and that we consider my amendment and that of Senator  Paul's within the next few days.  [[Page S4938]]         Mr. President, I am grateful to the Democratic leader and to  both Senators from New York for working with me on this and for getting  this, along with my amendment and Senator Paul's amendment, set up for  a vote.   To be very clear--I want there to be no ambiguity--I would be willing  to vote on this right now. There is no reason we should have to delay  that. I am taking into account scheduling requests that were made by  other Members of this body. As far as I am concerned and, as far as I  am aware, as far as Senator Paul is concerned, we would be happy to  vote on these immediately. There is no additional reason for delay.   This is how the Senate is supposed to work. Each Member is supposed  to have the opportunity to bring forward amendments to offer up  improvements to legislation, to make sure that they happen and that  they happen right.   I respectfully but strongly disagree with my colleagues on the merits  of some of the issues we have been discussing. We will debate those  more in the coming days.   I would reiterate that it is not unreasonable to suggest that a  program that takes the unprecedented step of authorizing funding for  something until 2092--that, coupled with language authorizing the  expenditure of such sums as may be necessary, creates problems. It is  one of the reasons we opt to vote on this amendment and one of the  reasons I believe in this amendment.   In any event, this is the kind of thing that ought not to be  difficult. When any Member of any political background sees a potential  weakness or defect in a piece of legislation, the rules of our body are  such that we are supposed to be able to offer that up and cast an  amendment. In this circumstance, I am pleased that it worked out the  way it did, and we will be able to get votes on these amendments.
