 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement  Act.  [[Page H1931]]    In order to reopen our economy and conquer this virus, we need to  have a real count of who has been infected, but we still don't know the  true impact of this pandemic because our Nation is facing a severe  shortage of COVID-19 tests. That is why it is so important that  Democrats fought to include $25 billion in this package to expand our  testing capacity.   Also of critical importance is that this legislation has the Paycheck  Protection Program set aside $60 billion in lending authority for small  community lenders, helping the countless small businesses turned away  by big banks, like my constituent Tony, a dentist who has had a  business account with Bank of America since 1983 but was denied the  opportunity to even apply for PPP. This set-aside authority gives our  smallest businesses the resources and hope they need that they can  survive this pandemic.
