 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan) for yielding.   Often during that polar vortex, I thought of South Carolina and  sometimes wished that I could enjoy the warm breezes.   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Energy Action Team as well as  a proud member of the Energy and Commerce Committee serving on the  Energy Subcommittee, I rise today about an important subject we have  been talking about here, and that is American energy security and  independence.   Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I understand the  importance of being a good steward of our environment. As an avid  outdoorsman, a proud representative of the energy district of the Great  Lakes State, a district that has wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, and coal  power, along with natural gas, we have it all there. But I want my  children and my grandchildren to experience the same beautiful world  that I have experienced. In fact, Madam Speaker, I want them to  experience even better.   We can do that in the use of our energy as well, but we are not going  to get there through socialist policies like the Green New Deal that  will cause energy prices to skyrocket and commit, really, a fraud on  the American people.                                time  2100    Instead, we should focus on solutions that spur innovation and  encourage investments in new technologies that support these goals  while keeping a reliable, resilient grid. These investments are  happening now, but the transition needs to happen in an orderly way  that doesn't hinder economic growth or the security of our country.   One step we can take right now is to update our energy policies for  the 21st century. The energy landscape looks totally different than it  did 40 years ago. Energy resources are abundant instead of scarce. It  is a more diverse market than ever before, and it will continue.   With that in mind, I introduced H.R. 1502, the PURPA Modernization  Act. The bill simply increases competition and reforms outdated  regulations from the 1970s, so that consumers are not burdened with  unnecessary costs on their utility bills coming from stale, outdated  green energy regulations.   We also can't forget that an all-of-the-above energy approach will  continue to utilize safe, clean, and resilient nuclear-based power,  like that produced at the Fermi plants in my district.   Getting new technologies, like advanced carbon capture, out of a lab  and into the market is also crucial. This past winter, we saw the  importance of baseload power when temperatures in Michigan and other  places in the north plummeted to lower than 40 degrees below zero.   I would point my colleagues to bipartisan legislation that I helped  introduce last week with my friend and colleague from Texas,  Representative Crenshaw, which would provide a jump-start to those  innovative technologies at commercial scale.   In closing, Madam Speaker, let's get to work on legislating, not  political messaging. The American people sent us here to work on  solutions that impact their pocketbooks and, yes, also promote their  pursuit of happiness. That is what America is about: unleashing  American energy. And bringing down prices for families we represent is  certainly an important crucial discussion to have.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman tonight for leading this.
