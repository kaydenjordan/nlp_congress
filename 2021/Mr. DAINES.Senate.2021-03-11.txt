 Mr. President, Montana has a rich outdoor heritage. It is  something we are known for not just across the country but even around  the world and something, as Montanans, we are very proud of.   In fact, for generations, Montana families have enjoyed hunting,  fishing, recreating on public lands. I myself am an avid outdoorsman.  In fact, some of my fondest memories growing up in Montana are spending  time with my  [[Page S1483]]  family, my dad, my mom, my grandpa hunting, fishing, backpacking in our  State. And, thankfully, I have had a chance to pass it on to our own  four children--something we still enjoy doing today, my wife and I, as  we are now empty nesters.   Recreation on public lands is part of our Montana way of life. It is  how we raise our families in Montana. And just as we cherish our access  to our public lands, we also value the conservation of our lands, as  well as the stewardship of our vast natural resources.   Energy development flourishes in Montana. It provides over 16,000  hard-working men and women with good-paying jobs to support their  families, while funding conservation and protecting our landscapes and  wildlife. Montana is still a State where hard-working moms and dads who  work hard during the week are thankful for many jobs provided by the  natural resources in our State. They work hard during the week, but on  the weekends, they go down to Walmart, Bob Ward's Sports' warehouse,  and Ace Sporting Goods store and buy an elk tag over the counter, a  fishing license, and get into our public lands within 30 minutes of  buying that license. That is uniquely part of our Montana experience.  These jobs that we have in the natural resource industry, these energy  jobs, are part of who we are as Montanans because we are a State full  of diverse interests, competing priorities, sometimes opposing  philosophies. But time and again, stakeholders have come together to  find balance and achieve our most lasting conservation wins.   That is a word that is missing in Washington, DC, as we are seeing a  new administration come to power; it is the word ``balance.'' You see,  as Montanans, we are proud stewards of our beautiful landscapes, our  rivers, our natural resources, and our wildlife. We take pride in  following the science and listening to our local experts on the ground  to do what is best for our environment and our public lands, as well as  our rural communities.   And this legacy of balance is intertwined within the jurisdiction of  the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior oversees  much of America's lands, our water, wildlife, energy resources, and in  many ways oversees our Montana way of life. Over the past few years, we  have seen Secretaries of the Interior with a range of views--some I  agree with, some I haven't. But one thing was consistent, they were  consensus builders. They were able to listen to the needs of diverse  stakeholders, bring folks together, come up with a solution that worked  for almost everybody. I would use the word ``balance'' again.   Unfortunately, Representative Haaland has a very well-documented and  hostile record toward made-in-America energy, toward natural resource  development, toward wildlife management, and sportsmen. Throughout her  tenure as a Congresswoman, Representative Haaland championed the Green  New Deal. She advocated for the most extreme positions, including  banning all fossil fuels.   She cosponsored legislation to provide Federal protections for  grizzly bears forever without considering the science that is very  clear that supports delisting that species and returning it back to the  States, just like we did with wolves back in 2011.   She has been enthusiastic in her calls to stop not just the Keystone  Pipeline but all pipelines, calling for a ban for all pipelines. She  even protested the Dakota Access Pipeline herself.   She has stated that trapping shouldn't be allowed on public lands.  And as noted by several sportsmen groups, Representative Haaland would  not even commit to maintaining current access on our public lands  during the hearing. I can tell you, these are not mainstream views held  by most Montanans.   I am not opposed to Representative Haaland's confirmation because she  is a Democrat or because she was nominated by President Biden. In fact,  I have supported many of the President's nominees. This is about her  record, her very far-left, divisive positions that will fail to  represent the West, to be in the mainstream of common sense and  balance. And I fear she will harm the Montana way of life as we know  it.   This is about protecting our Montana way of life, the ability to have  a good-paying job during the week and enjoying our public lands on the  weekends because if you kill the energy jobs, you kill all the  pipelines, you kill our natural resources, Montana is left to be simply  a playground for the rich and famous. We have to stand up for our hard- working Montanans and protect their way of life.   This is about maintaining a commonsense balance. We can develop our  natural resources and protect our public lands at the same time. We can  do both, and we must do both.   So I urge my colleagues, especially those from Western States that  hold many of these same values, to really think about what  Representative Haaland would bring to the Department of the Interior as  leader of that organization. I urge my colleagues to consider the  impact this will have and to vote against Representative Haaland's  nomination for Secretary of the Interior.   I yield back my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Dennis Davies of Lewis and Clark County for his compassion  and dedication to his community during the pandemic. While schools were  closed to in-person instruction, Dennis saw that students needed a  place to do their work at home. He rose to the occasion and began  building desks for young Montanans enrolled in virtual school.   When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Dennis was inspired by a TV segment  that profiled a teacher from Iowa who made desks for students and  thought he could do the same for Montana's students.   At first, he paid desk supply expenses out of his own pocket. After  the community recognized the service he was providing, donations began  rolling in. Now, with the assistance of donated supplies and funds, he  is able to expand his operation and build even more desks for kids.  Dennis works alongside many Montanans who volunteer their time to help  him build and deliver desks, and he hopes to provide 2,000 desks to  students across the State. Though that amount may be daunting, he is  excited to help do his part to help Montana families get through the  pandemic.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Dennis for his compassion and  dedication to the people of Lewis and Clark County in this trying time.  His kindness and charitable approach to work serves as an inspiration  to all Montanans.                            ____________________
