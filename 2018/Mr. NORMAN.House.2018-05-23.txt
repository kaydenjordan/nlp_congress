 Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor today to recognize the  93rd birthday of a true American hero, Lieutenant Colonel ``Buz''  Stebbins.   Just after Lieutenant Colonel Stebbins turned 20 years old, he  graduated from West Point in 1945. He served as a pilot in the Army Air  Corps and the United States Air Force for 28 years.   During that time, Buz piloted scores of military aircraft, including  the honor of taking delivery from Lockheed of one of the first C5A  Galaxy cargo aircraft, the largest cargo aircraft in the world. He flew  70 missions to Vietnam in support of our troops engaged in that war.  While stationed in Germany, he became a member of the Caterpillar Club,  whose membership is restricted to those who have had to bail out of a  disabled aircraft.   During his military career, Colonel Stebbins also served as a  professor of physics at both West Point and the United States Air Force  Academy.   Retiring in 1973, Colonel Stebbins chose to reside in the great city  of Tega Cay, South Carolina, which is in my Fifth Congressional  District. He became very active in the community, and was instrumental  in Tega Cay being incorporated as a city in 1982. He has been honored  by a number of organizations in the community, including Citizen of the  Year, grand marshal of the Independence Day parade, and many more.   Colonel Stebbins exemplifies the motto of the great school of West  Point: Duty, Honor, Country.   Buz, happy 93rd birthday on May 31. We look forward to many more  years of you doing what you continue to do.                            ____________________
