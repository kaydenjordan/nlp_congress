 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3469) to amend the Small Business Act to codify the Boots to  Business Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3469         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Entrepreneurship       Training Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. BOOTS TO BUSINESS PROGRAM.         Section 32 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657b) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(h) Boots to Business Program.--        ``(1) Covered individual defined.--In this subsection, the       term `covered individual' means--        ``(A) a member of the Armed Forces, including the National       Guard or Reserves;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  3469, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2021. But before I  begin, let me say how proud I am of the committee's work on behalf of  small businesses. I am pleased that we have worked together on these  bills that we are taking up today because small businesses deserve  nothing less.   I would also like to thank Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for his  bipartisan leadership on our effort today and the work of our Small  Business Committee members who continuously strive to make critical  changes in policy for entrepreneurs.   This week is National Veterans Small Business Week, and I would like  to take a moment to honor and salute the contributions veterans have  made to American small businesses and in our country.   The Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2021 is timely because  it would make vital improvements to SBA's Boots to Business Program, as  well as offer certainty to transitioning servicemembers by authorizing  the program for 5 years.   Since its inception in 2011, SBA's Boots to Business Program has been  a vital resource for transitioning servicemembers and their spouses  looking to launch and grow their small businesses.   Boots to Business offers a 2-day, in-person entrepreneurial education  and training program as part of the Department of Defense's Transition  Assistance Program. This valuable program is delivered throughout the  country by Veterans Business Outreach Centers. Each year, more than  200,000 servicemembers make the transition from military to civilian  life, and transition assistance is a critical component to ensure that  our veterans have meaningful employment opportunities.   Veterans are uniquely positioned to succeed in starting and growing  their own small businesses. The leadership skills, organizational  abilities, and tenacity they developed through their time in the  military lend themselves perfectly to the rigors of entrepreneurship.  According to the SBA, veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self- employed than nonveterans, with 1 in 10 veterans owning a small  business and, in return, employing 5.8 million individuals.   I want to thank Mr. Schneider and Mr. Williams for their work to  provide meaningful entrepreneurship assistance to veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, America's veterans, and their families, deserve our  support as they transition back to civilian life. SBA's Boots to  Business Program is a critical part of that support for veterans  looking to begin their next chapter through entrepreneurship.   I am pleased to support this legislation, which will go a long way in  ensuring transitioning servicemembers success in civilian life once  their tours of duty are complete.   In light of National Veterans Small Business Week and Veterans Day  next week, there is no better time for Congress to show their support  for veteran entrepreneurs. I thank my colleagues, Mr. Brad Schneider  from Illinois and Mr. Roger Williams from Texas, for working together  in support of America's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4256) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  increase the amount that certain banks and savings associations may  invest in small business investment companies, subject to the approval  of the appropriate Federal banking agency, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4256         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Main Street Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES.         Section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958       (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Appropriate federal banking agency defined.--For       purposes of this subsection, the term `appropriate Federal       banking agency' has the meaning given that term under section       3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  4256, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2021.   Since 1958, the Small Business Investment Company program, also known  as the SBIC program, has been an integral part of SBA's mission to  provide small businesses with capital and create jobs. It achieves this  purpose by partnering private and public investments in early-stage  startup businesses. In fact, in 2020, the SBIC program provided almost  $5 billion in financing for 1,063 small businesses and helped sustain  almost 92,000 jobs.   This program gives America's small, high-growth companies an  opportunity to fund and grow their innovative ideas and create jobs.  Just look at companies like Apple, Tesla, or FedEx. Each has achieved  what we all hope for every small business, extraordinary growth and  success. And each of them received early-stage financing from SBICs.   One of the strengths of this program is the hands-off approach SBA  takes with respect to individual investments, giving fund managers the  flexibility to invest in almost any business or sector they choose as  it fits their fund's investment strategy.   This freedom, combined with decades of sound investment strategy, has  led to its success. The SBIC program has helped increase the flow of  patient capital to small, high-growth companies, but we can do more to  ensure the program continues to meet demand.   Ms. Chu and Mr. Garbarino's bill will strengthen and grow the SBIC  program by allowing banks and Federal savings associations to invest up  to 15 percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs. This increase in  capital, which comes at no cost to the taxpayer, offers entrepreneurs  the financing necessary to grow their businesses and continue to  innovate.   I applaud Ms. Chu and Mr. Garbarino for identifying this issue and  finding a sensible solution. I ask all of my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), a sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As the small business economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic,  entrepreneurs will need as many options for affordable capital as  possible. The SBIC program fills the gap between the availability of  venture and private equity capital and the needs of small businesses in  startup and growth situations.   For decades, this program has channeled patient capital to leading- edge, high-growth companies. Some of our Nation's most successful  corporations received early-stage funding from SBICs. Without it, they  would not be the companies they are today. The bill we are considering  today will lead to additional investment by SBICs, which will, in turn,  lead to strong economic growth in our local communities.   The Investing in Main Street Act has bipartisan support, and it is  endorsed by the Small Business Investor Alliance.   I want to applaud Ms. Chu and Mr. Garbarino for their bipartisan work  on this SBIC program. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3462) to require an annual report on the cybersecurity of  the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3462         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``SBA Cyber Awareness Act''.       SEC. 2. CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS REPORTING.         Section 10 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 639) is       amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b) Cybersecurity Reports.--        ``(1) Annual report.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this subsection, and every year       thereafter, the Administrator shall submit a report to the       appropriate congressional committees that includes--        ``(A) an assessment of the information technology (as       defined in section 11101 of title 40, United States Code) and       cybersecurity infrastructure of the Administration;        ``(B) a strategy to increase the cybersecurity       infrastructure of the Administration;        ``(C) a detailed account of any information technology       equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment       of the Administration that was manufactured by an entity that       has its principal place of business located in the People's       Republic of China; and        ``(D) an account of any cybersecurity risk or incident that       occurred at the Administration during the 2-year period       preceding the date on which the report is submitted, and any       action taken by the Administrator to respond to or remediate       any such cybersecurity risk or incident.        ``(2) Additional reports.--If the Administrator determines       that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a       cybersecurity risk or incident occurred at the       Administration, the Administrator shall--        ``(A) not later than 7 days after the date on which the       Administrator makes that determination, notify the       appropriate congressional committees of the cybersecurity       risk or incident; and        ``(B) not later than 30 days after the date on which the       Administrator makes a determination under subparagraph (A)--        ``(i) provide notice to individuals and small business       concerns affected by the cybersecurity risk or incident; and  [[Page H6089]]         ``(ii) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       report, based on information available to the Administrator       as of the date which the Administrator submits the report,       that includes--         ``(I) a summary of information about the cybersecurity risk       or incident, including how the cybersecurity risk or incident       occurred; and        ``(II) an estimate of the number of individuals and small       business concerns affected by the cybersecurity risk or       incident, including an assessment of the risk of harm to       affected individuals and small business concerns.         ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection       shall be construed to affect the reporting requirements of       the Administrator under chapter 35 of title 44, United States       Code, in particular the requirement to notify the Federal       information security incident center under section       3554(b)(7)(C)(ii) of such title, or any other provision of       law.        ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       `appropriate congressional committees' means--        ``(i) the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship       of the Senate; and        ``(ii) the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives.        ``(B) Cybersecurity risk; incident.--The terms       `cybersecurity risk' and `incident' have the meanings given       such terms, respectively, under section 2209(a) of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness  Act. This bill directs the SBA to issue reports that assess its  cybersecurity infrastructure and report cyber threats, breaches, and  attacks.   For more than 25 years, the SBA's Office of Inspector General has  listed IT security as one of the most serious management and  performance challenges facing the agency. These vulnerabilities were  further exposed during the rollout of the SBA's COVID-19 relief  programs. The unprecedented demand for the SBA's relief programs  inundated SBA's legacy systems leading to back-end system crashes,  portals operating slowly, and a glitch that led to a data breach of  applicants' personal information.   SBA failed to make any public announcement about the data breach, and  it took weeks for the agency to send paper notifications to affected  individuals.   The SBA has taken the necessary steps to recover from these  incidents, but we want a notification system in place before the next  cybersecurity breach.   This bill sets new reporting requirements to ensure congressional and  public awareness of cyber incidents at the SBA. I would like to thank  my colleagues, Mr. Jason Crow from Colorado and Mrs. Young Kim from  California, for introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3462 adds new layers of  Congressional oversight to regularly assess SBA's IT and cybersecurity  systems and controls, and it will go a long way to increase  transparency in the event of another IT or cyber incident.   Congress and the American people need to know that the SBA's systems  are fully operational and capable of handling the next surge. This bill  takes a step towards rebuilding the trust and confidence in the SBA's  IT infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work, I urge Members to  vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4481) to amend the Small Business Act to establish  requirements for 7(a) agents, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4481         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business 7(a) Loan       Agent Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR 7(A) AGENTS.         (a) Office of Credit Risk Management Duties.--Section 47(b)       of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657t(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period and inserting       a semicolon; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(4) any 7(a) agent.''.        (b) Enforcement Authority.--        (1) Office of credit risk management.--Section 47(e) of the       Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657t(e)) is amended by       inserting ``or 7(a) agent'' after ``7(a) lender'' each place       such term appears.        (2) Lender oversight committee.--Section 48(c)(2) of the       Small Business Act is amended by striking ``and any Lending       Partner or Intermediary participant'' and inserting ``, any       7(a) agent (as defined in section 47), or any Lending Partner       or Intermediary participant''.        (c) Registration System.--Section 47 of the Small Business       Act (15 U.S.C. 657t) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsections:        ``(j) Registration System for 7(a) Agents.--        ``(1) In general.--The Director shall establish a       registration system for 7(a) agents that assigns a unique       identifier to each 7(a) agent and collects data necessary for       the Director to submit the report required under paragraph       (4).        ``(2) Requirements.--A 7(a) agent shall--        ``(A) register in the system established under paragraph       (1) before providing covered services to a lender or       applicant; and        ``(B) effective 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this subsection, submit an annual fee for such registration       to the Director.        ``(3) Database.--The Director shall establish and maintain       an electronic database of the types of covered services       provided by each 7(a) agent.        ``(k) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) 7(a) agent.--The term `7(a) agent' means a person who       provides covered services on behalf of a lender or applicant.        ``(2) Covered services.--The term `covered services'       means--        ``(A) assistance with completing an application for a loan       under section 7(a) (including preparing a business plan, cash       flow projections, financial statements, and related       documents); or        ``(B) consulting, broker, or referral services with respect       to a loan under section 7(a).''.        (d) Effective Date.--This Act and the amendments made by       this Act shall take effect 6 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  4481, the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act.   This bill would establish a registration system for 7(a) loan agents  that assigns each a unique identifier and collects data to help SBA  track and evaluate loan performance for loans generated through agent  activity.   Our committee has consistently heard from agency watchdogs about the  increased risk associated with loans originated through loan agents.   In October 2021, SBA's Office of Inspector General identified  increased risk introduced by loan agents as one of the agency's top  management and performance challenges facing the agency this fiscal  year.   H.R. 4481 addresses the IG's finding by establishing a registry and  including loan agents as entities against which SBA's Office of Credit  Risk Management may issue formal or informal enforcement actions.   Earlier this Congress, our committee approved this bipartisan bill on  a unanimous basis, and I am proud to support it again today.   I applaud my colleagues, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Meuser, for identifying  this issue and working together on a commonsense solution. I ask all of  my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As the small business economy continues its recovery, we have an  opportunity to optimize SBA's flagship capital access program.   Today's legislation improves SBA's ability to oversee the loan agents  in the 7(a) program and empowers the agency to hold noncompliant agents  accountable.   Currently SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management conducts loan agent  oversight as part of its periodic lender reviews, not directly through  the agents themselves.   The registry established under this bill will improve SBA's ability  to conduct more targeted oversight over the 7(a) loan agents.   I applaud the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) for their bipartisan work to  improve the 7(a) program. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4531) to amend the Small Business Act to require a report on  7(a) agents, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4531         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``7(a) Loan Agent Oversight       Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON 7(A) AGENTS.         Section 47 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657t) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(j) Annual Report.--        ``(1) In general.--The Director shall submit to Congress,       in addition to the report required under subsection (h)(2),       an annual report including, for the calendar year covered by       the report--        ``(A) the number of 7(a) agents assisting applicants for       loans under section 7(a), disaggregated by 7(a) agents who       are attorneys, accountants, consultants, packagers, and       lender service providers (as defined by section 103.1 of       title 13, Code of Federal Regulations);        ``(B) the number of fraudulent loans made for which an       applicant used services of a 7(a) agent;        ``(C) the purchase rate by the Administrator of loans for       which an applicant used services of a 7(a) agent;        ``(D) the number and aggregate dollar value of referral       fees paid to 7(a) agents, disaggregated by whether the       applicant or 7(a) lender paid such fees;        ``(E) without identifying individual 7(a) agents by name, a       consolidated analysis of the risk created by the individual       7(a) agents responsible for not less than 1 percent of--        ``(i) the dollar value of loans made with the assistance of       7(a) agents; and        ``(ii) the number of loans made with the assistance of 7(a)       agents;        ``(F) an analysis of interest rates on loans for which an       applicant or 7(a) lender used services of an agent; and        ``(G) a description of how the Administrator communicates       with 7(a) agents.        ``(2) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) 7(a) agent.--The term `7(a) agent' means a person who       provides covered services on behalf of a lender or applicant.        ``(B) Covered services.--The term `covered services'       means--        ``(i) assistance with completing an application for a loan       under section 7(a) (including preparing a business plan, cash       flow projections, financial statements, and related       documents); or        ``(ii) consulting, broker, or referral services with       respect to a loan under section 7(a).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  4531, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act, companion legislation to H.R.  4481, the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act.   While H.R. 4481 would establish a registration system for 7(a) loan  agents, this bill requires SBA to submit a report to Congress assessing  and analyzing the performance of 7(a) loans generated through loan  agent activity.   This analysis will include SBA's purchase rate for loans generated  through loan agent activity, the aggregate dollar value of referral  fees paid to agents either by borrowers or lenders, and the interest  rates associated with these loans.   The report will also include an analysis--without naming individual  agents--of the risk created by individual agents responsible for  generating at least 1 percent of the 7(a) portfolio.   SBA's Office of Inspector General has repeatedly identified the  increased risks to the 7(a) loan portfolio created by loan agents as  the top agency management challenge and recommended the agency develop  a system to register loan agents and monitor their performance.   The IG's findings about loan agent activity are particularly  troubling. In one instance a loan agent fraudulently originated $90  million in 7(a) loans and received compensation from at least 19  different lenders.   Today's bills on 7(a) loan agent registration and oversight will go a  long way in providing transparency and are long overdue.   Once again, I want to sincerely thank Mr. Phillips and Mr. Meuser for  identifying this issue and collaborating on a sensible solution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The two bills we are considering today go hand in hand and will also  go a long way to enhance transparency in the 7(a) program.   Over the last year, our committee has focused on relief programs, but  we never lost sight of our traditional lending programs. Today, we turn  our attention to the core SBA loan programs and ensure they are working  as best as they can.   The report required under this bill will help Congress and the public  better understand the role loan agents play in the 7(a) program,  whether they improve access to capital for entrepreneurs, and the  impact of potential bad actors in this space, especially as it relates  to portfolio risk.   Though lenders bear primary responsibility for monitoring their  agents, only SBA is positioned to aggregate loan agent portfolios,  evaluate their performance, and inform lenders and policymakers about  concerning program risks or trends.   Once again, I want to salute the work of the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Phillips) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser). I  encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4515) to amend the Small Business Act to require cyber  certification for small business development center counselors, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4515         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Development       Center Cyber Training Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DUTIES OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER                     COUNSELORS.         Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(o) Cyber Strategy Training for Small Business       Development Centers.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `cyber strategy' means resources and tactics       to assist in planning for cybersecurity and defending against       cyber risks and cyber attacks; and        ``(B) the term `lead small business development center'       means a small business development center that has received a       grant from the Administration.        ``(2) Certification program.--The Administrator shall       establish a cyber counseling certification program, or       approve a similar existing program, to certify the employees       of lead small business development centers to provide cyber       planning assistance to small business concerns.        ``(3) Number of certified employees.--The Administrator       shall ensure that the number of employees of each lead small       business development center who are certified in providing       cyber planning assistance under this subsection is not fewer       than the lesser of--        ``(A) 5; or        ``(B) 10 percent of the total number of employees of the       lead small business development center.        ``(4) Consideration of small business development center       cyber strategy.--In carrying out this subsection, the       Administrator, to the extent practicable, shall consider any       cyber strategy methods included in the Small Business       Development Center Cyber Strategy developed under section       1841(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2662).        ``(5) Reimbursement for certification.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations and subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall       reimburse a lead small business development center for costs       relating to the certification of an employee of the lead       small business development center under the program       established under paragraph (2).        ``(B) Limitation.--The total amount reimbursed by the       Administrator under subparagraph (A) may not exceed $350,000       in any fiscal year.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4515, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act. This legislation will enable  Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs, to better assist small  businesses with their cybersecurity needs.   Small businesses often lack the resources, training, or technical  knowledge to prevent a cyberattack before it happens. In the past year  alone, 47 percent of small businesses experienced a cyberattack, and  out of those, 44 percent experienced more than one.   A cyberattack can cripple a small business, and the repercussions can  be felt across the supply chain. In fact, the cost of a single breach  can cost upwards of $200,000 or more. During hearings over the years,  my committee has heard heartbreaking stories of how just one  cyberattack forced companies to close their doors permanently.   Today's legislation takes action to provide much-needed resources to  any small company, whether it is our local pizza shop or an independent  Uber driver, to educate and protect themselves from growing cybercrime.   Because SBDCs have a proven record of understanding the needs of  small businesses, H.R. 4515 would establish a cyber counseling  certification program in SBDCs to provide specific, free-of-charge  cyber training for small entities.   The cyber training provided by the nationwide network of SBDCs will  offer crucial resources for small employers to plan and implement  cybersecurity protections and combat cyberattacks.   I thank my colleagues, Mr.  Andrew Garbarino from New York, Mr.    Steve Chabot from Ohio, and Mr. Dwight Evans and Ms. Chrissy Houlahan  from Pennsylvania, for their work on this bill. I am confident that the  bipartisan work of the Small Business Committee will better fortify our  Nation's cyber infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our national cybersecurity infrastructure is only as  strong as our weakest links. America's small companies need the same  cybersecurity protections as Fortune 500 businesses and the Federal  Government but often lack the resources.   This bill would go a long way in assisting small businesses with  their cybersecurity needs. The training and resources provided by SBDCs  will offer crucial resources for small businesses to plan and implement  cybersecurity protections and minimize the damage of cyber incidents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
