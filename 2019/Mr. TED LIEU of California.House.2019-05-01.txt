 Mr. Speaker, in the last 24 hours, we  have discovered that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote a letter to  Attorney General Bill Barr saying that the Attorney General  mischaracterized the Mueller report. That is an extraordinary letter.   I am now going to read into the House Congressional Record the  relevant portions of that letter, which is dated March 27, 2019, from  Robert Mueller to Bill Barr.   He writes: ``The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and  released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully  capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office's work and  conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the  morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical  aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to  undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the  Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the  investigations.''   Bill Barr is supposed to be the attorney for all Americans. He is  supposed to be the people's attorney, not Donald Trump's personal  attorney. He does not understand that. He needs to resign.                            ____________________
