 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Reverend Dr. Naomi  Rogers, a devoted Korean American.   Reverend Rogers has devoted much of her life to the spiritual well- being of Arkansans through her work as a pastor with the United  Methodist Church.   Her expertise in theology and love for Christianity have allowed her  to become involved with multiple Methodist churches throughout our  State.   She also serves as the president of the Korean American Federation of  Arkansas. Her work with the association was instrumental in the  construction of the Korean War Memorial in Little Rock.   Her work and leadership have made Reverend Rogers a marvelous role  model and ambassador for Korean Americans not only in Arkansas, but  across our country.   I congratulate Reverend Rogers on all of her accomplishments and look  forward to all that she will achieve in the future.                Recognizing Lieutenant Colonel Larry Stricklin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable  accomplishments of Lieutenant Colonel Larry Stricklin. On 14 October,  Colonel Stricklin and his colleagues celebrated  [[Page H5408]]  his well-deserved retirement after 30 years of selfless service to our  Nation.    Colonel Stricklin's career in the U.S. Army began in 1995 when he  joined the 39th Infantry Brigade. Separating from the Army due to a car  crash in 1996, Lieutenant Colonel Stricklin reenlisted in 1998.   Since then, Colonel Stricklin has served his country in Iraq and has  held a variety of other key positions around the globe. He recently  assisted with the military response to one of the worst pandemics in  our Nation's history.   Throughout his remarkable career, Colonel Stricklin has exemplified  dedication, resilience, leadership, and most of all, an unwavering  dedication to our beloved country.   Mr. Speaker, I wish him a happy retirement and thank him for his  service and inspiration for the next generation.                celebrating the life of william gary underwood     Mr. Speaker, I am sad to rise today, but I rise to  celebrate the life of my dear friend, William Gary Underwood.   His 47-year career in music, youth, and media ministry has brought  joy and healing to numerous Americans and Arkansans, and Arkansas was  fortunate to have him in our community.   Gary's journey through ministry was plentiful. He was involved in the  Elmdale Baptist Church in Springdale, Beech Street First Baptist Church  in Texarkana, and he served as the interim minister at Perryville First  Baptist Church. He was also instrumental as the chaplain of the Little  Rock Touchdown Club.   Gary was a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, and his passion  led him to be heavily involved in the development and launch of ACTS  Christian Television Network in Arkansas.   Beyond the ministry, Gary and I became friends when he joined  Governor Mike Huckabee's staff as his director of media operations in  1996.   Gary's passion for music, aiding youth, and the church has left  Arkansas a much better place than when he found it. He will be missed  by family, friends, and many others in our State. He lived a life to be  celebrated.            Celebrating the Life of Judge Floyd ``Buddy'' Villines     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of  former Pulaski County Judge Floyd ``Buddy'' Villines.   Mr. Villines graduated from Hendrix College in 1969 and afterwards  would go on to serve in the U.S. Army during Vietnam where he earned a  Bronze Star.   Upon return to the United States, he graduated from the University of  Arkansas at Little Rock's William H. Bowen School of Law. Mr. Villines  would start a career in public relations with the management of his own  firm.   He won his first election in 1984, becoming a member of the Little  Rock Board of Directors. He would then serve as vice mayor from 1987 to  1988, and he became mayor in 1989, serving 1 year.   In 1990, he was elected to be the Pulaski County judge, and he would  serve in that post until 2014.   Villines left his mark in central Arkansas through numerous bridge  and trail projects, including the Big Dam Bridge, the Arkansas River  Trail, Simmons Bank Arena, and the expansion of the Statehouse  Convention Center.   His impact on Pulaski County has been tremendous and his remarkable,  lasting landmarks will stand as testament to his decades of leadership.   Mr. Villines will be missed dearly by his family, friends, and all of  us in Pulaski County.                            ____________________
