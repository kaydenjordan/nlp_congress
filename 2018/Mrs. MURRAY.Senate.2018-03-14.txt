 Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to remind all  of us of those who have been lost due to gun violence from Washington  State.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, time and again, President Trump and Vice  President Pence have made clear they will put extreme ideology ahead of  women's health and constitutional freedoms. We have seen it in their  efforts to undermine women's ability to get reproductive healthcare  from providers they trust. We have seen it in their efforts to let  employers deny women birth control coverage based on what they believe  and regardless of what the women who work for them believe. We have  seen it in the administration's close coordination with a hate group on  tailoring policies to undermine Planned Parenthood. We heard it loud  and clear when Vice President Pence laid out his far-right vision that  women's freedom to have safe and legal abortions could end in our time.  We have also seen it implemented to an appalling extreme in Scott  Lloyd's inexcusably harmful and ideologically driven actions as  Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   The Office of Refugee Resettlement is a little-known but very  important office inside the Department of Health and Human Services.  They are supposed to be helping resettle refugees who are fleeing  violence, to resettle and integrate Iraqis and Afghans whose lives are  actually in danger because they work for the U.S. Government. They  provide rehabilitative, social, and legal services to survivors of  torture, and they are charged with overseeing a network of providers  across the United States who care for unaccompanied children who arrive  at our Nation's borders--children and youth--seeking safety in our  country.   However, under Director Lloyd, it has become a testing ground for the  radical Trump-Pence agenda to interfere with women's health choices.  Repeatedly, under the supervision of Director Lloyd's office, when  young women--some of whom are survivors of sexual abuse--have sought  safe and legal abortions, his response has been to personally step in  and put up barriers to their care. He worked to prevent young women in  his custody from speaking with lawyers about their rights. He  personally interfered to try to pressure women out of their decisions  to have abortions. Director Lloyd even had his office explore the  possibility of reversing an abortion once the medical procedure was  underway--a practice that the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists has noted is ``unproven and unethical.''   A deposition from ongoing litigation shows just how reckless and  irresponsible Scott Lloyd has been. In emails,  [[Page S1703]]  he admitted he was making these decisions on an ad hoc basis. In other  words, Director Lloyd wasn't concerned with fulfilling his duty as the  head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. He wasn't concerned with  the well-being of women. He wasn't concerned with their personal  decisions or their freedoms. He was only concerned with furthering an  extreme, ideological agenda.   Women and men across the country are not having it. They are standing  up and standing against Scott Lloyd's extreme policies. Many have  signed a petition calling for his removal, and they are just the latest  addition to a growing outcry against Director Lloyd's willful disregard  for women's rights.   Many Senate and House Democrats have called for him to step down. I  am again calling on Secretary Azar to fire Scott Lloyd as Director of  the Office of Refugee Resettlement because Scott Lloyd's actions and  his personal beliefs about what women can and can't do with their  bodies show a fundamental disrespect for the rights and equality of  women, as does setting policy that has huge implications for women's  health and lives through an ``ad hoc'' process.   Scott Lloyd's actions to undermine women's health and to deny women's  rights are utterly unacceptable, and they cannot go unchecked. We  cannot permit bullies to try to intimidate vulnerable young women who  are making the healthcare decisions that are right for them--not  President Trump, not Vice President Pence, and not Scott Lloyd.   I am going to keep standing up and fighting for the rights of these  women and immigrants across the country and for the rule of law that  ensures those rights. I am going to keep fighting against those who  think they are above the law and who want to roll back the clock on  these freedoms. I urge my colleagues to join me today in standing with  women, standing for the rule of law, and calling for Scott Lloyd's  immediate removal from office.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
