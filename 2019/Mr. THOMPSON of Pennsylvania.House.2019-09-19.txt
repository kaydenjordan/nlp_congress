 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize September as National Suicide Prevention Month.   Depression and suicide ideation affect all ages, genders, and  backgrounds, and thousands of Americans die each year. Suicide is the  10th leading cause of death in the United States. There are an  estimated 1.7 million attempts each year. In 2017, suicide rates in  [[Page H7819]]  Pennsylvania exceeded the national average.   Mental health professionals, advocacy organizations, survivors, and  allies take this month to combat the stigma of discussing mental health  and connect those with suicidal thoughts to a network of professional  resources.   If you think a loved one is struggling with depression or ideation,  just ask. People in need can often feel relieved when someone asks  about their well-being in a caring way. Acknowledging and discussing  their thoughts may be the first step in reducing risk.   I encourage anyone who is struggling with thoughts of suicide to call  the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.   Madam Speaker, let's keep the conversation going year-round. We can  all play an important role in prevention.                            ____________________
