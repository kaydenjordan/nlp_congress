 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1567) to require that the Secretary of Agriculture and the  Secretary of the Interior submit accurate reports regarding hazardous  fuels reduction activities, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Accurately Counting Risk       Elimination Solutions Act'' or the ``ACRES Act''.       SEC. 2. ACCURATE HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION REPORTS.

(4) Wildland-urban interface.--The term ``wildland-urban       interface'' has the meaning given the term in section 101 of       the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511).        (e) No Additional Funds Authorized.--No additional funds       are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act, and       the activities authorized by this Act are subject to the       availability of appropriations made in advance for such       purposes.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1567, as amended, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Representative Tiffany's  legislation, H.R. 1567, the Accurately Counting Risk Elimination  Solutions, or ACRES Act.   This is a commonsense, good governance bill that will bring sorely  needed transparency and accountability to the misleading way our  Federal land managers are tracking and reporting hazardous fuel  treatments.   We remain in the midst of a historic catastrophic wildfire crisis  that has devoured an average of 7 million acres every year for the last  two decades. This alarming figure is more than double the annual losses  seen during the 1990s.  [[Page H4250]]    This worsening problem is directly linked to insufficient forest  management, which has created a dangerous build-up of hazardous fuels  in our forest. Despite the clear need to confront this crisis head on,  Federal land management agencies like the Forest Service are still  failing to increase the pace and scale of their treatments.   Even more concerning is the recent investigative reporting by NBC  News that found that the Forest Service is overreporting the number of  acres they treat annually by over 20 percent. This happens because the  Forest Service will count the same piece of land toward its risk  reduction goals multiple times if different treatments, such as  prescribed thinning and burning, are completed on that land.   In some extreme cases, the Forest Service counted the same parcel of  land 30 times, meaning the agency reported to Congress that they  reduced hazardous fuels on 30 acres when, in fact, only one acre had  received treatment.   This problem gets worse if treatments can span several years. For  example, NBC News found an example of a hazardous fuels reduction  project in southern California that lasted for 5 years. The Forest  Service reported that they treated 744 acres of land when, in fact,  only 173 acres had been treated.   If the Forest Service were treating at the order of magnitude that  they need to be treating, these numbers wouldn't matter, but I think  inflating the numbers is just a way to try to cover up the inadequate  management that is happening. Instead of talking about hundreds of  acres, we need to be talking about thousands and tens of thousands and  even hundreds of thousands of acres that are being treated.                                time  1645    This kind of reporting means that the Forest Service suggested to  Congress and the public that they are doing as much as four times more  work than they had actually accomplished. This is absolutely  unacceptable, particularly in an area where wildfire risk and the risk  to communities is extremely high.   This legislation simply requires the Forest Service to submit data to  Congress annually that details their hazardous fuels reduction work by  only counting each individual acre once even if multiple treatments  were performed. This exact idea has been supported in reports from the  Government Accountability Office and USDA's Office of Inspector  General.   The fact that we need to pass legislation to tell the Forest Service  to count the way that we all learned how to count should show us just  how deep this problem runs within our agencies when it comes to  confronting our catastrophic wildfire crisis.   By holding Federal land managers accountable for their actual work,  the work that they are doing on the ground to help improve forest  health and to make our Nation's forests safer for all of us, we are  required to do this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Tiffany for bringing this bill  forward. I ask that we support this bill strongly, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2023.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 1567, the ``Accurately Counting       Risk Elimination Solutions Act'', or the ``ACRES Act''. Thank       you for collaborating with the Committee on Agriculture on       the matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing       consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over any subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support       such a request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 1567 and request a       copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                             Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, September 6, 2023.      Hon. Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 1567, the       Accurately Counting Risk Elimination Solutions Act or the       ACRES Act, which was ordered reported by the Committee on       Natural Resources on April 28, 2023.        I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and       appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I       acknowledge that the Committee on Agriculture will not       formally consider H.R. 1567 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained therein.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Bruce Westerman,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal  Lands and the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we do everything in  our power to ensure that our forests are being managed properly. The  ACRES Act is one small step in the right direction. It is a commonsense  solution to a problem that really shouldn't even exist in the first  place.   Again, I thank the ranking member in the minority for supporting this  bill. The idea that we are actually moving toward more forest  management is encouraging to me.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1450) to amend the Agricultural Act of 2014 to modify the  treatment of revenue from timber sale contracts and certain payments  made by counties to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of  the Interior under good neighbor agreements, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1450         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Treating Tribes and Counties       as Good Neighbors Act''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN REVENUE AND                     PAYMENTS UNDER GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS.         (a) Good Neighbor Authority.--Section 8206 of the       Agricultural Act of 2014 (16 U.S.C. 2113a) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(6), by striking ``or Indian tribe'';       and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting ``, Indian tribe,''       after ``Governor'';        (B) in paragraph (2)(C)--        (i) by striking clause (i) and inserting the following:        ``(i) In general.--Funds received from the sale of timber       by a Governor, an Indian tribe, or a county under a good       neighbor agreement shall be retained and used by the       Governor, Indian tribe, or county, as applicable--         ``(I) to carry out authorized restoration services under       the good neighbor agreement; and        ``(II) if there are funds remaining after carrying out       subclause (I), to carry out authorized restoration services       under other good neighbor agreements.''; and         (ii) in clause (ii), by striking ``2023'' and inserting       ``2028'';        (C) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``, Indian tribe,''       after ``Governor''; and        (D) by striking paragraph (4).        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 8206(a) of the       Agricultural Act of 2014 (16 U.S.C. 2113a(a)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)(B), by inserting ``, Indian tribe,''       after ``Governor''; and        (2) in paragraph (5), by inserting ``, Indian tribe,''       after ``Governor''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act apply       to any project initiated pursuant to a good neighbor       agreement (as defined in section 8206(a) of the Agricultural       Act of 2014 (16 U.S.C. 2113a(a)))--        (1) before the date of enactment of this Act, if the       project was initiated after the date of enactment of the       Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-334; 132       Stat. 4490); or        (2) on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1450, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Congressman Fulcher's bill, the  Treating Tribes and Counties as Good Neighbors Act.   This legislation would greatly enhance the collaborative stewardship  of our Federal lands with Tribal and county partners. This is a  bipartisan effort that passed out of the House Natural Resources and  Agriculture Committees unanimously, and it is my hope that we can pass  this thoughtful proposal in a similar fashion here on the House floor  today.   The Federal Government owns roughly 640 million acres, an astonishing  28 percent of the entire country. States, Tribes, and counties all have  a very clear interest in how these lands are managed.   When Federal lands are mismanaged, it is those closest to the lands  that are most impacted. There is no clearer example of this reality  than the forest health and wildfire crisis affecting vast swaths of  Federal lands. Fire knows no boundaries between managed land and  unmanaged lands. It knows no jurisdictional boundaries.   As Federal land managers struggle to address this worsening problem,  Congress developed the Good Neighbor Authority to empower States to  assist in active forest management efforts on Federal lands.   Under the Good Neighbor Authority, the Forest Service and Bureau of  Land Management had the ability to authorize States to undertake  restoration projects such as hazardous fuel reduction, habitat  improvement, and road restoration on Federal lands within their  borders.   By all accounts, this program for States has been very successful.  Since 2014, over 490 projects have begun in 38 States. Just last year,  approximately 274 million board feet of timber was sold under Good  Neighbor agreements.   The 2018 farm bill extended Good Neighbor Authority to counties and  Tribes in the hopes that even more active forest management could be  accomplished. Unfortunately, the participation of counties and Tribes  has been limited.  [[Page H4252]]    Current law does not give Tribes and counties the same authority that  States have benefited from to retain timber receipts for use on  additional restoration work. This reality removes a substantial  incentive for counties and Tribes to pursue Good Neighbor projects, and  the numbers have shown this to be true. There are currently only six  counties and five Tribes that have entered into Good Neighbor  agreements.   H.R. 1450 offers a solution to this dilemma by extending the  authority to retain timber receipts from Good Neighbor projects to  counties and Tribes to fund additional restoration projects, bringing  them into parity with the treatment that States currently receive.   In addition to providing important parity, this bill will also  improve cross-boundary work by allowing restoration projects to occur  on non-Federal lands. As I mentioned earlier, wildfires know no  boundaries.   Good Neighbor Authority has unquestionably been a successful program  that has not yet reached its full potential. I believe that Congressman  Fulcher's bill will improve this program and pave the way for Tribes  and counties to partner on much-needed forest management efforts. Fully  empowering counties and Tribes to utilize this authority will reduce  wildfire risks and improve the health of our Federal lands for  generations to come. I applaud Congressman Fulcher for his leadership  on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and  Mineral Resources.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Committee on  Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I must say it is an honor to work with a  colleague like Chairman Thompson who cares so much about forest health,  and I appreciate the ranking member in the minority for supporting this  bill as well, as it did pass unanimously out of both committees.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the magnitude of our forest health crises  demands an all-hands-on-deck approach that utilizes all of the tools in  the toolbox.   The Good Neighbor Authority has proven to be an exceptional tool when  used by the States. We need to improve and expand on that with H.R.  1450 by including Tribes and counties.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3389) to require the Secretary of Agriculture, acting  through the Chief of the Forest Service, and the Secretary of the  Interior to conduct an evaluation with respect to the use of the  container aerial firefighting system (CAFFS), and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3389         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Wildfire Fighting       Technology Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. CONTAINER AERIAL FIREFIGHTING SYSTEM (CAFFS).         (a) Evaluation.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture and       the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the       National Interagency Aviation Committee and the Interagency       Airtanker Board, shall jointly conduct an evaluation of the       container aerial firefighting system to assess the use of       such system to mitigate and suppress wildfires.        (b) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture and the       Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the National       Interagency Aviation Committee and the Interagency Airtanker       Board, shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees a       report that includes the results of the evaluation required       under subsection (a).        (c) Appropriate Committees Defined.--In this section, the       term ``appropriate committees'' means--        (1) the Committees on Agriculture and Natural Resources of       the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry       and Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 3389, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Congressman Valadao's bill, the  Emergency Wildfire Fighting Technology Act of 2023.  [[Page H4254]]    This legislation, rightly named, has the potential to provide another  tool in the toolbox for addressing the catastrophic wildfire crisis.  Americans have tragically grown accustomed to increasingly severe  wildfire years that are lasting longer and producing more destruction  than ever before. This summer, devastating wildfires impacted the  community of Lahaina on the island of Maui, devastation I saw firsthand  along with several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Unfortunately, the reality is that decades of inadequate forest  management have created an unprecedented forest health crisis. Across  the U.S., there are now 1 billion acres of at-risk land for wildfire.  In the absence of dramatic change, the future outlook remains bleak.   When it comes to fighting these out-of-control infernos, we simply  don't have the luxury of ignoring potential new technologies that could  improve the cost efficiency or effectiveness of suppressing fires.   It is critical that wildland firefighting agencies have all tools and  methods available to them to fight fires and protect lives and  property. Aircraft and helicopters provide lifesaving support to ground  crews, often by delivering water or fire retardant. In order to drop  water or fire retardant from a plane or helicopter, the aircraft must  be designed or retrofitted for such purposes, limiting the number of  aircraft that are available.   Mr. Valadao has worked with various stakeholders who have developed  and improved a container aerial firefighting system to drop water and  fire retardant from aircraft via disposable containers. This technology  could decrease the response time to wildfires by increasing the number  of aircraft available, thus saving more lives and more structures. This  technology is not new. However, the system has not been recently  studied by the wildland firefighting agencies.   H.R. 3389 would require the U.S. Forest Service and Department of the  Interior to conduct an evaluation on the use of container aerial  firefighting systems in response to wildfires. The evaluation will  focus on effectiveness, cost, ease of delivery, and safety.   Directing our wildfire fighting agencies to study new and emerging  technology is a win for the wildland firefighting crews and a win for  those who live in fire-prone areas.   I applaud Congressman Valadao for his leadership on this important  topic. He is a leader on bipartisan solutions that meaningfully improve  forest health and reduce wildfires.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                          House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2023.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 3389, the ``Emergency Wildfire       Fighting Technology Act of 2023''. Thank you for       collaborating with the Committee on Agriculture on the       matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing       consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over any subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support       such a request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 3389 and request a       copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                             Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, September 6, 2023.      Hon. Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 3389, the       Emergency Wildfire Fighting Technology Act of 2023, which was       ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources on       June 13, 2023.        I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and       appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I       acknowledge that the Committee on Agriculture will not       formally consider H.R. 3389 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained therein.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Bruce Westerman,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao), the lead sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. Valadao for bringing  this important piece of legislation. I thank the ranking member and the  minority for their support on this bill.   Again, we must provide all necessary tools for the wildland  firefighting agencies so that they can combat this wildfire crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3324) to extend the authority to collect Shasta-Trinity  Marina fees through fiscal year 2029.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHASTA-TRINITY MARINA FEES.         Section 422 of the Department of the Interior, Environment,       and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law       110-161; 121 Stat 2149) as amended, is further amended by       striking ``and each subsequent fiscal year through fiscal       year 2019'' and inserting ``and each subsequent fiscal year       through fiscal year 2029''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 3324, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3324. This is a good  bipartisan effort being led by Representatives Huffman and LaMalfa and  will help to improve recreation opportunities to their constituents in  northern California.   This bill extends the authority of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest  to collect and retain existing marina fees for the purpose of enhancing  recreation opportunities and improving access at the Whiskeytown- Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, which is located within  Congressmen LaMalfa and Huffman's districts.   The Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area encompasses  large reservoirs and abundant mountain terrain. This area is very  popular with hunters, anglers, and outdoor recreationists.   The authority to collect and retain marina fees expired in 2019 but  has been temporarily extended through appropriations legislation. The  marina fees retained by the Forest Service are spent on recreation  enhancement projects such as boat ramp improvements, lake cleanup  efforts, maintaining recreational facilities, and improving access for  visitors with disabilities. The Forest Service also provides  educational programs with these funds.   This bill would not increase or otherwise affect the price of the  current marina fees. H.R. 3324 simply continues a current authority  that has yielded positive results for families who enjoy visiting this  idyllic destination. I commend Representatives Huffman and LaMalfa for  their collaborative work on this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Huffman and Mr. LaMalfa for  bringing this legislation forward. I think this could actually be a  model that could be expanded on across the country so that recreation  fees collected in a certain area could be retained and used to reinvest  back into that area to provide Americans more access to our public  lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
