 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6720) to prohibit the slaughter of dogs and cats for human  consumption, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6720         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Dog and Cat Meat Trade       Prohibition Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SLAUGHTER OF DOGS AND CATS FOR HUMAN                     CONSUMPTION.         (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (c), no       person may--        (1) knowingly slaughter a dog or cat for human consumption;       or        (2) knowingly ship, transport, move, deliver, receive,       possess, purchase, sell, or donate--        (A) a dog or cat to be slaughtered for human consumption;       or        (B) a dog or cat part for human consumption.        (b) Scope.--Subsection (a) shall apply only with respect to       conduct--        (1) in interstate commerce or foreign commerce; or        (2) within the special maritime and territorial       jurisdiction of the United States.        (c) Exception for Indian Tribes.--The prohibition in       subsection (a) shall not apply to an Indian (as defined in       section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education       Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)) carrying out any activity       described in subsection (a) for the purpose of a religious       ceremony.        (d) Penalty.--Any person who violates subsection (a) shall       be subject to a fine in an amount not greater than $5,000 for       each violation.        (e) Effect On State Law.--Nothing in this section--        (1) limits any State or local law or regulation protecting       the welfare of animals; or        (2) prevents a State or unit of local government from       adopting and enforcing an animal welfare law or regulation       that is more stringent than this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6720, to prohibit the  slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption, and for other  purposes.   While this practice is completely unacceptable in the United States,  only four States explicitly ban it. This patchwork of State laws does  not signal the appropriate protection we Americans expect for our  beloved pets and companions.   To credibly condemn the international dog and cat meat trade,  including the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China, the United States must  send a clear message that this practice is completely unacceptable.  This overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation is a crucial step in doing  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my distinguished  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I simply urge all Members to join me in support of this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
