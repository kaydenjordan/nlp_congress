 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Corporal Joseph Maciel of the Third Infantry Division, who died in the  line of duty in Afghanistan on July 7.   Corporal Maciel was an excellent soldier who had served in the Army  for 2 years in the Third ID. He had been stationed in Afghanistan since  February of this year. His quality work ethic, positive attitude, and  honorable service earned him a number of accolades, including the Army  Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Army Service  Ribbon. He was highly respected by his fellow soldiers.   Corporal Maciel's passing occurred during an insider attack in  Afghanistan in which two other soldiers were wounded. As our soldiers  risk their lives in Afghanistan and other nations to spread the values  of democracy, we must keep our soldiers and their families in our  thoughts and prayers.                      HONORING CAPTAIN MICHAEL MCFADDEN     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain  Michael McFadden of the Savannah Fire Department, who lost his life in  the line of duty earlier this year at 44 years of age.   A life dedicated to public service, Captain McFadden served in the  United States Marine Corps for 8 years before joining the Savannah Fire  Department. His high level of training and successful missions allowed  him to rise through the ranks from master firefighter to, eventually,  captain.   Captain McFadden collapsed suddenly one day with a heart problem.  Unfortunately, firefighters are at high risk for severe cardiac  problems because of their strenuous physical activity, emotional  stress, exposure to pollutants, and smoke inhalation.   With more than a million firefighters across the U.S., I hope that  everyone will keep these brave men and women in their thoughts as they  go to work each day to keep us and our communities safe.   Captain McFadden's family will continue to be in our thoughts and  prayers.                           HONORING RONNIE THOMPSON     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Ronnie Wayne Thompson, who passed away Sunday, July 8, at the  age of 71.   A lifetime resident of Savannah in Georgia's First Congressional  District, Mr. Thompson is leaving a lasting legacy on the city. Mainly,  he will be remembered for owning and operating the famous Mrs. Wilkes  Boarding House restaurant, which serves some of the best home-style  southern cooking in Savannah.    Founded by his grandmother-in-law, Mrs. Wilkes, Mr. Thompson did a  seamless job of maintaining the quality of food and the southern  atmosphere at the restaurant with which he worked for 40 years.   He was spotted often in downtown Savannah, enjoying coffee with  friends, attending the St. Patrick's Day parade, and just generally  making other people's days a little bit brighter.   He met his wife, Marcia, at the age of 12 on Tybee Island and spent a  great deal of time there in his later years with his grandchildren.   A U.S. Marine Corps veteran, longtime Savannahian, small-business  owner, husband, father, grandfather, and overall genuine person, Ronnie  Thompson truly will be missed.                            ____________________
