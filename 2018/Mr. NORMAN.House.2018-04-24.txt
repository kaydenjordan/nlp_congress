 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell you that the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act is working. It is working in South Carolina's Fifth  Congressional District, and it is working across the country. It is  working for individuals and families who are seeing more money in their  paychecks each month, and it is working for the companies that are  investing the savings from tax reform into their employees.   Over the past few weeks, I have spoken with and visited the  businesses of South Carolina that are putting these savings right back  into the local communities. Early this month, LPL Financial announced  that they will be investing these savings into their employees by  increasing its 401(k) match to 75 percent and reducing the time for new  hires to qualify for this match by 6 months.   As Congressman Wilson said, this personally touches 2,000  constituents in the Fifth District of South Carolina. That is 2,000  more families that now have a greater opportunity to save and see the  light of a brighter future ahead.   Mr. Speaker, just today, I visited a UPS store in Gaffney, South  Carolina. Because of tax reform, UPS has announced over $12 billion in  investments and an increase in pension funding.   During my UPS visit, I put on a uniform and assisted a delivery  driver during a ride-along. I heard directly from the hardworking  employees about how this news will impact them and all of their loved  ones.   I don't think I speak just for myself when I say that we want jobs to  come and stay in America. We want businesses to expand and to hire  people in our communities. By reducing tax rates and simplifying the  Tax Code, we are allowing companies to make these investments in their  employees, in their communities, and in growing their businesses.   I look forward to continued opportunities to learn, see, and talk  about the success of this tax reform. We promised fairer taxes, higher  wages, and more jobs. As Congressman Wilson says, we have delivered.
