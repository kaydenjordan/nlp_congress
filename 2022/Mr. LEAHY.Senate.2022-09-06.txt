 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to highlight a  truly feel good story straight out of my home State of Vermont, a story  of how middle school friends and ski buddies from southern Vermont  reconnected and fell in love after life took them mostly separate ways.   Caroline Cornell and Daniel Patrick Logan grew up in southern Vermont  and were close, but platonic, friends while attending middle school and  Burr and Burton Academy in Manchester, VT. After graduation, they  remained in contact, but traveled transiently and independently. Their  individual journeys took them across the world, from the Lost Coast of  California to Thailand, Florida, and the Finger Lakes of New York.  Their two separate, but eventually corresponding, life journeys  involved transient living, Grateful Dead tribute bands, odd jobs,  romance, heartbreak, and so much more. In retrospect, it may have been  inevitable that time would turn these two lifelong friends into  companions. And finally, in June of this year, they became husband and  wife.   Caroline and Daniel have traveled far and wide, but like so many  others before them, their love for each other, and our small, beautiful  State, has brought them home to Vermont, the same place where their  friendship began almost 20 years ago. Caroline and Daniel's story of  music, travel, love, and fate was profiled in a July 1, 2022, article  published in the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page S4425]]  the article titled ``While Following Grateful Dead Tribute Bands, a  Romantic Turn'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The New York Times, July 1, 2022]        While Following Grateful Dead Tribute Bands, a Romantic Turn                              (By Nina Reyes)         Caroline Cornell and Daniel Patrick Logan weren't       technically off the grid when they found romance on the Lost       Coast of Northern California, the state's most remote       oceanfront area, in the summer of 2014. But the routes each       had taken to get there could definitely be described as off       the beaten path.        The two first met in middle school in southern Vermont, and       later attended the same high school, Burr and Burton Academy,       in Manchester, Vt. As teenagers they ran in the same circle       of friends, with whom they would ski and snowboard.        Mr. Logan, 32, said that although there was never an       acknowledged attraction between them back then, Ms. Cornell,       31, was a benchmark. ``She was one of those people I would       compare other girls to,'' he said. ``I would say, That girl's       no Caroline, but that's OK.''        Ms. Cornell saw Mr. Logan as her best friend. ``He's just       really sweet and didn't judge, always made you laugh,'' she       said.        When he graduated from high school, in 2007, Mr. Logan went       to study massage in Nevada City, Calif. Following her       graduation, in 2008, Ms. Cornell and a group of their mutual       friends soon began traveling across the country to attend       concerts by bands reimagining the Grateful Dead. ``That's       what I did instead of college,'' Ms. Cornell said. Mr. Logan       would often meet up with them at shows.        Both spent the next 10 years living transiently. When they       weren't traveling, Ms. Cornell worked as a bartender and at       other odd jobs, sometimes staying with her parents and       grandparents at their homes in Key West, Fla., while Mr.       Logan worked at a marijuana farm in Honeydew, Calif., which       is on the Lost Coast. He also continued to study massage, in       Thailand and in the Finger Lakes region of New York.        In July 2014, Ms. Cornell, who had remained in regular       contact with Mr. Logan, took a seasonal job at the farm where       he was working. Both had recently become single, and they       commiserated over the end of their relatively long       relationships. One night, at the only bar in the town, they       drank Don Julio 1942 tequila for almost 12 hours. Yet both       remember what happened next with absolute clarity.        ``We had our first kiss in the parking lot, and we just let       it happen,'' Ms. Cornell said. ``I feel like I was already in       love with him because he was my best friend.''        Said Mr. Logan, ``It wasn't until I kissed her that I       realized I was going to kiss her.''        Though their relationship remained casual for a few months,       each knew it was in a new phase. ``There's really no going       back from this,'' Mr. Logan recalled thinking.        When her seasonal gig concluded that September, she left       while he remained on the Lost Coast. ``We talked almost every       day on the phone, but I had to drive a four-wheeler to the       top of the hill'' to call her, he said.        ``We were dating even if it wasn't official,'' Mr. Logan       added. ``We said, `It is what it is. We're not going to ask       questions.' ''        The following year, after spending time with Ms. Cornell at       her family's place in Key West, he actually did have a       question. In March 2015, Mr. Logan called her and asked Ms.       Cornell if she was going to be his girlfriend.        Saying no, Ms. Cornell said, risked her losing ``the best       guy forever.'' So she said yes. ``But if I'm going to do       this,'' she recalled thinking, ``I'm going to marry this       guy.'' Mr. Logan proposed on Valentine's Day in 2021, while       the two were again in Key West. By then they had already       bought a property together and were building a home in       Rawsonville, Vt., near where both had grown up. Ms. Cornell       is now a floral designer in Manchester. Mr. Logan is a       licensed massage therapist and also works at the Red Fox Inn,       in Bondville, Vt., which his parents have owned and operated       since 1984.        On June 17, the couple were married at his parents' inn       before 300 guests. Kate Logan, the groom's elder sister,       officiated after receiving authorization from Vermont's       secretary of state.        The ceremony was part of a four-day celebration, which       included several events that together featured a lineup of no       fewer than five bands. Those performances were an opening act       of sorts for the groom and the bride, who took his surname.       After the wedding, they again hit the road for a month of       following even more live music events.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 75th  anniversary of an integral Vermont institution, the Proctor Maple  Research Center, which is housed at the University of Vermont. The  Proctor Maple Research Center has been an international leader in the  development of knowledge in maple production and in the sustainability  of the maple tree and the Northern Forest for the past 75 years. The  practical and scholarly research conducted at the center has  contributed to increased efficiency and sustainability of maple  production and to the well-being of maple trees and their habitat. In  fact, the work of the Proctor Maple Research Center has been essential  to the development of the entire North American maple industry.   In 1946, former Vermont Governor Mortimer Proctor purchased the  Harvey Farm in Underhill to give to the University of Vermont as a site  to conduct research on the extensive maple stand located there. In  1947, Dr. James Marvin and Dr. Fred Taylor opened the Proctor Maple  Research Center, marking its first year of maple research and  production. Today, it has close to 6,500 taps for production, with  research located on 200 acres of land on the western side of Vermont's  Mount Mansfield, and new trees added each year for research.   Maple research has been a proud part of the University of Vermont's  history since the 1890s, and the establishment of the Proctor Maple  Research Center has made UVM a leader in maple research globally. The  university has provided technical support, research-based data, and  created new techniques and technology for maple producers across North  America. Patented inventions have increased maple yield, such as the  2009 check valve spout that nearly doubles production from each maple  tree.   Climate change has had a direct and visible impact on maple  production, and the Proctor Maple Research Center's research on sap  yield and sugar maple health in the face of differing tree nutrition  levels and climate challenges has been crucial in understanding how  climate change may be affecting maple tree health and sap production.   Proctor Maple Research Center staff serve as advisers to maple  producers on the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, the North  American Maple Syrup Council, and the International Maple Syrup  Institute. The center has provided invaluable support to the maple  industry, especially as it confronts environmental challenges, ever- changing regulations, and diseases and pests of the sugar maple tree.   Many Vermonters grow up sugaring, spending many a cold March evening  in a sugarhouse tending sap as it boils into syrup. For generations,  maple sugar production has played an important role in our State's  agricultural economy. The Proctor Maple Research Center has provided  the research, technical assistance, and the on-going support that has  helped continue this beloved and important Vermont tradition. It is  hard to imagine that Vermont would remain the top maple producer in the  country without the Proctor Maple Research Center.   I offer my sincere congratulations to the Proctor Maple Research  Center and to Dr. Timothy Perkins, research professor and director, his  staff, and the many students who have worked there on its 75th  anniversary. I look forward to their continued success in the field of  sugar maple research and development for years to come.                            ____________________
