 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Congressman  John Lewis, an American hero, a dear friend.   He taught us what patriotism is, that to love our country is to  acknowledge and work to repair its imperfections.   Congressman Lewis endured angry mobs, death threats, and so much  violence with endurance, persistence, and even warmth and optimism.  Surely we can honor his remarkable life by coming together to  reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, to ensure our laws reflect that  Black lives matter.   Advocating for the Nation's marginalized throughout his life, acting  as the conscience of Congress during his 34 years of service, he  inspired generations of Americans to get in ``good trouble.''   I remember sitting on the floor with John. Rather than sitting in the  chair, we were proving our point and all sitting on the floor.   He has taught us so much with his sweet, sweet manner, but the  strength of his conviction.   We must honor Congressman Lewis' legacy by striving to achieve the  equitable and just society for all that he fought so hard to attain. In  the words of John himself, ``If not us, then who? If not now, then  when?''   Dear, sweet, kind John, we will miss you. We love you. May you rest  in peace.
