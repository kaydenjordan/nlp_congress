 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senator King and  Senator Markey for their remarks and their work as we all come together  to battle this terrible opioid epidemic.   I rise as the Senate considers bipartisan legislation that marks a  critical step forward in the fight against the fentanyl, heroin, and  opioid crisis.   In New Hampshire, and all across our Nation, entire communities are  being ravaged by this epidemic. In order to turn the tide, we need to  combat the challenges communities are experiencing from all angles; we  need to collaborate across traditional boundaries; we need to take a  truly all-hands-on-deck approach because the magnitude of this crisis  demands it.   This crisis does not discriminate. I have spoken to so many  individuals and families from all walks of life who are heartbroken and  reeling. Their loved ones were professionals--students, athletes,  parents--and then they fell victim to this illness, and their lives and  the lives of those who loved them were never the same.   Just this morning, I met with a number of grandparents who are now  the primary caregivers for their grandchildren--a situation that many  of us at first considered a phenomenon and now realize has become  commonplace because the children's parents have died or they are in  prison or they are simply absent or unable to be a caregiver due to  their substance use disorder.   I spoke this morning with this group of grandparents, two of whom  have been raising their grandson for nearly 9 years now, one of whom  has seen two grandchildren returned to their parents after their  parents recovered from their addiction. In one case, the grandparent  whose grandchildren have gone  [[Page S6164]]  back to their parents is, at age 57, starting life completely anew. She  had given up her job and gone through her entire retirement savings to  keep her children safe while their parents battled their addiction.   Another set of grandparents, who again have given up everything to  keep their grandson safe, are scared of going to court to get permanent  custody and adopt their grandchild because they are concerned the  child's father will reappear and contest the custody, and the cost of  that custody battle will mean they have no money left to care for their  grandchild.   Most heartbreakingly, both sets of grandparents said to me they were  worried about what will happen to their grandchildren should they die  since the children's parents might not be able to be there for them.   I was also reminded today that at one of our largest treatment  centers in New Hampshire, the providers estimate that 40 percent of  those in treatment have children, which means there will be more and  more children in our communities who need their grandparents or other  caregivers to step forward.   This crisis is also taking a particular toll on first responders who  respond to overdose after overdose, sometimes reviving the same people  on the same day.   This crisis also impacts our workforce and our economy. I have met  with a number of employers who can't fill jobs because they can't find  workers who can pass a drug test. There are people now in recovery,  some with convictions on their record, who wonder if anyone will ever  give them a second chance.   There is a lot of collateral damage from this crisis. The good news  is, just as the ripple effect of this epidemic touches all parts of our  communities, people from all corners of New Hampshire and our country  are responding--as communities, as friends and neighbors, and as first  responders and healthcare providers--in a collaborative manner. This is  a multifaceted problem, and it requires a multifaceted approach, but  for too long we haven't seen a Federal response that matches the  urgency on the ground.   I am hopeful that by passing this bipartisan legislation, we can move  forward. We have given communities and families some of the support  they need and that they have been waiting for, aching for.   This comprehensive legislation we are considering today includes many  priorities the people of New Hampshire, particularly those on the  frontlines, have been urging us to fight for.   This bill reauthorizes and improves State-targeted response grants to  ensure that States hardest hit by this crisis--States like New  Hampshire--continue to get the resources they need.   This legislation also includes the bipartisan Comprehensive Opioid  Recovery Centers Act, which I partnered on with Senator Capito, to  offer grants to expand existing centers of care to provide  comprehensive coordinated care and support services like housing and  employment reintegration for those who are in recovery.   We have also heard loudly and clearly from our healthcare providers  that we need a more integrated approach in order to combat this complex  disease on all fronts. So this bill includes legislation Senator  Portman and I worked on together aimed at the next generation of  doctors, encouraging medical schools and residency programs to  integrate addiction medicine and treatment into their curriculum, as  well as ensuring that doctors who get this training can apply right  away to prescribe medication-assisted treatment as soon as they are  licensed and have a DEA number.   Members of law enforcement have made clear that they need additional  tools to crack down on bad actors in the pharmaceutical industry whose  behavior has greatly contributed to this crisis. So Senator Grassley,  Senator Cruz, and I worked on a provision to make those tools available  and to help hold industry bad actors accountable.   This legislation also curbs the importation of deadly fentanyl and  other synthetic drugs being shipped through the borders to drug  traffickers in the United States.   These are just a number of the key provisions included in this bill.  As the Senate moves forward and moves into negotiations with the House  of Representatives, I will work with Members of both parties to make  important improvements.   For example, we should keep working in a bipartisan way to include a  provision making permanent prescribing authority for nurse  practitioners and physician assistants, which were some of the measures  that Senators Markey and King were just talking about. Nurses and  physician assistants are vital parts of our care workforce, including  and especially in rural and underserved areas, and their prescribing  authority should be made permanent, and we should allow additional  advanced practice nurses to prescribe.   I am pleased that we are taking this step forward today, and I am  grateful for the Senate's bipartisan work that has brought us to this  point--the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor. I am  particularly grateful for the work of Senator Alexander and Senator  Murray.   This legislation is a vital next step in our efforts to combat this  crisis. The biggest mistake anyone could make is thinking that our  efforts are anywhere close to being done. As the families I met with  this morning made clear, we have a lot more work to do.   I am encouraged by the progress of this bill, and I believe its  implementation will help us mount a much more informed and  comprehensive response to this devastating epidemic. I also remain  encouraged that we have secured a significant increase in Federal  funding to combat this crisis through our budget negotiations.   Let there be no mistake. We will need to continue to work together.  In particular, we will need to learn about which treatment and recovery  practices will be successful in the long run, and we will need further  research to establish best practices for supporting a newly at-risk  cohort--the children of those with this disorder. We have been  responding to and learning about this disease as the epidemic unfolded,  and there is much we do not know and much we still need to tackle.   I am encouraged that Members of both parties have come together,  demonstrating that we can put partisanship aside and work together to  address some of the most dire challenges our communities face. We owe  it to all of the many stakeholders in this fight to keep listening to  them, to keep collaborating together, and to keep working on solutions  so that we can truly make progress and get better. This is a good  start, but it is and must be only a start.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader
