 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for her passionate  work on this issue.   The President's transgender military ban doesn't just ignore science,  expert testimony, military experience, and the advice of all five  military chiefs of staff, it ignores the men and women who are willing  to die in defense of our freedom.   So I ask my colleagues one simple question: Are you willing to look  into the eyes of a trans servicemember and tell them that they are not  qualified to serve in our Nation's Armed Forces simply because of who  they are, that our country won't allow them their most basic freedom  while expecting them to die for our own?   If our Nation's fundamental promise that we are all created equal  doesn't apply to all, then what are we asking them to defend in the  first place?
