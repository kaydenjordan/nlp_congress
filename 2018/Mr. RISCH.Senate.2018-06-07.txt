 Mr. President, as you may know, I supported the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act that became law in December of last year. We hear stories  every day of the positive impact this law has had on the economy at  large and in the lives of Americans who are seeing more money in their  paycheck. What we don't hear are enough stories about the small  businesses that have benefited from this law. As chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I supported this  legislation because I believed that it would spark investment, increase  economic growth, and reduce taxes for millions of small businesses  whose work ethic and perseverance shows that the American Dream is  still possible. I also saw the potential that the legislation would  have, not just to help small business owners and their employees in my  home State of Idaho, but to positively affect small businesses across  the country. A couple of weeks ago, I began this series of speeches  highlighting small businesses that have benefited from this  legislation.   While there are numerous stories about the benefits of tax reform, I  rise today to talk about the story of the Don Ramon Restaurante Cubano  and Social Club located in West Palm Beach, FL. Dina and Juan Rubio are  the operators of this successful restaurant that offers traditional and  affordable Cuban dishes in charming surroundings. Don Ramon Restaurant  also offers catering services, provides live music, and hosts private  events. Often, Juan will take the stage with his keyboard and entertain  patrons with his rollicking renditions of traditional Cuban dances such  as the salsa, son, and guaracha. This dedication to an authentic Cuban  experience over the last 27 years is what has made this restaurant a  popular culinary destination and landmark for people all over south  Florida.   From Cuba and Nicaragua respectively, Dina and Juan appreciate the  opportunities afforded everyone by the American Dream and have worked  hard to realize their goal of becoming successful entrepreneurs. New  tax law changes implemented under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have  allowed Dina and Juan Rubio to give their employees pay increases and  larger holiday bonuses than normal. This law has also allowed them to  begin planning capital improvements for their restaurant. They are  planning to renovate their restaurant, open a take-out window, install  new refrigerators and coffee machines, and hire up to eight new  employees. Stories like the Rubio's demonstrate the benefits that tax  reform has already had on numerous small businesses. Overall, it can be  said that tax reform was a worthy goal that has increased small  businesses' optimism, employee bonuses and wages, lowered taxes, and  driven new capital investment.                            ____________________
