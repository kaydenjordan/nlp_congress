Also a brief explanation of       why information is sensitive:        a. The AN/APX-123, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)       Transponder, is a space diversity transponder and is       installed on various military platforms. When installed in       conjunction with platform antennas and the RCU ( or other       appropriate control unit), the transponder provides       identification, altitude and surveillance reporting in       response to interrogations from airborne, ground-based and/or       surface interrogators. The transponder provides operational       capabilities for Mark XII Identification IFF capabilities of       Modes 1, 2, 2/ A, C and 4&5 and Modes S (levels 1, 2, and 3       capable).        b. The LN-251 INS/GPS is a satellite based positioning       system coupled to the aircraft inertial navigation system to       provide aircraft position and navigation. The INS/GPS has an       embedded SAASM and has gyro and accelerometers that have been       evaluated as MTCR Category II controlled items, specifically       items 9.A.6 and 9.A.8.        c. The WESCAM MX-10Di is a small Multi-Sensor, Multi-      Spectral Imaging System with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)       and Embedded with Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard       Positioning Service (SPS). WESCAM MX-10 is embedded with GPS       SPS. SPS is a three- dimensional position and time       determination capability provided to a user equipped with a       minimum capability GPS SPS receiver in accordance with GPS       national policy. The LN-200 is a small, lightweight fiber       optic IMU comprised of gyro and accelerometers that have been       evaluated as MTCR Category II controlled item, specifically       item 9.A.6.        d. The M 134 Mini Gun has variable rates of fire-up to 4000       rounds per minute-and has seen increasingly widespread       deployment over the last several years.        e. The AN/APR-39 (V)(4) Radar Signal Detecting Set is a       system that provides warning of a radar directed air defense       threat and allow appropriate countermeasures.        F. The 12.7mm (.50 caliber) GAU-19/B Externally Powered       Gatling Gun, has variable rates of fire-up to 2000 rounds per       minute-and has seen increasingly widespread deployment over       the last several years.        g. The M299 Longbow Hellfire Launcher (LBHL) is a digital       missile launcher capable of carry and launch of up to four of       any combination of AGM-114 missiles. The launcher provides       electronic functions required for the missile and launcher to       communicate with the platform through MIL-STD-1760 and MIL-      STD-1553 interfaces. The production quad-rail configuration       was designed for use on the AH-640 Apache Longbow but is also       commonly used on a wide variety of other rotary-wing       platforms across all services. The M299 launcher has also       been successfully re-configured into a dual rail launcher for       weight savings and/or use on smaller platforms and also into       a single-rail configuration for use on Un-manned Air System       (UAS) platforms where the launcher electronics is integrated       within the platform airframe.        h. The AGM-114 Hellfire II is a precision strike, Semi-      Active Laser (SAL) guided missile and is the principal air-      to-ground weapon for the Army AH-64 Apache. It provides the       warfighter with an air-to-ground, point target precision       strike capability to defeat advanced armor and an array of       traditional and non-traditional targets. The Hellfire AGM-      114R model is a selectable multipurpose warhead providing       effects against a diverse target set.        1. The M260 Rocket Launcher with APKWS capability is a       seven tube rocket launcher with a remote fuze setting       function. Once the target is located, single or multiple       pairs of the Hydra 70 APKWS folding-fin rockets can be       launched toward the target when a predetermined time signal       is sent to the electronic time fuze.        J. The APKWS is a low cost semi-active laser guidance kit       developed by BAE Systems which is added to current unguided       70 mm rocket motors and warheads similar to and including the       Hydra 70 rocket. It is a low collateral damage weapon that       can effectively strike both soft and lightly armored targets.       APKWS turns a standard unguided 2.75 inch (70 mm) rocket into       a precision laser-guided rocket.        k. AN/AVS-6 (Helmet Mounted) Night Vision Goggles. The AN/      AVS-6 NVG is a 3rd generation aviation NVG offering higher       resolution, high gain, and photo response to near infrared.
