 Mr. Speaker, President Trump recently told The Economist  that he is ``absolutely a free-trader.'' Ohioans would be the first to  tell you that free trade and fair trade do not mean the same thing.   Our trade deficit ballooned to $43.7 billion in March of this year-- more red ink and more lost jobs. That skewed gap is even more  pronounced with NAFTA nations, where we have a huge negative imbalance,  totaling over $16 billion with Mexico and nearly $7 billion with  Canada. That yields over 115,000 more forfeited jobs in our country.   Yes, trade deficits translate into lost jobs and lower wages for our  workers like steelworkers that have been battered in Lorain, Ohio. We  must stop these trade practices that snuff out our jobs and hurt our  communities.   That is why tomorrow I will be reintroducing the Balancing Trade Act.  This bill requires an actual U.S. policy that takes the trade deficit  seriously. It provides real achievable steps to balance our trade  deficits with countries with which we hold a deficit of over $10  billion for three consecutive years.   I urge President Trump to support this measure as a reasonable step  forward. Let us help heal heartland communities, many of which elected  him. Let us seek trade solutions that lift up our people and create new  jobs on all sides of North America's borders, but starting here in the  good old USA.                            ____________________
