 Madam President, I call up my amendment, No. 3115, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I grew up on a farm in Southwest Iowa,  where we took extraordinary pride in the work we did and the livestock  and crops we raised.   Our hard-working livestock producers should not have to worry about  being subject to onerous regulations and increased production costs due  to Federal permits or regulations.   My amendment would prohibit or limit any new Federal methane  requirements on livestock that would increase the cost of beef or other  critical  [[Page S6221]]  products. This ``cow tax'' will just result in higher food costs for  Americans at the grocery store at a time when inflation has already  caused prices to skyrocket.   This ``cow tax'' could put our local farms out of business. They  could devastate our rural communities, which are continuing to feed and  fuel the world.   I won't stand by while the Democrats force Iowa farmers and ranchers  and American consumers to pay for their over-the-top regulations.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and keep America's  farming and ranching operations going and food prices affordable for  our hard-working families.
