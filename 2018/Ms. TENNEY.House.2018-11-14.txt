 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor firefighters from  across our community. They recently traveled to Albany to honor the  life and legacy of Merle Nell, a fire police captain and former chief  of the Vernon Fire Department in upstate New York. Family, friends, and  fellow firefighters watched as Merle's name was inscribed in the New  York State Fallen Firefighters Memorial.   Merle passed away in November 2016 while on the scene of a fire in  Vernon Center, New York. His name is now etched on a wall with 2,551  other fallen firefighters from our great State who have given their  lives in the line of duty.   Affectionately known as ``Skippy'' to his family and friends, Merle's  legacy of service lives on through his sons and grandsons. Merle's  sons, Scott and Mark, serve as fire chiefs in both Verona and Vernon;  and his grandsons, Adam and Matthew, are active firefighters in Vernon,  and Zachary is a junior firefighter in Verona.   A marine, a father, a postal worker, and a firefighter, Merle's life  of service is a true inspiration to everyone in our community. His  memory will live on in the hearts of our grateful community both in  central New York and in New York State.                            ____________________
