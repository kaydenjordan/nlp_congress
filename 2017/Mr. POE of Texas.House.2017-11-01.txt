 Mr. Speaker, ever since she was a little girl,  Silvana loved to play hockey. In her Massachusetts hometown, hockey was  more of a way of life than just a sport.   Her parents knew she was talented, and supported her dream to play  even in college. When she was offered a scholarship in 2011, to be the  goalie for the University of Connecticut, Silvana felt like all of her  dreams had come true, so she eagerly accepted.   She pulled out of her driveway with her packed clothes and hockey  gear, but she could have never known that in a few days her life would  change forever. She could not have foreseen how a lifetime of hard work  and ambition would suddenly disappear tragically.   Like all new students, she was eager to immerse herself in her new  college life. On the third day at the university, Silvana went to a  house party with some new friends she met. But, after two drinks, she  began to feel dizzy, numb, and lethargic. She quickly lost the ability  to walk, and she became very ill. As she drifted out of consciousness,  a male hockey player at the party instructed others to carry her to his  bedroom. When she woke up, she found him on top of her, sexually  assaulting her.   She immediately turned to the university for help and reported the  assault at The Women's Center. But the counselor did not tell her to  call the police, advise her to press charges, or help her in any way.   Silvana then went to the on-campus doctor. But instead of treating  her like a victim and offering her the care and support she needed, the  doctor told her that he didn't want to know who assaulted her. Get  this, Mr. Speaker: the doctor told her, the remedy was for her to  transfer to another university. This is awful.   One in five women on our university campuses are sexually assaulted.  Of those, less than 25 percent even report the rape.   It took an extraordinary amount of courage for Silvana to report that  sexual assault, especially to multiple people she didn't even know. She  was offered no help or no support by anyone. She was alone, and she  felt it.   The doctor wasn't trained to deal with rape victims and made it clear  he wanted nothing more to do with Silvana. The university clearly  viewed Silvana as a burden, just another statistic they didn't want to  deal with.   Mr. Speaker, universities in the United States should be required to  have a victim advocate on staff, a sexual assault victim advocate.  Also, to ensure that this doesn't happen to more victims at hospitals,  I have introduced legislation that would require a hospital to provide  access to a staffer--it is called a SAFE, sexual assault forensic  examiner--who is trained to provide care and be sensitive to trauma  rape victims, or have a plan to get that victim to a nearby hospital  that does. Universities and nearby hospitals need to work together to  make sure that rape victims are treated appropriately when they are  assaulted on campus.   The bill that I just mentioned is named the Megan Rondini Act. It is  in honor of a college sexual assault victim on the University of  Alabama campus, who was a Texas student, who was denied access to post- rape treatment at a hospital. The university didn't help her, and the  local law enforcement didn't help her.                                time  1015    In Megan's case, because she was alone and abandoned by all three of  those entities, when she returned to Texas, she later committed  suicide.   Anyway, after the rape of Silvana, the university left Silvana to  pick up the pieces of her shattered life. She was traumatized and  depressed. Claiming that she wasn't stable enough, the hockey coach  removed her from the team. She never played a single game of hockey in  college. She withdrew from the University of Connecticut shortly  thereafter, but her rapist stayed on his hockey team and played for the  university. Silvana had to successfully sue the university to get  justice. She had to take the matter to court, where society and our  justice system should have helped her initially.   Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim, yet Silvana felt  that she was the one being blamed for what happened to her.   We as a society must demand our universities and hospitals protect  and care for sexual assault victims. No longer should they be allowed  to suffer alone and be abandoned. No more excuses.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 425) to authorize the revocation or denial of passports  to individuals affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 425         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FTO Passport Revocation Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS                     AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN TERRORIST                     ORGANIZATIONS.         The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and       validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved       July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 211a et seq.), commonly known as the       ``Passport Act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT.         ``(a) Ineligibility.--        ``(1) Issuance.--Except as provided under subsection (b),       the Secretary of State may refuse to issue a passport to any       individual whom the Secretary has determined has aided,       assisted, abetted, or otherwise helped an organization the       Secretary has designated as a foreign terrorist organization       pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality       Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).        ``(2) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a       passport previously issued to any individual described in       paragraph (1).        ``(b) Right of Review.--Any individual who, in accordance       with this section, is denied issuance of a passport by the       Secretary of State, or whose passport is revoked by the       Secretary, may request a hearing before the Secretary not       later than 60 days after receiving notice of such denial or       revocation.        ``(c) Report.--        ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary of State refuses to       issue or revokes a passport pursuant to subsection (a), or       if, subsequent to a hearing pursuant to subsection (b), the       Secretary issues or cancels a revocation of a passport that       was the subject of such a hearing, the Secretary shall, not       later than 30 days after such refusal or revocation, or such       issuance or cancellation, submit to the Committee on Foreign       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on such refusal,       revocation, issuance, or cancellation, as the case may be.        ``(2) Form.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) may       be submitted in classified or unclassified form.        ``(d) Definition.--In this section, the term `passport'       includes a passport card.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attack last night in New York City comes  as a devastating reminder that the enemies of liberty will not cease.   Eight people were killed and 11 more were injured in what law  enforcement officials are now calling New York's deadliest terror  attack since 9/11.   The perpetrator of this attack was radicalized domestically by ISIS,  highlighting the grave threat posed by this terrorist propaganda.   Mr. Speaker, the terrorist last night was an immigrant from  Uzbekistan, but we know that even within our midst, there are Americans  who sympathize with those who seek to destroy our freedom.                                time  1830    As many as 250 American citizens have sought to travel to Syria, and  more than 100 have joined ISIS' ranks. Many of these individuals have  received terrorist training while overseas. Some are under the command  and control of terrorist leaders who have instructed them to attack the  United States whenever. Others are inspired by the perverted ideology  of hate that the terrorists post on social media sites. Many of these  are American social media sites.   These American citizens are a direct threat to our homeland.  Unfortunately, our current safeguards are insufficient to protect us  against such vulnerability.   In 2014, a 22-year-old Florida native became the first American to  carry out a suicide bombing in Syria. He had battled hard and been  trained by al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate for some time. This same  American was waved through U.S. border inspections when he traveled  home to Florida a year earlier.   After spending some time in Florida, the man made his way back to  Syria to kill in the name of al-Qaida. When he ultimately blew himself  up in May of 2014, al-Qaida released a video of his last will and  testament. He said: ``You think you are safe where you are in America.  You are not safe.''   Mr. Speaker, today we are at a dangerous crossroad. As ISIS loses  more territory in its so-called caliphate and it collapses, the threat  to our homeland will really grow. Americans who have been fighting with  ISIS will be looking for ways to come home to stage deadly attacks.   In recent weeks, a man from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted on  terrorism charges for joining ISIS. He was sentenced to 20 years in the  penitentiary. This terrorist traitor to our Nation named four other  Westerners who had joined ISIS and who left Syria with intentions to do  harm in their home countries.   Law enforcement officials and terrorism experts have been warning of  this foreign fighter threat for years. This is a serious threat, and we  must address it before it becomes worse.   Having betrayed our Nation, we must revoke the privileges that come  with an American passport. That is why my colleague, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), and I introduced H.R. 425, the Foreign  Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It authorizes the  Secretary of State to revoke passports of those who have joined foreign  terrorist organizations.   I might add, Mr. Speaker, this is a legal term, what a foreign  terrorist organization is. It is only those organizations.   These individuals are U.S. citizens, but they betray our country.  They should clearly not be allowed the privilege of international  travel with an American passport, and they should definitely not be  able to come back into the United States when they travel overseas,  such as in Syria. This bipartisan bill will also stop these Benedict  Arnolds from using their passports to travel to other war zones or  cross borders to attack any of our allies.   Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing in current regulations  specifically to support foreign terrorist organizations. The Secretary  of State does not have the authority to revoke passports on a broad  national security basis.   It is time our laws change and catch up with the modern world and the  new and real threats to our Nation. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This  bill would not strip American of their citizenship. It would deny those  Americans who have sided with foreign terrorist organizations the  privilege of travel internationally.   The bill also would not impinge on any American's due process rights  if they want to appeal the revocation of their passport. Anyone whose  passport is revoked or denied is eligible for a due process hearing  within 60 days. The bill would actually increase oversight on this  process by requiring the State Department to report directly to  Congress whenever the Secretary moves to revoke or deny an American's  passport on these grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr.  Keating) for working with me on this bill. We both sit on the Committee  on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade as the chair and ranking member. We have both been working on  this issue of foreign fighter threats for some time, and we believe  this is a good first step to protect our homeland.   I also want to thank Chairman Royce for his help in getting this  important bill passed in the committee, and also Ranking Member Engel  from New York, where this unfortunate tragic event occurred last night.   Mr. Speaker, the point is this: the traitors among us who have chosen  to  [[Page H8364]]  make their allegiance to a murderous ideology instead of the country  that gave them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must face  the consequences. If you take up arms with our enemies, you deserve to  be treated like one.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to emphasize again our prayers for the folks in New York City  and for the appreciation of our first responders, who are always there,  as you personally know, Mr. Speaker. And the New York tragedy is an  example of how they respond and chase and go after terrorists rather  than run from terror.   One other thing I want to mention is the Foreign Affairs Committee,  we work primarily bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. That shocks a lot of folks  here in Washington, D.C., and it sure shocks a lot of folks back home.  But most of the  [[Page H8365]]  things that come before the House floor have been bipartisan pieces of  legislation.   We spend a lot of time on legislation and almost always come to the  House floor with unanimous votes, or mostly unanimous votes, on the  committee level. We work very well on these issues because these are  not partisan issues; these are American issues that we are talking  about.   Mr. Speaker, there are about 61 designated foreign terrorist  organizations that our State Department has said are foreign terrorist  organizations and, to prevent individuals in America who side with  these organizations, who support these organizations, who are part of  these organizations from traveling around the world and coming back  home, based upon their activities, this legislation by Mr. Keating is  introduced. Keep them from traveling, because we know who those people  are, and keep them, especially, from coming back to the United States.   So what would happen if a passport is revoked and some American is in  Syria and is radicalized and he tries to get on a plane? Well, he is  not allowed to get on the plane. He is stopped, and then he is turned  over, eventually, to Department of Homeland Security and our Justice  Department and handled that way.   Now, there are only a few places under our law where a person's  passport can be revoked. Not paying your child support, drug  trafficking, sex tourism--those are three of the examples. So we are  not talking about a lot of examples, but we are talking about this  example.   I am a former judge, and I know Mr. Keating is a former prosecutor.  Due process for Americans is always important. The Supreme Court has  already ruled on whether or not passports can be revoked under certain  circumstances, and they have affirmed the authority of the State  Department to revoke passports in specific cases based upon national  security reasons.   This bill allows for due process of those people who have their  passports revoked. This is a good step in protecting the United States.  This is bipartisan legislation. I think it is very important that we  take this step.   Once again, my prayers, our prayers, are for those folks in New York.  But, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to allow terrorists to have their  day. We are not going to allow them to have their way.   And that is just the way it is.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Sergio Jose Martinez was trolling a  parking garage in sanctuary city Portland, Oregon, armed with a knife.  He set his sights on his prey, a defenseless 65-year-old woman, and he  attacked her.   But the woman fought back and pressed the panic button in her car.  Martinez, the coward, fled the scene, but he was caught. Get this, Mr.  Speaker: Martinez, after serving several stints in U.S. penitentiaries,  has been deported over 20 times. But the criminal does his time, gets  deported, and just comes back into the United States.   Our border protectors do the best they can, but they are outmanned,  outgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels, criminal gangs, and  outlaws trying to enter the United States.   The Border Security for America Act authorizes a border wall, both  physical and virtual, puts more boots on the ground, more boats in the  water, and gives more equipment to our law enforcement.   We must keep criminals like Martinez out of the United States.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
