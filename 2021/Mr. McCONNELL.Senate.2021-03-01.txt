 Madam President, once again, our communities across my  home State of Kentucky are enduring the aftermath of severe--very  severe--weather. From east to west, heavy rains have drenched the  Commonwealth. Sadly, some of the hardest hit areas were still in the  midst of trying to recover from last month's dangerous ice and snow.  Emergency crews, first responders, and now the Kentucky National Guard  are continuing to work around the clock to prevent this bad situation  from becoming entirely tragic.   An entire nursing home in Magoffin County was evacuated as a safety  precaution. Feet of water submerged vehicles and caused power outages  in Calloway County.   Wolfe County firefighters followed the light of a cell phone and  saved a family of five who had been trapped in their car.   Once again, Kentucky's brave first responders are stepping up at a  time of need. We are all grateful for their dedicated efforts and  praying for their safety.   All Kentuckians can help the first responders by continuing to follow  the recommendations of local emergency personnel. My team and I are  closely monitoring the situation, and we will be ready to assist  however we can.                            ____________________     On another matter, at about 2 a.m. on Saturday  morning, House Democrats rammed through the bonanza of partisan  spending they are calling a pandemic rescue package. Only Democrats  voted for it. Both Republicans and Democrats voted against it.   Last year, under a Republican Senate and a Republican administration,  Congress passed five historic coronavirus relief bills--five of them.  Not one of the five bills got fewer than 90 votes in the Senate or less  than about 80 percent over in the House.   Ah, but alas, this time Democrats have chosen to go a completely  partisan route. Even famous liberal economists and liberal editorial  boards are saying their half-baked plan is poorly targeted to what  families needed.   We have gone from passing public relief with 80 percent and 90  percent bipartisan supermajorities last year to the Speaker of the  House ramming this through with just 50.7 percent of the House on  Friday night. The bill contains all kinds of liberal spending on pet  projects with no relationship whatsoever to pandemic relief.   Remember, we are almost to the 1-year anniversary of a leading House  Democrat admitting they see this whole crisis as ``a tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.''   So, sorry to all the American families who have just been hoping to  get their jobs back, their schools back, and their lives back.  Democrats are more interested in some restructuring. That is why only 1  percent--1 percent--of this huge package goes directly to  vaccinations--1 percent for vaccinations. That is why it proposes  another 12-digit sum of Federal funding for K-12 schools, even though  science shows those schools can be made safe right now. About 95  percent of that funding won't even go out this fiscal year. Ninety-five  percent of the school funding in this bill won't go out this year. And  this is an emergency package?   That is why they are pushing economic policies that would drag down  our recovery--like the House's vote for a one-size-fits-all minimum  wage policy that would kill 1.4 million jobs or continuing to pay laid- off workers a premium to stay home that would extend well into a  recovery where job growth and rehiring will be pivotal.   Whenever their long-term liberal dreams came into conflict with what  Americans actually need right now, Democrats decided their ideology  should win out.   Well, it doesn't have to be this way. We could have built more  practical policies to help the American people move forward. Some  Senate Republicans literally went down to the White House and proposed  that both sides work together, like we did five times last year. The  administration declined. So this is where we are: a bad process, a bad  bill, and a missed opportunity to do right by working families.                            ____________________     Now, on one final matter, last weekend brought  disconcerting headlines for the supporters of freedom and democracy in  Asia. In Burma the military junta's month-long coup turned bloody.  Eighteen protesters have been murdered and at least a thousand civilian  officials have been imprisoned on farcical grounds.   In Hong Kong, China's puppet regime arrested 47 democracy advocates,  including some who helped draw millions to the streets in peaceful  protests in 2019, and are now holding them without bail.   Unfortunately, in both places, this sort of repression has become a  familiar part of life, and it could be a dark preview of developments  elsewhere if the free world does not act.   Even as Burma's civilian government made history in 2015, the  military made clear it would keep using cronyism and constitutional  manipulation to obstruct real popular control. In last year's election,  the people overwhelmingly demanded true democracy and economic  transparency, but that also raised the risk for those working publicly  to make permanent reforms.   The military's detention spree has hit Burma's civilian leaders,  including people like Mya Aye, a longtime Muslim pro-democracy leader.  It has also swept up some of the brightest economic reformers working  to fight corruption and grow prosperity--brave men like Bo Bo Nge, who  spent years locked away in Burma's Insein prison in the 1980s and  1990s, built a successful life abroad, and returned to help the  civilian government craft economic reforms.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post  article detailing Bo Bo Nge's story be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, March 1, 2021]            An American Success Story Is Lost in Myanmar's Coup                            (By Shibani Mahtani)         Hong Kong.--Bo Bo Nge's path typified that of his       generation's brightest and bravest: Jailed as a student for       protesting Myanmar's military regime in 1988, he spent years       learning English from dictionary pages  [[Page S910]]       smuggled into his Yangon cell. After his release and       continued persecution, he fled to the United States.        He made a new life, rising from dishwasher to an economist       with a six-figure salary. But his heart never left Myanmar,       and armed with a Ph.D., he returned home as a democratic       transition took hold, leading to his appointment in 2017 as       deputy governor of the central bank--where he served       alongside others who fought for democracy three decades       earlier.        Just after dawn on Feb. 1, five soldiers appeared at Bo Bo       Nge's home in Myanmar's capital, Naypyidaw, and demanded he       come with them, according to his wife. She and his friends       have not heard from him since.        Bo Bo Nge's fate, along with that of other intellectuals,       lawyers and young leaders detained in the military coup that       deposed Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government, once again       epitomizes dashed hopes for a better future in Myanmar. These       reformers and technocrats, whose skills and experience helped       salvage the country's antiquated financial system in recent       years, are now silenced and subject to the whims of       isolationist generals.        In Myanmar coup, grievance and ambition drove military       chiefs power grab.        At the same time, Myanmar's security forces are cracking       down on protesters, killing 18 on Sunday. More than 1,130       people, including Bo Bo Nge, have been arrested since the       coup.        His predicament is made more urgent by his health issues       and the fragile state of Myanmar's economy, already battered       by the coronavirus pandemic. Banks have closed their doors as       hundreds of thousands of people, including tellers, resist       the coup by refusing to go to work, pushing the economic       system closer to collapse. The few military-linked banks that       remain open have restricted customer numbers, while the       central bank is limiting withdrawals across financial       institutions, raising fears of a cash shortage.        ``When someone like Bo Bo arrived back in Myanmar, it was       like a bottle of water to a person in the desert,'' said Ba       Win, a former provost of Bard College at Simon's Rock, who       helped Bo Bo Nge move to the United States. Bo Bo Nge, he       added, ``had the intellectual training and discipline to look       at economic issues in a way that transcended parochial       political interests.''        In an interview with Frontier magazine, Win Thaw, the       military's chosen replacement for Bo Bo Nge, accused       protesters and those participating in the civil disobedience       movement of ``destroying their own country's economy.''        ``Policies differ from one government to another, but they       should have a common goal, which is to develop the country       and not trouble the people,'' he said. The military       government, he added, is ``doing their best.''        Bo Bo Nge's first stint in detention was at Yangon's lnsein       prison, where he served more than four years for       participating in the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, which the       military regime brutally crushed. The sprawling complex is       one of the city's most visible landmarks, where behind       towering metal gates prisoners were subjected to torture and       other inhumane treatment. There, Bo Bo Nge's health began to       deteriorate, and his teeth rotted from neglect, friends and       family say.        Locked up alongside academics and intellectuals, he was       exposed to lofty conversations about history, economics and       philosophy. He and his fellow prisoners would bury smuggled       English dictionary pages under the muddy floors of their       cells, studying them furiously when guards were not around.       By the time he was released in 1993, Bo Bo Nge was fluent,       and after a stint exporting taro stems harvested from       Myanmar's lnle Lake to South Korea, he moved to America's       lush, mountainous Berkshires, where he attended community       college.        ``He was immediately helpful, kind and so good-natured,''       said Marion Lathrop, 84, who hosted Bo Bo Nge with her       husband, Don, then a professor at Berkshire Community       College. ``It was kind of hard to grasp the fact that someone       with that nature could have gone through that kind of       ordeal.''        Immediately, friends said, Bo Bo Nge got down to business,       acquiring a driver's license and a car to drive between his       odd jobs and college. In 2001, two years after his arrival,       he won a scholarship to Bard College, and after graduation,       he pursued a master's degree in economics at Johns Hopkins       University.        Through those years, he maintained a long-distance love       with his future wife, Hnin Wai Lwin, better known by her       nickname Me Kyi, whom he met on lnle Lake at her shop where       she sold trinkets under a famed pagoda. Their international       calls were a source of entertainment for her village--where       residents could listen in on a central broadcast as phones       were scarce--before she joined him in Massachusetts seven       years after his departure, according to several friends.        His first job was at a subsidiary of the American Institute       of Economic Research, where he eventually earned six       figures--epitomizing the American immigrant success story.       Colleagues were ``immediately struck by his brilliance,''       said Seth Hoffman, now vice president of that subsidiary,       American Investment Services.        ``Given his particular skill set, Bo Bo could have gone on,       if he was reoriented in a different direction, to be on a       bond desk in a major investment bank,'' Hoffman said. ``He       could have had a more comfortable life.''        But Bo Bo Nge, heartened by a hopeful yet uncertain       military-led transition to democracy that began in 2010,       wanted to do ``something more than make money,'' according to       Ba Win. Inspired by a conversation the two had about a lack       of skilled leaders in Myanmar--the military shuttered its       best universities after the 1988 uprising and reopened them       only in 2014--Bo Bo Nge pursued a doctorate at the School of       Oriental and African Studies in London, where Suu Kyi was a       research student in the 1980s.        When he went back to join the government as deputy central       bank governor in 2017, the military had ceded some control to       a civilian leadership and the economy was making great       strides. Poverty had been halved from a decade prior, growth       was picking up, and reformists were driving policy changes,       keeping down inflation and modernizing the central bank. In       the recent coup, several of Suu Kyi's leading economic       advisers were detained, including Australian economist Sean       Turnell, and Min Ye Paing Hein, a former World Bank economist       who was the deputy industry minister. None have been heard       from since they were taken by authorities.        As the military tightens its hold on power and the prospect       of reconciliation grows dim, the European Union and other       Western countries are readying sanctions against Myanmar's       generals and their economic interests, following moves by the       United States.        A general strike on Feb. 22, meanwhile, added momentum to       Myanmar's civil disobedience movement. Many taking part in       the resistance say sacrificing the economy is their only way       to bring down the junta and achieve democracy.        Zaw Zaw, a 41-year-old garment factory owner in Yangon,       said he sold an apartment and his car to support those who       are forgoing a paycheck to participate in acts of       disobedience against military rule. Soon he will run out of       things to sell, he admits, but says he will do anything to       keep the resistance afloat.        ``The country's economy was already in danger'' before the       coup, he said. ``Whether or not the generals hold an election       in a year as promised, the economy will collapse anyway. So       it is worthwhile to sacrifice everything to bring them       down.''        Since her husband was taken on Feb. 1, Hnin Wai Lwin has       had trouble sleeping and has lost her appetite. Memories of       basic facts--when they arrived in the United States, her       husband's age--are fading or have become confused. She has       moved back to Shan state up north, away from the military-run       capital, Naypyidaw, for her safety and that of their 5-year       old son, who she said is always asking for his father, unable       to comprehend what has happened.        She cannot stop thinking about the health of her husband,       who is in his 50s, and whether he has run out of the limited       supply of medicines she packed in a bag before he left with       the soldiers. In an interview, she said Bo Bo Nge was       suffering from gastrointestinal disease and hypertension, for       which he needs medical treatment.        ``I am also not in good health, and we are not together,''       she said. ``I am very sorry. We should be together, whatever       the circumstance.''        Kyaw Ye Lynn in Yangon contributed to this report.    Madam President, even foreign nationals have been  subjected to unjustified detention. The world is closely watching the  case of Sean Turnell, an Australian scholar who has spent years helping  Burma's civilian leaders unlock its economic potential.   The administration has been right to condemn the junta and to consult  with Congress on an appropriate response. But as Burma's protesters  begin to pay the ultimate price for speaking out, the United States  must make it clear that military and police officials will face  crippling costs of their own. This should include the military-owned  holding companies, which have deep roots in Burma's economy. It is time  to lead an international effort to support the people of Burma.   It is also time to strengthen our calls for an international response  to China's shameless human rights abuses, beginning with Hong Kong.  Another round of arrests in the last several days has sent a new wave  of student activists to prison with no due process. They join veteran  pro-democracy performers like my friends Martin Lee and Jimmy Lai, who  were already rounded up.   The United States cannot outsource our moral authority in championing  democracy around the world. When we stay silent, the voice of the  international community is channeled through forums where the most  notorious human rights abusers preside over their own trials.   The ironically named U.N. Human Rights Council boasts a membership  including such paragons of virtue as the Russian Federation, which has  begun sending residents to prison for non-state-sanctioned religious  beliefs; and Venezuela, whose rap sheet the  [[Page S911]]  State Department spells out as ``arbitrary detention,'' ``forced  disappearances,'' and ``extrajudicial killings''; and Cuba, whose  government exports repressive tools to countries like Venezuela; and,  of course, the People's Republic of China itself, where the hypocrisy  stretches from repression in Hong Kong to internment and torture of the  Uighur people in Xinjiang.   The Biden administration has advertised a foreign policy focused on  human rights and democracy and quite publicly announced its intention  to rejoin the U.N. Human Rights Council. Fine, let Burma and Hong Kong  and Xinjiang and Belarus be tests of this administration's approach to  the council. But the White House must not put much trust into this  corrupted institution. We should be uniting like-minded democracies  around actions that the United Nations panels are either unwilling or  unable to take. With respect to Hong Kong, the prior administration  took several concrete steps, from closing PRC investment loopholes in  Hong Kong to opposing targeted sanctions.    Now is the time for the Biden administration to show its resolve as  it confronts serious tests of its own.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
