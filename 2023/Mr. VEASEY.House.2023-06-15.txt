 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the legacy of  Jesse Tafalla, Jr., a pillar in the north Texas community who was a  steadfast champion for equality, justice, and inclusion.   Jesse lived to serve his community. After high school, Jesse worked  for IBM and, for the past 10 years, DART. He was an active member in  many organizations in Dallas, including Rainbow LULAC, Stonewall  Democrats, Dallas County Democratic Party, and the MLK Jr. Community  Center board.   He was a champion of so many different social causes and issues, and  he worked tirelessly to try to bridge the gaps and create understanding  between communities. He was a very special person.   He greeted everyone with the line, ``Hey, don't I owe you a drink?''  This was his way of saying that he cared. After that, he would listen  to people, and he advocated for communities and people who he felt were  genuinely left behind.   Jesse was an embodiment of service and kindness, and his legacy will  be carried on through the countless lives he touched. His love for  family, friends, and strangers was unconditional.   I extend my deepest condolences to all of his family, his friends,  and everyone in the community who loved him and called him a friend.                            ____________________
