 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and congratulate  one of the distinguished finalists for the Prudential Spirit of  Community Awards, Millard South High School senior, Carly Renken, from  Gretna, Nebraska.   Carly is a cofounder of the nonprofit Special Musicians, which  conducts music sessions for over 40 kids with special needs in the  Omaha metro area. The organization is designed to provide an inclusive,  safe, and fun learning environment; teaches basic music theory;  features instrument playing, singing, and dancing; and culminates with  a performance in front of friends and family members.   In 1995, Prudential Financial partnered with the National Association  of Secondary School Principals to create a program that focused on the  importance of community service and volunteer work to inspire other  Americans to help those in need. More than 29,000 students across the  country participated in the 24th annual Prudential Spirit of Community  Awards program.   I ask that you all join me in recognizing Carly for her passion and  service and thank Prudential Financial for taking the time to encourage  our youth in the pursuit of selfless sacrifice.                          Congratulating Trey Mytty     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to support a constituent of  mine who was recognized this past January as the 2019 Dealer of the  Year by the American Truck Dealers.   Trey Mytty is the President and CEO of Truck Center Companies, which  is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, located in my congressional  district. Truck Center Companies has eight dealerships, including parts  and service facilities in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa, representing  seven trucking franchises. Of the nearly 575 employees, almost 25  percent of his staff are military veterans or active in the Reserves or  National Guard.   In 1990, while in high school, Mr. Mytty began his career with Truck  Center Companies, then known as Omaha Truck Center. He started out by  washing trucks and ensuring the workplace was clean. After earning his  degree from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and working his way  through the ranks, Trey became the dealer principal and the owner of  Truck Center Companies.   The 2019 Dealer of the Year is a national award recognizing a  commercial truck dealer who exhibits exceptional performance in their  dealerships and performs distinguished community service. Trey was  chosen, in part, for his support of Make-A-Wish Nebraska by sponsoring  an annual golf outing. To date, the dealership has raised over $2.6  million, with a goal of $3 million in 2019.   In addition, Mr. Mytty and Truck Center Companies donate to multiple  area technical schools, and the company has developed a 16-week  training program to integrate young professionals into the truck retail  industry.   Earlier this year, Mr. Mytty began a 2-year role as president of the  Daimler Trucks North America Dealer Council, demonstrating his selfless  leadership to his fellow truck dealers.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of the constituents of Nebraska's  Second District, please join me in congratulating Trey Mytty on being  named the 2019 Truck Dealer of the Year. I wish him, his family, and  the dealership staff at Truck Center Companies continued success and a  prosperous future.                          Recognizing Sherry Wright     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I would  like to recognize a constituent of the Second District of Nebraska,  Sherry Wright, the first African American woman to receive a military  commission from the University of Nebraska-Omaha's ROTC program.    As a single mother, Sherry earned a bachelor's degree in social  welfare and a graduate degree in urban studies and human resource  planning from UNO, upholding high academic standards.   In September of 1975, Sherry noticed some ROTC members on campus and  admired their willingness to serve, protect, and honor our country. It  was in that exact moment that Sherry knew what she wanted to do, so she  joined the Air Force ROTC that very day.   She worked as an air terminal operations officer and a squadron  transportation officer, monitoring and directing airfield operations,  security, and ground transportation. After serving in the Air Force,  Sherry worked for 30 years in the United States Post Office, totaling  35 years of government service.   Now retired, Sherry's selflessness and consideration for children has  motivated her to create programs that educate and empower today's  youth. She has also taken children on educational field trips. At her  own expense, she flew children to Disney World so that they could  experience an airplane ride for the first time and know that there is a  world outside of their neighborhood.   She founded and organized the Increase the Peace campaign, an  organization to challenge youth to think about peace and what they can  do to help their communities through writing and art. She has been an  active board member of the Greater Omaha Neighborhood Coalition, the  Drew Medical Health Clinic, the city of Omaha's Human Relations Board,  and the Omaha Housing Authority board.   Not only is Sherry a published author of the book, ``Somethin's in My  Water,'' she is an Outstanding Service for Women of Color Award nominee  and a recipient of the Navy of the State of Nebraska and the UNO Woman  of Color Award as well. She was also made an admiral of the Nebraska  Navy by former Governor Dave Heineman.   Mr. Speaker, Sherry continues to lead by example and live through  Christ as she serves and cares for her neighbor. Her willingness to  serve our country and her local community makes her a positive role  model, humble individual, and empowering community activist.                            ____________________
