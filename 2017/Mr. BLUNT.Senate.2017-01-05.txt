 Mr. President, I am going to talk about the resolution we  are moving to that will allow us to repeal and begin the replacement  for the President's health care plan.   A little over 3 years ago, President Obama hailed the start of the  ObamaCare exchanges as a life-changing opportunity for Americans. For  most Americans, it was life-changing, but it didn't turn out to be an  opportunity. It was a life-changing experience because in many cases  the insurance they had was no longer affordable, what they thought met  their family's needs was no longer available, and the cost continues to  go up.   When President Obama pushed the health care law through Congress  without a single Republican vote, he repeatedly assured Americans that  they would be able to keep the plans they had, that they would be able  to keep the doctors they had, and that every family would have a  significant reduction in their health care costs. He continued to make  every one of those commitments until the plan actually was put in place  and it was obvious those commitments were not going to be what  happened. By the end of 2013, at least 4.7 million Americans had their  plans canceled because they didn't meet the law's mandatory  requirements. Remember, these were plans that 4.7 million people  thought met their individual needs, and they could afford those plans.  That is why they bought them. They might not have been perfect. They  might have still been a stretch on their budget, but they decided: This  is insurance I can afford, and it is insurance that meets the needs  that I can afford to meet with the insurance I can buy.    The President's claims about everybody being able to keep their  policies and keep their doctor were so far from reality that PolitiFact  rated it as the lie of the year. I don't like to use that language as  it relates to the President of the United States. I would say it must  be really easy to become isolated in the Oval Office, and the President  may get lots of information that sounds to him as if his plan is  working, but the truth is that the President is not entitled to his own  facts. He is entitled to his own opinion. He is entitled to his vision  of what he thinks health care in America should look like, but he is  not entitled to his own facts. If it is not happening the way he thinks  it is happening, somebody needs to tell him. But, of course, in just a  few days there will be a new President, and we have to deal with the  chaos, frankly, that has been created under the old law.   President Obama said this law would mean more choice, more  competition, and lower costs for millions of Americans. Nobody can find  those Americans. A number of Americans got on Medicaid, another  government program, who weren't on Medicaid before. But there aren't  millions of Americans who have more choices, and there aren't millions  of Americans who have more competition for their business, and there  aren't millions of Americans who have lower costs. In fact, just the  opposite would be the case in Missouri, where I live. A number of  insurers pulled out of the exchange totally. Our neighboring States all  have the same experience and, in some cases, even worse experience, but  the competition, the choices, just aren't there because the system  doesn't work.   We have 115 counties in our State, and in 97 of them, you have one  choice; you have one insurer offering insurance. That one insurer may  offer three different plans, but there is no competition for whatever  level you are shopping for. There is only one place to get that level.  This would be as if there is one shoe store in town and none of the  shoes fit and they all cost too much, but if you didn't buy the shoes  in that shoe store--and the chairman of the Budget Committee knows a  lot about shoe stores--you would have to pay a penalty for not buying  shoes that were available at that one location. Everybody would think:  Well, that is unacceptable; you ought to at least be able to drive to  another community and look for shoes. But that is not the case in 97  places, 97 counties. The vast majority of our State and a couple of  States have no counties on the individual exchange that have  competition. We went from several--every county a year ago in Missouri  had at least two companies offering insurance, so there was at least a  competitor. Some had more than two companies offering insurance. Now 97  have one company.   The promise was to bend the cost curve. The cost curve bent, but it  bent the wrong way. The cost curve went up; it didn't go down. In our  State, again, increased premiums have been as high as 40 percent.   In a number of States, they are in the 70-percent category. In one  State, there is a 100-percent increase--not from when ObamaCare started  but from last year--in places where the cost of insurance for  individuals and families had too often already doubled, and now another  add-on.   I was with somebody the other day, and I asked them about their  insurance. He was a healthy guy in his mid-40s. His wife and two  daughters were healthy. I said: What are you doing for insurance?   He said: I am self-employed. In 2009, there were four of us. We had  insurance we thought met our needs. We were paying $300 a month. Now we  are paying $1,190 a month, and we have a $7,500 deductible. If two of  us are sick, we have to submit that deductible twice before we get any  assistance from the insurance company--a $15,000 deductible if two  people in the family are sick with a $1,190 monthly premium.   This is a family that had no health care problems. This is not a  response to somebody who has a policy that they were using. This is a  policy that wasn't being used and, of course, with a $7,500 deductible  unlikely to be used unless that family really has a catastrophic  situation occur. What I believe that family found out a few months  after I visited with them was that their policy went up closer to  $2,000 than $1,190.   The average deductible for a mid-level plan--there are the gold plan,  silver plan, the bronze plan. For the silver plan, the average  deductible in the exchange last year was $3,000. The average deductible  in the bronze plan was $5,000, and it is higher than that for many  people.   To make matters worse, if you aren't able to afford the few options  available on the exchange, you pay a penalty. So you have no  competition. You are required to buy the product, and if you don't buy  the product, there is a penalty. It could have been as much this year  as $2,045, but if your option is to pay $15,000 or $20,000 for  insurance that has this high deductible, that is what many people have  decided to do.   I have heard a lot of Missourians from the day this was initiated  through today talking about the individual challenges they have seen.  For  [[Page S85]]  example, Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, said that the  premiums for his employees have doubled. Why would that be the case?  One, the standards necessary for a policy change and, two, if you're  losing all this money in the individual marketplace, the insurance  companies make that up somewhere. So his premiums have doubled. At the  same time, they have continually had to raise deductibles and seriously  reduce benefits. The cost goes up and the coverage goes down. I think  that is what President Clinton said when he said this is a crazy  system. It is costing more all the time and covering less. That is what  Dave has found out in his business, and he was told late last year that  he should expect a 40-percent increase this year. He said: If that  happens another time, we are no longer in the employee-employer  provided insurance marketplace.   Another location that serves our State and happens to be  headquartered also in Columbia is the Older Americans Transportation  System, a not-for-profit. They provide critical transportation services  to older Missourians, and they have it other places in the country-- older Missourians to low-income people, to underserved parts of our  State that don't have other transportation options. The costs to insure  their drivers have gone up by half a million dollars. The paperwork to  comply with the law's requirements, as the executive director told me,  is so complex and cumbersome, they had to spend additional money to  hire a consultant to implement a software program to help them keep up  with the new mandates. It suddenly got even harder to be a not-for- profit and break even.   Families and small businesses shouldn't be penalized because the law  did not live up to its promise: If you like your health care, you can  keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Family  costs will go down by $2,500 after this plan is put in place. Those  things didn't happen.   We are in a chaotic situation now, and it is time to move in a new  direction. We will have a bill before us very shortly that will allow  us to begin that transition to do things that will prevent Washington  from getting in between health care providers and their patients. We  will do things that will break down barriers that artificially restrict  choice and prevent Americans from picking insurance that meets their  family's needs that they can still pay for. What a concept that would  be.   This is basically the system we had before. It wasn't a perfect  system, and I will say the biggest straw man put forward in that system  was that nobody else had any ideas. There were plenty of other ideas,  ideas that would better serve American families, American job creators,  American job holders, people--plans that would have allowed small  businesses to band together and become a bigger group to seek group  insurance for a number of businesses instead of just one business's  health savings account, better use of health savings accounts, buying  across State lines, and things that I proposed specifically on letting  your family stay on your insurance a little bit longer. Frankly, that  was a 4-page bill that adds 3 million people to insurance every year so  you can stay on your family policy until you are 26. There are four  pages with a lot of white space. This does not have to be that  complicated. There is no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, you are adding  young, healthy people, not much cost to anybody but fundamentally no  cost to taxpayers. It is just an additional way to look at things like  buying insurance across State lines would be. There are solutions here,  but we have been prevented from moving to those solutions.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that will allow us to  move forward. We will begin to eliminate the chaos of ObamaCare and  restore the focus of health care to patients, people, the doctors they  want to have, and the places they want to go to get their health care.
