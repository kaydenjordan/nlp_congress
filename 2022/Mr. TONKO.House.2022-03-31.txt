 Madam Speaker, I was detained by legislative business. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 98 and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 99.

It is so important that we are now investing in research as the  COMPETES Act requires so that we create the next generation of product  line and chips. It is important to invest in that pipeline of workers  that will have those precision-oriented skills in an innovation economy  that requires such precision. It is important that we retrofit our  manufacturing centers so as to compete and compete effectively.   I am impressed by the fact that we have taken the strengths of so  many committees and brought them into the forefront of COMPETES to make  certain that we invest in the CHIPS for America Act. I have industries  for microelectronics, and certainly the semiconductor industry that are  hosted in the 20th Congressional District that I am honored to  represent. They deserve and they require, more importantly, a  partnership with the Federal Government. Those resources will be there  with the passage of this bill as we bring together a consensus.   We will invest in that $52 billion worth of investment for the chips  industry, the CHIPS for America Act. We will make certain that a bill  that I authored, the Micro Act, is incorporated in the context of  COMPETES, and that will complement the provisions in CHIPS by making  certain that we accelerate early stage microelectronics research to  feed into the national semiconductor technology center.   It is so important to have that cutting-edge investment so that we  can lead the world in innovation, and making certain also that we  promote strong global leadership by positioning the interests and the  values of our United States, not China, to win on the world stage,  including with strong action to hold the PRC accountable for its trade  abuses which hurt U.S. workers, and for its human rights violations.   The America COMPETES Act will elevate American leadership in the  global arena, putting diplomacy first, strengthening our alliances,  combating unfair trade practices, and standing up for our national  values.   The COMPETES Act ensures that American goods are made in America by  American workers and boosts competition addressing supply bottlenecks,  strengthening U.S. manufacturing, and lowering those kitchen table  costs.   This is a measure that is all-inclusive. It is the boldest, strongest  statement on competitiveness for America. It is the great strength of  COMPETES that I hope will carry us now into an innovation economy with  the workforce prepared to go, a research investment that gives us the  vision and tethers that vision into future product lines and chips  development, and that will allow for us to strengthen our manufacturing  partnership. They require that assistance and they require our  partnership.
