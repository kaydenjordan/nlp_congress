 Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague  from the State of Washington, Senator Cantwell, for her passion for  people and the rights of people to vote, and her willingness to  actually go through the details of the groups outside of this Congress  that feel so strongly about this, including businesses, as pointed out,  that understand that you can't do business overseas--having just come  back from Ukraine, from which I just arrived an hour ago--and uphold  democracies overseas, if we are allowing our democracy to go to  shambles by allowing voter suppression laws to pass, as they have in  numerous States across the country.   Just this week, we marked the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., and, today, we are considering legislation that goes to the  very heartbeat of the democracy--the freedom to vote--that so many have  fought and died for.   We are here because a flood of State laws to roll back voting has  surged up since the 2020 elections, when in the 2020 elections, in the  middle of a pandemic, more Americans cast a ballot than ever before.  They were willing to take those risks, and the laws were changed in red  States and blue States and purple States to allow them to do that.   But now what do we see? A rollback. A rollback in the Presiding  Officer's great State of Wisconsin. We see rollbacks attempted across  the Nation in places like Montana, with same-day registration in place  for 15 years. And 8,000 people took avail of it in the last election to  either change their address or register that way.   So then what happens? Well, say the Republican legislature in Montana  says: Why don't we get rid of something we have had in place for 15  years? Why don't we do that?   Guess what that creates, my friends. Maximum confusion and ultimate  voter suppression.   With that core freedom of voting now at stake, it is on us to stand  up and to take up the torch that Dr. King and so many brave Americans  carried decades ago and acted to preserve the foundational right of our  democracy. And while that may sound like an ambitious task, it is one  within our reach. By passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, we  can meet these challenges and turn back the tide.    Today, I want to address a topic that has loomed large over this  historic debate, and that has to do with the very rules of this  Chamber.   This week, every Member of the Senate will have a chance to cast a  vote that will determine if this is a legislative body that will rise  to meet a test. The test is participation and voting. The test is  actually being able to take on the issues of our day.   It won't be the first time. Indeed, four times already this Congress,  our Republican colleagues have blocked us from even considering  legislation to protect the freedom to vote. But we are here again this  week. We are here because, to quote Ella Baker, a granddaughter of  slaves from Virginia who worked alongside some of the great leaders of  the civil rights movement, ``We who believe in freedom cannot rest.''   So while much has been made of our colleagues who have not committed  to join us in this effort to change the Senate rules, we must remain  steadfast in the truth that the right to vote in this country is not  negotiable. We must forge ahead.   I want to start by responding to some of the points that have been  raised as reasons not to move forward with legislation at this  watershed moment, as reasons not to do what it takes when it comes to  protecting this most sacred of rights--the right to vote.   Some have argued that allowing voting rights legislation to pass the  Senate without clearing a 60-vote threshold would be a mistake that  would open the door to somehow leading to wild swings in Federal  policy. I am trying to imagine this place ever being involved in such a  thing given how slowly we go and how many people understandably want to  make sure we are careful in how we pass laws, but that is one of the  things that have been raised for why we need some kind of a 60-vote  threshold, which, of course, is not in the Constitution. The words  ``filibuster'' and ``cloture'' are not in the Constitution. In fact,  legislatures across this land, some of which do very good things, do  not use a 60-vote threshold. In fact, democracies across the world do  not use a 60-vote threshold.   The truth is this: We have tried for months to persuade our  Republican colleagues to join us in supporting legislation, to work  with us, to debate it,  [[Page S250]]  but what they do is they throw a wrench into the process and then  basically walk out that door and go home. We don't have that debate  that allows us to have amendments and allows us to ultimately have a  vote on the bill. It is cut off from a vote.   When you look at the past when it comes to voting rights, it has been  bipartisan not even that long ago. But this time--this time--even  reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, something that has been law of the  land and supported on a bipartisan basis, as the President of the  United States pointed out when he was in Atlanta--this time, no. Only  one Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, was willing even to allow  the John Lewis bill to come up for a vote.   But if our colleagues across the aisle will not work with us, it does  not mean--it cannot mean--that we should simply give up. A simple look  at history makes that clear.   As Representative Clyburn has noted in recent weeks, there have been  moments in our history when this most fundamental of rights has not  been extended or defended on a bipartisan basis; that is, the right to  have these bills come up. He pointed to the 15th Amendment. That, as he  said, was a single-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote.  That fact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.   I would also say to my colleagues that the real threat facing our  country isn't too much legislation; it is the gridlock and the  stalemate in which this Chamber is stuck.   A number of us were just in Ukraine standing up for democracy,  standing up for the right of people across the world to be able to  debate issues and make decisions on the most pressing issues of this  time. Now we are back here in this Chamber, and we have to have that  opportunity as well.   This misses another key point in the arguments made against changing  the rules. When politicians actually have to vote on stuff, voters can  hold them accountable for these votes.   We know that the policies in the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act  enjoy strong support among the American people. They have been adopted  in red, blue, and purple States.   Look at places like Utah, where for years there has been mail-in  balloting. Yet, in other States, sadly, it is really hard to do. In  other States, you have to get a notary just to get an application or  you have to get a witness just to get an application even if you have  COVID and you are in a hospital. Yet, in many States--red, blue,  purple--this is in place.   We believe--those of us who support the Freedom to Vote Act--that in  keeping with the Constitution that says Congress can make or alter the  laws regarding Federal elections, that this should be the law of the  land. It is constitutionally supported, and Americans, no matter what  their ZIP Code, should have the right to vote in a safe way that is  best for them.    Arguing that Senate rules are more important than the right to vote  ignores the very history of this Nation. As Senator Angus King has  reminded us, in 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge introduced a bill to ensure  African Americans in the South were not disenfranchised. The bill was  passed in the House but was blocked by the Senate with a filibuster.  Lodge argued that the Senate should get rid of the filibuster, saying:         To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and       never vote is imbecile.    I think that kind of says it all quite directly.   The Senate chose not to change its rules, and due to repeated  filibusters in the years that followed, Congress couldn't pass  legislation to enforce the 15th Amendment until nearly 70 years later  through the Civil Rights Act of 1957.   We have also heard that allowing one party to insist on virtually  unlimited debate so that you can't vote is an essential part of the  Senate, but experts from both parties have said this isn't true.   Marty Gold, a respected expert on Senate rules who worked for  Republican Leader Howard Baker and was staff director of the Senate  Rules Committee, has written:         The possibility that a minority of Senators could hold       unlimited debate on a topic against the majority's will was       unknown [in] the first Senate.    Those are his words.   Others have argued that requiring a supermajority, as this filibuster  does now, to pass legislation was an intentional effort to foster  compromise, but, again, the historical record simply doesn't back that  up.   The Constitutional Convention heard but did not adopt a proposal to  require a supermajority for legislation. The Framers explicitly decided  to reserve supermajority requirements for things like constitutional  amendments, treaties, and impeachment.   To quote one of them, Benjamin Franklin wrote that a system where  ``the minority overpowers the majority'' would be ``contrary to the  common practice of assemblies in all countries and ages.''   Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison:         It is my principle that the will of the majority should       always prevail.    James Madison was a fierce defender of minority rights, but in 1834,  even he wrote:         The vital Principle of Republican Government is . . . the       will of the majority.''    Listening to those words, does it really seem like the Framers of our  Constitution envisioned a system where a minority of Senators could  stand in the way of legislation and stop it altogether--stop the vote,  stop the consideration, throw a wrench into the process, take it off  the rails--and then just walk out the door and go home? That is not  what they envisioned.   I also want to be clear. Updating the Senate rules to meet the needs  of this moment isn't some radical break with past precedence.  Throughout the Senate's history, when faced with unrelenting  obstruction from the minority, the majority has, in fact, changed the  Senate rules to allow matters to conclude, to be voted on, not to hang  in abeyance in perpetuity. In fact, since it was first established in  1917, the cloture rule has been revised multiple times to make it  easier to end debate and to force a vote.   Now, for friends watching at home, this is what it means: A cloture  motion is what allows Senators to bring something to a vote, and under  the current rules, it takes 60 Senators to open debate or to pass a  bill.   Here are some examples of how the cloture rule has changed over time:   In 1949, cloture was extended to cover all issues pending before the  Senate, not just bills.   In 1975, the vote threshold for cloture was reduced to three-fifths  of all Senators.   In 1979, total postcloture debate was limited to 100 hours, and then  it was limited again to 30 hours in 1986.   In the past decade, the cloture rule has been further reduced for  various kinds of nominees, most recently by our Republican colleagues  across the aisle. This isn't something from 100 years ago. This isn't  something from before we had cars and people were arriving here on  horseback. This just happened.   In addition to changes to the cloture rule itself, the Senate has put  in place exceptions to the rule. In fact, over time, the Senate has  established over 160 processes and statutes that allow a final vote  without requiring 60 votes for cloture to end debate; in other words,  you get to a vote without the 60 votes.   As a result, we have expedited procedures, including--get this-- reconciliation to pass spending and tax legislation; the Congressional  Review Act to block regulations; disapproval of arms sales. I guess  someone decided that was OK to do for less than 60 votes. Even  approving compensation plans for commercial space accidents doesn't  require 60 votes, my friends.    But while the 60-vote threshold was carved up 160 times so Senators  could pass things like tax cuts under President Trump, block  regulations, and confirm Supreme Court Justices, when it comes to  voting rights, we are told that tradition and comity mean that we  should hug it tight--this old rule--throw voters under the Senate  desks, and go home.   It is no wonder that our Republican colleagues support for the 60- vote threshold rings hollow when their priorities, such as tax cuts and  a Supreme Court nominee, can be passed with a simple majority.   Time and time again, the majority in the U.S. Senate has had to  change the  [[Page S251]]  rules to help pass major legislation. As Senator Merkley has noted time  and time again, bills we have passed after the majority has modified  the rules include the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1977; funding for the  Selective Service System in 1980; deficit reduction legislation in  1985; a moratorium on listing new species under the Endangered Species  Act in 1995; and a change made by the majority in 1996 to the  reconciliation process, which paved the way for the 2001 and 2003 Bush  tax cuts and the 2017 Trump tax cuts. When circumstances change,  Senators have changed the rules time and time again.   All of this history clearly shows that the Senate rules are not  chiseled in stone. That is probably a good thing because the people out  there need us to do our jobs. And maybe that is more important than  some archaic rule that someone is now abusing. They are not an outside  force, these rules, over which we have no control. They are our rules-- the Senators' rules, yes, but also the people's rules--written and  changed over the years by Senators representing the people of this  country, just like the ones sitting in this Chamber today.   As we move forward, I want to make clear that I agree with my  colleagues who have said that we must keep the history of this  institution in mind. By the way, I just gave you the history of this  institution--160 carve-outs; time and time again when the rules have  changed. That is the true history of this institution.   History plainly allows for just this type of action that our  democracy now demands. If we acknowledge the stakes when it comes to  protecting the freedom to vote, the cornerstone of our democracy, and  we acknowledge the history of the rules of this body, I am left with a  simple conclusion: We must update, change, and improve our rules to  restore the Senate and meet the moment of our times.   Our Nation was founded on the ideals of democracy, and we have seen  for ourselves in this building how we can't afford to take that for  granted. I certainly saw that this weekend in Ukraine. We cannot afford  to take any democracy for granted.   The world is watching us--watching to see how America is taking on  the challenges of the 21st century, including the threats to our  democracy. Around the globe, there are those who see weakness as an  opportunity. They see weakness in our democracy as an opportunity for  them. Those who are hoping that gridlock and paralysis are the defining  features of America--they are out there, and you can imagine what world  leaders I am thinking of right now.   To put it simply, if we are going to effectively compete with the  rest of the world, we need a Senate that can do more than just respond  to crises. We are pretty good at that--tornadoes, hurricanes, floods,  tsunamis, financial crises, pandemics. OK. We respond to that. But what  about the long-term challenges that slowly but surely are eroding this  democracy with voter suppression? There is so much at stake here. We  must get this done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the remarks of Senator Portman, the Senate recess until 6:15 p.m.
