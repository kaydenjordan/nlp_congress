 Madam Speaker, I rise to vote down the previous  question.   If we defeat the previous question, Republicans will amend the rule  to include the restoration of the 15-year schedule for qualified  improvement property, or QIP, as part of H.R. 1309, the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Healthcare and Social Service Workers Act.   Madam Speaker, there is strong bipartisan support to fix QIP, which  affects restaurants, retailers, and other leaseholders in every  congressional district in this country. There are 271 bipartisan  cosponsors split nearly evenly between Republicans and Democrats on  H.R. 1869, which I helped introduce to resolve this issue.   Fixing QIP is a commonsense solution that would unleash investment,  create jobs, and help small businesses grow. However, it also requires  urgency, and Congress must do everything in our power to address this  issue as soon as possible.   I hope that we defeat the previous question to ensure that  restaurants, retailers, and other small businesses are able to unlock  the full benefits of tax reform and continue driving our Nation's  economic growth forward.   Failing that, I sincerely hope that all sides can come together  before the end of the year to enact this bipartisan, commonsense piece  of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous  question.  [[Page H9072]]
