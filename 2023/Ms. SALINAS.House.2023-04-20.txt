 Mr. Speaker, I rise in defense of science, freedom, and  choice.   Two weeks ago, a Trump-appointed judge issued a ruling to suspend the  FDA's approval of mifepristone, a safe abortion and miscarriage  management medication that has been on the market for more than two  decades.   This unscientific, partisan judicial decision is the latest move in  the ongoing attack on reproductive freedom across the United States.   Abortion, including medication abortion, like mifepristone, is still  safe and legal in Oregon. But, like so many Oregonians, I am deeply  troubled by these attacks, and I refuse to sit idly by as they  jeopardize the health and well-being of millions of Americans.   I will continue to stand up for those who can get pregnant to ensure  mifepristone remains available to all who need it, and to restore the  right to choose in all 50 States.   Congress can and must intervene.                            ____________________
