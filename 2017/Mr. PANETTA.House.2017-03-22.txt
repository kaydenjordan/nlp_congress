 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the American  Health Care Act and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act 7 years ago, in my  district, the uninsured rate has dropped from 19 percent to 9 percent.  In my district, there has been the creation and the funding of 6,500  jobs in local hospitals and rural healthcare clinics.   Yet, despite this progress in my community and across our country,  the majority wants to replace the ACA with a quickly and carelessly  crafted AHCA.   If the AHCA becomes law, in my district, 56,000 people will lose  their healthcare coverage. In Salinas, hardworking families will pay  more than $3,000 for healthcare coverage; and in Santa Cruz, low-income  senior citizens will be stripped of $10,000 worth of subsidies.   Yes, the ACA does have its faults, but we should come together to  thoughtfully fix it. But it is not just about money; it is about  people. And it is not just about people; it is about the security that  the ACA provides people to live their daily lives.   Mr. Speaker, the AHCA makes us insecure, and that is why I am voting  against it.                            ____________________
