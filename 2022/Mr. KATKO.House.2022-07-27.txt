 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Michael  Long, who passed away on July 24, 2022.   Mike was a beloved member of the New York Conservative Party, a  mentor to many, including myself, a dear friend, and a champion for New  Yorkers. A Brooklyn native, Mike developed a love for his home State  and his country at a young age.   Mike's sense of public duty led him to serve his country in the  United States Marine Corps. Following that service, he began his  decades-long career in politics. In 1981, he was elected to serve as a  Brooklyn at-large representative on the New York City Council.   In 1988, Mike became the chair of the New York Conservative Party, a  post that he retained until 2019. It was in this capacity that I got to  know Mike and got to know Mike well.   The overriding thing I got from Mike was his sense of fairness, his  sense of decency, his commitment to the cause, and endeavoring to make  sure that the Conservative Party had a big tent, not a small,  restrictive one.   The Conservative Party and all New York Republicans will miss Mike's  guidance and his integrity.   Outside of politics, Mike was a devoted husband to his wife, Eileen,  and father to their nine children.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring the life and legacy of Michael Long.   May he rest in peace.
