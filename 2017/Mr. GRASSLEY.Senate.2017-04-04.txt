 Mr. President, before I start, I ask unanimous consent  that the debate time on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch during  Tuesday's session of the Senate be divided as follows: the time until  3:30 p.m. be under the control of the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee; the time from 3:30 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. be under the control  of the minority; the time from 4:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. be under the  control of the majority; the time from 5:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. be  under the control of the minority; and finally, that the time from 6:30  p.m. until 6:45 p.m. be under the control of the majority.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, today we will continue to debate the  nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of  the Supreme Court of the United States.   The Judiciary Committee held four full days of hearings last month.  The judge testified for more than 20 hours. He answered more than 1,000  questions during his testimony and hundreds more questions for the  record. We have had the opportunity to review the 2,700 cases he has  heard, and we have had the opportunity to review the more than 180,000  pages of documents produced by the Bush Library and the Department of  Justice. Now, after all of this, my Democratic colleagues unfortunately  appear to remain committed to what they have been talking about for a  long period of time: filibustering the nomination of this very well  qualified jurist.   Even after all of this process, there is no attack against the judge  that sticks. In fact, it has been clear since before the judge was  nominated that some Members in the Democratic leadership would search  desperately for a reason to oppose him.   As the minority leader said before the nomination: ``It's hard for me  to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get  Republican support that we could support.'' That is the end of the  quote from the minority leader.   He said later, and I will continue to quote him: ``If the nominee is  out of the mainstream, we'll do our best to hold the seat open.''   Then the President nominated Judge Gorsuch. This judge is eminently  qualified to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, and there  is no denying that whatsoever.   Let me tell you some things about him. He is a graduate of Columbia  University and Harvard Law School. He earned a doctorate in philosophy  from Oxford University and served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court  Justices.   During a decade in private practice, he earned a reputation as a  distinguished trial and appellate lawyer. He served with distinction in  the Department of Justice. He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court  of Appeals by a unanimous voice vote in this body.   The record he has built during his decade on the bench has earned him  the universal respect of his colleagues both on the bench and the bar.  This judge is eminently qualified to do what the President appointed  him to do.   Faced with an unquestionably qualified nominee, my friends on the  other side of the aisle, my Democratic colleagues, have continually  moved the goalpost, setting test after test for this judge to meet. But  do you know what? This judge has passed all of those tests, all with  flying colors, so the people on the other side of the aisle--the  Democrats in the minority--are left with a ``no'' vote in search of a  reason.   Let's go through some of their arguments. First, the minority leader  announced that the nominee must prove himself to be a mainstream judge.  Is he a mainstream judge or not? Well, consider his record: Judge  Gorsuch has heard 2,700 cases and written 240 published opinions. He  has voted with the majority in 99 percent of the cases, and 97 percent  of the cases he has heard have been decided unanimously. Only one of  those 2,700 cases was ever reversed by the Supreme Court, and it  happens that Judge Gorsuch did not write the opinion.   Then consider what others say about him. He has been endorsed by  prominent Democratic members of the Supreme Court bar, including Neal  Katyal, President Obama's Acting Solicitor General. This Acting  Solicitor General wrote a New York Times op-ed entitled ``Why Liberals  Should Back Neil Gorsuch.'' Mr. Katyal wrote: ``I have no doubt that if  confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule  of law.''   He went on to write that the judge's record ``should give the  American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to  favor the President who appointed him.''   Likewise, another well-known person, David Frederick, a board member  [[Page S2191]]  of the liberal American Constitution Society, says we should ``applaud  such independence of mind and spirit in Supreme Court nominees.''   So after hearing what people on both the right and the left have said  about the judge, it is clear that he is ``mainstream,'' but the  goalpost seems to move. Next we hear that the judge doesn't care about  the ``little guy'' and, instead, rules for the ``big guy.''   First of all, that is a goofy argument. Just ask liberal law  professor Noah Feldman. If you ask Professor Feldman, he says this  criticism is a ``truly terrible idea'' because ``the rule of law isn't  liberal or conservative--and it shouldn't be.''   The strategy on this point became clear during our hearing: Pore  through 2,700 cases, cherry-pick a couple where sympathetic plaintiffs  were on the losing end of the legal argument, then find a reason to  attack the judge for that result, and then, because of that case or  two, label him ``against'' the little guy. As silly as that argument  is, the judge himself laid waste to that argument during the hearing  when he rattled off a number of cases where the so-called little guy  came out on the winning end of the legal argument of a case.   At any rate, as we discussed at length during his hearings, the judge  applies the law neutrally to every party before him, and that is what  you expect of judges.   I disagree with some of my colleagues who have argued that judging is  not just a matter of applying neutral principles. I think that view is  inconsistent with the role our judges play in our system and, more  importantly, with regard to the oath they take. That oath requires them  to do ``equal right to the poor and the rich'' and to apply the law  ``without respect to persons.'' Naturally, this is what it means to  live under the rule of law, and this is what our nominee has done  during his decade on the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals. So the judge applies the law ``without respect to persons,''  as he promised in his first oath he would, and he will repeat the oath  when he goes on the Supreme Court.    Then, of course, as they move these goalposts, the judge has been  criticized for the work he did on behalf of his former client, the U.S.  Government, when he was at the Justice Department.   Of course, we have had a lot of nominees over many years who have  worked as lawyers in the government. Most recently, Justice Kagan  worked as Solicitor General. As we all know, she argued before the  Supreme Court that the government could constitutionally ban pamphlet  material. That is a fairly radical position for the U.S. Government to  take. When asked about that argument during her hearing, she said that  she was a government lawyer making an argument on behalf of her client,  the U.S. Government, and it had nothing to do with her personal views  on the subject. Now, there is a whole different standard for some  people of this body. That answer is apparently no longer good enough.  To hear the other side tell it, government lawyers are responsible for  the positions their client, the U.S. Government, takes and the  positions they have to argue. I respect my colleagues who are making  this argument, but this argument does not hold water.   What, then, are my colleagues on the other side left with after  moving these goalposts many times, after making all of these arguments  that don't stick? What are they left with? Because they can't get any  of their attacks on the judge to stick, all they are left with are  complaints about the so-called dark money being spent by advocacy  groups. Yes, that is where the goalpost took them--to dark money.   As I said yesterday, that speaks volumes about the nominee, that  after reviewing 2,700 cases, roughly 180,000 pages of documents from  the Department of Justice and the George W. Bush Library, thousands of  pages of briefs, and over 20 hours of testimony before our committee  and hundreds of questions both during and after the hearing, all his  detractors are left with is an attack on the nominee's supporters-- people out there whom the nominee probably doesn't even know. They  raise money to tell people about him, which they have a constitutional  right to do under the First Amendment freedom of speech.   The bottom line is that they don't have any substantive attacks on  this nominee that will stick, so they shifted tactics, yet again moving  the goalpost, and are now trying to intimidate and silence those who  are speaking out and making their voices heard in regard to this  nominee.   Here is the most interesting thing about this latest development:  There are advocacy groups on every side of this nomination. There are  people out there for him, raising money and spending the money for him,  and there are people out there against him who are raising and spending  money so people know why they disagree with this nominee. Of course,  that is nothing new. That has been true of past nominations, and there  is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the First Amendment freedom  of speech and in the process of being for or against and encouraging  public debate on whether a person ought to be on the Supreme Court. It  was certainly true when liberal groups favoring the Garland nomination  poured money into Iowa to attack me last year for not holding a  hearing. For that reason, I didn't hear a lot of my Democratic  colleagues complain about that money that could well be called dark  money as well.   There are groups on the left who are running ads in opposition to  this nominee and threatening primaries. They are actually threatening  primaries against Democrats who might not tow the line and might not  help filibuster this nomination. For some reason, I am not hearing a  lot of complaints about the money that is being raised to make some  Democrats who might support this nominee look bad.   As I have said, there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the  process and making their voices heard. This is one of the ways we are  free to speak our minds in a democracy. It has been true for a long,  long time.   As I said yesterday in the committee meeting, if you don't like  outside groups getting involved, the remedy is not to intimidate and  try to silence that message; the remedy you ought to follow is to  support nominees who apply the law as it is written and then, in turn,  leave the legislating to a body elected to make laws under our  Constitution--the Senate and the House of Representatives.   Regardless of what you may think about advocacy groups, about their  getting involved, there is certainly no reason that they should go to  great lengths to talk about this in our committee or talk about it to  the nominee because he can't control any of that.   The truth is, the Democrats have no principled reason to oppose this  nomination, and those are words from David Frederick that I have quoted  before. It is clear instead that much of the opposition to the nominee  is pretextual. The merits and qualifications of the nominee apparently  no longer matter.    The only conclusion we are left to draw is that the Democrats will  refuse to confirm any nominee this Republican President may put forth.  There is no reason to think the Democrats would confirm any other judge  the President identified as a potential nominee or any judge he would  nominate. In fact, we don't even need to speculate on that point  because the minority leader has spoken that point and made his point  very clear. Before the President made this nomination, he said: ``I  can't imagine us supporting anyone from his list.'' So it was very  clear from the very beginning that the minority leader was going to  lead this unprecedented filibuster. The only question was what excuse  he would manufacture to justify it. The nominee enjoys broad bipartisan  support from those who know him, and he enjoys bipartisan support in  the Senate.   I recognize that the minority leader is under very enormous pressure  from special interest groups to take this abnormal step of  filibustering a judge, because filibustering the Senate is not unusual  but filibustering a Supreme Court Justice is very unusual. I know other  Members of his caucus are operating under those very same pressures as  well. In fact, yesterday, while the committee was debating the  nomination, a whole host of liberal and progressive groups held a press  conference outside of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,  demanding that the campaign arm cut off campaign funds for any  incumbent Democrat who  [[Page S2192]]  doesn't filibuster this nominee. Those groups argue that because the  Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had already raised a lot of  money off the minority leader's announcement that he was going to lead  a filibuster, the committee shouldn't provide that money to any Member  who refused to join this misguided effort.   Well, all I can say is that it would be truly unfortunate for  Democrats to buckle to that pressure and engage in the first partisan  filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice nominee in U.S. history--another  way to say that is, the first partisan filibuster in the 228-year  history of our country since 1789. If they regard this nominee as the  first in our history worthy of a partisan filibuster, it is clear they  would filibuster anyone.   I have stated since long before the election that the new President  would nominate the next Justice and the Judiciary Committee would  process that nomination. That is just what we have done through the  committee, and now we are doing it on the floor. So I urge my  colleagues not to engage in this unprecedented partisan demonstration.  Everyone knows the nominee is a qualified, mainstream, independent  judge of the very highest caliber. Republicans know it, Democrats know  it, and the left-leaning editorial boards across the country prove that  even the press knows it. I urge my colleagues on the other side to come  to their senses and not engage in the first partisan filibuster in U.S.  history and instead join me and vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.    Mr. President, I have several of my colleagues on this  side of the aisle who want to speak, but I just want to take a minute  and a half or so to clarify some things I have heard from the other  side that need to be counteracted.   First of all, I don't know whether they mentioned the term ``Ginsburg  rule,'' but we do have this Ginsburg rule that was set out a long time  ago when Judge Ginsburg came before the Senate for her confirmation.  She said that you can't comment on things that might come before the  Court because obviously you would be violating judicial ethics. Then I  will comment on some things people have said about Brown v. Board of  Education.   The very fact that Judge Gorsuch has declined to offer his opinion on  legal issues that are likely to come before the Supreme Court  demonstrates what we should all expect of him: his judicial  independence. That is what we expect of every judge. The judge's  decision not to offer his opinion on issues that may come before him is  consistent with judicial ethics rules and is consistent with what I  have referred to already as the Ginsburg rule or the Ginsburg standard,  which all Supreme Court nominees in recent memory have followed. As  Justice Ginsburg said, commenting on these issues is not fair to  parties who might come before the Court in future years. That is what  Judge Gorsuch said as well.   Questions to this end are nothing more than an attempt to compromise  the judge's independence, and he showed us that he wasn't going to have  his independence compromised because he is going to do what judges  should do: look at the facts of a case, look at the law, and make those  decisions based only on that and send no signals whatsoever ahead of  time of how he might view something.   Along these lines, my colleagues said that the judge should have  announced that he agreed with the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education  but didn't offer enough information about this opinion in an  appropriate discussion of precedent.  [[Page S2200]]    I will quote our nominee. He said this: ``Senator, Brown v. Board of  Education corrected an erroneous decision, a badly erroneous decision,  and vindicated a dissent by the first Justice Harlan in Plessy v.  Ferguson, where he correctly identified that separate to advantage one  race can never be equal,'' end of the quote of our nominee. So the  judge spoke about precedent very appropriately. He answered our  questions in a manner consistent with his obligations and with past  nominees.   One more point. I keep hearing complaints that the judge won't make a  commitment to follow Roe v. Wade, but my colleagues' requests really  boil down to a quest for a promise to reach results that they want.  They demand adherence to Roe v. Wade on the one hand and a promise to  overrule Citizens United on the other hand, as examples. Asking the  judge to make commitments about precedent is inappropriate. I have said  this so many times, and my colleagues will repeat it many times as  well. It compromises the judge's independence.   Instead of being beholden to the President, my colleagues would have  the judge be beholden to them. This nominee isn't going to be beholden  to a President, and he is not going to be beholden to any Senator  because if he did that, he would be compromising his views.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.    Mr. President, we are continuing to debate the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said that  this is an important moment for the Senate. I couldn't agree more.   I think it is important to reflect on why we are here and how we got  here. Before I turn to the Supreme Court and the current debate, let me  take just a few minutes to talk about lower court nominees and provide  a little bit of history and context, especially for the benefit of some  of the Senators who weren't here over the last few years.   I am going to start way back in the spring of 2001. President George  W. Bush had just been elected President. As we all know, it was a close  election, and it was hard fought. The Senate was closely divided, with  the Republicans in control. Given how close the Presidential election  was, there were elements of the hard left who refused to accept the  results of that election. Some blamed Ralph Nader, others blamed  Governor Jeb Bush, and still others blamed the Supreme Court. Many on  the hard left claimed that President George W. Bush wasn't a  ``legitimate'' President. Liberal interest groups were egging on the  Democratic leadership to fight the new President at every turn.   That still sounds very familiar for this year we are in.   At the same time, one major concern for the hard-left liberal  interest groups was that President Bush, who they claimed wasn't  legitimate, would be able to nominate conservative judges. Again,  doesn't that sound familiar?   Senator Cornyn went over some of this same subject yesterday, but it  deserves discussion now, and it serves as a reminder of where we have  been before because sometimes the past predicts the future.   So in the spring of 2001, the hard-left interest groups went to the  Senate Democratic leadership with a plan. According to the New York  Times, ``42 of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private retreat . .  . where a principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to  combat the White House on judicial nominees.'' Thinking about 2017,  doesn't that sound a little familiar?   At that meeting--Cass Sunstein, Marcia Greenberger, and Laurence  Tribe spoke at the retreat and pitched to the Democrats who were  present their idea of how this crusade could proceed.   According to one attendee, ``They said it was important for the  Senate to change the ground rules, and there was no obligation to  confirm someone just because they are scholarly and erudite.''   Well, let's think about that for a moment. Why do you suppose they  believed they needed to ``change the ground rules'' for confirming  judges? It is because up to that point you didn't filibuster judges.  You just didn't. You heard the majority leader speak to that point in  his short remarks this morning about how things have changed after more  than 200 years.   Well, as it happened, less than a month after the caucus retreat,  Senator Jeffords from Vermont switched parties and began caucusing with  the Democrats. That threw the majority to the Democrats for the next 18  months. Then they lost the election of 2002, and in the spring of 2003,  Republicans were back in the majority.   Now back in the minority, Senate Democrats went ahead with the plans  that were enunciated at that retreat to ``change the ground rules.''  For the first time in the history of the Senate, they began to  systematically filibuster circuit court nominees--not because they  believed the nominees weren't qualified. The nominees were qualified.  And it was not because they believed the nominees didn't have the  necessary experience. The nominees did have the necessary experience.  They filibustered those nominees because they believed they were  conservative judges.   So with respect to appellate court nominees, Senate Democrats, at the  behest of the far left, took the unprecedented step of using the  filibuster in a very systematic way for the first time in Senate  history. At the time, there was a lot of debate about changing the  rules, dubbed the so-called nuclear option, so that nominees would be  afforded an up-or-down vote, consistent with the Senate's history and  practice.   Well, Republicans exercised restraint and agreed to step back. Then  President Obama became President. Our side didn't like the use of a  filibuster for judges, but we also didn't think there should be two  sets of rules--one for a Republican President and one for a Democratic  President. Common sense tells you that is a legitimate position to  take.   We defeated two circuit court nominees, one to the Ninth Circuit and  one to the DC Circuit. Then President Obama nominated three individuals  to the DC Circuit. Our side denied cloture on those three nominees to  the DC Circuit.   Well, at that point, their side didn't like playing by the rules they  wrote, so then-Majority Leader Reid took another unprecedented step. In  November of 2013, he utilized the so-called nuclear option to eliminate  the very tactic they pioneered. The nuclear option becomes effectively  the regroup.   So that is how the filibuster was first used on lower court nominees  and later eliminated. Senate Democrats took the unprecedented step to  utilize that. Then when it no longer benefited them, they used  unprecedented means to eliminate it.   This brings me back to where we are today and the rest of this week-- talking about a Supreme Court nominee, Judge Gorsuch.   Everyone knows we had a big debate last year about whether to proceed  with the Garland nomination. There were 52 Republicans who believed we  should follow Senate history and tradition and not proceed with the  nomination in the middle of a heated election year.   I know it frustrates my colleagues to hear me say it, but fact is  that in 1992, when then-Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, he announced that he wouldn't hold a hearing to fill a  vacancy in the last year of President Bush's term. So last year, we  followed the precedent that then-Senator Biden described in 1992 for  all of the same reasons he discussed.   You get back to this commonsense principle: Can you have one rule for  Republican Presidents and another rule for Democratic Presidents? We  didn't feel you could. And, of course, everyone in this Chamber knows  that if the shoe were on the other foot, the Democrats would have done  the same thing, because they said they would. In fact, President  Obama's former White House Counsel admitted as much. She said she would  have recommended the same course of action if the tables were turned.    So now here we are, April 2017, with the nominee before us. Just as  in 2001, we have just had a very contentious Presidential election. It  was close. It was hard fought, and frankly, some on  [[Page S2305]]  the hard left refused to accept the results of the election. Once  again, leftwing groups are egging on the minority leader to take  another unprecedented step with respect to judicial nominations. Only  this time they want him to lead the very first partisan filibuster of a  Supreme Court nomination in U.S. history. Based on the vote we had  yesterday, it appears 44 Democrats are prepared to follow the minority  leader on this fool's errand. No Supreme Court nomination in our  country's entire history has ever failed because of a partisan  filibuster. There is no getting around that fact.   Abe Fortas, whom I have referred to, was subjected to a bipartisan  filibuster over ethical concerns when President Johnson tried to  elevate him to be Chief Justice.   Justice Thomas was confirmed by a vote of 52 to 48. I was here for  that nomination. A single Senator--any Senator--could have demanded a  cloture vote, but out of 100 Senators, none did. Why? For the simple,  commonsense fact and 200 years of history that you don't filibuster a  Supreme Court nomination.   But today is entirely different. The minority is committed to  filibustering this fine nominee in the first partisan filibuster in  U.S. history.   So here we are. The President has nominated an exceptionally  qualified judge to take Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. The  Democrats will break new ground again by conducting a partisan  filibuster of the nominee. Republicans aren't the ones breaking new  ground here. As a matter of fact, the Democrats' own Vice Presidential  nominee last year emphatically promised that the Democrats would  further change the rules to make sure an expected-President Clinton's  nominees couldn't be filibustered.   So at the end of the day, the fact is that if Democrats insist on a  filibuster, the Republicans will insist on following the practice that  Senators have followed for more than 200 years, and that is not to have  a partisan filibuster for somebody going to the Supreme Court. We don't  conduct partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees, and we  certainly are not going to start with this highly qualified nominee.   I hope those that think back 16 or 17 years--when this meeting of  Democrats in retreat came to the conclusion that you had to break new  ground--realize that they have poisoned the well of the comity  traditional of the Senate. I think maybe a lot of them realize that was  a mistake, as we realized that was a mistake, and it would be nice to  get back to the comity of the Senate that existed on judges prior to 15  or 16 years ago. But that is going to take people on their side who  were present at that same retreat who are still in the U.S. Senate to  drill a new well, because the present one is poisoned, and we need to  get back to the comity that we have had.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, millions of Americans and thousands of  Iowans annually fall victim to senseless acts of crime. In their honor  and in honor of the thousands of advocates, first responders, crisis  hotline volunteers, and others who work tirelessly on their behalf, I  introduced a resolution to commemorate National Crime Victims' Rights  Week.   I thank Senators Leahy, Crapo, and Feinstein for joining me as  cosponsors of this important resolution. In 2017, National Crime  Victims' Rights Week takes place from April 2 through April 8. We have  commemorated the week every April since 1981.   Here in Washington, DC, and across the Nation, activities are being  organized to highlight and promote this year's theme: ``Strength.  Resilience. Justice.'' The theme for 2017 recognizes the strength of  individual victims. It highlights the resilience of survivors as well  as the victim assistance organizations who support survivors in their  efforts to heal. And it reflects the importance of securing justice for  crime victims.   During this week, we also highlight the contributions of the crisis  hotline volunteers and staff, victims' rights attorneys, advocates,  sexual assault nurse examiners, police officers, and other emergency  responders who provide critical assistance to survivors of crime in  communities across the United States. On Friday, several of these  individuals will receive awards during a ceremony hosted by the Office  for Victims of Crime at the U.S. Department of Justice. I extend my  gratitude to those award recipients for their work to assist victims of  crime.   Many of us in this Chamber have championed landmark legislation to  enhance the rights of crime victims. For example, I was an original  cosponsor of the 1984 Victims of Crime Act,  [[Page S2360]]  which established the Crime Victims Compensation Fund. I also joined my  colleagues in supporting the 1994 enactment of the Violence Against  Women Act. This landmark legislation enhanced penalties for sex  offenders and made hundreds of millions of dollars available for  activities and programs to respond to the needs of domestic violence  survivors.   The Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has continued to make the  protection of victims' rights a top priority. Two years ago, we  approved the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which makes new  resources available to help survivors of human trafficking. We also  approved the Survivors' Bill of Rights, which establishes new rights  for survivors of federal crimes of sexual violence. We cleared the  Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which enhances crime survivors'  ability to seek restitution and improves victims' access to legal  services. And we approved the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes  Reauthorization Act of 2016.   Supporting and protecting victims of crime will again be an important  priority this year in the Judiciary Committee. Last week, I convened a  hearing to examine allegations that dozens of young athletes  experienced sexual abuse at the hands of coaches, instructors, and  others.   Senators Feinstein, Collins, and I also recently introduced a bill,  the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, to ensure that  sexual assault allegations by young athletes will be reported and  investigated promptly. This year, we also will make it a priority to  extend and update programs authorized under the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act.   In closing, crime victims and survivors in the United States deserve  our assistance in helping them cope with the often devastating  consequences of crime. That is why it is so important that we support  the mission of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this important  resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I was going to ask unanimous consent to  that extent. I guess you have already announced that it is in place; is  that right? I am going to add something to what the Acting President  pro tempore just said, so let me start over again.   I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10:45 a.m. be equally  divided between Senator Feinstein or her designee and myself or my  designee and that the time from 10:45 a.m. to 11 o'clock be reserved  for Senator Schumer's leader remarks.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.   The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, I was going to ask unanimous consent to  that extent. I guess you have already announced that it is in place; is  that right? I am going to add something to what the Acting President  pro tempore just said, so let me start over again.   I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10:45 a.m. be equally  divided between Senator Feinstein or her designee and myself or my  designee and that the time from 10:45 a.m. to 11 o'clock be reserved  for Senator Schumer's leader remarks.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.   The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, that is what my unanimous consent  request said.    Mr. President, that is what my unanimous consent  request said.    I will probably need more than 9 minutes, but I will  put the rest of my statement in the Record.    Mr. President, within the next hour or so, we will  learn whether the minority will come to their senses or whether they  will engage in the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  nominee. All indications are that they are committed to their course.  That is unfortunate. It truly is.   The question one has to ask is this: What, exactly, is so  objectionable about this nominee that he should be subjected to the  first partisan filibuster in U.S. history? Is he, really, not well  qualified?   He attended Columbia for his bachelor's, Harvard for law school,  Oxford for his doctorate. He clerked for not one--but two--Supreme  Court Justices. He has spent over 10 years on the circuit court and has  heard 2,700 cases. It is clear, then, that he is extremely well  qualified.   So what is it? What makes this nominee so objectionable?   The truth is, throughout this process, the minority, led by their  leader, has  [[Page S2386]]  been desperately searching for a justification for their preplanned  filibuster. Over the course of the last couple of months, they have  trotted out one excuse after another, but nothing will stick.   They said he isn't mainstream, but that is not true. Everyone from  Obama's Solicitor General to Rachel Maddow has said he is mainstream.  They said he isn't independent, but everyone knows he is an independent  judge. He is his own man, and he understands the role of a judge.   Then they roll out this ridiculous argument that he is for the big  guy and against the little guy. Even liberal law professors like Noah  Feldman made fun of that attack. He called it ``a truly terrible  idea.'' Then they said we should hold him responsible for the legal  positions he took on behalf of the U.S. Government. The only problem  there is, we have had a lot of nominees who have represented the U.S.  Government. They worked for it; the government was their client. The  other side certainly didn't want to hold Justice Kagan responsible for  taking the truly extreme position as Solicitor General that the U.S.  Government was constitutionally permitted to ban pamphlets. So that  argument fell flat as well.   Then, of course, after they ran out of substantive arguments against  the judge and his record, they resorted to attacks on his supporters or  the President who nominated him or the selection process, anything-- anything--to distract from the judge and the stellar record he has.   They trotted out this absurd claim that we should reject the judge  not because of some opinion he has written but because those who  support his nomination have the gall to actually speak out and make  their voices heard, except they forgot to check with their own  supporters first to make sure none of them are spending so-called dark  money. Of course, they are spending money on issue advocacy, just as  the law permits and the Constitution protects under the First  Amendment.   As we all know, issue advocacy during Supreme Court nominations is  absolutely nothing new. Those who are complaining about issue advocacy  today don't seem to remember the TV ads the far left ran attacking  Judge Bork in 1987. I remember those ads. I remember the ads the left  ran against Justice Thomas as well. Of course, outside groups on the  left have attacked every Republican nominee since.   So expressing selective outrage over issue advocacy doesn't advance  their cause either, but they still keep it up.   Finally, the talking point we have heard repeated most often over the  last 24 hours is that Candidate Trump ``outsourced'' his selection  process to conservative groups. I must say, I find that argument the  oddest of all. It is the kind of thing Justice Scalia would call ``pure  applesauce.''   The President didn't outsource the selection process to conservative  groups. He made his list public for the entire country to review during  the campaign--the first President to do that. If anything, he  outsourced the selection process to whom? The voters--the American  people.   So what do you do? You are out of substantive arguments from the  other side. Even shots fired at the judge's supporters somehow  boomerang back and hit your own advocacy groups. We have seen all of  this before. I have been through a few of these debates over the years.  When a Republican occupies the Oval Office, the nominees may change,  but the attacks remain the same.   You will hear today the same poll-tested catch phrases we have all  heard time and again. You will hear words and phrases like ``outside  the mainstream,'' ``far right,'' and ``extreme.'' Invariably, these are  words the left tries to pin on every nominee of a Republican President  and the people he submits to the Senate. With each nominee, the  playbook on the left seems to be the very same. The nomination process,  it seems, is a desperate attempt to retell the same old preordained  narrative.   As I have said, those of us who have been through a few of these  episodes have heard it all before, and we are going to hear it in the  next few hours again, but this time something is very different. This  time, they intend to use the same old preordained narrative to justify  the first partisan filibuster in the 220-year history of the United  States. Of course, this result was preordained because as the minority  leader said weeks before the President was even sworn into office,  ``it's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose  that would get Republican support that we [Democrats] could support.''   You have already committed to the far left that you will launch the  first partisan filibuster in U.S. history. So you are stuck. You have  to press forward, don't you, even though you know the effort is doomed  to fail. You know he will be confirmed, and you know in your heart of  hearts he deserves to be confirmed. That is why this is an especially  sad state of affairs, and I hope my colleagues will change their minds.   At the end of the day, we are left with an exceptional nominee, with  impeccable credentials and broad bipartisan support. In short, we have  in Judge Gorsuch a nominee who proves without a doubt that the minority  leader would lead a filibuster against anyone nominated by this  President. That is unfortunate because it is not the way it has to be,  but it is a situation we cannot accept.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority whip is recognized.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we are now well on our way to confirming  Judge Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme Court. I have a few  things to say about the way we have gotten here.   Earlier today, the other side--meaning the Democrats--made a very  unprecedented break with Senate history and with Senate tradition. They  launched the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in  our Nation's history. For our part, we Republicans insisted that we  follow the practice of the Senate. We don't engage in partisan  filibusters of Supreme Court nominees.   Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the path that brought  us to this point. As I discussed, way back in 2001, the current  minority leader and some of his allies on the far left hatched a plan  to, in their words, ``change the ground rules'' with regard to lower  court nominees. I noted a New York Times article describing the  Democratic senatorial caucus retreat, where the new approach to  nominees was discussed; in other words, where they discussed the  strategy for changing the ground rules of how judges are considered by  the United States Senate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the May 1, 2001, New York Times article entitled ``Washington talk;  Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight,'' and the April 5, 2017, story  from the Washington Examiner entitled ``The Gorsuch Plagiarism Story is  Bogus.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the New York Times, May 1, 2001]           Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight                             (By Neil A. Lewis)         President Bush has yet to make his first nominee to a       federal court and no one knows whether anyone will retire       from the Supreme Court this summer, an event that would lead       to a high-stakes confirmation battle.  [[Page S2407]]         Nonetheless, the Senate's Democrats and Republicans are       already engaged in close-quarters combat over how to deal       with the eventual nominees from the Bush White House.       Democrats in particular are trying to show some muscle as       they insist that they will not simply stand aside and confirm       any nominees they deem right-wing ideologues.        ``What we're trying to do is set the stage and make sure       that both the White House and the Senate Republicans know       that we expect to have significant input in the process,''       Senator Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior Democrat, said       in an interview. ``We're simply not going to roll over.''        Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private       retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal       topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the       White House on judicial nominees.        The senators listened to a panel composed of Prof. Laurence       H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Prof. Cass M. Sunstein of the       University of Chicago Law School and Marcia R. Greenberger,       the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the       need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.       The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that       the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they       said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr. Bush was       planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.        ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the       ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone       just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who       attended said.        Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,       then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday       morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any       Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who       spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because       some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two       Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the       nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney general.        Senators Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph R.       Biden Jr. of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft       selection, impeding the early campaign against the       nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted       against the nomination.        The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom       that Republicans are considering changing, which governs       whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home       state. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee       have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy''       that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip       with the committee.        On Friday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking       Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. Schumer sent a       letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats       insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially       given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the       Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick       Cheney is able to break any tie.        Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,       told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration       will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they       should expect to name judges from their state.''        Mr. Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the       process but, in the end, would not block any significant       number of nominees.        Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of       the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13       circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some       of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench       is shaped in the next four or eight years, scholars say,       could have a profound effect on issues like affirmative       action, abortion rights and the lengths to which the       government may go in aiding parochial schools.        Mr. Bush is expected to announce his first batch of       judicial nominees in the next several days, and it is likely       to include several staunch conservatives as well as some       women and members of minorities, administration officials       have said. Among those Mr. Bush may put forward to important       federal appeals court positions are such conservatives as       Jeffrey S. Sutton, Peter D. Keisler, Representative       Christopher Cox of California and Miguel Estrada.        The first group of nominees, which may number more than two       dozen, is part of an effort to fill the 94 vacancies on the       federal bench while the Republicans still control the Senate.        But it remains unclear if there will be a Supreme Court       vacancy at the end of the court's term in July. Speculation       on possible retirements has focused on Chief Justice William       H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul       Stevens. But in recent days, associates of Justice O'Connor       have signaled that she wants it known that she will not       retire after this term.                                   ____                 [From the Washington Examiner, Apr. 5, 2017]                   That Gorsuch Plagiarism Story Is Bogus                            (By T. Becket Adams)         Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is not a plagiarist,       according to the woman from whom he has been accused of       lifting materials.        ``I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue       here; even though the language is similar. These passages are       factual, not analytical in nature, ``Abigail Lawlis Kuzma,       who serves as chief counsel to the Consumer Protection       Division of the Indiana Attorney General's office, said in a       statement made available to the Washington Examiner.        Her remarks came soon after two reports alleged Tuesday       evening that President Trump's Supreme Court nominee had       ``copied' passages in his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted       Suicide and Euthanasia.'' The reports alleged he also lifted       material for an academic article published in 2000.        The charge, which involves Gorsuch repeating medical terms       and not original concepts or ideas, is weak, at best.        ``[The similar] passage are factual, not analytical in       nature, framing both the technical legal and medical       circumstances of the `Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in       1982,'' Kuzma explained. ``Given that these passages both       describe the basic facts of the case, it would have been       awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used       different language.''        BuzzFeed was first to report on the similarities between       Gorsuch and Kuzma. It published a story Tuesday headlined,       ``A Short Section in Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be       Copied From A Law Review Article.        Politico followed suit publishing a story titled,       ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.''        Other newsrooms, including the Huffington Post, Business       Insider and New York magazine, moved quickly to repeat the       charges against Gorsuch.        Politico bolstered its charge with quotes from multiple       academic experts, including Syracuse University's Rebecca       Moore Howard, who, interestingly enough, is quite open about       supporting former President Barack Obama.        However, several professors who worked closely with Gorsuch       during the period in which he produced much of the work in       question said the hints and allegations against the judge are       nonsense.        ``[I]n my opinion, none of the allegations has any       substance or justification,'' Oxford University's John Finnis       said in a statement made available to the Examiner. ``In all       four cases, Neil Gorsuch's writing and citing was easily and       well within the proper and accepted standards of scholarly       research and writing in the field of study in which he was       working.''        Georgetown University's John Keown, who reviewed Gorsuch's       dissertation, said elsewhere in a statement: ``The allegation       is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its       citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is       guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary       sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly,       absurd.        Indeed, the book's reliance on primary rather than       secondary sources is one of its many strengths.''        Further, actual attorneys disagree that Gorsuch plagiarized       anything.        ``People unfamiliar with legal writing, or even writing,       may be unfamiliar with how citations work,'' Attorney Thomas       Crown explained Wednesday.'' When I cite to a case or       statute, if I am quoting verbatim, I give a direct quotation,       with apostrophes and everything, and then the source. If I am       summarizing, sometimes even using the same words, I follow       with the direct citation. The Bluebook, which is the legal       style Bible, is for law reviews and some appellate and trial       courts, and has more specific rules.        ``I mention this because this is standard across numerous       fields, not just law, and only illiterates . . . are       shocked,'' he added. ``Different field with different       standards and forms; but even most academics believe that a       good synopsis with citation isn't plagiarism.''        In conclusion, he wrote, ``I don't want to ruin a perfectly       good five-minute hate, but this isn't even close to       plagiarism.''     After a brief time in the majority, Senate Democrats  were back in the minority in 2003--so approximately 2 years after they  had this strategy. It was at that time the Senate Democrats began an  unprecedented and systemic filibuster of President George W. Bush's  circuit court nominees.   Then the tables turned. President Obama was elected, and Republicans  held the Senate minority. At that time, even though many of us did not  like the idea of using the filibuster on judicial nominees, we also  recognized that we could not have two sets of rules--one for Republican  Presidents and one for Democratic Presidents.   Our party defeated two nominees for the lower courts by filibuster  and denied cloture to three of President Obama's nominees to the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals. But the other side did not appreciate being  subject to the rules that they first established and started using in  2003 to filibuster judges. So at that point, in 2013, they decided to  change the rules of the Senate.   By the way, they changed the rules by breaking the rules. I say that  because the rules of the Senate say it takes a two-thirds vote to  change the  [[Page S2408]]  rules of the Senate, but they changed it by a majority vote. Now at  that time, as we all know, Majority Leader Reid changed the rules for  all Cabinet nominations and lower court nominees. To say that my  colleagues and I were disappointed is a gross understatement.   The majority claimed that they left intact the filibuster for Supreme  Court nominees. But my view back in 2013, when they did that, was that  the distinction Majority Leader Reid drew between lower court nominees  and Supreme Court nominees was not a meaningful one. My view, in 2013,  was that Majority Leader Reid had effectively eliminated the filibuster  for both lower court nominees and the Supreme Court.   Here is the reason. There are two circumstances where this issue  might conceivably arise: either you have a Democrat in the White House  and a Democrat-controlled Senate or you have a Republican in the White  House and a Republican-led Senate.   In the first, there was a Democrat in the White House and the party  led by Leader Reid and Leader-in-Waiting Schumer was in the majority.  If for some extraordinary reason Senate Republicans chose to filibuster  the nominee, there is no question that a Majority Leader Reid or a  Majority Leader Schumer would change the rules.   Now, I do not believe that this particular circumstance would ever  arise, because our side does not believe in filibustering Supreme Court  nominees. I have never voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, not  once. I think I have a pretty good sense of the rest of our caucus. Our  side just does not believe in it. It is not much more complicated than  that simple commonsense statement I just made.   Of course, even if for some extraordinary reason our side did choose  to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, we do not have to speculate as  to whether the other side would have changed the precedent with respect  to the Supreme Court. Last year, when everyone thought that Secretary  Clinton was going to win the election, their own Vice-Presidential  candidate said that they would change the rules if they needed to if we  had a Republican filibuster.   Then, of course, the other circumstance where this issue would arise  is what we have seen this very day--a Republican in the White House and  a Republican-controlled Senate. We saw this very day that the minority  was willing to take that last step and engage in the first partisan  filibuster in U.S. history.   As I have repeatedly discussed, because they were willing to do it  with a nominee as well-qualified as Judge Gorsuch, it proved, without a  shadow of a doubt, that they would filibuster any one submitted by this  Republican President. That is why, on the day that Majority Leader Reid  took that unprecedented action in 2013 to break the Senate rules to  change the Senate rules, I spoke on the floor.   I concluded my remarks this way. So I want to quote myself:         So the majority has chosen to take us down this path. The       silver lining is that there will come a day when the rolls       are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely       nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees       with 51 votes, regardless of whether the Democrats actually       buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the       filibuster on the lower court nominees and still preserve it       for the Supreme Court nominees.    That is what I said when Reid took that extraordinary step. So though  I am extremely pleased that we will confirm such an exceptional nominee  to the Supreme Court in the next day or so, I am, of course,  disappointed with what we were forced to do to get it done. Sadly, I  cannot say I am surprised. I think my surprise, or the fact that I  can't be surprised--you can tell it from what I said back there, what I  just quoted from the 2013 speech that I gave.   I knew when Majority Leader Reid did it in 2013 that this is where we  were headed. That is where we ended earlier this afternoon. But the  bottom line is that you cannot have two sets of rules. You cannot  clothe yourself in the tradition of a filibuster while simultaneously  conducting the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  nominee in history. You cannot demand a rules change only when it suits  the Democratic Members of this body.   You just can't have it both ways. You can't use the Senate rules as  both a shield and a sword. But I must say, the one thing that does not  disappoint me is this: The nominee to take Justice Scalia's seat is  eminently qualified. He will apply the law faithfully without respect  to persons. He is a judge's judge. Come some time tomorrow, we will all  start calling him Justice Gorsuch.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to fellow  Iowan Judge Edward ``Nick'' McManus.   Judge McManus died earlier this month at the age of 97.   He has a long and deep history in Iowa politics and judicial  activities.   When I first entered the State legislature, Judge McManus was known  as Lieutenant Governor McManus. He also served in the Iowa Senate.   In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed him chief judge of the  Northern District of Iowa where he served for 23 years when he took  senior status. His ascension to this position made him the first  native-born Iowan appointed to the Federal Northern District Court of  Iowa. He remained on the bench for a total of 55 years and was still  taking cases at the time of his death.   He was proud of his service on the court and the modernization of the  court he started in 1962.   Upon Judge McManus's death, current acting U.S. Attorney Sean Berry  told the Cedar Rapids Gazette, ``The changes implemented by Judge  McManus left an indelible and positive impact on the efficient  administration of justice for all litigants in the federal court.''   He took great pride that the only time he had a backlog of cases was  the first 100 that were there when he took the job. He took very  seriously the Bill of Rights Sixth Amendment where it says ``the  accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.''   His longtime assistant, Deb Frank, may have said it best, ``I know he  loved to work. He loved what he was doing. I think it's just the whole  idea of coming to the office every day and doing what needed to be  done.''   Barbara and I send our sincerest condolences to Judge McManus's five  sons, two step-sons, other family members, and friends.   He served our State and our country with great distinction and will  be missed.                            ____________________
