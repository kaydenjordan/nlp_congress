 Madam Speaker, extreme Republicans are driving our  economy toward a devastating default. They are holding the economy  hostage.   Holding our economy hostage hurts all Americans, especially  communities of color and low-income communities.   Republicans don't want to close loopholes for billionaires. Instead,  their ransom demands are that we kick families out of their homes, that  we rip away food assistance from grandma and grandpa, from women,  infants, and children, that we cut access to childcare and make it  easier for industries to pollute our communities.   Democrats are united. We agree that America must pay its bills and  continue to lower costs for working families, not default. Republicans  must stop these dangerous games and come back to work.                            ____________________
