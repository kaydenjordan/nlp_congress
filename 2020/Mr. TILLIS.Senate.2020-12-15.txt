 Mr. President, I am here today to honor the life of  Officer Tyler Herndon, a member of the Mount Holly Police Department in  North Carolina, not far from where I live. He tragically lost his life  in the line of duty last week, just days before his 26th birthday.  [[Page S7481]]    Officer Herndon will be laid to rest today, and I want to take a  moment to honor his life, his service to his community, and speak about  the noble profession he chose.   Officer Herndon was responding to a report of a break-in on Friday  morning, and upon his arrival, he was murdered on the scene. He had  been a police officer at Mount Holly for less than 2 years. He is  described by his colleagues on the Mount Holly Police Department as  ``the guy you just couldn't help but like.'' He was active in his  community, not only as a law enforcement officer but as a volunteer in  local schools. His goal was to become an FBI officer, and he was just  approaching the 2 years he needed as a police officer to become  eligible to apply for the FBI.   Officer Herndon's life and promising career were senselessly taken  away. His tragic death is a reminder of the dangers our men and women  in blue face every single day that they go to work to protect our  communities.   In 2020, this year, we have lost 47 police officers who have been  killed in the line of duty across the United States. Of those, 8 were  ambushed in premeditated attacks, 2 were victims of an unprovoked  attack, and 37 officers were killed in the line of duty. These gruesome  killings are in addition to the hundreds of officers who have been shot  and injured this year.   These 47 Americans are not only law enforcement officers--they are  somebody's parent; they are someone's spouse; they are someone's child.  That is a point that has unfortunately been neglected by some,  especially given the shameful effort to not only minimize the work of  law enforcement but to also demonize it.   Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to keep us safe  every single day. Our debates in Congress should not be about whether  to defund or abolish the police; they should be about how we can  respect and support law enforcement through greater investments and  commonsense reforms.   I will never turn my back on the brave men and women of law  enforcement who protect North Carolina and protect communities across  this great Nation.   Congress needs to start showing more support and respect for law  enforcement, not only through our words but through our actions, and we  must hold violent criminals who target them accountable. That is why I  and several other Senate colleagues have introduced the Protect and  Serve Act. It is legislation that would create Federal penalties for  individuals who deliberately target local, State, and Federal law  enforcement officers with violence.   Next Congress, I plan to reintroduce this legislation and work to  build support until its passage because, with increased penalties like  those proposed in the Protect and Serve Act, criminals may start  thinking twice before targeting an officer, and if they choose to do  it, they are going to regret it.   There is no doubt that being a law enforcement officer is one of the  hardest and most dangerous jobs in this country, but it is also one of  the most noble and honorable professions. They run to danger to protect  others. They are fully aware of those dangers as they go through the  police academy and begin their career as officers. Yet they do it every  single day.   Tyler Herndon is an officer who answered the call, ran into danger to  protect others, and lost his life. My thoughts and prayers are with  Officer Herndon's family, the Mount Holly Police Department, and the  community he served. I want Tyler Herndon's family and law enforcement  across the State of North Carolina to know that we will never forget  the sacrifice he made and they make every day and that we are going to  work hard to get them the respect and the resources they deserve.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 4 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
