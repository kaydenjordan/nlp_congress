 Mr. Speaker, every day, millions of Americans  from every corner of our Nation get up early in the morning, leave  their families, go off to work. They work hard to support themselves  and their families. Many of them work two or more jobs at a time. Some  come home very late, miss seeing their kids go to bed. These are folks,  again, in every part of the Nation who don't ask much from their  government. The only thing that they ask is that we live in a country  where there is opportunity to pursue their American Dreams.   That means different things for different people. Some kids dream of  growing up and being a teacher, an engineer, a lawyer, a firefighter,  many things. As parents, we want to see our kids succeed, to live in a  nation that remains the preeminent Nation of opportunity around the  world.   Unfortunately, over the last 6 months, the policies pursued by this  administration are endangering the United States' infrastructure of  opportunity, endangering our position in the world. Today we are going  to have an opportunity to talk about some of those policies that are  harmful to America now and America in the future.   President Trump's proposals on the budget, for example, would hurt  the creation of jobs, the ability of people to get healthcare, would be  bad for the environment, would do so much harm in so many ways. So I am  honored tonight to be with three of my colleagues, all of us from  different parts of the country: Myself from Texas, the congresswoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the congresswoman from Washington State  (Ms. Jayapal), and the congresswoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).   First I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Congresswoman Gwen  Moore, because I know that she has some very strong opinions and  perspectives on healthcare.    This week, I thought it was astounding, in the  course of less than 24 hours, the Senate was unable to pass a  healthcare bill. The President had promised for months that there would  be a new healthcare bill to replace so-called ObamaCare. That failed in  the Senate. And then the strategy after that became: Well, we are just  going to repeal this, and we are going to give ourselves 2 years to  come up with a replacement.   That failed today, and I think it failed for good reasons, because  that would be disastrous for the American people; 32 million people  would be dropped from the healthcare rolls if all you did was repeal.   So what were you hearing in this whole debate in Wisconsin from your  constituents and your voters up there?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I represent the State of Florida. I want to  thank my colleagues for bringing up this extremely important  conversation about the, at least, 23 million people who would have lost  healthcare coverage if the ``Not Very Affordable Care Act'' that the  Republicans envisioned would have passed.   If I were the President of the United States, I might want to revise  my definition of winning, because I think that we have a leader in the  White House who repeatedly said that America would get so tired of  winning, once he became President, that we wouldn't know what to do  with ourselves.   Well, if killing their horrific healthcare bill and making sure that  we can maintain healthcare as a right and not return it to the  privilege that it once was for only people who could afford it, then I  will take that kind of winning, because we did win on behalf of the  American people, but we know that this is not the last trick up their  sleeve.   The gentlewoman from Wisconsin mentioned the huge cuts to Medicaid in  this terrible piece of legislation, and the gentleman from Texas  mentioned the 64 percent of seniors in nursing homes who are there  because they are on Medicaid.   I represent the State of Florida, Mr. Speaker, and in the State of  Florida, we have the highest percentage of senior citizens as a  proportion of our population in the country. This is just one example  of a very vulnerable population, and this is an example of a population  that our friends on the other side of the aisle were willing to just  write off and leave twisting in the wind.   What would happen if this bill became law is we would go back to the  days before Medicare and before Medicaid, in which you had families go  bankrupt trying to take care of the ever-increasing healthcare needs of  their most elderly family members, and it is just absolutely  unacceptable.    And, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, in the  1990s, my grandmother was in her eighties. In 1993, she went into a  nursing home and stayed there for about 3 years until she passed away.  My grandmother suffered most of her life from type 2 diabetes, and  before the end of her life, she had to have one of her legs amputated,  and finally succumbed to congenital heart failure, but there is no way  that my family, my mom, would have been able to afford to pay for 3  years of a nursing home stay but for the effect of this program.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I, too, had a very similar experience. My  mother-in-law suddenly had a stroke when she was 58 years old, and she  was cut down in her prime, also suffered from diabetes, and spent 3  years really in a very debilitated condition. She had to spend down  essentially all of her assets to be able to qualify for Medicaid,  because the only way that she could get care in a nursing home and be  able to afford to get quality care in a nursing home was through  Medicaid. She did also eventually die after 3 years in a nursing home,  but I can't even imagine having to try to find a way to pay for her  care if it were not for Medicaid.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin.    And, by the way, Congresswoman Moore, that is  why a lot of people were referring to these cuts as cruel. I mean, it  really is cruel.    That is right. You bring up a great point, and  then I want to talk real quick about the budget.   There is this underlying tone from the President and from other  politicians that some of the folks who are on Medicaid are somehow  undeserving, that they are somehow freeloading, and that is just not  the case. It is a complete misunderstanding of who these Americans are.   We talk about how healthcare failed. It seems like the President  promised healthcare, but it didn't happen.   One of the things that they wanted to do before healthcare, which  hasn't happened either, was tax reform. That is going to be very  difficult, especially when one of the foundations of your new tax plan  is giving a tax cut to the wealthiest folks, literally who need it the  least, but it raises a question of the budget and what the budget does  for the American people.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I would be happy to. I am a member of the  Budget Committee, and we are actually going to mark up the Republicans'  budget tomorrow in that committee. Really, with all due respect, Mr.  Speaker, to the ``Commander in Tweet,'' President Trump's budget that  he proposed in May certainly did not put either families or taxpayers  first--far from it.   In fact, the budget that both he proposed and that we will mark up  tomorrow put Americans and taxpayers dead last, right behind polluters,  industry lobbyists, and climate change deniers. And like too many of  our Republican colleagues' spending priorities, this budget, this  Republican budget, is actually a brutal attack on America's families.   We all know that it fails to deliver on investments in jobs, in  infrastructure, and in education, but, my friends, nowhere is the  damage to American families as stark as when it comes to our  environment.   The Trump budget, the Republican budget that we will mark up  tomorrow, will irreparably damage our air, our water, and our climate.  The President has already managed to undermine America's position as a  global leader in clean energy frontiers by withdrawing America from the  Paris climate accord, for example. And like many of his tweets,  President Trump's climate science policies are a rejection of reality,  and a cynical embrace of falsehood and fantasy.   Ms. Jayapal represents a State that is on a coast, I represent a  State that is on a coast, Ms. Moore represents a State that is on the  Great Lakes. Sea levels are rising. Our water levels are rising, Mr.  Speaker. Property appraisers and insurance companies in south Florida  are already factoring this reality into their home value assessments.  King tides are bringing fish into the streets of south Florida.   President Trump's climate change solution is not the Paris climate  accord, it is not making sure that we make investments in alternative  energy. Let me show you what President Trump's solution to sea level  rise and climate change is. His solution is to throw people a life  vest, and they can sink or swim. Folks like the people in my district,  who have invested most of their savings, like so many people, into  their home, a life vest and being told that they can just deal with it  is unacceptable.   We have to come together and come up with solutions to make sure that  we can fight sea level rise and climate change, to make sure we can  keep our drinking water clean, to make sure we make the kinds of  investments so that we can protect the air we breathe. We have cities  like Flint, Michigan, that have dealt with lead in their water and  children being poisoned for years.   To my colleagues, this is something that is an existential threat,  that if we don't make the kinds of investments that we must, then we  are going to be in a world of hurt, and it is not at some distant point  in the future. There was an article in the Miami Herald yesterday, Mr.  Speaker, that referenced that my children's generation may not be able  to live in my own district. That is absolutely unbelievable.   I am actually thinking of sponsoring an appropriation. Rather than  making sure that we can invest in moving away from fossil fuels, maybe  we will just invest in more life vests, President Trump's solution to  global warming and climate change and sea level rise, and just issue  everybody one of these, and we are good to go.    Congresswoman, you bring up a great point, and  you focused on the environment there and how the President's budget  proposal and the majority's budget proposal is damaging to the  environment.   I think about a series that I saw yesterday in Texas. The Texas  Tribune is an online publication, but it is kind of like the State  newspaper, and they did a series called ``A Pass to Poison.'' And in  the series, they noted that in 2016, I believe, there were about 3,700  incidents of air pollution in Texas, and the regulating agency in  Texas, which is TCEQ, only gave out fines for 20 of those incidents.   So you talk about breathing harmful air. I can't help but think what  will happen if these cuts that are being proposed under this budgetary  situation go through, are we going to have 5,000 incidents now, and you  are still only going to fine 20 people?   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I just came from the Appropriations Committee  markup on the Interior legislation, and a large part of that  committee's work relates to the environment.   In my district, which is ground zero for sea level rise, Broward  County recently ordered the drawing of new flood maps because of  anticipated higher water levels. The city of Fort Lauderdale has  already increased the height requirement for seawalls and raised the  elevation of home sites. Miami Beach's climate plan involves building  elevated roads and installing pumps to keep out saltwater.                                time  1845    So the President's and the Republican's--our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle--solution for sea level rise is basically sink or  swim. Here is the President's coastal flood mitigation plan. We have  got the sea level rise plan and the coastal flood mitigation plan. Take  your pick. At some point, we are probably going to have to give people  both because we literally have to slosh around in galoshes when you are  walking down the street in south Florida because of how bad the king  tides are and how bad the streets flood in a normal rain.   But, God forbid, we should invest in infrastructure. And I know the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), when she was in the State  senate, was a significant leader on investing in infrastructure, which  is absolutely critical to making sure that we can keep people safe and  that we can make sure that we can create jobs. That is something that  this President and the Republicans have talked a whole lot about.   We are 178 days into this President's term, and we haven't passed a  single piece of legislation related to infrastructure investment. And I  think he actually promised to think big, because supposedly Democrats  weren't thinking big enough; and that he was going to propose a $1  trillion infrastructure plan. I am hearing crickets. I am still waiting  for that plan.    Mr. Speaker, when Americans think about their  main concerns--I have a bread and butter district where people are  thinking foremost about their work. They want to make sure that they  can support themselves and their family members, but there hasn't been  much in the way of anything from the White House to create jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Would the gentlewoman be surprised that last  night in the Appropriations Committee, we marked up the T-HUD bill--the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill? And for all the  talk about making it in America and investing in infrastructure and  transportation and making sure that we can create jobs through those  vehicles, will the gentlewoman be surprised that the Republican  majority actually zeroed out TIGER grants?   Those are the transportation grants that go directly to projects in  communities across this country, to help move people around through  people movers and investments in roads and bridges.   In my district, a TIGER grant was granted last year for complete  streets because we have the highest number of pedestrians and  bicyclists killed in the country, unfortunately, in Broward County.   So would the gentlewoman be surprised to learn the so-called big  commitment to creating jobs and investing in infrastructure actually  resulted in massive cuts in the very legislation where we would be  investing those resources and infrastructure?     I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    I hear you. I wanted to give Congresswoman  Wasserman Schultz the last word.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I just wanted to, again, place these items on  the table and demonstrate the grave impact that will take its toll on  the American people if the cuts that have been proposed by the Trump  administration and the Republican majority go through. And we will  stand together fighting every step of the way to make sure that-- instead of galoshes, a life vest, and a surgical mask that we see so  many citizens of other countries have to walk around their streets  using because their air quality is so poor, we will stand together to  continue to fight to make the kind of investments that will help  improve, not detract, from people's quality of life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 19, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
