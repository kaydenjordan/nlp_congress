 Mr. Speaker, we have, right now, a situation where the  President is visiting the border.   In my line of work, as a young lieutenant, I flew along the border  and knew that there was a problem in the early 1990s. As a matter of  fact, in the mid-1990s, as a forward air controller, we had to stop  operations at nighttime as vans bouncing around in the middle of our  operations made us cease fire so we could chase illegal immigrants out  of our firing ranges. Then, as an emergency medicine doctor, I treated  patients who came here illegally.   Most people don't realize the consequence of our actions, of our poor  border security, and what it has done. We understand the numbers. We  understand the millions that are coming across the border, 4 million  since we have had a new President, but not the downwind consequences  when you provide laws that encourage bad behavior and punish good  behavior.  [[Page H118]]    One of the things that most people don't realize is that when you go  to the emergency room and are waiting in line behind a lot of people  who came here illegally, you are not only waiting in line behind them  but you are also paying for their bills. Many people are coming across  the border to receive treatment for their chronic illnesses that cost  millions of dollars per year, and those are several patients per  hospital. We are talking about billions, even tens of billions of  dollars, spent on people who come here illegally. It comes from  taxpayer money, both out of your pocket and through your taxation,  which adds to our debt, which, of course, is going to be paid for by  our children.    To make it worse, we punish those people who come here the right way.  In my district, we have a huge immigrant population, people who come  here from all over the world, whether it be India, Europe, South  America, and they have to wait in line with a glutted immigration  policy that makes it very difficult for them to follow the law.  Meanwhile, we reward those people who break the law.   I think we need to change our laws. I think we need to make it more  streamlined for people who follow the law, who are good citizens, who  paid their taxes, who have jobs, who create jobs, and make it more  difficult for people who break laws.   I think, right now, when you talk about the overwhelming number of  people coming across the border, and when you have the President go  down there and have the borders cleaned up so he can view something  that doesn't really exist, which is a problem where we don't protect  our sovereign border, which is one of the President's main  responsibilities; where you have people's property violated; where you  have people's rights violated; where you have crimes.   Of course, as an emergency medicine physician, this last year I lost  four patients who came in from fentanyl overdoses that I was not able  to revive. Now, almost every single night, I do revive somebody, so it  is something I literally witness almost every single shift, usually  several times per shift.   The opioid crisis is real, and it is something that is killing over  100,000 Americans per year. Every year, we are setting a new record,  and we have done nothing of consequence to really stem that tide.   I think it is with the greatest earnest appeal to my fellow  Republicans and Democrats that we watch after our own house. It is okay  to be compassionate. It is okay to reach out and help people, but we  have to do it the right way.   Most importantly, we have to make laws that encourage good behavior,  that people coming here are rewarded for following the laws. They are  rewarded with citizenship when they do the right thing, and we are  punishing people who come here with ill intent.   Finally, I would like to point out that we are experiencing diseases  here in America we haven't seen in decades. Where is it coming from? It  is because we don't have good screening procedures.   It used to be, to come to America, you couldn't even come here if you  had glaucoma. Now you can come here with every kind of disease process  there is, and we will never even know that you are even here.   If you look at the terrorists coming across the border--we know that  we have at least nine terrorists we have caught in the last month, but  we don't know how many got away. It is because we have poor border  security.   So, it is not just for one thing; it is for many things that we need  to secure our border, make sure that we are a sovereign Nation, and  follow the law.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of those who  defend the unborn.   I join my esteemed colleague,   Mike Johnson, in calling out against  violence. Not all of us believe in the Bible, but those who do  understand that there are over 100 references to a child before it is  born.   For those of us who believe that the child is in existence and  recognized by God before they are born, wouldn't it be immoral of those  people to not stand up for what they believe is life?   Therefore, I call on all those people who respect those beliefs and  respect the Bible, respect their God, that we defend those people in  making sure that we don't have violence, and we call out, as a united  body, both Democrats and Republicans, to protect those who stand for  what is right.                            ____________________
