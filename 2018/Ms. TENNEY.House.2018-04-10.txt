 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Antonio Pagliaro.  Antonio recently lost his battle to cancer, leaving behind his wife,  Nicole, their children, Alexis, Antonio, and Kylie, as well as his  parents, Tony and Richetta, and his brothers, Peter and Michael  Pagliaro.   As a graduate of the T.R. Proctor High School class of 1999, Antonio  began his professional destiny and purpose in life to help people in  need by serving in the emergency medical services industry. His passion  was to provide critical help and comfort to those in need, especially  in his hometown in the city of Utica, New York.   Antonio was a paramedic supervisor with Kunkel Ambulance for 15  years. He was also a 10-year volunteer with the Schuyler Volunteer Fire  Department.   Antonio was a courageous public servant who served our community  selflessly. He put his life on the line every single day for the  betterment of all of us.   Along with being a dedicated public servant, Antonio was a passionate  cook, number one dance dad, a gardener, and a parishioner of the Church  of Our Lady of Lourdes, and so much more.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Antonio Pagliaro, a true  hometown hero. Our community is lucky to have had such a selfless,  loving person as Antonio, and we wish his family prayers and positive  thoughts to the entire family from all of us and my colleagues.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from California  and her hard work on this really important issue.   Taxes are, of course, extremely important in New York State as being  one of the highest taxed States in the Nation, along with California,  an undistinguished honor that we don't want to have.   But I rise today to actually recognize the thousands of hardworking  families across the 22nd District of New York, and throughout upstate,  who have felt the real impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was broken. It was  riddled with loopholes that penalized success and hurt hardworking  families and hardworking taxpayers. Our middle-income families were the  ones who suffered as the economy and wages remained stagnant.   As I traveled from Sandy Creek to Vestal, Little Falls to Cortland, I  heard real stories from families, small-business owners, single  parents, veterans, and seniors detailing the damage of our oppressive  Tax Code. It held our small businesses back, crippled our family farms,  and left our families feeling hopeless and overwhelmed.   That is why we stepped up to the plate, took our constituents'  concerns and stories to Washington, and passed legislation that  reflected the values of fairness and hard work. No longer is our  economy stagnant. No longer will American businesses and families  suffer under an unfair and oppressive Tax Code from Washington.   Here in New York, tax reform has provided once-in-a-generation relief  from the failed status quo, a status quo that was created in part and  mostly by Albany politicians whose seemingly only intent is to tax and  spend, and I dare say, waste our hard-earned money.   Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the typical middle class family of  four in New York's 22nd District, which I represent, will see a tax cut  of $2,439. Imagine what kind of money that could do for a family of  four.   Now, families will have the opportunity and means to save for  college, plan for the future, invest in their retirement, and provide  their children with increased educational opportunities.   Families know how to spend their resources much better than the  Federal Government. That is why we are putting real money back into the  pockets of hardworking families, money they earned, and money they  deserve to keep.    Throughout the debate on tax reform, I, along with my fellow  colleagues from New York, fought an uphill battle to include provisions  facing elimination that are vital to seniors, single parents,  struggling families, and overly burdened job creators.   One of the key provisions that we New Yorkers fought tirelessly to  include is the State and local tax deduction or, as you heard often,  the SALT deduction. I would like to thank Chairman Brady and everyone  on the Ways and Means Committee for understanding the importance of  this deduction and what it means to my constituents. As a result of our  advocacy, nearly all of my constituents in the 22nd District will be  able to continue to claim a SALT deduction.   It is also flexible, which means it can be used for property sales or  income tax, and not just restricted to local tax.   In the 22nd District, 99 percent of itemizers deduct less than  $10,000 in property taxes. This provision will cover the overwhelming  number of property owners who own homes of less than $450,000 in value,  which is a very nice home in my district, a little different than in  the coastal areas and sometimes you will see in the southern tier of  New York.   The reason the SALT deduction matters stems from Albany politicians  who have no regard for the taxpayers they represent. For example, all  eight of the counties that I represent are in the top 36 highest  property tax rates compared to home value nationwide per county.   This bill provides relief on the Federal level, while finally taking  a step to encourage fiscal responsibility from Albany. I have always  put the taxpayers I represent first, and it is long past time for  politicians in Albany to do the same, and we are hoping that this bill  will incentivize them to do that to help our taxpayers.   The benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act do not stop there.  Earlier this year, I heard from Frank Suits. Frank is the president and  CEO of Suit-Kote Corporation, a family owned, multigenerational paving  company in Cortland, New York. Frank wrote to me to share the impact  tax reform has had on his business and nearly 800 employees.   First, in direct response to the new tax law, Suit-Kote announced  plans to match the Federal tax cut and provide its employees with a 2  percent retroactive pay increase and has begun to accelerate 401(k)  contributions for 2018 by 4 months to provide employees additional  funds in their retirement accounts.   Our goal in passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was to deliver this  type of relief to hardworking families like those employed by Suit- Kote, and it was an honor for me to actually go to Suit-Kote and meet  with the employees and hear from them, firsthand, just how great their  benefits were from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   We also heard that NBT Bank, a local bank in my region, with dozens  of locations throughout the 22nd District, has used tax reform to  invest in its employees. NBT decided to raise the starting hourly rate  of pay from $11 to $15 an hour, without a mandate coming from the  government, merely because of the benefits from tax reform. Employees  earning $50,000 or less will receive a permanent minimum increase of 5  percent this year.   Another great little business in my community, fairly new, started by  a young guy, A&P Masters Images, LLC, in Utica, a small printing  business, has hired another full-time graphic designer and is now  weighing the options of putting on an addition to its building in the  city of Utica.   Howard Potter, CEO of A&P Masters, said with everyone's increase in  pay he can already see a morale boost coming from his employees. He  said the end-of-the-year tax relief for businesses will help them  afford to be more aggressive with investing in their growth, to build  or buy, or hire more staff, and buy more equipment.   While these companies are based in the 22nd District, there are  dozens of other companies with branches in my district that are reaping  the benefits of tax reform. For example, CVS is increasing its wages  for hourly employees from $9 to $11 an hour.  [[Page H3088]]    Home Depot, with a location right next to my New Hartford office, is  giving employees a bonus of up to $1,000, with the chairman and CEO of  the company stating it was directly made possible by the tax reform  bill.   Lowe's and Walmart are also giving back to their employees as a  direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. All three of these  corporations have numerous locations across my district and employ  hundreds of hardworking citizens throughout NY's 22nd.   Critics of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have called this law and its  benefits crumbs, or Armageddon, as you famously heard. They have also  called this law a handout to the 1 percent. Time and again, they have  been proven wrong.   Just this past weekend, our very own New York Post declared, and I am  paraphrasing: GOP's tax cut isn't actually a gift to the rich. They  come to that conclusion from an analysis done by the nonpartisan Tax  Policy Center, who found that the top 20 percent of wage earners will  pay 87 percent of all Federal income taxes in 2018, up from 84 percent  last year. Additionally, the analysis found that most families earning  under $50,000 a year will pay almost no Federal income taxes at all,  and many will see a refund.   Mr. Speaker, this does not sound like middle class Armageddon to me.  These benefits certainly do not sound like crumbs. This is money that  can be used to get ahead on car payments, to pay rent, to pay  mortgages, so much more that everyday Americans struggle with in a  tough economy.   Businesses like the ones I mentioned are proof that providing  desperately needed relief from the Federal side for the failed tax-and- spend status quo that we see in New York is the most effective way to  improve the lives of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for her advocacy  on this and for asking us to join.   One added note I would like to say is we found also from the  nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that New York is going to be one of the  gainers. We are actually going to see a growth in our economy and a  growth in jobs, in spite of what Albany may or may not do; but we are  really grateful for that, and I just want to say it is an honor to  support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to advocate for the things in  that bill that helped our district.
