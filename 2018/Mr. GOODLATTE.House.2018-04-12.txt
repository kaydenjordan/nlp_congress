 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 2) proposing a balanced budget amendment to  the Constitution of the United States.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 2         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled   (two-thirds       of each House concurring therein), That the following article       is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United       States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as       part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of       three-fourths of the several States within seven years after       the date of its submission for ratification:                                ``Article --         ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not       exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-      fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall       provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts       by a rollcall vote.        ``Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States       held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-      fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law       for such an increase by a rollcall vote.        ``Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall       transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United       States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays       do not exceed total receipts.        ``Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law       unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each       House by a rollcall vote.        ``Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this       article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is       in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for       any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in       military conflict which causes an imminent and serious       military threat to national security and is so declared by a       joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number       of each House, which becomes law. Any such waiver must       identify and be limited to the specific excess or increase       for that fiscal year made necessary by the identified       military conflict.        ``Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this       article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on       estimates of outlays and receipts.        ``Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of       the United States Government except those derived from       borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the       United States Government except for those for repayment of       debt principal.        ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with       the fifth fiscal year beginning after its ratification.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 2, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   March 2, 1995, was a pivotal day in the history of our country. On  that day, the United States Senate failed by one vote to send a  balanced budget constitutional amendment to the States for  ratification. The amendment had passed the House by the required two- thirds majority, and the Senate vote was the last legislative hurdle  before ratification by the States.   If Congress had listened to the American people and sent that  amendment to the States for ratification, we would not be facing the  fiscal crisis we are today. Rather, balancing the Federal budget would  have been the norm, instead of the exception, over the past 20 years,  and we would have nothing like the annual deficits and skyrocketing  debt we currently face.   In 1995, when the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of  passing, the gross Federal debt stood at $4.9 trillion. Today, it  stands at over $20 trillion. The Federal debt held by the public is  rising as well and is increasing rapidly as a percentage of the  country's economic output. Unlike the past, when the debt spiked to pay  for wars of finite duration and then was reduced gradually after  hostilities ended, more recently, the debt has risen as a result of  having to pay for entitlement programs that are of indefinite duration  and difficult to reduce over time.   As John Cogan of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University wrote:  ``All of the increase in Federal spending relative to GDP over the past  seven decades is attributable to entitlement spending. Since the late  1940s, entitlement claims on the Nation's output of goods and services  have risen from less than 4 percent to 14 percent. Surprising as it may  seem, the share of GDP that is spent on national defense and nondefense  discretionary programs combined is no higher today than it was seven  decades ago.''   As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has observed, such  high and rising debt will have serious negative consequences. Interest  rates will increase considerably, productivity and wages will be lower,  and high debt increases the risk of a financial crisis.   What is particularly troubling is that the debts we are incurring  under entitlement programs will burden multiple future generations.  Indeed, a few years ago, a cross-national study found that the United  States ranked worst among 29 advanced countries in the degree to which  it imposes unfair debt burdens on future generations.   University of Virginia philosophy professor Loren Lomasky has written  that theorists have devoted considerable attention to injustices  committed across lines of race and gender. Far less attended are  concerns of intergenerational fairness. That omission is serious.  Measures that have done very well by the baby boomers are much less  generous to their children and worse still for their grandchildren. The  single greatest unsolved problem of justice in the developed world  today is transgenerational plunder.   It is time for Congress to stop saddling future generations with the  burden of crushing debts to pay for current spending. We should not  pass on to our children and grandchildren the bleak fiscal future that  our unsustainable spending is creating.   The only way to ensure that Congress acts with fiscal restraint over  the longterm is to pass a balanced budget amendment. Experience has  proved time and again that Congress cannot for any significant length  of time rein in excessive spending. Annual deficits and the resulting  debt continue to grow due to political pressures that the  Constitution's structure no longer serves to restrain.   In order for Congress to be able to consistently make the tough  decisions necessary to sustain fiscal responsibility, Congress must  have the external pressure of a balanced budget requirement to force it  to do so. Constitutional principle will prevail where political  promises have not.   The Framers of the Constitution were familiar with the need for  constitutional restrictions on deficit spending. When the Constitution  was ratified, it was the States that had exhibited out-of-control  fiscal mismanagement by issuing bills of credit to effectively print  money to pay for projects and service debt. As a result of that lack of  fiscal discipline, Article I, section 10 of the Constitution  specifically deprives States of the power to issue bills of credit.  Over 200 years later, it is the Federal Government that has proved its  inability to adopt sound fiscal policies, and it is now time to adopt a  constitutional restraint on Federal fiscal mismanagement.   Several versions of the balanced budget amendment have been  introduced this Congress, including two I introduced this Congress, as  I have every Congress for the last decade. H.J. Res. 2, the version we  are debating today, is nearly identical to the text that passed the  House in 1995 and failed in the Senate by one vote. It requires that  total annual outlays not exceed total annual receipts. It also requires  a true majority of each Chamber to pass tax increases and a three- fifths majority to raise the debt limit.  [[Page H3163]]    Today is the day we can turn proposals into legislative action. Our  extraordinary fiscal crisis demands an extraordinary solution. We must  rise above partisanship and join together to send a balanced budget  amendment to the States for ratification.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and  in freeing our children and grandchildren from the burden of a  crippling debt they had no hand in creating so they can be free to  chart their own futures for themselves and for their own posterity.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me quote President Ronald Reagan. In his address to  the Nation on the fiscal year 1983 Federal budget, he said:   ``Only a constitutional amendment will do the job.''   ``With the stick of a balanced budget amendment, we can stop  government squandering, overtaxing ways, and save our economy.''   A few years, later he said this in his weekly radio address:   ``One part of our Founding Fathers' genius was their provision for  amending the Constitution. They knew they had created a good document  but not a perfect one. In fact, even two centuries ago, some of them,  especially Thomas Jefferson, were troubled by one omission: the lack of  a limitation on public borrowing by the Federal Government.''   ``Well, even in their reservations about the Constitution, the  Founding Fathers were perceptive and wise.   ``I think most of you know how badly out of control Federal spending  has gotten in recent years;''--I'm quoting President Reagan in 1980-- ``today the national debt is $2.25 trillion.''   ``. . . I'm one of those Americans who has always believed that a  constitutional amendment mandating that Congress balance the budget is  the answer to what ails us.''   That was 30 years ago. Today the national debt is over $20 trillion,  and President Reagan's words ring 10 times louder as a result.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and  in freeing our children and grandchildren from the burden of a  crippling debt they had no hand in creating so they and their own  children and generations to come can be free to chart their own  futures.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment  to the United States Constitution, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Thank you, Chairman Thompson. I really appreciate your  organizing this Special Order.   I am glad you picked this topic because we need to tell the story of  what the great provisions are in this farm bill, but also how important  it is to Republicans that we work with America's agricultural community  to make sure that we continue to provide the safest, most abundant,  most affordable food supply in the world.   Americans today, right now, enjoy one of the lowest percentages of  their average income being spent on food of any country in the world,  at any time in the world's history. Back when our country was founded,  90 percent of Americans lived on farms and basically produced enough  food to just take care of themselves and then maybe have a little bit  left over to sell to buy some implement for their family. Today, 2  percent of America's farmers do that, provide all of that food and  nutrition, including what goes into these important programs for low- income people. So making sure these programs are protected but also  making sure that they work fairly and honestly is the objective of this  farm bill.   I want to talk tonight about a program that helps get food directly  into the hands of those who are in need in communities throughout the  country, including in Virginia's Sixth Congressional District that I  have had the honor of representing. The Emergency Food Assistance  Program, known as TEFAP, is a Federal program that helps to supplement  the diets of low-income Americans, including elderly people, by  providing them with emergency food assistance at no cost.   TEFAP provides commodities to the States, who then distribute the  food through local agencies, like the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank and  Feeding America Southwest Virginia in my district. This program is a  good model of efficiency and allows State and local organizations to  play a leading role in helping to meet the nutritional needs of those  in their communities.   Food banks are an existing, strong network for food delivery to those  in need. However, it is also important to note that many farmers often  still have excess fruits and vegetables that go to waste. The solution  is to establish a farm-to-food bank program, allowing States to enter  into agreements with farmers to procure this excess for distribution.   To achieve this, we are expanding funding in H.R. 2 for TEFAP, using  a portion of that increase for a farm-to-food bank program, a State- administered agriculture surplus clearance program, that provides an  inexpensive source of food for low-income families while supporting  producers.   I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Chairman Conaway for their hard  work to ensure that TEFAP remains a viable resource for American  families.   Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your hard work and for organizing  this opportunity to share some of the great things in this farm bill  with the American people.
