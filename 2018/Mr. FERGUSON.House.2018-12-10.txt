 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Congressman Mac Collins. Mac represented the good people of  Georgia's Third District, including myself, in this Chamber for a  decade.   He was a real champion for the working men and women of America, and  his life was an example of the American Dream. He started with nothing  and built an amazing business and a wonderful life for his family.   In 1964, Mac enlisted in the Georgia Army National Guard and, like so  many brave men and women before him, he donned the uniform to defend  the freedoms we hold so dear.   From there, Mac went on to serve Georgians at the local and State  level before coming to Washington to represent the Third District of  Georgia.   After this lifetime of service, Mac passed away shortly before  Thanksgiving at the age of 74. As we reflect on Congressman Mac  Collins' life and mourn his passing, let us strive to follow his  example and honor a lifetime of public service.   He lived the scripture, Luke 22:26: ``The greatest among you should  be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.''                            ____________________
