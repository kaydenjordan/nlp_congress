 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Larry Dockins, a Wyomingite who courageously served our  country and who was and remains a beloved hero by all who knew him.   After receiving his GED, Larry made the decision to join the Army  National Guard in 1962, where he began his lifetime career in service  to his country.   Throughout his time in the Army National Guard, he prioritized the  needs of his community and that of his fellow residents. Plowing snow  and hauling hay were just a few of the ways in which Larry was able to  assist those around him.   He was also a proud member of the Command Maintenance Evaluation and  Training team, which sought to solve logistical and equipment-related  issues experienced by National Guard units through assistance and  training. Upon the conclusion of his service, Larry retired as a master  sergeant.   Despite his love for public service, Larry valued family above all  else and cherished every minute he was able to spend with both his  grandkids and great-grandkids.   Larry, sadly, passed away on January 4, 2023. His selfless service  will always be remembered by his family and friends and will leave a  lasting impression on the communities he dedicated his life to  assisting.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in remembering the life of Larry  Dockins, honoring his service to our Nation and standing with his  family in these difficult times.                            ____________________
