 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am going to be joined on the floor  over the next 45 minutes or so by a number of my colleagues to talk  about an exceptional court case that is being heard today in New  Orleans, LA.   This is a court case the Trump administration, along with a number of  Republican attorneys general, has brought to obliterate the Affordable  Care Act, all of it, overnight. The case, if successful, would result  in a humanitarian catastrophe in this country.   Why do I say that? Because the plaintiffs in the case, backed by the  Trump administration, are arguing that the court should throw out the  entire Affordable Care Act, with nothing to replace it, despite the  fact that for almost a decade now, I have listened to this President  and my Republican colleagues in the Congress object to the Affordable  Care Act on the premise that they will have something better to replace  it with--in President Trump's words, a replacement that will insure  more people, at lower cost, with all the protections the Affordable  Care Act has. That plan has not materialized yet because it doesn't  exist. It has never existed. It will never exist.   The choice today is between the Affordable Care Act, which insures  over 20 million Americans, which guarantees that people with  preexisting conditions cannot be discriminated against, and nothing--no  protections, no expansion of Medicaid, no subsidies--for individuals to  buy private insurance.   Right now, with the support of Republicans in Congress, the Trump  administration today is making the argument that the entire Affordable  Care Act should be struck down, with nothing--nothing at all--to  replace it.   This is my friend John from Middletown, CT. I had breakfast with John  last week. That is a picture of John in his younger years. John was 12  years old when he started to have flulike symptoms but was diagnosed-- coincidentally, on the day of the tragedy in Sandy Hook, CT--with a  rare form of soft-tissue cancer in the back of his throat.   The treatment process for John was, in his words, horrendous,  bringing him to as little as 70 pounds for a period of time, rendering  him unable to speak, eat, or drink. He was out of school and in and out  of the hospital for almost 2 years.   Six years later, he can only open his jaw a small fraction of the  normal range of motion; he can only chew foods out of one side of his  mouth; and he has very limited healing ability for any jaw injury.   These issues will never go away for John. He has become an advocate  for the Affordable Care Act because he knows--he knows that if the  Trump administration's lawsuit is successful, his life as he knows it  is over because, once again, insurance companies would deny him  treatment. No insurance company would provide John Carlson with  insurance, knowing his history of cancer, if they were allowed to make  decisions for themselves on who gets coverage and who doesn't. The only  reason John gets coverage is that we have said, through the Affordable  Care Act, we are not going to hold you responsible for your childhood  cancer. We are going to make sure you get insurance no matter what.   These are the stakes right now. These are the stakes for millions of  Americans like John whose lives will be upended if this heartless,  thoughtless, cruel lawsuit proceeds. We should be talking about how to  make the healthcare system better. We should be talking about ways to  lower costs. We shouldn't be talking about going backward with no  safety net.   What if this lawsuit is successful? I haven't heard a single  Republican in the Senate talk about what they would do. I haven't heard  the President talk about what his plan is if his lawsuit is successful.   What happens to John? What are you going to do to make sure he still  gets the treatment he needs? The answer is, you don't know. The answer  is, you are jumping without a net, and you are playing with the lives  of millions of Americans.   John is a remarkable young man also because his eyes were opened when  he was in the hospital. I want to read you his words. He said this to  me a couple of weeks ago, and I asked him to write it down because it  is really remarkable the capacity of young people to see beyond their  own suffering. He said:         I wanted to take this opportunity today to tell one more       story about an experience I had in the hospital during my       cancer treatment. This is a story about a young boy who       received cancer treatment the same time as me. During my       daily physical therapy walks around the childhood cancer       floor, I started to notice a pattern. There was always one       room--directly across from the nurses station--with the same       patient inside. A small  [[Page S4718]]       boy, no older than three years old. I can remember asking my       parents and nurses, ``Why are that baby's parents not with       him?'' I felt so angry that such a tiny child was left alone       and forgotten in a hospital room while going through cancer       treatment. I remember seeing the tiny chemotherapy port       embedded in his head through the glass door.        ``Why would they abandon him like that?'' I asked the nurse       walking with me that day. She explained to me that he had not       been abandoned at all, he was not forgotten nor neglected.       She explained that he was left alone due to pure necessity       and desperation.    This is John talking. He said:         I learned that both of his parents were working day and       night to be able to afford his cancer treatment. Nobody       deserves to go through this alone, especially not a three-      year-old infant. I shared my story so that his story will not       continue to take place in America. I shared my story so that       patients fighting for their life will no longer be taken       advantage of by the hospitals and insurance companies.    What a miracle that this young man, going through his own cancer  treatments, would think of a 3-year-old child who has no parents there  with him because his parents are working multiple jobs in order to  afford the cancer treatments for their son.   Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, 750,000 people in  this country went into bankruptcy because of medical costs. That does  not happen any longer. It doesn't mean our healthcare system is  perfect. It doesn't mean it doesn't need more improvement, but why  would we want to go back to the day in which a family lost everything  simply because their 3-year-old son got cancer? Why would we take this  chance with these people's lives?   I, once again, come to the floor to beg my colleagues to stand with  us, to stand with us and oppose this lawsuit--this careless,  thoughtless lawsuit. At the very least, if you support it, then come to  the floor with a real plan for how you are going to take care of John  and the millions of Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act for  coverage.   I yield the floor.
