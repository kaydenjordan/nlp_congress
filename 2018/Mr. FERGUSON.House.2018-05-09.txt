 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative  Carter from Georgia's First District, for organizing this hour to honor  one of Georgia's great leaders, former United States Senator and  Georgia Governor Zell Miller.   Governor Miller's leadership in our State led to the creation of  something that we hold near and dear to our hearts, and that is the  HOPE Scholarship. This scholarship program has helped generations of  young Georgians build a bright future for themselves, and that, in  turn, has led to a stronger State for our people.   In addition to the HOPE Scholarship and many other policy  accomplishments, Governor Miller truly embodied the term ``public  servant.'' He devoted his life to serving our fellow Georgians and  sought to leave our State better than he found it.   At his funeral, Governor Miller's grandson read a list of 14 life  lessons that the Governor had written to mark his 70th birthday. This  list included a number of important lessons that he wanted to pass  along to his family and to others, and it included such things as  reminding folks not to smoke, that it killed his friends way too early.  It reminded people to be polite, to be on time.   One of the lessons that struck me in particular and I think really  describes how Zell Miller sought to live his life reads this:         Search for your niche. It may take years, although often it       occurs early in life. There is something out there that you       can do better and easier than everybody else. You will have a       knack or talent for it. Find it. It is there. And when you       do, others will beat a path to your door to get you to do it       for them.    Governor Miller certainly found his niche in his lifetime, and that  niche was serving his fellow Georgians. Using his talents, he created a  program that helped thousands of students achieve their dream of a  college education, a legacy that will live on through each successive  class of HOPE scholarships.   We are eternally grateful for his service and his commitment to our  great State and to ensuring that future generations will have greater  opportunities.
