 Mr. President, I would like to call up my amendment No.  837 and ask it be reported by number.    The First Amendment of our Constitution states that  Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.  This has not been a controversial thing in our history and also does  not have an asterisk next to it saying, ``Unless there is a pandemic.''   We don't restrict freedom of religion. We just don't do that. This  has been a great debate in our Nation over the past year as we have  seen restrictions on churches and mosques and on synagogues.   This is a very simple statement. All this is asking for is to make  sure that we treat faithbased entities the same as we do  secular entities. It is not asking for special treatment. It is saying  that if you treat a bar one way, then a block away, you have to treat a  synagogue the same way; if you treat a store one way, a block away, if  there is a church, you have to treat them the same way; if there are  outdoor gatherings that are allowed in the city, there has to be  outdoor religious gatherings also allowed.   It is asking for the same treatment, not special treatment. That is  all that this is--to try to affirm this.  [[Page S454]]    I didn't think this would be controversial. Quite frankly, I thought  this would be something we could voice vote, but I am understanding  this is something we may actually have to take a vote on.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
