 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, Members of Congress who are Eagle  Scouts are taking to the floor of the House of Representatives to say  thank you not only to the Boy Scouts of America but to recognize and to  highlight our opportunity while in Boy Scouts, and now, as Members of  Congress, to talk about how important the Boy Scouts of America is to  the youth, the young men and young women of this country, and, also, to  highlight the leadership that takes place every single day in this  country: men and women who volunteer their time to make sure that the  Boy Scouts of America are prepared and ready to meet not only the times  that we live in but the advances of young people and the challenges  that they have.   Tonight, as an Eagle Scout of the Eagle class of 1970, it is my  opportunity to introduce Members of Congress and then to follow up at  the end as we talk about how important Scouting is.   Today, there are 1,262,311 boys in Scouting from ages 6 to 10 in Cub  Scouts. There are 822,999 boys aged 11 to 17 in Boy Scouts of America  and Varsity Scouts. There are 119,268 young men and young women between  the ages of 10 to 20 who are engaged in exploring based upon programs  that may be STEM or other Scouting programs.   As you see, Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scouts of America is important to  the youth of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins),  who is the head of our Scouting Caucus, and the Eagle class of 1963.    Eagle Scout Chris Collins, thank you very much.   By the way, one of those presidents of the Boy Scouts of America was  Ed Whitacre. When I was at AT&T, Mr. Whitacre led the Boy Scouts of  America, understanding how important it is.   Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the  House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Dallas, Texas,  is also an Eagle Scout. Jeb Hensarling not only is a bright, young,  thoughtful, articulate leader in the United States Congress, he is  Eagle Class of 1971.   Chairman Hensarling, as an Eagle Scout, not only distinguished  himself to Scouting, but also, that led him to Texas A&M University and  then, further, to the University of Texas Law School. He is a young man  who not only deeply believes in his country and his God, but he  believes in the things that have brought him forward to become a leader  in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Eagle Scout Jeb  Hensarling.    Chairman Hensarling, Eagle Scout, class of 1971, thank  you very much.   Mr. Speaker, I hold a Scoutbook, something I call the second good  book. Of course, we know in Scouting, the  [[Page H4492]]  good book is the Bible; but to Scouters, also the second good book is  the Boy Scout Handbook. This was given to me in 2010 by Bob Mazzuca,  who is our chief Scout executive, and he gave it to me with really a  guide to my life to continue down that pathway of talking about  Scouting in great ways. And that is what we are doing tonight.   I acknowledge that we not only have John Garamendi, who is an Eagle  Scout, class of 1960, who will be speaking in a bit, but on a  bipartisan basis, this body has young people, young men who understood  why they got into Scouting. They understood about their life. They  certainly understand it now.   At this time I would like to bring forth Eagle Scout French Hill,  1972, from Arkansas, a relatively new Member of Congress, not only a  mature man, but a man who comes with the proxy of knowledge of what Boy  Scouting has helped provide him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), an  Eagle Scout.    Mr. Speaker, Eagle Scout Congressman French Hill, Eagle  class of `72, thank you very much.   It is with great distinction now that I recognize Congressman Eagle  Scout Jim Bridenstine, 1991. It was about a week ago that Eagle Scout  Bridenstine came up to me and said: Pete, I want you to know that my  son is involved in Scouting, and I deeply believe in it, but I think we  ought to get together here.   So it actually is Eagle Scout Jim Bridenstine who said: Let's get  together our Eagle Scouts and talk about it.   And I hope that the gentleman will have a chance to come on July 24  or so, as Eagle Scout Members of Congress, along with Senator Mike  Enzi, and perhaps others--my Down syndrome son, Eagle Scout Alexander  Gregory Sessions, Troop 890, Lake Highlands, Texas, will join me--that  you, too, with your son, may be able to go with us to the reserve and  do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Bridenstine), a distinguished Eagle Scout.                                time  1830     Eagle Scout Jim Bridenstine, Member of Congress from  Oklahoma, Eagle Class 1991, thank you very much.   The Scouting stories of leadership, of character, and of opportunity  began in my life with my father, who was an Eagle Scout. His father,  Dr. Will A. Sessions, in 1947 wrote the original God and Country Award  Handbook. I wanted to be an Eagle Scout because of my dad. I have two  young sons: William Steele Sessions II, who is an Eagle Scout, age 27;  and Alexander Gregory Sessions, a Down syndrome young man, an Eagle  Scout, who is 23. Scouting is in our blood, we believe it, but it is  also in family blood. Jim Bridenstine spoke about it, and Chris Collins  spoke about the Eagle Class of `63.   This other next young man who is here will talk about Scouting and  what a difference it makes. I wish we had hours, Mr. Speaker, but the  rules allow 1 hour. He is a young man from Pennsylvania, Eagle Scout  Glenn ``GT'' Thompson. I had an opportunity to go to Pennsylvania with  the Chief Scout Executive and give GT Thompson his National and  Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and pin him.   Glenn's wife is a Scouting widow. She is proud of her Eagle Scout  sons, but she knows that the weekends are made for Scouting.   GT Thompson is a man who will be with me again at the Summit Bechtel  Reserve this year for the Scouting Jamboree.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout Glenn Thompson, Eagle  Scout 1977. On behalf of Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh and  Members of Congress who gathered together this evening to tell another  story, I intend to do it again next month. I intend to get John  Garamendi, who is one of our dear friends from California, Eagle Class  of 1960.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Eagle Scouts of Congress who had time  to come tonight, myself, Chris Collins, Jeb Hensarling, French Hill,  Jim Bridenstine, GT Thompson, I am thankful for the hour you have  allowed us to tell the story about the Boy Scouts of America, about  exceptionalism, about the Order of the Arrow, and about the opportunity  for character to lead a great nation.   Mr. Speaker, we are thankful for the time. We will be back. We hope  that we leave our campsite better than the way we found it. That is  what we try to do every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
