 Madam President, America is in a debt crisis  because of reckless government spending. Now, thanks to the insane  spending and failed policies of President Joe Biden and Democrats in  Washington, we are seeing higher and higher inflation.   Under the Biden administration, inflation has grown every month. Just  look at this week's CPI numbers. From June 2020 to June 2021, the  Consumer Price Index rose 5.4 percent. Energy costs are up 24.5  percent, and gasoline prices are up 45 percent--nearly $1 more from  where they were last year. Inflation is at the highest rate since the  great recession. This week's Producer Price Index data shows a 7.3- percent increase in June and a historic 22.6-percent jump in the prices  of processed goods, the highest since 1975. For 6 straight months, we  have seen the data clearly shows that spending beyond our means has  consequences. Inflation is growing at the fastest rate since 1981.   These aren't just numbers or statistics; these increases represent a  growing pressure on Florida families and businesses. Every time prices  rise, life gets harder.   Last month, I met with business owners in Miami and heard firsthand  how their businesses were struggling with the rising price of goods.  Every time I am home in Florida, I hear from families who are noticing  prices are up, gas prices are up, and food prices are up. Every price  increase has a direct impact on a family's budget.   When inflation goes up, it hurts everyone, especially our poor  families, those on fixed incomes, and small businesses. I saw how hard  it was for my parents to make ends meet when inflation hit in the  seventies. When food and gas prices went up, we had less food on the  table.   I remember going to the grocery store, when my mom took in ironing to  [[Page S4881]]  raise money every day for groceries, and she said: You have to look at  the price of things because they are constantly going up.   That is happening again in Joe Biden's America. Families in Florida  and across our Nation are suffering because of the Democrats' reckless  spending spree led by Joe Biden.   Just take a look around. Average prices of everything--everything is  up. Let's say families are filling up their tank once a week. If you  drive a car, that means Joe Biden raised your expenses $600 a year. If  you drive a truck, that means Joe Biden raised your expenses by more  than $1,000 a year. And let's remember, half of Americans make less  than $35,000 a year. Inflation is a new tax on our families.   Instead of addressing this crisis that has hurt Americans, Biden and  the Democrats are living in an economic fantasyland where debt doesn't  matter, spending has no consequences, and inflation is impossible. They  are ignoring the fact that our Nation is barreling towards $30 trillion  in debt. That is $233,000 in debt for every family in America.   Now Democrats in the Senate want to spend another $4 trillion of your  money on a so-called infrastructure plan that has little to do with  infrastructure. They don't care if Americans get a return on their  hard-earned tax dollars.   But the truth is, we can't keep spending like this. There will be a  day of reckoning coming if we don't act to get our fiscal house in  order. That is why I have introduced legislation, the Federal Debt  Emergency Control Act, to take real steps to rein in Washington's out- of-control spending. That includes preventing Biden and the Democrats  from mindlessly spending by requiring that two-thirds of the Senate  vote to increase the debt before approving any bill with deficit  spending.   It would terminate any unobligated funding from the American Rescue  Plan and any previous stimulus bills, sending it back to the Treasury  General Fund for deficit reduction.   Finally, it would ensure that any bill reducing the debt by at least  5 percent over 10 years is fast-tracked through the legislative  process.   We are in a debt crisis. This isn't monopoly money; it is Americans'  money, and we have to be responsible with it. It is time to end the  madness, and it is time to stand up for low- and fixed-income families  and for small businesses that bear the brunt of President Biden's  inflation crisis. With the debt ceiling suspension expiring on July 31,  we must tackle these issues head-on and chart a new and fiscally  responsible path forward that protects families and our Nation's  financial security.   I look forward to every fiscally responsible Republican and Democrat  working with me to reject Biden's insane spending spree, quickly pass  my bill, and protect the future of this Nation    Mr. President, I would like to thank my  colleague Senator Rubio for joining me to honor the lives lost in the  horrific tragedy on June 24, when the Champlain Towers South condo  building in Surfside, FL, suddenly collapsed in the middle of the  night, and honor the brave men and women that have risked their lives  in search, rescue, and recovery efforts.   Senator Rubio and I were on the ground in Surfside following the  collapse, talking to families, first responders, and members of the  community. The pain these families are experiencing is unimaginable.  Those unexpectedly lost in this horrific tragedy were mothers, fathers,  grandfathers and grandmothers, friends, aunts, uncles, and cousins.  They were children and grandchildren with their full lives ahead of  them.   I can't imagine losing any member of my family like this, but the  thought of losing one of my grandchildren is too painful to imagine. We  mourn with these families, and our hearts break for them. We continue  to pray for the Surfside community, the families and loved ones of  those lost, and all of those working tirelessly to serve the Surfside  community.   In the face of tremendous tragedy, our first responders ran into the  danger. They are heroes. They immediately answered the call to serve,  and firefighters, law enforcement officers, rescue and recovery crews,  emergency medical technicians, physicians, nurses, and others from  across the State of Florida and the Nation came rushing to save them.   When you meet with the first responders--I mean, they are working  tirelessly trying to find somebody that has survived, and your heart  goes out to them as they went from rescue to recovery. Miami-Dade Fire  Rescue, the Miami-Dade Police Department, the Surfside Police  Department, and others from around the area were there every step of  the way.   Some of these responders lost family in the collapse; yet they still  answered the call. We heard the absolutely devastating story of a  Miami-Dade firefighter who carried the body of his own 7-year-old  daughter, Stella, away from the rubble. You just can't even begin to  imagine the pain and loss experienced by this father.   International rescue crews and emergency support organizations from  Israel and Mexico also responded to the site to aid in the search and  rescue efforts. Numerous volunteer organizations responded, including  the Red Cross, as well as community leaders and individuals offering  resources, support, and comfort to the survivors and community in  Surfside.   Our Jewish community, particularly Orthodox Jews, have been  especially affected by this tragedy, and we thank CSE, Hatzalah, ZAKA,  and all those who have worked selflessly to support our Jewish  community. We can never thank these brave men and women enough for  their bravery and determination in the face of this terrible tragedy.   I know right now we all have a lot of unanswered questions. We are  all going to work tirelessly to understand exactly what happened. And  while we can't bring back the lives lost, I will always work to honor  those lost and will be relentless in the search for answers to make  sure a tragedy like this never happens again.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 300, submitted earlier today    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I appreciate the unanimous  support of my Senate colleagues passing this resolution to honor the  lives lost in the horrific tragedy in Surfside, and I thank the many  first responders for their incredible bravery in the search and rescue  and recovery efforts.   Our hearts are broken, but we stand together. Florida is ``Surfside  Strong.''   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
