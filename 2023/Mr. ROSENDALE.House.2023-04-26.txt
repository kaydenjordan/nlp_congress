 Mr. Speaker, Montana students have always been on the  cutting edge of science and technology. Today, I rise to give special  recognition to a group of students from Helena who may soon impact the  way that we all travel.   Earlier this month, a robotics team from Helena introduced new  equipment that the TSA hopes will reduce wait times at airport  security. The team, known as Fusion 4133, is renowned for its technical  expertise, winning the 2023 Montana regional championship and  qualifying for an international competition.   What makes Fusion's design for TSA so remarkable is its simplicity.  Using a 3D printer, the students designed a ramp that will allow bags  to flow seamlessly through airport screening systems.   The bright group of inventors are living proof that no one is too  young to pioneer new technologies. I am confident their work will  expedite travel for millions worldwide. It is my privilege to recognize  them on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.                            ____________________
