 Madam Speaker, for weeks we have heard that action on  the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is eminently doable. So why  haven't we gotten it done?   It is time to put politics aside and to come together for the future  of our countries and our people.   NAFTA went into effect in 1994. It was due for modernization. By all  reasonable accounts, USMCA represents progress for farms and ranchers,  for autoworkers, for medical device manufacturers, and others.   This is a multitrillion-dollar economic relationship between the  United States and our two neighbors. It supports millions of American  jobs. In Utah alone, trade with Mexico and Canada supports over 120,000  jobs, jobs that pay the rent, that provide healthcare, that send kids  to college and help Utahns save for retirement. Over $418 million worth  of agricultural exports are sent from Utah to our North American  neighbors each year.   We were elected to move forward on priorities that matter to people's  everyday lives. There is nothing more fundamental for businesses,  employees, and communities than to have stability on the economic  front.   Today, I am saying no more foot-dragging; no more vague promises  about ``soon.'' It is time to deliver on what we promised. Come to an  agreement. Bring USMCA to the House floor, and let's get it done.                            ____________________
