 Mr. Speaker, it looks almost certain that the Trump  administration is going to take about 1.2 million immigrants who  currently have documents issued by the U.S. Government and turn them  into undocumented immigrants. They have work permits and pay their full  share of taxes. They are covered by U.S. labor laws and are not  undercutting the wages, well-being, and livelihood of native-born  American workers.   For all intents and purposes, they are documented workers in the  U.S., and many have been here for more than two decades. Nevertheless,  the more than 400,000 with temporary protected status, or TPS, and  800,000 with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, could be  made undocumented in the coming weeks and in the month of September.   Then, once they are categorized as undocumented, President Trump will  unleash ICE and Homeland Security to go after them so they can be  deported.   There are 800,000 young people who went through a thorough background  check and have been complying with the rules of the DACA program for  almost 5 years. They were brought here as children and grew up in the  United States, went to our schools, played sports with our kids, and  they speak English probably as well as you and I.   They came forward, as they were told to, and we actually reduced the  population of undocumented immigrants, got people on the books, and  were able to redeploy our resources elsewhere.   Now it appears that the leaders in the Republican Party who do not  like the idea of so many immigrants having legal status are giving the  President an ultimatum: deport the DREAMers, or we will sue.   The Governor of Texas, who is leading the charge, has a very  sympathetic judge, and it is up to Jeff Sessions to put up a fight,  when he himself has been trying to kill legal status for immigrants for  years.   So, practically speaking, between ending DACA and ending TPS, we are  going to dump about 1.2 million people into the pool of 10 million to  11 million people who are living and working here under the radar,  outside of legal protections, and without any way to become legal.   So this Saturday, in Chicago, at 2 p.m., at Lincoln United Methodist  Church on Damen, we are going to get together and organize ourselves to  fight back. Yes, there will be legislation from Democrats and even  Republicans to fight back. There will be court cases to fight back,  even if the Attorney General does nothing, which we fully expect him to  do. But fighting for DACA and fighting to keep millions of people in  this country who have put down roots and built lives here is going to  be a people's fight, and the effort to find ways to protect families  and to cope with more than a million people being pushed into the black  market requires us to organize in every community across the Nation.   It is up to us to teach each other how we will resist this latest  insult in our congregations, churches, universities, cities, and  neighborhoods throughout the Nation. Immigrants or people who have DACA  or TPS cannot do this on their own, but they need to be part of a  coalition that fights back.   Teachers who work with kids every day and bear witness to the fears  students face every day about their parents and families can't do this  alone. They need to be part of a coalition that comes together to  resist.   Employers will face a choice: whether they are just going to roll  over while employees are ruled ineligible and work documents are  terminated, or to stand with us and stand with their workers and fight  for them.   So, if you marched with your pink hat at the Women's March, I am  asking you now, on behalf of immigrants and the very future of  immigration, to stand with us. If you marched for science or the  environment, if you have joined us in protesting bathroom laws and  discrimination in all its forms, your brothers and sisters need you  now.   At airports across the country, you stood up for refugees and said no  to Trump's Muslim ban. We need you. Black Lives Matter, we need you,  and, frankly, we need each other.  [[Page H5982]]    People are going to peacefully stand up and fight for justice, common  sense, and what is right. We need everyone to be there with us, helping  us, walking with us. In Chicago, it starts this Saturday at 2 at  Lincoln United Methodist Church in Pilsen.   The road ahead is not going to be very easy, but we have fought hard  to win victories for our country, and for the DREAMers, who are the  leading edge of our movement to make immigration legal again in this  country.   Now is the time. We need your help to protect families and  communities and to do what is right. We cannot do it alone.                            ____________________
