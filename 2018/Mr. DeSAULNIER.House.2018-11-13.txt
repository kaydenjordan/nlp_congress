 Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote on  Tuesday, November 13, 2018, as I was attending an event recognizing the  importance of cancer research and honoring cancer survivors.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 416,  H.R. 6064 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 417, H.R. 2615.                            ____________________
