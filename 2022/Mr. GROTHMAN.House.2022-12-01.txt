 Madam Speaker, I use this opportunity to try to wake up  our slumbering press corps on another very relevant story related to  the southern border.   In the last week, it became apparent that, in the last month, 73,000  illegal immigrants snuck across the border without touching the Border  Patrol.   So you understand, when you hear these numbers, 150,000, 180,000  people crossing every month, most of those people are people that are  at least touched by the Border Patrol before they are given an  appearance date at which they have to appear before some judicial  forum. But there are also people who sneak across the border without  being touched by the Border Patrol.   We had 70,000 gotaways in November. That is the all-time high-- without any perfunctory analysis at all, 73,000.   The border crisis is the greatest it has ever been. I beg the press  corps in this country to wake up. That 73,000 figure ought to be the  banner story in every newspaper across the country. We know that most  of those papers won't even cover it. They are off covering some  Hollywood floozy.                            ____________________
