 Madam Speaker, I don't have any notes in front of me. I  just want to speak a little bit to this body about a topic that has  been in the news, even as of this evening, and to just let folks know  and to remind folks again about why we are pushing so hard to solve a  problem that appears so easy to solve: the issue of the DACA  [[Page H5089]]  population and the importance of comprehensive immigration reform, but  more importantly, of solving this problem for this population of young  people who know of no other country but the United States as their  home.   Now, the public might hear terms like ``queen of the hill'' and  ``discharge petitions,'' and, Madam Speaker, those terms may mean  things to you and me, but for the general public, I just want to  crystalize what it is we are fighting for. What we are asking for, a  bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans, we are asking for an  opportunity to vote on immigration measures that would offer a solution  to these young people.   Now, the measure that I support and that many of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle support is one that would offer an earned path  to citizenship for those individuals who work, go to school, or serve  in the military. That doesn't seem like a stretch for the American  public.   The American public, over 80 percent, support a solution for these  young people. But in this body, it becomes a little more difficult; and  in this body, sometimes things get in the way.   So I don't know the outcome of special meetings this evening or  outcomes among discussions that colleagues have in the majority, but  what I would remind folks again at home and my colleagues is that there  are Democrats and Republicans underneath this dome who are working hard  every day to try to offer a permanent solution to these young people-- not a temporary solution that punts this down for another day, but a  permanent solution that would allow these young people to come out of  the shadows, to continue to work, continue to teach, continue to live  in our neighborhoods without fear.   So we don't have a lot of time left, Madam Speaker, and based on what  I know today, I don't believe that there are any more signatures  signing the discharge petition this evening. But I think what my  colleagues and I want to underscore is that, to those young people who  feel that this institution let them down once again--or maybe they feel  that I let them down--that we are going to continue to work, that we  are going to continue to offer our ideas and solutions, that we are  going to continue to offer a path to citizenship for those who belong  here, who were raised here, who know the United States as their home.  That is our responsibility. It is what the Constitution allows us to  debate and discuss.   It is unfortunate that, on the other side of Capitol Hill, the Senate  had this debate and had this discussion and voted on four bills, some  authored by just Republicans, some authored by a bipartisan group. They  had an opportunity to debate and discuss what should transpire. We  haven't had that opportunity.   Madam Speaker, I know it might not surprise you to know that the last  time immigration was discussed on this House floor was in 2010, and it  was when the DREAM Act passed, in a bipartisan way, in a lameduck  session in December.   So the stakes are incredibly high, and what I would tell folks is  that that just shows this isn't easy.   The last time immigration was discussed was 8 years ago on this  floor. Since then, folks have felt that burying their head in the sand  was a solution enough or just offering a partisan bill was a solution  enough.   That is why we decided to engage in discussion and debate and to try  to force this Chamber to have a bipartisan discussion and to try to  force this Chamber to vote on three or four bills, some a little more  conservative, some a little bit more left of center, right of center,  but to have an opportunity to vote for one or multiple bills. It is  just unfortunate, Madam Speaker, that there isn't enough political  will, that there isn't enough strength in this Chamber among the  Members to have that conversation.   Now, we could be dejected. We could be upset, and I know folks in our  communities will be, but we are going to continue to work. We are going  to continue to find a solution. We are going to continue to work in a  bipartisan way, as we have done for the past 9 months since the  President ended the DACA program. I feel that we owe it to our  communities, we owe it to our constituents, we owe it to each other as  colleagues to allow this place to do what it should do: debate and  discuss bills.   I don't have much more to offer, Madam Speaker, but, I hope that  folks at home understand how important this is and that there are some  of us who are going to continue to engage in this discussion.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.  Michelle Lujan Grisham).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments  and her time. There are few people in this Chamber who have dug in  deeper than the gentlewoman from New Mexico, Chairwoman Michelle Lujan  Grisham, who actually, when the story of this discussion is told at  some point in the future, it was her efforts that really highlighted  and started to push us in a bipartisan way when we had conversations  among Democrats and Republicans. And one of those early individuals who  stood up and said, I am willing to have a real conversation with you if  this can genuinely be a bipartisan effort, was the gentleman from  Texas, who I have learned a lot from and gained a lot of respect for  throughout this process.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, not  only for calling our attention to the Wired article, but also for his  comments about solving this problem in a bipartisan way. He has been a  true friend throughout this process, and I think we have all learned a  lot from each other.   One of the things that he highlighted on as well was: How do you--how  do we--I will speak personally, how do I have a conversation about  border security?   My district doesn't touch the border. I can have conversations with  individuals. I can go and do my due diligence and talk to Border  Patrol, stakeholders, and advocates in the community. But it is going  to take having conversations with those Members who represent the  border, those Members in Arizona, New Mexico, California, and my  colleague in Texas, who has the most mileage of any Member in Congress  along the southern border.   We are going to continue to have these conversations because that is  the only way we learn, that is the only way we grow, and that is the  only way we can chart a course forward, is to do it in a bipartisan  way.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address this body, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 36 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 13, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
