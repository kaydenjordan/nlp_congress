 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, the chairman, for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill. Atlanta,  Chicago, Pittsburgh, Parkland, Charleston, Oak Creek, Newtown, Orlando,  Las Vegas, and many other places: How many more must suffer? How many  more must die?   For years, the people spoke up. Mothers called. Fathers cried.  Students marched. But Congress offered a blind eye or a deaf ear to  their cries.   Today, we say to those who begged and pleaded for us to act that we  see you. We feel your pain. We heard your cries, and we are going to  answer today, now.   We sat in on this floor. I want to thank the chair of our task force,    Mike Thompson, for never giving up, for never giving in, for keeping  the faith, for keeping your eyes on the prize. We are doing the right  thing today.   We have a mission. We have an obligation and a mandate to pass this  bipartisan bill that must become public law.   Today, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``yes.'' It is good. It is the right thing to do to save lives and to  stop this madness.
