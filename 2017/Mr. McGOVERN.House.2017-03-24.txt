 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the majority is rushing to congratulate itself for  finally having a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For 7 years,  Republicans had nothing to actually replace the law with, but that  didn't stop them from making one empty political promise after another.   And after all that, what do we have in front of us today? This bill  will take away health care from 24 million hardworking Americans. It  forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out- of-pocket costs. It is a crushing age tax, forcing Americans age 50 to  64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health  coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Not to mention the $880  billion cut to Medicaid or the fact that it steals from Medicare,  shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and  ransacking funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care they  need.   I don't see anything there to be excited about. But then again, I  come from the old-fashioned school of thought that we should actually  take care of our fellow citizens as they grow older, rather than  tossing them off the ship without a life preserver.   It is no wonder that after developing such an ill-conceived and far- reaching bill on the fly, the majority has had to try and jam this  legislation through our Chamber.    First, they rushed this bill through the committee process without  holding a single hearing, and without the benefit of a nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office score outlining its costs and impacts.   Then the majority came out of a back room somewhere and filed four  managers' amendments in the dark of  [[Page H2376]]  night to try to appease the conservative and moderate holdouts,  including the infamous Buffalo bribe. The Republican leadership has  been trying to strong-arm their conference into voting for this bill  all week, and nobody knows how today's vote will go. The only thing we  do know is that this is a terrible bill that is only getting worse, not  better.   This thing has been a mess from beginning to end. Now, I know our  President prides himself on his negotiating skills, but this seems more  like the art of no deal to me, no matter what the final vote tally  looks like.   That brings us to this early morning, when we met at 7 a.m. in the  Rules Committee to report out this rule, which rewrites the bill to  make it far worse.   Last night, we were presented with a provision, concocted in some  back room, that boggles the mind with its cynicism. So what is this  mysterious grand bargain that will appease the Republican Conference  and finally buy Speaker Ryan enough votes to pass this disaster of a  bill? Well, Mr. Speaker, it is so cartoonishly malicious that I can  picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their  secret Capitol lair last night.   Republicans are killing the requirements that insurance plans cover  essential health benefits--essential health benefits. Now, perhaps you  are wondering: What are these so-called essential benefits? Well, I  will give you a partial list: emergency room trips, maternity care,  mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and prescription  drugs. These are the types of exotic, extravagant benefits that  Republicans apparently don't think are important for working Americans  to be able to afford.   It would be literally unbelievable if we weren't here considering it  right now, Mr. Speaker. Now, I have been awake since before dawn-- thanks to our Rules Committee meeting--so I know that this isn't a  nightmare. We are actually voting on a bill with a backroom deal, made  in the dark of night, that would take away any guarantee that plans  would cover these basic essential benefits.   And, of course, we have no idea what the costs will be or how many  people it will affect. We can't know those things until we get an  analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which,  obviously, we will not have before we vote on this reckless  legislation.   And that is the real problem. Because every time you come out of a  back room, this bill gets worse. For the sake of our country, maybe we  should consider putting locks on the back rooms you huddle in.   President Trump keeps talking about crowd size. My colleagues across  the aisle keep talking about page size. This morning, in the Rules  Committee, Republicans kept saying that the fifth manager's amendment  is only 4 pages long. How bad could it be?   Well, they need to stop worrying about size and pay more attention to  how this bill will affect regular, working Americans. These 4 pages are  the worse 4 pages on this planet because of the terrible consequences  it will have on real people. It will be devastating for millions and  millions of Americans.   So, Mr. Speaker, instead of rushing this horrendous bill, patched  together with backroom deals, to the floor and voting on it just hours  after seeing the final product, we should be working together in a  bipartisan way to improve people's lives, and certainly not putting  them at risk. My colleagues seem too concerned about winning at any  cost to stop and think about the consequences for millions upon  millions of Americans. This is a lousy bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  AARP; a letter from the National Rural Health Association; a letter  from the American Society of Addiction Medicine; and a letter from the  American Medical Association--all strongly opposed to the Republican  bill.                                                           AARP,                                                      March 7, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: AARP, with its nearly 38       million members in all 50 States and the District of       Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, is a       nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps       people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities,       strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter       most to consumers and families such as healthcare, employment       and income security, retirement planning, affordable       utilities and protection from financial abuse.        We write today to express our opposition to the American       Health Care Act. This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal       sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for       Americans aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of       millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor       seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term       services and supports and other benefits.                                   Medicare         Our members and older Americans believe that Medicare must       be protected and strengthened for today's seniors and future       generations. We strongly oppose any changes to current law       that could result in cuts to benefits, increased costs, or       reduced coverage for older Americans. According to the 2016       Medicare Trustees report, the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is       solvent until 2028 (11 years longer than pre-Affordable Care       Act (ACA)), due in large part to changes made in the ACA. We       have serious concerns that the American Health Care Act       repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened       Medicare's fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the       additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higher-income workers.       Repealing this provision could hasten the insolvency of       Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to       pay for services in the future.                              Prescription Drugs         Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other       segment of the U.S. population, typically on a chronic basis.       We are pleased that the bill does not repeal the Medicare       Part D coverage gap (``donut hole'') protections created       under the ACA. Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8       million Medicare beneficiaries have saved over $26.8 billion       on prescription drugs. We do have strong concerns that the       American Health Care Act repeals the fee on manufacturers and       importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is       projected to add $25 billion to the Part B trust fund between       2017 and 2026. AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce       the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and       taxpayers and is willing to work with you on bipartisan       solutions.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         About 6.1 million older Americans age 50-64 currently       purchase insurance in the non-group market, and nearly 3.2       million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for       health insurance coverage through either the federal health       benefits exchange or a state-based exchange (exchange). We       have seen a significant reduction in the number of uninsured       since passage of the ACA, with the number of 50-64 year old       Americans who are uninsured dropping by half.        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical senior seeking coverage through an       exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and       already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for health care.       We have serious concerns that the bill under consideration       will dramatically increase health care costs for 50-64 year       olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to       the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that       requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more       than younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current       subsidies for older Americans.        Age rating plus premium increases equal an unaffordable age       tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change showed       that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to       $3,200 for a 64-year-old, while reducing premiums by only       about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium       increases for older consumers will make insurance less       affordable, will not address their expressed concern of       rising premiums, and will only encourage a small increase in       enrollment numbers for younger persons. In addition, the bill       proposes to change current subsidies based on income and       premium levels to a flatter tax credit. The change in       structure will dramatically increase premiums for older       consumers. We estimate that the bill's changes to current       law's tax credits could increase premium costs for a 55-year-      old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-      year-old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than       $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64-year-old earning       $15,000. When we examined the impact of both the tax credit       changes and 5:1 age rating, our estimates find that, taken       together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much       as $3,600 for a 55-year-old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000       for a 64-year-old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for       a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year. In addition to these       skyrocketing premiums, out-of-pocket costs could       significantly increase under the bill with the elimination of       cost sharing assistance in current law. The cost sharing       assistance has provided relief on out-of-pocket costs (like       deductibles and certain benefits) for low-income individuals       who are some of the most financially vulnerable marketplace       participants.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. Medicaid is a vital safety net and       intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals,       including over 17.4 million low-income seniors and children       and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for       critical health care and long-term services and supports       (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily  [[Page H2378]]       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing       medications, and transportation).        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all       ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute       health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help       them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay       with their families and receive the help they need at home or       in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face       high medical costs, or already spent through their resources       paying out-of-pocket for LTSS, and need these critical       services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a program of       last resort.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens. In terms of       seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a       time when per-beneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely       to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to       turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher       levels of service--including HCBS and nursing home--moving       them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this       group continues to age, their level of need will increase as       well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps       will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals       in each state, including for children and adults with       disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the       most severe disabling conditions.        AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent       enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the       Community First Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with       a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and       people with disabilities live in their homes and communities       where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want       to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as       possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in       Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost       of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could       disrupt services for older adults and people with       disabilities in the states that are already providing       services under CFC.        AARP has concerns with the removal of the state option in       Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the federal       minimum. This takes away flexibility for states to adjust a       Medicaid eligibility criterion based on the specific       circumstances of each state and its residents beyond a       federal minimum standard.        Although we cannot support the American Health Care Act, we       are pleased that the bill does not repeal some of the       critical consumer protections included in the Affordable Care       Act, such as guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting       condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage       limits and allowing families to keep children on their       policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP does support       restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense       deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling       to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing       homes and other long-term services and supports.        We look forward to working with you to ensure that we       maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust       insurance market protections, controls costs, improves       quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans.            Sincerely,                                                Joyce A. Rogers,                                              Senior Vice President,      Government Affairs.                                   ____                   Vote NO to the American Health Care Act         The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on       the American Health Care Act (AHCA).        Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other       populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced       that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and       the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The       AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural       America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more       uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure       crisis.        Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill will       improve the base bill, including increased tax credits for       Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would have seen       their premiums skyrocket under the current plan, the National       Rural Health Association is concerned that the bill still       falls woefully short in improving access and affordability of       health care for rural Americans. Additionally, the new       amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan.       1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will       disproportionately harm rural America.        The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural       Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved       populations in our nation without coverage, and further       escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to       the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit       rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the       largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times       reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--      lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of       the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid       under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable       Care Act.''        Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural       America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets,       exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op       collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating       Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a       health care crisis in rural America. However, it's beyond       frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is       squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be       created in rural America.        Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural       health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect       it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain       access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America       are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to       protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements       are critical for rural patients and providers:        1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-      expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are       covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).        Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is       different and thus requires different programs to succeed.       Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not       `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and       targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for       millions of rural patients and financial stability for       thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal       health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect       its rural safety net providers. The federal government must       not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities       to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to       care.        Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access       to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a       state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a       matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to       create stability among rural providers to maintain access to       care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent       to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,       a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is       provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued       access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not       limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective       Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health       Service providers, and individual rural providers.        2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace       enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing       70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack       of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.       Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34       for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).        Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,       cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to       participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,       poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural       Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and       less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.       Rural communities have fewer health care providers for       insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to       serve the community.        Any federal health care reform proposal must address the       fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural       markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies       are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for       participation and are currently not obliged to provide       service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.       Demographic realities of the rural population make the market       less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance       company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the       same way that financial service institutions are required to       provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable       insurance companies should be required to provide services in       underserved communities.        3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals       serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),       thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the       board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad       debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable       health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot       afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has       actually increased  [[Page H2379]]       50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average       Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are       expected to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median       profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have       experienced a median loss of 6%.        If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to       protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be       undone. The National Rural Health Association implores       Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the       nation.                                   ____                                                 American Society of                                              Addiction Medicine,                                       Rockville, MD, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Neal       and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf of the American Society       of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the nation's oldest and largest       medical specialty society representing more than 4,300       physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in       the treatment of addiction, I am writing to share our views       on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that is being       considered by the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce       committees.        ASAM is very concerned that the AHCA's proposed changes to       our health care system will result in reductions in health       care coverage, particularly for vulnerable populations       including those suffering from the chronic disease of       addiction, and we cannot support the bill in its current       form.        More than 20 million Americans currently have health care       coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including       millions of Americans with addiction. This coverage is a       critical lifeline for persons with addiction, many of whom       were unable to access effective treatment before the ACA's       expansion of Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, and       its requirement that Medicaid expansion plans and plans sold       in the individual and small group market provide essential       health benefits (EHB) including addiction treatment services       at parity with medical and surgical services.        We are concerned that rolling back the Medicaid expansion,       sunsetting the EHB requirements for Medicaid expansion plans,       and capping federal support for Medicaid beneficiaries will       reduce coverage for and access to addiction treatment       services, changes that will be particularly painful in the       midst of the ongoing opioid epidemic. Moreover, while the       AHCA retains the EHB requirements for private plans, it       repeals the ACA's actuarial value requirements for those       plans. We are concerned that this could result in insurers       offering addiction treatment benefits in name only due to       higher costs and/or less robust benefits.        The Medicaid expansion in particular has led to significant       increases in coverage and treatment access for persons with       addiction. In states that expanded Medicaid, the share of       people with addiction or mental illness who were hospitalized       but uninsured fell from about 20 percent in 2013 to 5 percent       by mid-2015 and Medicaid expansion has been associated with       an 18.3 percent reduction in unmet need for addiction       treatment services among low-income adults. Rolling back the       Medicaid expansion and fundamentally changing Medicaid's       financing structure to cap spending on health care services       will certainly reduce access to evidence-based addiction       treatment and reverse much or all progress made on the opioid       crisis last year.        To be sure, ASAM supports flexibility in the Medicaid       program and has supported several states' applications for       1115 waivers to transform their addiction treatment systems       to offer all levels of care described by The ASAM Criteria;       Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance-Related, and Co-      Occurring Conditions. However, ASAM has seen for decades how       states underfund addiction treatment services and waste       federal dollars on inefficient and ineffective care when they       are left to decide how to manage their federal Medicaid       dollars without mandates for parity and accountability to       cover appropriate care. Based on this experience, we       commended the Congress for requiring accountability for the       $1 billion in funding sent to the states to combat the opioid       epidemic authorized by 21st Century Cures. This funding is an       additional lifeline to suffering communities, but it will       come to an end while patients will continue to need treatment       for the chronic disease of addiction. When it does, the       Medicaid program must continue to fund appropriate addiction       treatment at parity with medical and surgical services.        ASAM has long advocated for broad access to high-quality,       evidence-based, individualized and compassionate treatment       services for persons suffering from the chronic disease of       addiction. The critical need for access to this type of care       has been heightened and highlighted by our nation's ongoing       epidemic of opioid addiction and related overdose deaths. The       ACA's Medicaid expansion, EHB requirements for addiction       treatment coverage, and extension of parity protections to       the individual and small group market have surely reduced the       burden of this epidemic and saved lives. As you consider this       legislation, we hope that parity protections will continue to       apply individual, small and large group plans as well as       Medicaid plans through the transition. Finally, throughout       this process, we implore you to keep in mind how your       decisions will affect the millions of Americans suffering       from addiction who may lose their health care coverage       entirely or see reductions in benefits that impede access to       needed treatment.            Sincerely,      R. Jeffrey Goldsmith, MD, DLFAPA, DFASAM,        President, American Society of Addiction Medicine.                                   ____                                     American Medical Association,                                        Chicago, IL, March 22, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Due to projections       that enactment of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will       result in millions of Americans losing health insurance       coverage, the American Medical Association (AMA) must express       our opposition to the proposal currently before the House of       Representatives. The need to stabilize the individual       insurance market and make other improvements in the       Affordable Care Act is well understood. However, as       physicians, we also know that individuals who lack health       insurance coverage live sicker and die younger than those       with adequate coverage. We encourage all members of Congress       to engage in an inclusive and thorough dialogue on       appropriate remedies. We cannot, however, support legislation       that would leave health insurance coverage further out of       reach for millions of Americans.        Earlier this year, we shared with Congress key health       reform objectives that we believe are critical to improving       the health of the nation. Among these objectives are ensuring       that those currently covered do not lose their coverage,       maintaining market reforms, stabilizing and strengthening the       individual insurance market, ensuring that low and moderate-      income patients are able to secure affordable and adequate       coverage, and ensuring that Medicaid and other critical       safety net programs are maintained and adequately funded.       While we appreciate that the bill's authors have made efforts       to maintain some market reforms and that regulatory efforts       are underway to strengthen the individual insurance market,       as a whole the legislation falls short of the principles we       previously outlined.        Health insurance coverage is critically important. Without       it, millions of American families could be just one serious       illness or accident away from losing their home, business, or       life savings. The AMA has long supported the availability of       advanceable and refundable tax credits, inversely related to       income, as a means to assist individuals and families to       purchase health insurance. The credits proposed under the       AHCA are significantly less generous for those with the       greatest need than provided under current law. The reduced       purchasing power with the AHCA tax credits will put insurance       coverage out of reach for millions of Americans.        We also remain deeply concerned with the reduction of       federal support for the Medicaid program and the resulting       significant loss of coverage. Medicaid expansion has provided       access to critical services, including mental health and       substance abuse treatment, for millions. Not only will the       AHCA force many states to roll back coverage to these       millions of previously ineligible individuals, but the       significant reduction in federal support for the program will       inevitably have serious implications for all Medicaid       beneficiaries, including the elderly, disabled, children, and       pregnant women, as well.        We also continue to be concerned about provisions that       eliminate important investments in public health, and those       that inappropriately insert the federal government into       personal decisions about where Americans are allowed to       access covered health care services.        We continue to stand ready to work with Congress on       proposals that will increase the number of Americans with       quality, affordable health insurance coverage but for the       reasons cited above, urge members to oppose the American       Health Care Act.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.     Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my colleague from  Texas, he said this bill was talked to death. It was talked to death by  politicians. There were no hearings on this bill, so no experts came to  testify, and none of these people who are now writing to us in  opposition had the opportunity to be able to come before us and tell us  how awful this bill is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I hear my friend talking about what came  out of the Ways and Means Committee. I will tell you what came out of  Ways and Means Committee: a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would respond to the gentleman from  Alabama with the words of another Alabama Member, Congressman Mo  Brooks, who this morning said:         This is one of the worst bills I've seen in my 30 years in       Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I notice the gentleman from Georgia relied  on a tweet from Donald Trump for his facts in explaining the bill. I  might suggest a more scholarly source, maybe, like, beginning with the  Congressional Budget Office, which says that 24 million people will  lose their health coverage as a result of the bill.   I will also point to the Quinnipiac poll that says only 17 percent of  the American people approve of what my Republicans friends are doing.  Seventeen percent is lower than Trump's rating. That is quite an  accomplishment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  NETWORK, the lobby for Catholic Social Justice; a letter from the  National Alliance on Mental Illness; a letter from the Mental Health  Liaison Group; and an article in the New York Times entitled ``Late GOP  Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy but Not  Chemotherapy.''         Dear Representative: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social       Justice urges you to vote NO on the American Health Care Act       (AHCA). This legislation fails to protect access to quality,       affordable healthcare for vulnerable communities. It would       widen the gaps in our society by making massive cuts to       Medicaid, giving large tax breaks to the very wealthiest       families and corporations, and threatening the health       security of American families.        Our faith teaches that access to healthcare is an essential       human right that is necessary to protect the life and dignity       of every person. The bill would drastically increase the       number of people without health insurance--and I know that       behind those numbers are millions of stories of families       facing medical bankruptcy, forgoing treatment, and losing       loved ones who could have been saved by preventative care.        The AHCA cuts Medicaid spending--an essential source of       care for millions of children, seniors, people with       disabilities, and people experiencing poverty in our nation--      and a per-capita cap would force states to ration care. The       legislation would also increase costs for older and sicker       patients and burden low- and moderate-income families with       much higher premiums by cutting $312 billion of financial       assistance for people purchasing health insurance on the       individual market. This is far from the Gospel mandate to       care for our most vulnerable sisters and brothers.        For any replacement to the ACA to be sufficient, it must       meet these 10 conditions--a Ten Commandments of Healthcare if       you will--and the AHCA breaks nine of 10 commandments:  [[Page H2383]]             1. Thou shalt provide affordable insurance and the same       benefits to all currently covered under the Affordable Care       Act. AHCA fails.        2. Thou shalt continue to allow children under the age of       26 to be covered by their parents' insurance.        3. Thou shalt ensure that insurance premiums and cost       sharing are truly affordable to all. AHCA fails.        4. Thou shalt expand Medicaid to better serve vulnerable       people in our nation. AHCA fails.        5. Thou shalt not undercut the structure or undermine the       purpose of Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP), and Medicare funding. AHCA fails.        6. Thou shalt create effective mechanisms of accountability       for insurance companies and not allow them to have annual or       lifetime caps on expenditures. AHCA partial fail.        7. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate       against those with pre-existing conditions. AHCA partial       fail.        8. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate       against women, the elderly, and people in poverty. AHCA       fails.        9. Thou shalt provide adequate assistance for people       enrolling and using their health coverage. AHCA fails.        10. Thou shalt continue to ensure reasonable revenue is in       the federal budget to pay for life-sustaining healthcare for       all. AHCA fails.        At its heart, this bill has lost sight of community and the       common good. Its biggest problem is that it lacks the       awareness that it is community which makes healthcare       effective. Healthcare is not just about the individual--it is       a communal good. The hyper individualism evident in the AHCA       is sucking the life out of our nation. Just focusing on one's       individual self is contrary to our Catholic faith and       contrary to our Constitution. We will track the vote and       score it in our 2017 voting record.        This dangerous legislation is not the faithful way forward       and must be rejected. Stand by Gospel principles and vote NO       on the AHCA.            Sincerely,                                       Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS,                                   Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby      for Catholic Social Justice.                                   ____                                                National Alliance on                                                  Mental Illness,                                       Arlington, VA, March 8, 2017.      Re The American Health Care Act.       Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: NAMI is       the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization       dedicated to building better lives for the millions of       Americans affected by mental illness. On behalf of our       nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, I am writing to express       our views on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which seeks       to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        The mental health crisis in our nation is well documented.       Half of all Americans with mental illness go without       treatment. Last year, Congress passed significant bipartisan       legislation to address the crisis in our nation's mental       health system. However, addressing the mental health needs in       our country relies on a foundation of affordable, quality       health coverage with fair and equal coverage of mental health       and substance use conditions. Thus, the importance of       Medicaid and insurance safeguards for individuals living with       mental illness cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, the       proposed reforms in the AHCA threaten to undermine the       historic progress being made to improve mental health and       substance use care.             Restructuring Medicaid Threatens Mental Health Care         Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health and       substance use services in the United States. Medicaid is also       the largest funding source for the country's public mental       health system. One in five of Medicaid's nearly 70 million       beneficiaries have a mental health or substance use disorder       diagnosis.        NAMI is deeply concerned with proposed provisions to       convert Medicaid financing into a per capita cap model. This       would limit federal funding to a lump sum for all enrollees       and, instead of providing more flexibility, would shift       financial risk for health care costs--including unexpected       costs, such as promising new innovations in treatment--to       states. Current estimates are that the per capita cap       provisions would shift an alarming $370 billion in Medicaid       costs to states over the next ten years. In the face of       budget shortfalls, states will be forced to cut people from       coverage, reduce health benefits and access to care, and/or       reduce already low provider payments, escalating our nation's       healthcare workforce crisis.        The AHCA would set per capita caps for Medicaid at current       funding levels, adjusted for medical inflation. Funding for       mental health and substance use services is already       inadequate in Medicaid programs and, under this model, could       not be improved without cutting other health care. Further,       the deep reductions in federal Medicaid funding would mean       that people with mental illness will face even more desperate       circumstances when trying to access critical mental health       care.                Freezing Medicaid Expansion Puts Lives at Risk         Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion       lives with a mental health or substance use condition.       Medicaid expansion has proven to be a lifeline that helps       people with mental illness who typically fall through the       cracks. Medicaid expansion provides coverage to people with       mental health conditions who are too sick to navigate the       traditional Medicaid application process, who are just stable       enough not to qualify for disability (often because they are       coming out of a psychiatric hospital), or who have first       symptoms of a serious mental illness.        NAMI strongly urges the Committee to take further steps to       preserve enrollment in Medicaid expansion, rather than the       proposed end to new enrollment in 2020. Expanded eligibility       has brought mental health treatment and the hope of recovery       to millions affected by mental illness. It is helping keep       people healthier and productive in their communities.       Congress should not abandon this important means of improving       coverage for and access to critical mental health treatment.        NAMI also urges the Committee to reject provisions in the       AHCA that would lock enrollees out of Medicaid expansion       should they experience a lapse of coverage of more than one       month. This is a high price to pay for forgetting to pay a       premium while in the hospital or experiencing severe symptoms       of mental illness. Denying coverage only serves to further       de-stabilize lives with costly consequences for individuals,       families and communities.        Finally, NAMI is very concerned that the AHCA removes the       requirement for Medicaid expansion plans to cover essential       health benefits, including mental health and substance use       treatment. Congress' significant commitment to mental health       and substance use services in recent legislation should not       be jeopardized by making these vital services optional in       Medicaid. Our country can ill afford to weaken coverage at a       time when the need for mental health and substance use       treatment is so high.                Continuing Insurance Subsidies and Protections         To help Americans afford quality health insurance, NAMI       strongly urges the Committee to continue current levels of       federal support, tied to income, to purchase health care       coverage. Without assistance tied to income, more people with       mental illness will be unable to afford coverage for mental       health care. This threatens their overall health, resulting       in more costly and difficult-to-treat conditions and denying       people the chance to reach and maintain recovery and a stable       life in the community.        NAMI appreciates that the Committee included essential       insurance safeguards in the AHCA. These safeguards include       protecting Americans from losing or being denied coverage       because of pre-existing health conditions. This also includes       continuing to allow young adults to remain on their parent's       health insurance plans to age 26 and banning annual and       lifetime caps for insurance coverage.        Cutting corners in health coverage will keep people from       getting the treatment they need and will push people with       mental illness into costly emergency rooms, hospitals and       jails. Making the investment early in affordable, quality       mental health care promotes recovery and reduces the high       long-term financial burden to taxpayers in avoidable       disability, criminal justice involvement and hospital care.        NAMI urges the Committee to maintain coverage and services       for people with mental illness by preserving financial help       based on income, removing the proposed per capita cap       financing model for Medicaid and protecting expanded Medicaid       eligibility. We appreciate the challenges in reforming       America's health coverage and look forward to working with       you to improve mental health coverage and care for children       and adults throughout our nation.            Sincerely,                                              Mary Giliberti, J.D.,      Chief Executive Officer, NAMI.                                   ____                                      Mental Health Liaison Group,                                                     March 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Mental       Health Liaison Group (MHLG) wishes to express our serious       concerns about the provisions of the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) that would restructure the Medicaid program and end       the Medicaid expansion, as well as provisions of that       legislation that would significantly reduce the Federal       premium assistance that enrollees receive from the Federal       government to maintain continuous insurance coverage, and       impose a significant penalty for not maintaining continuous       coverage. We are also very concerned that the legislation       would eliminate required coverage for prevention and       treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders under       state Medicaid managed care and alternative benefit programs,       as Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding in every       state for mental health and substance use services.  [[Page H2384]]         The MHLG is a coalition of dozens of national organizations       representing consumers, family members, mental health and       substance use treatment providers, state behavioral health       agencies, advocates, payers, and other stakeholders committed       to strengthening Americans' access to mental health and       substance use services and programs.        The elimination of Medicaid expansion under the AHCA would       leave without coverage the 1.3 million childless, non-      pregnant adults with serious mental illness who were able,       for the first time, to gain coverage under Medicaid       expansion. It would also leave uncovered the 2.8 million       childless, non-pregnant adults with substance use disorders       who also gained coverage under expansion for the first time.       These are populations that Congress promised and worked to       serve with the passage of 21st Century Cures and the       Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016,       respectively. And it is important to remember that untreated       mental health and substance use disorders intensify and serve       to increase the number of co-morbid medical conditions in       those populations, thereby multiplying total Medicaid program       costs.        Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health       services in the United States, accounting for about 26       percent of behavioral health spending, and is the largest       source of funding for the country's public mental health       system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the       Medicaid provisions of the AHCA would reduce Medicaid funding       over 10 years by $880 billion, or about 25 percent. With an       estimated 14 million people--one in five of Medicaid's 70       million enrollees--living with mental illness or substance       use disorders and depending heavily on Medicaid services,       allowing states to determine whether those services should be       covered could very well leave many low-income Americans       without access to medically necessary prevention and       treatment services.        Medicaid covers a broad range of behavioral health services       at low or no cost, including but not limited to psychiatric       hospital care, case management, day treatment, evaluation and       testing, psychosocial rehabilitation, medication management,       as well as individual, group and family therapy. In three       dozen states, Medicaid covers essential peer support services       to help sustain recovery. Additionally, because people with       behavioral health disorders experience a higher rate of       chronic physical conditions than the general population,       Medicaid's coverage of primary care is critical to help this       population receive needed treatment for both their behavioral       health and physical health conditions.        In states that have expanded Medicaid and which have been       particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, such as Kentucky,       Maine, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, Medicaid pays       between 35 to 50 percent of medication-assisted treatment for       substance use disorders. CARA and 21st Century Cures were to       increase payment for those services, but the elimination of       mandated coverage under Medicaid would likely result in state       cost shifting, so that CARA moneys (should they be       appropriated) and moneys provided under 21st Century Cures       for prescription opioid addiction prevention and treatment       services would supplant, rather than supplement, the existing       Medicaid coverage of services in the states.        Similarly, converting Medicaid into a per capita cap block       grant program or a simple block grant program will shift       significant costs to states over time. Ultimately, states       will be forced to reduce their Medicaid rolls, benefits, and       already low payment rates to an already scarce workforce of       behavioral health providers. Mental health and substance use       disorder treatments and programs will be at high risk       because, even though they are cost-effective, they are       intensive and expensive. Furthermore, the elimination of the       ACA's required Medicaid managed care coverage of mental       health and substance use disorder services and the long-term       reduction of real funding dollars will leave states and       managed care plans no alternative but to reduce or eliminate       services in order to balance state Medicaid budgets and       operate within managed care organizations' capitated rates.        In addition, these cuts will hit children with serious       emotional disorders, as well as adults with mental illness.       Fifty percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are children.       Seventy-five percent of mental conditions emerge by late       adolescence. The loss of Medicaid-covered mental and       substance use disorder services for adults would result in       more family disruption and out-of-home placements for       children, significant trauma which has its own long-term       health effects, and a further burden on a child welfare       system that is struggling to meet the current demand for       foster home capacity. In addition, we estimate $4 to $5       billion in Medicaid assistance will be lost by schools for       specialized instructional support services, including mental       and behavioral health services.        More directly, the rollback of the maximum eligibility       level for children ages 6 to 19 from 133 percent of the       Federal Poverty Level to 100 percent FPL will undoubtedly       have the result of reducing access to mental health and       substance use disorder services, and critical Early and       Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)       services, for those older children. This is a particularly       problematic change since 5 percent (1.2 million) of       adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 had substance use       disorders in 2015 and EPSDT screening is the most effective       early identifier for emergent mental health issues.                  ahca changes to private insurance coverage         If Medicaid is not to provide the avenue for recovery for       individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders,       then the private insurance market may have to serve as an       alternative, but the $2,000 to $4,000 refundable tax credits       provided under the AHCA to subsidize insurance premiums       constitute a significant reduction in the advance premium tax       credits paid under the ACA, which averaged 72 percent of       gross premiums. Further, the 30 percent premium surcharge       required under AHCA to be imposed for a failure to maintain       continuous coverage will likely hit hardest the lowest-income       enrollees who will be struggling to maintain premium payments       for coverage. It will be particularly destructive for those       enrollees whose serious mental illness or substance use       disorders may render them cognitively impaired and thus       unable to maintain premium payment schedules until they       recover, when the sizeable surcharge will leave them unable       to pick up coverage. For the foregoing reasons, these       provisions of the AHCA leave us very concerned for the       continued well-being of the individuals with serious mental       illness and substance use disorders we have been better able       to serve since the implementation of the ACA's expanded       coverage.        We urge you to continue to protect these vulnerable       Americans' access to and coverage of vital mental health and       substance use disorder care and services, and to not reverse       the recent progress made with the enactment of key mental       health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment       reforms under the 21st Century Cures Act and CARA.

Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                                Chemotherapy                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health       insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan       that's right for them.''        Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that       includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an       example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable       Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every       plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often       costly.        Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut       a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part       of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act       moving through Congress. (The vote in the House is expected       later today.)        At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.       Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity       benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to       pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will       come down, and more people will be able to afford that       coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy       coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for       the plan that's right for them.        But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum       benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health       insurance''  [[Page H2385]]       can start to become a little murky. The second is that, in a       world in which no one has to offer maternity coverage, no       insurance company wants to be the only one that offers it.        Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are       required under the Affordable Care Act:        Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)        Emergency services        Hospitalization        Maternity and newborn care        Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,       including behavioral health treatment        Prescription drugs        Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices        Laboratory services        Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease       management        Pediatric services, including oral and vision care        The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress       who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are       required for children, but not adults, for example. But over       all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who       buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of       coverage people get through their employer. A plan without       prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one       that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan       as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.        Under the Republican plan, the government would give people       who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A       20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the       government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential       health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed       to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.       Federal money would help buy these plans.        But history illustrates a potential problem.        In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped       low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,       it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating       cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them       to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed       the provision after investigations from the Government       Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee       uncovered fraud.        Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the       Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends       to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the       Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be       problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If       they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying       insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that       you might end up with the government paying for plans that       covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to       specify what's included.''        A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly       aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a       lot more money than the current G.O.P. plan, since far more       people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap       products, even if they weren't very valuable.        There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health       economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare       requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who       have pre-existing illnesses at the same price as they sell       them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep       this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that       attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to       cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money       or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive       away any healthy customers.        Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate       School of Public Service at New York University, who helped       work on the essential health benefits in the Obama       administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.       Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy       insurance that covers only mental health services. Other       parents won't care about that benefit.        The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up       with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,       while its competitors that drop them will get healthier       customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health       services are optional, no insurance company will want to       offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy       their product and put them out of business.        And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug       addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.       The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't       require that these benefits are required, they often just get       knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.        Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards       for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not       uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug       coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans       tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a       world where health insurers could discriminate against sick       people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply       tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy       insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer       mental health benefits to everyone else.        David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the       Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he       thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered       under the proposed mix of policies could become much more       bare-bones than plans before Obamacare. He envisioned an       environment in which a typical plan might cover only       emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything       else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as       it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.        ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-      you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system       would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,       opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially       higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people       would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as       many treatments.        There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers       might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the       costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the       average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But       making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-      offs, less simple than their talking point.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a second to summarize  this rule because people have been asking about it.   It is a closed rule. The only amendments allowed are amendments  offered by people who wrote the bill. Those amendments are fixes to  fixes to fixes to fixes in their bill and, in the words of Trump, sad.   I would just say, you know, usually when you have a lousy process you  have a lousy bill, and that is why only 17 percent of the American  people support what my Republican friends are doing.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman  from Texas, if I can.   I know he has a few more speakers than he did yesterday, but we have  a ton over here, and if there is additional time that he could share  with us, we would appreciate it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score for  the underlying bill and the first four manager's amendments. We just  got it last night, and it is already out-of-date given the fifth  manager's amendment that was just submitted late last night.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker: At your request, the Congressional Budget       Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)       have prepared an estimate of the direct spending and revenue       effects of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, as posted       on the website of the House Committee on Rules on March 22,       2017, incorporating manager's amendments 4, 5, 24, and 25.        As a result of those amendments, this estimate shows       smaller savings over the next 10 years than the estimate that       CBO issued on March 13 for the reconciliation recommendations       of the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House       Committee on Energy and Commerce. The estimated effects on       health insurance coverage and on premiums for health       insurance are similar to those estimated for the committees'       recommendations.                        Effects on the Federal Budget         CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.R. 1628, with the       proposed amendments, would reduce federal deficits by $150       billion over the 2017-2026 period; that reduction is the net       result of a $1,150 billion reduction in direct spending,       partly offset by a reduction of $999 billion in revenues (see       Tables 1 and 2). The provisions dealing with health insurance       coverage would reduce deficits, on net, by $883 billion (see       Table 3); the noncoverage provisions would increase deficits       by $733 billion, mostly by reducing revenues.        Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the       legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO       and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.                     Effects on Health Insurance Coverage         CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people       would be uninsured under the legislation than under current       law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative       to the number under current law would reach 21 million in       2020 and 24 million in 2026 (see Table 4). In 2026, an       estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured,       compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year       under current law.                             Effects on Premiums         H.R. 1628, with the proposed amendments, would tend to       increase average premiums in the nongroup market before 2020       and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to       projections under current law. In 2018 and 2019, according to       CBO and JCT's estimates, average premiums for single       policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to       20 percent higher under the legislation than under current       law. By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in       the nongroup market would be roughly 10 percent lower than       under current law.                    Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates         The ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers,       employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other       affected parties would respond to the changes made by the       legislation are all difficult to predict, so the estimates in       this report are uncertain. But CBO and JCT have endeavored to       develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution       of potential outcomes.                    Comparison With the Previous Estimate         On March, 13, 2017, CBO and JCT estimated that enacting the       reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Ways       and Means and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce       (which were combined into H.R. 1628) would yield a net       reduction in federal deficits of $337 billion over the 2017-      2026 period. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1628, with the       proposed amendments, would save $186 billion less over that       period. That reduction in savings stems primarily from       changes to H.R. 1628 that modify provisions affecting the       Internal Revenue Code and the Medicaid program.        Over the 2017-2026 period, modifications to provisions       affecting the Internal Revenue Code that are not directly       related to the law's insurance coverage provisions would       reduce JCT's estimate of revenues by $137 billion. Reducing       the threshold for determining the medical care deduction on       individuals' income tax returns from 7.5 percent of income to       5.8 percent would reduce revenues by about $90 billion. Other       changes include adjusting the effective dates and making       other modifications to the provisions that repeal or delay       many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which would       reduce revenues by $48 billion.        A number of changes to the Medicaid program would reduce       CBO's estimate of savings by $41 billion over the 2017-2026       period. The reduction would result from revising the formula       for calculating the per capita allotments in Medicaid to       allow for faster growth of the per capita cost of aged,       blind, and disabled enrollees. The effects of changing that       formula would be offset somewhat by the effects of three       other provisions that would increase savings: reducing the       per capita allotment in Medicaid for the state of New York in       proportion to any financing the state receives from county       governments; providing states the option to make eligibility       for Medicaid conditional on satisfying work requirements for       enrollees who are not single parents of children under age 6       or who are not pregnant or disabled; and allowing states to       receive a block grant for Medicaid coverage of children and       some adults instead of funding based on a per capita cap.        Other smaller changes resulting from the manager's       amendments would reduce savings by an estimated $8 billion       over the period.        Compared with the previous version of the legislation, H.R.       1628, with the proposed amendments, would have similar       effects on health insurance coverage: Estimates differ by no       more than half a million people in any category in any year       over the next decade. (Some differences may appear larger       because of rounding.) For example, the decline in Medicaid       coverage after 2020 would be smaller than in the previous       estimate, mainly because of states' responses to the faster       growth in the per capita allotments for aged, blind, and       disabled enrollees--but other changes in Medicaid would       offset some of those effects.        The legislation's impact on health insurance premiums would       be approximately the same as estimated for the previous       version.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     This analysis confirms that the Republicans will give a  trillion-dollar tax break to the wealthiest people in this country, and  they will kick 24 million Americans off their health insurance.   I will say that is why we are packed with speakers on this side, and  there is probably only a couple of people on the gentleman's side,  because we are standing with the American people who are outraged by  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).

[[Page H2389]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 87 patient and  provider organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which  is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                     March 20, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: The undersigned       organizations write to express grave concern about proposals       put forth in the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to alter the       fundamental structure and purpose of Medicaid, a vital source       of health care for patients with ongoing health needs.        We feel compelled to speak out against proposals to phase       out Medicaid expansion and implement per capita caps, which       threaten the ability of Medicaid to provide critical health       care services to many of our most vulnerable citizens. These       proposals aim to achieve cost savings of approximately $880       billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, at the       expense of tens of millions of patients who rely on Medicaid       for life-sustaining care. While we appreciate the       opportunities we have had to work with your staff, we cannot       support the Medicaid provisions in this bill and cannot       accept policies that prioritize cutting costs by limiting       patients' access to care.                      Medicaid is Critical for Patients         Medicaid is a crucial source of coverage for patients with       serious and chronic health care needs. Pregnant women depend       on Medicaid, which covers roughly 50 percent of all births       including many high-risk pregnancies. Medicaid covers cancer       patients: nearly one-third of pediatric cancer patients were       enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 and approximately 1.52 million       adults with a history of cancer were covered by Medicaid in       2015. Over fifty percent of children and one-third of adults       living with cystic fibrosis rely on Medicaid to get the       treatments and therapies they need to preserve their health.       Nearly half of children with asthma are covered by Medicaid       or CHIP and adults with diabetes are disproportionally       covered by Medicaid as well. The patients we represent are       eligible for Medicaid through various pathways, including       through income-related and disability criteria.                            Reject Per Capita Caps         The proposal to convert federal financing of Medicaid to a       per capita cap system is deeply troubling. This policy is       designed to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, forcing       states to either make up the difference with their own funds       or cut their programs by reducing the number of people they       serve and the health benefits they provide.        For patients with ongoing health care needs, this means       that Medicaid may no longer cover the care and treatments       they need, including breakthrough therapies and technology.       In order to save money, the per capita caps are set to grow       more slowly than expected Medicaid costs under current law.       As the gap between the capped allotment and actual costs       increases over time, states will be forced to constrain       eligibility, reduce benefits, lower provider payments, or       increase cost-sharing. Moreover, by capping the federal       government's contribution to Medicaid in this manner, states       will be less able to cover the cost of new treatments. This       could be devastating for people with serious diseases, for       whom groundbreaking treatments represent a new lease on life.       For people with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and other diseases,       new therapies can be game changers that improve quality of       life and increase life expectancy. In fact, we have already       seen Medicaid programs respond to current budget constraints       by using clinically inappropriate criteria to restrict access       to therapies old and new. A per capita cap will only       exacerbate the downward pressure on Medicaid budgets and will       further reduce access to these therapies for patients.        Pairing financing reforms with increased flexibility, as       has often been proposed, would further undermine Medicaid's       role as a safety net for patients. Without current guardrails       provided by federal requirements--coupled with reduced       federal funding--states will have the authority to reduce       benefits and eligibility as they see fit and to impose other       restrictions, such as waiting periods and enrollment caps.       These policies have serious implications for patients--for a       person with cancer, enrollment freezes and waiting lists       could mean a later-stage diagnosis when treatment costs are       higher and survival is less likely. For a person with       diabetes, this would risk the ability to adequately manage       the disease. Many of our patients rely on costly services       that will be quickly targeted for cuts if states are given       such flexibility, so it is imperative that current federal       safeguards remain in place.                         Maintain Medicaid Expansion         While the AHCA has been described as preserving Medicaid       expansion for those already enrolled in coverage, we are       concerned that estimates show that eliminating the enhanced       match for any enrollee with even a small gap in coverage       would actually result in millions of people losing       coverage. By eliminating the enhanced federal match for       any enrollee with a gap in coverage, eventually states       will be on the hook for billions of dollars to continue       covering this population--an insurmountable financial       hurdle. Additionally, seven states have laws that would       effectively end Medicaid expansion immediately or soon       thereafter when the expansion match rate is eliminated.       Nearly half of adults covered by the Medicaid expansion       are permanently disabled, have serious physical or mental       conditions--such as cancer, stroke, heart disease,       arthritis, pregnancy, or diabetes--or are in fair or poor       health. Repealing Medicaid expansion will leave these       patients without coverage they depend upon to maintain       their health.        The proposed financing reforms are a fundamental shift away       from Medicaid's role as a safety-net for some of the most       vulnerable members of our society. Repealing Medicaid       expansion would leave millions without the health care they       rely on. Our organizations represent and provide care for       millions of Americans living with ongoing health care needs       who rely on Medicaid and we cannot support policies that pose       such a grave risk to patients.        We hope that we can continue our dialogue as you move       forward in this process to arrive at solutions that provide       all Americans with high-quality, affordable care regardless       of an individual's income, employment status, health status,       or geographic location.

Mr. Speaker, I would say to my colleagues that this is  a sad day for this institution. This process has been awful. But this  is even a sadder day for the American people.   I remind my colleagues that we are supposed to care about one  another, especially the most vulnerable in our society. In this era of  Trump, Washington has become a mean place. It is a place where it has  become unfashionable to worry about the poor, about older Americans,  and about those who struggle.   There is absolutely no justification for giving huge tax breaks to  billionaires--$1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires and  billionaires, and at the same time throwing 24 million people off of  health care and denying millions more essential healthcare protections.   Twenty-four million people--my Republican colleagues have lost their  human ability to feel what that means. That is the entire population of  Australia.   Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues, but  when I look at this bill and I read this bill, I have to wonder: What  are you thinking? How could you do this?   I have come to the conclusion there are only two reasons--there are  only two ways you can vote for this bill. One is you don't know what is  in the bill; or two is you have to have a heart of stone, because this  bill is shameful. It is going to hurt people. It is going to hurt your  constituents.   Withdraw this bill or vote ``no'' on this bill, but this bill cannot  become law. The health care and healthcare protections for the American  people are too important.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues--both Democrats and  Republicans--reject this. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
