 Mr. Speaker, just a short time ago, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) gave a heartfelt speech about his time in  Congress. I want to pass along my appreciation for him, especially his  hard work in shepherding through the 21st Century Cures Act just a  couple of terms ago.   I appreciate that and his strong work in the Congress. God bless Mr.  Fred Upton.   Mr. Speaker, I get up here and speak a lot about the situation with  food availability in this country, farming, the availability of food  that comes from farming.   Just recently, President Biden basically promised food shortages  around the world and even have effects here in the United States, the  land of abundance with the capability of growing much more than our own  food supply. There is no reason the United States should be running  short of food in any fashion for our own people or in our ability to  help other people around the world with exports or the food programs  that aid those that are in poor, dire situations in some other  countries.   Yet, indeed, my wife just told me a couple of days ago that she was  in the market, and there was an entire freezer shelf that was empty in  one of the large chains of grocery stores in northern California. How  can this be? Why is it?   I know we are coming out of COVID. That caused some problems, but the  essential workers were in there pretty much the whole time making it  happen, making beef available to our store shelves, everything else.   The farmers probably never really left the fields. There is no reason  we should be having shortages.   I still hearken back to the story about 30-something years ago when  Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, came to this country. Along  with President Bush at the time, he visited the Johnson Space Center in  Houston. On the way out, they stopped at a grocery store there in  Texas. Mr. Yeltsin just wanted to see that, I guess, and he was amazed  by what was on the shelves of American stores, the bounty we have.   I think it moved him to become emotional about it, and it also moved  him to give up his role in the Communist Party in Russia and try to  start reforming his country.   Indeed, he was quoted as saying, If the Russian people could see what  was on the shelves here, there would be a revolution. That is pretty  amazing.   So, what are we doing here in this country? The regulatory agencies  and policies that come out of this administration and, of course, the  State of California are basically running agriculture off the map.  Taking the water away from farmers in California is a big example.   Now, people around the country may be watching and wonder: ``Why does  that affect me, man, a bunch of California problems? They are all  messed up out there anyway.'' What is important, though, is that so  many of these products we grow in California benefit the whole country.  There are at least a dozen crops that 90 to 98 percent of them that  Americans consume are grown in my home State.   I went to this irrigation district meeting just recently in my  district. A whole bunch of farmers were gathered with the district  managers there, their board. Indeed, the district is doing everything  it can to make a bad situation work just a little bit better. They are  using innovative ideas.   But the bottom line is, the water has been taken from them when you  are talking Lake Shasta, Lake Oroville, the other projects we have in  California, the State project, the Federal project.   How has it been taken? Well, of course, we are going through somewhat  of a drought situation, but a lot of it is a man-enhanced drought  because so much water has been let out of our storage systems into the  delta, ostensibly to help fish, ostensibly to help with water quality.   One of the delta fish we are talking about is known as the delta  smelt. It is gone. They go out and take what they call trawls, looking  for this species. It isn't there anymore, so they have shifted much of  the narrative away from the smelt now to water quality, salinity, such  as that.   We get that because some of the bay area intakes for city use are in  the delta, and they need to not have saltwater coming into those. So,  the freshwater coming down, basically, from the mountains washes that  water away. They need some of that flow.  [[Page H4158]]    According to statistics I have seen, because I can hardly get a  straight answer, six times the flow has been pushed through there as  what it would take to maintain that salinity--six times the flow.   So much water is not being captured. California still has a lot of  rain and snowpack that falls upon it that is not being captured.   What are we down to? That water district I met with, those farmers  are going to receive 7 percent of their flows, 0.4 acre-feet. If you  had 100 acres, you would get to plant 7 acres. Can you imagine in any  kind of business atmosphere where you get to operate 7 percent of it?   We have to get this right. The Federal Government needs to come in  and do its job, not just worship the Endangered Species Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last week, President Biden announced a  decision to repeal one of the best tools our Nation has to deter  illegal immigration, title 42.   Title 42 is a public health law that authorized U.S. border agents to  promptly send back illegal immigrants if they pose a health risk to  Americans  [[Page H4160]]  and are from a country with a communicable disease outbreak.   This reckless decision comes as U.S. Customs and Border Patrol warned  the historic surge at our border is already worsening, now even more so  in anticipation of the rollback of this title.   The U.S. will soon hit 1 million illegal crossings of our borders in  just the first half of this fiscal year, which began in October.   Last week, Customs and Border Patrol confirmed that over 300,000  illegal immigrants have illegally entered in just the last 6 months-- 300,000. This is known as the known got-aways, and the true number is  most likely much higher.   Title 42 expulsions account for over half of all expulsions; the ones  with the health issues are half of expulsions. They will now be let in.   Where are the concerns about Americans' health? We are just coming  off this COVID situation. Where are Americans' health concerns in this?   This is a crazy policy that is not putting Americans first.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Ranking Member Graves yielding  me the time on this as well as the bipartisan effort with Chairman  DeFazio and everybody on this important legislation.   The Resilient AMERICA Act really, indeed, is like the old adage, a  stitch in time saves nine. When you can spend dollars upfront  mitigating, such as this bill moves to do, to make a larger pool of  money available under FEMA to do so, it just saves a lot of extra pain  and suffering.   Mr. Garret Graves talked about the $100 billion year in, year out we  are spending on disaster relief. It is good we do so, but we can nip a  lot of this in the bud by applying this type of thinking toward all  types of possible disasters.    In my home district, you know, last year the Dixie fire, right at a  million acres; the Camp fire before that hit the town of Paradise. You  all heard about that in the news, 85 people lost their lives, destroyed  90 percent of the town. Now, if we can get ahead of the curve on this,  whatever is applicable for FEMA preassistance, prework, hardening power  lines, having buildings that can be hardened with the right materials  for their siding and for their roofs. The mitigation we need to be  doing in forested areas, whatever is applicable, the more we can do,  the better off we are.   We are also looking at flood situations. I have that, too, with the  Sacramento River and Feather River in my area, as well as lesser areas,  too, in size. Instead of fixing a levee on New Year's Eve in the middle  of the night on soggy levees, doing that work ahead of time, upgrading  them makes it safer for the workers, safer for the community, and is  much less expensive.   This is, indeed, a great success for us in this time, and there is  sometimes difficulty here in Congress to have legislation like this  with strong bipartisan support that can help everybody. I am proud of  the work this committee has been able to do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Graves) for the time.   Here we have again another triumph of legislation coming together  that can be beneficial at no great new cost to the process.   The Stafford Act has needed updating, certain aspects, for a long  time. When you look at some of the difficulties when you are in a  postdisaster situation of having to deal with some arcane legislation  and laws, it just makes much more suffering than is necessary for  people who have been victims, in my case, from many wildfires in  northern California.   In adhering to the approximate 95 percent of projects being under the  new threshold, that still keeps with what had been set in place way  back in 1988. H.R. 5641 is a triumph in that.   Also, with it at 10 percent of total funding for disasters, we are  not blowing the budget on this either.    It is, indeed, very important because when you are talking about my  rural district or rural America, you don't have the wherewithal to be  hassling your way through some of these processes in order to get  things going again postdisaster.   In my area, for example, towns like Whiskeytown, Happy Camp,  Hornbrook, Concow, Yankee Hill, Magalia, Paradise, Doyle, Canyondam,  [[Page H4177]]  Greenville, Indian Falls, and others I couldn't possibly all list here  today, they are all going to be beneficiaries and appreciative of this  effort because they don't have the ability, small counties like Plumas  County and Lassen County, to have to deal with some of the restrictions  previously under the Stafford Act.   This would be a big win for anybody facing disaster, a small town, or  even large, around this country. This is another win for us  legislatively, and I appreciate the effort of the committee.
