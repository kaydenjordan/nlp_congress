 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  Chamber for the first time in my service to the 23rd District of Texas.   My path to Congress has been marked by many obstacles. At age 18, I  left high school to join the Navy and provide a path to success for my  family. As I embarked on a 20-year career as a cryptologist, I deployed  to Iraq and Afghanistan and gained a deep understanding of the security  issues that currently affect our Nation.   Today, many of those issues are visible along our Southern border,  especially within my district, which spans over 800 miles between the  U.S. and Mexico border. The challenges facing our district are  compounded by the minute, and it is imperative that Congress take  action.   Mr. Speaker, as I have made my way around the district, I have seen  firsthand the men and women who are doing the work. People like Sheriff  Martinez in Val Verde County, like Sheriff Coe in Kinney County. We  have other sheriffs throughout. We have Chief Guajardo in Eagle Pass  and Chief Rodriguez in Uvalde. We have Sheriff Dodson. These are the  men and women on the ground every day doing the work.   That is why I am proud to introduce the Security First Act, to ensure  our borders are safe, resilient, and adaptive to 21st century  challenges. One of the primary objectives to my bill is to authorize an  increase in grant funding for Operation Stonegarden.   As a key pillar of our border security framework, Operation  Stonegarden provides resources to local law enforcement agencies  involved in Customs and Border Protection operations. By enabling our  sheriffs and police departments to collaborate with CBP and United  States Border Patrol, Operation Stonegarden helps create a layered  approach to border security and encourages a joint collaboration across  all levels of Government. Operation Stonegarden funds can be used to  purchase field equipment to enhance operational efficiencies.   The United States has long been a leader in technology. So equipping  our boots on the ground with sophisticated tools to do their job is  exactly what is needed. After speaking to countless law enforcement  agents in my district, it is clear that more funding for this program  is needed. A surge at our Southern border is occurring.   The Security First Act proposes a 4-year increase to current  Stonegarden funding levels and requires that all moneys seized from  drug trafficking activities at the Southern border be funneled to the  Stonegarden account. By strengthening our ability to cope with evolving  security challenges, the Security First Act helps protect the integrity  of our Southern border.                            ____________________
