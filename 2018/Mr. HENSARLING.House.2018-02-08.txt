 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4771) to raise the consolidated assets threshold  under the small bank holding company policy statement, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4771, the  Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. It is a bipartisan bill  which passed our committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 41-14.   Mr. Speaker, this exact same provision came out of the Senate Banking  Committee also with a very strong bipartisan vote of 16-7.   First, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love) who is a  very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. I want to  thank her for introducing this legislation and helping lead our  congressional efforts to provide regulatory relief to our Nation's  community banks. She is a great asset to our committee and widely  respected.   The Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement is a  regulation that allows certain bank holding companies that have less  than $1 billion in assets to hold more debt at the holding company  level than would otherwise be permitted by current capital  requirements. They do this as long as they meet a number of ongoing  requirements and restrictions.   H.R. 4771 would raise that threshold for qualifying institutions from  $1 billion to $3 billion, thus allowing more community banks to raise  more capital by the issuance of debt. By increasing this threshold,  H.R. 4771 provides much needed relief for bank holding companies from  overly burdensome capital and leverage requirements that were truly  intended, Mr. Speaker, for the largest and most complex global  financial institutions.   It is a reoccurring problem, Mr. Speaker. Again, over and over, the  regulatory burden on our community financial institutions is causing us  to lose one approximately every other day in America. These are rules  that have made it, again, more difficult for small banks to raise  capital. And while the bank holding companies will no longer have to  abide by these rules under this bill, again, there are plenty of  safeguards that continue to be in place to protect the safety and  soundness of the institution and its customers. But these institutions  present no threat to the safety and soundness of our financial system.   First and foremost, the Federal Reserve retains the right to impose  capital standards on a holding company if they determine it is needed.  In other words, this is a ``may'' bill and not a ``shall'' bill. The $3  billion threshold remains totally within the discretion of the Federal  Reserve. It is permissive.   Next, capital rules and regulations will continue to apply to the  subsidiary banks of the holding company level. Again, let me repeat,  the capital rules and regulations continue to apply to subsidiary  banks.   All institutions must continue to meet certain qualitative  requirements, including those pertaining to non-banking activities,  off-balance-sheet activities, and publicly registered debt and equity.  These requirements ensure that the higher leverage the policy statement  allows does not pose any undue burden on subsidiary depository  institutions.   So the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act will indeed make it  easier for small, hometown community banks to raise capital. And as  they raise more capital, they can turn it into more Main Street jobs,  more economic growth, and more home ownership opportunities for our  constituents.   In fact, passing this bill will immediately benefit community banks  all across America. Not the big banks, not Wall Street banks, as I have  no doubt the ranking member will say in her remarks, but again, it will  be community banks that will benefit.   If you don't believe me, ask them. Ask the Independent Community  Bankers of America and its 5,700 community bank members.   As a matter of fact, the passage of this bill, Mrs. Love's bill, has  been an important, longstanding goal of the Independent Community  Bankers of America because they have been suffering and suffocated by  an avalanche of red tape with massive increases in regulatory burdens,  which has caused consolidation with much, much larger competitors.  Because of increased regulation and compliance costs, again, many of  them have found it difficult to access and raise capital. This is the  capital that is needed to capitalize our small businesses.   Small businesses are struggling for access to credit, and the  incredible regulatory burden placed on home buyers has simply  complicated the buying process.                                time  1115    These higher costs are being felt at the same time that paychecks are  only now beginning to grow for working families thanks to the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act.   Just don't take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Let's listen to just one  community banker who happens to be from West Virginia. They wrote in  and said:         What no one in a position of power seems to realize is that       many customers in our  [[Page H984]]       country prefer to deal with a smaller, hometown institution,       with people they know and trust. If a customer has a question       about their loan or their deposit, they simply pick up the       phone and call or drop by. If we don't know the answer, we       find out and let them know as soon as possible. But it       appears that Congress and the administration are attempting       to get rid of smaller institutions, so there are a lot fewer       institutions to deal with, and those are the large ones who       are too big to fail.    Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what happened under the Dodd-Frank Act.   Continuing:         Please just try to remember that small financial       institutions and small businesses are the heart of America.       The American Dream is to work hard, learn, and make a good       life for yourself and your family. In the meantime, it       includes working in your community or neighborhood to help       others out. Even as a small institution as ours, we sponsor       Little League Baseball teams, soccer teams, the county junior       fair, and many other activities. We realize if we don't       support local small businesses, they soon won't be here.    Those words could have been written by almost any community financial  institution in America, Mr. Speaker, and they ring so true. In order to  keep our small communities alive, we have to keep their small  businesses alive and we must keep their small banks alive.   So, again, it is so important that we enact H.R. 4771 and that we  reduce this red tape on our community financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Utah for introducing the  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Utah.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say that,  as the ranking member appears to be vexed at where the $3 billion  number came from, it is the product of bipartisan compromise, something  I invite her to engage in more often, and this particular bill is  supported by almost half the Democrats on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that I am shocked that anybody would come here and say that they want  to support community banks and they supported Dodd-Frank--the very  reason these community banks are being gobbled up. The whole idea of  this legislation is to allow them to come together and protect  themselves and not be gobbled up by the big banks they vilify in the  first place.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to simply use  a term popularized on the other side of the aisle. These are crumbs,  deregulatory crumbs, offered by the ranking member when, in fact, she  and others on the other side of the aisle have their handprints all  over Dodd-Frank, which 90 percent of community bankers will tell you is  the number one reason they are going out of business, which is why we  have to enact this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee  on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross), vice chairman of the Housing and  Insurance Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to  request of the ranking member, on her time, if she will begin to name  the community banks that were responsible for the 2008 financial  crisis, ostensibly, that was supposed to be answered by Dodd-Frank. She  will have some time to think about that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin).  [[Page H989]]         I yield the gentleman from New York an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    I yield the gentleman from Ohio an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.  [[Page H990]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our community financial institutions play a vital role  in our local communities, particularly in rural areas like the Fifth  District of Texas, our east Texas counties, and yet they are being  crushed, crushed by the sheer weight, volume, complexity, and expense  of regulation brought about by Dodd-Frank.   I hear so much from the ranking member about how much her side of the  aisle cares about community banks, but their words are belied by their  actions in supporting Dodd-Frank, supposedly meant for Wall Street, but  it is hurting Main Street.   We have a bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, that will  give a little bit of ability for community banks to protect themselves  from the onslaught of this regulatory burden. The whole idea, again,  Mr. Speaker, is to ensure that community banks can at least gather and  merge amongst themselves so they are not gobbled up by the big banks  that are vilified by the other side of the aisle in the first place.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this is actually--you wouldn't know it from the  ranking member--a bipartisan proposal, supported by almost half--half-- of the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. And again, there  is great bipartisan work on our committee. Almost three-quarters of our  bills are bipartisan; it is just few of them that are supported by our  ranking member.   Let's do one small thing today. Let's have the House do one small  thing today, Mr. Speaker, that will help them survive a day more so  that they can lend money to a hardworking family to buy that first  home, so that they can lend money to somebody to realize their American  Dream of perhaps starting their own small business. After having to get  that paycheck at the local factory for so many years, now they can  finally go out and start their own small business. Maybe it is a matter  of sending the first kid to college.   But all of this, all of this disappears. These hopes and dreams  disappear with our community banks who are still failing,  unfortunately, at the rate of one approximately every other day. This  is unacceptable. This is totally unacceptable.   So we have one deregulatory measure here--one--to help our community  banks survive. And we hear from so many of them, Mr. Speaker.   Here is one from Indiana that says:         Regulations have significantly reduced our ability to make       judgment calls on credit decisions. When I first came to       First Savings Bank, I had a number of people tell me that the       First Savings Bank gave them their first loan, probably when       they didn't deserve it. Today, they are business and civic       leaders. And I guess we made the right call then. However,       today we cannot make that call. Washington has made that       call, and the answer is no.    One reason, one voice of one banker telling us why we need the bill  from the gentlewoman from Utah.   Here is another from a banker in Texas, who said:         When I started banking, the community bank business model       was built around bankers helping their communities to thrive.       Today, customers are confused when they have to sign so many       papers to open a deposit account or borrow money. I can only       think of one explanation, and that is our government thinks       our customers are too stupid to come into the bank and       negotiate a private transaction with their banker, the       community banker that they go to church with, the community       banker whose kids go to school with the customers' kids, and       the community banker whose wife is in the local charity with       the wives of the banker's customers' wives.                                time  1215    Here is another one from Nevada:         I have been a banker for over 30 years, and I have never       been more discouraged than I am now. Good bankers are fleeing       the industry. The days of making a commonsense decision for       the benefit of a customer are gone. For me, retirement can't       come soon enough.    I have got binders and binders full of these testimonies, Mr.  Speaker. As the local community banks leave, so leave the credit  opportunities of so many low-and moderate-income Americans. It has got  to stop.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the House to enact H.R. 4771. Let's stop  the carnage, let's encourage community bank living, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
