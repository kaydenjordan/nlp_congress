 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   We are here, really, to reaffirm a very important commitment that we  have to one of our closest partners in the Middle East, and that is  Jordan. I think all of us agree that, over the generations, it has been  astounding the way Jordan has always offered safe haven and refuge  through the generations to others.   This bill gives us an opportunity to continue that close working  relationship that we have with Jordan because, as we know, Jordan is  locked--has been locked--in a struggle with ISIS, or Daesh, as they  call it in that part of the world. They have been involved on the  battlefield, and this bill addresses both the military and economic  elements of the close relationship we have with Jordan.   As they valiantly fight ISIS, Jordanians have struggled to absorb,  most recently, more than 1 million Syrian refugees; and they are doing  this, obviously, while coping with a tough economy, with an  overburdened infrastructure, and with high unemployment for their  youth. I have been to some of the schools in Jordan to see the  Jordanians as they once again reach out a hand of friendship to help  those who are in this predicament.   Although Jordan has successfully worked with the Millennium Challenge  Corporation and the World Bank to address some of the economic  challenges, it really has not been enough to create the level of vital  economic growth needed in the circumstances that Jordan is in.   Economic opportunity and prosperity in Jordan are one element of our  bulwark against extremist groups, against the Iranian regime, the IRGC,  who seek to spread chaos and destruction, and as ISIS seeks to spread  death.   In addition to supporting existing efforts, including regional water  and energy projects that bring needed resources and will bring  increased cooperation between neighbors, this bill calls for the  establishment of an enterprise fund for Jordan. This is a measure  previously authorized, previously funded by this body, and this fund  will help create economic opportunity through private-public  partnership, through investments in small and medium enterprises, and  it will also create market development in Jordan.   Although not a familiar measure to many, enterprise funds have  already been very successful in Tunisia, and we have seen that. We have  seen that success.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our colleagues for their support for  this measure for our ally and friend, Jordan, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues. I would like to  thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel,  but I would also like to thank Mr. Eagle over there, Brendan Boyle, and  I would  [[Page H757]]  like to thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen as well.   Jordan, of course, is a key partner in our struggle against ISIS and  against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and other destabilizing  actors in the Middle East. This bill supports our joint efforts on the  battlefield and will help Jordan achieve much-needed economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and, once  again, extend the arm of friendship to our closest partner, Jordan.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) be allowed to reclaim his unused  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1997) to encourage United States-Ukraine  cybersecurity cooperation and require a report regarding such  cooperation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1997         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Cybersecurity       Cooperation Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States established diplomatic relations with       Ukraine in 1992, following Ukraine's independence from the       Soviet Union.        (2) The United States attaches great importance to the       success of Ukraine's transition to a modern democratic       country with a flourishing market economy.        (3) In an effort to undermine democracy in Ukraine, hackers       targeted the country's voting infrastructure just days before       its 2014 presidential election.        (4) In December 2015, a malicious cyber intrusion into       Ukrainian electric utility companies resulted in widespread       power outages.        (5) As a result of the December 2015 cyber incident, the       United States sent an interagency team to Ukraine, including       representatives from the Department of Energy, the Federal       Bureau of Investigation, and the North American Electric       Reliability Corporation, to help with the investigation and       to assess the vulnerability of Ukraine's infrastructure to       cyber intrusion. The visit was followed up by another       interagency delegation to Ukraine in March 2016 and a May       2016 United States-Ukrainian tabletop exercise on mitigating       attacks against Ukraine's infrastructure.        (6) In response to an escalating series of cyber attacks on       the country's critical infrastructure - including its       national railway system, its major stock exchanges, and its       busiest airport - President Petro Poroshenko declared that       ``Cyberspace has turned into another battlefield for state       independence.''.        (7) In May 2017, Ukraine cited activities on Russian social       media platforms, including pro-Russian propaganda and       offensive cyber operations, as threats to Ukrainian national       security.        (8) Following the June 2017 Petya malware event - a global       cyber incident that primarily affected Ukraine - the       Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       (NATO) said ``the cyber attacks we have seen. . . very much       highlight the importance of the support, the help NATO       provides . . . gives . . . or provides to Ukraine to       strengthen its cyber defenses, technical and other kinds of       support. We will continue to do that and it's an important       part of our cooperation with Ukraine.''.        (9) In September 2017, the United States and Ukraine       conducted the first United States-Ukraine Bilateral Cyber       Dialogue in Kyiv, during which both sides affirmed their       commitment to an internet that is open, interoperable,       reliable, and secure, and the United States announced $5       million in new cyber assistance to strengthen Ukraine's       ability to prevent, mitigate, and respond to cyber attacks.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) reaffirm the United States-Ukraine Charter on Strategic       Partnership, which highlights the importance of the bilateral       relationship and outlines enhanced cooperation in the areas       of defense, security, economics and trade, energy security,       democracy, and cultural exchanges;        (2) support continued cooperation between NATO and Ukraine;        (3) support Ukraine's political and economic reforms;        (4) reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the       Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances;        (5) assist Ukraine's efforts to enhance its cybersecurity       capabilities; and        (6) improve Ukraine's ability to respond to Russian-      supported disinformation and propaganda efforts in       cyberspace, including through social media and other outlets.       SEC. 4. UNITED STATES CYBERSECURITY COOPERATION WITH UKRAINE.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Secretary of State should take the following actions,       commensurate with United States interests, to assist Ukraine       to improve its cybersecurity:        (1) Provide Ukraine such support as may be necessary to       secure government computer networks from malicious cyber       intrusions, particularly such networks that defend the       critical infrastructure of Ukraine.        (2) Provide Ukraine support in reducing reliance on Russian       information and communications technology.        (3) Assist Ukraine to build its capacity, expand       cybersecurity information sharing, and cooperate on       international cyberspace efforts.        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate a report on United States cybersecurity cooperation       with Ukraine. Such report shall also include information       relating to the following:        (1) United States efforts to strengthen Ukraine's ability       to prevent, mitigate, and respond to cyber incidents,       including through training, education, technical assistance,       capacity building, and cybersecurity risk management       strategies.  [[Page H758]]         (2) The potential for new areas of collaboration and mutual       assistance between the United States and Ukraine in       addressing shared cyber challenges, including cybercrime,       critical infrastructure protection, and resilience against       botnets and other automated, distributed threats.        (3) NATO's efforts to help Ukraine develop technical       capabilities to counter cyber threats.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks,  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to talk about Ukraine and the U.S.-Ukraine  cyber cooperation. Ukraine, of course, is on the front lines of digital  combat as we have learned. Few countries have endured as great a level  of cyber invasion and aggression as has Ukraine at the hands of Russia  and at the hands of other malicious actors as well.   I led a delegation of four Democrats and four Republicans into the  east, into Dnipropetrovsk in the Donbass region, and we had an  opportunity to hear about what is being done to try to tear that  country apart.   This is in addition to the invasion in the east, the occupation of  the east. This is the farthest east one can go in Ukraine today, and  you can see the struggle that everyday people are having with the  disinformation campaign launched against them relentlessly. As  President Poroshenko said, ``Cyberspace has turned into another  battlefield for state independence,'' and that is so true for Ukraine.   Their struggle to defend their independence and their territorial  integrity from Russian aggression extends far beyond the armed conflict  of the occupation of its territory. In 2014, hackers targeted Ukraine's  electoral infrastructure just days before its presidential election.  The following year, a malicious cyber intrusion shut down the country's  electric grid, turning off the lights and turning off the heat in the  dead of winter.   Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including its national railway  system, its major stock exchanges, and its busiest airport, have been  repeatedly targeted by sophisticated cyber attacks.   Most of these continuing assaults have been identified by experts as  Russian in origin. By working with the government in Kiev, we can  better prepare ourselves as well as our friends in partner countries  against similar aggression, including combating Russian disinformation  efforts that rely heavily on disseminating propaganda. That propaganda  poses as legitimate news.   So this bill will enhance our cooperation with Ukraine in addressing  shared cyber challenges, including cybercrime and the protection of  critical infrastructure.   Modern society requires an internet worldwide that is open, that is  reliable, that is secure, which can only be ensured if all those who  seek to preserve it join forces to defeat those who wish to destroy it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who is an esteemed  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. And besides Brendan Boyle  here, he is another big Philly Eagles fan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to also recognize and thank my  colleagues, especially Mr. Boyle and Mr. Fitzpatrick, one Democratic  and one Republican, both from Philadelphia, the sponsors of this  bipartisan legislation. I want to thank Mr. Boyle for his work on this  important bill because I think the threat to Ukraine and cyberspace is  not isolated. It shouldn't be ignored. I think that when we talk to the  researchers, they have warned that the attacks on Ukraine by state and  by nonstate actors might be a test run for even larger additional  attacks in the future on the United States and on our NATO allies.   While we must bolster our own capabilities, we should also cooperate  with our friends and partners such as Ukraine because we have got to be  sharing best practices; we have got to improve joint capabilities; and  we have got to provide that mutual assistance to prevent, mitigate, and  respond to those international cyber attacks.   This legislation is going to enhance that effort. And in so doing, it  is going to strengthen our ability to protect our own country from  those who seek to do us harm.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3851) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 to provide for rewards for the arrest or  conviction of certain foreign nationals who have committed genocide or  war crimes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3851         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Rewards Expansion       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PROGRAM.         Paragraph (10) of section 36(b) of the State Department       Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(b)) is amended       by striking ``defined under the statute of such tribunal.''       and inserting the following: ``defined--        ``(A) under the statute of such country or tribunal, as the       case may be; or        ``(B) under United States law;''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just start by thanking the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx) who is very engaged on this issue; and my ranking  member on the Foreign Affairs Committee as well, Eliot Engel. They  introduced this bill together.   For the last 33 years, the Department of State War Crimes Rewards  Program has authorized the Secretary of State to offer rewards for the  arrest or the conviction of certain dangerous individuals. Originally  drafted to be used against international terrorists, this successful  program has been expanded over the years to include the use against  others who threaten our safety and our security. So this now includes  drug traffickers, war criminals, and perpetrators of genocide, some of  those efforts I had authored years ago.   But in 2012, we expanded it further to transnational organized crime.  At that time, my subcommittee held a hearing where the State Department  testified that one captured target, a narco terrorist, told DEA agents  that he could no longer trust anyone in his organization after a reward  was offered on his head.   What he said was: I felt like a hunted man.   Exactly. That is the rationale behind that program, and that is why  we expanded it then with my legislation and why we expand it today with  the legislation of Virginia Foxx and Eliot Engel, because our goal here  is to turn the table on these dangerous criminals and help ensure that  they have no safe haven from justice.   The bill before us today clarifies these authorities. The current  statute authorized rewards for the arrest or conviction of foreign  nationals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Many  people often think of those things in connection with international  tribunals. But the U.S. also has domestic statutes on the books that  criminalize war crimes and criminalize genocide. This bill makes clear  that the State Department's rewards can be used in connection with the  prosecution of foreign nationals in U.S. courts for those crimes, as  well to make sure that inducement is there.   Tragically, these authorities continue to be necessary and we know  continue to be important. We live in a world where crimes against  humanity are perpetrated. We have seen two declared genocides in as  many decades. One in Darfur in 2004. I remember seeing firsthand a  young boy who had his hand amputated by the Janjaweed and by ISIS in  2016. Any of us can pick up our iPhone and see the results of that kind  of terror. We also see tragic ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya  right now in Burma.   So I again want to thank Congresswoman Foxx and Mr. Engel for their  work on the bill. It deserves our support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), chairwoman  of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and the author of  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, when we consider the human cost in terms of those who  commit war crimes or crimes against humanity, I reflect on some of the  victims of Charles Taylor's activities in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We  saw young children who had limbs amputated at the hands of the  Revolutionary United Front, supported by Charles Taylor. We have met  with children whose parents have been murdered by the perpetrators of  violence who believed they were beyond justice.    The concept behind having the Department of State Rewards Program  serves such an important purpose when we consider that it has helped  bring to the bar of justice around this planet those who have been  involved in war crimes. It has turned the table on dangerous war  terrorists and criminals.   This bill, sponsored by Virginia Foxx and Eliot Engel, continues to  expand that very effort to help ensure that they face justice but, just  as importantly, to send the message that others in the future who  contemplate behaving like Charles Taylor or committing this kind of  mayhem will also face the bar of justice. It will also encourage those  who are working with them to turn them over in order to get that  reward, leaving them in a state of perpetual anxiety so that they know  that, at any time, anyone in their organization could turn them over  for international justice. This bill helps advance that effort.   Again, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and my  good friend from New York (Mr. Engel), as well, for sponsoring this  bill to make clear that this important authority includes justice meted  out by U.S. courts under U.S. law. This makes it clear that the  international provisions we seek to expand include the actions taken  here in the United States, and I congratulate them for bringing this  bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.
