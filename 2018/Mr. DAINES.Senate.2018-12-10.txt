 Mr. President, as the lead Republican on this bill, I  want to thank my colleague Senator Gillibrand for her leadership on  this very important issue.   I am a fiscal hawk. I look at every penny spent by the Federal  Government. I respect Senator Enzi and Senator Lee and their views,  especially on fiscal issues. I urge this body to pass the blue water  Navy bill by unanimous consent. This is about justice. This is about a  bureaucracy making a decision and really not following the intent of  this Congress.   It is correct that something was done wrong in 2002, as Senator  Gillibrand has already laid out so eloquently. Our U.S. Navy veterans  who were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam have been  denied proper care through the VA. Even though both Houses of Congress  extended presumptive health coverage to all illnesses linked to Agent  Orange, the VA thwarted congressional intent by choosing the narrowest  possible definition of ``service in the Republic of Vietnam,'' which  included the country's territorial waters.   Our veterans deserve much better. It is unacceptable that a  technicality in the law and a dysfunctional Federal bureaucracy have  resulted in the prolonged suffering of thousands of our Nation's  heroes. This legislation will ensure that the victims of Agent Orange- related disease receive the care and compensation they have long  deserved. I will continue to fight for our veterans just as they have  fought for us.   Thank you.   I yield to my fellow Montanan, Senator Tester.
