 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 846 censuring Representative Brian Mast.   Whereas, Representative Brian Mast served honorably in the United  States Army with distinct sacrifice, dedication, and bravery;   Whereas, Representative Brian Mast has repeatedly made inflammatory  statements regarding innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are in  harm's way through no fault of their own as a result of horrific  terrorist attacks conducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023;   Whereas, Representative Brian Mast 's refusal to distinguish innocent  Palestinians from Hamas terrorists is false, misleading, dehumanizing,  dangerous, and unbecoming of a Member of Congress;   Whereas, on October 19, 2023, during a House Foreign Affairs  Committee markup, Representative Brian Mast emphatically asserted that  any urgently needed humanitarian aid for innocent Palestinian civilians  who are in harm's way through no fault of their own ``should be slowed  down'' and that there should be ``every effort made to slow down any  perceived assistance'';   Whereas, on October 19, 2023, during the same House Foreign Affairs  Committee markup, Representative Brian Mast stated that terrorism is  ``absolutely supported by the Palestinian people, from elementary  school all the way up into the elderly'';   Whereas, on November 1, 2023, during a speech on the House floor,  Representative Brian Mast inexcusably compared innocent Palestinian  civilians, including children, who are often used as human shields by  Hamas terrorists, to Nazi collaborators that perpetrated the Holocaust  against the Jewish people;   Whereas, the horrific crime against humanity perpetrated by Nazis  that resulted in the murder of more than 6 million Jews during the  Holocaust should never be trivialized;   Whereas, on November 1, 2023, during a speech on the House floor,  Representative Brian Mast stated that ``there are very few innocent  Palestinian civilians'';   Whereas, on November 2, 2023, Representative Brian Mast again  incorrectly conflated innocent Palestinian civilians with Hamas  terrorists by tweeting a video of a Hamas leader and asserting that ``a  two-state solution means making a state out of these murderous  terrorists who are openly calling for the atrocities of October 7 to be  committed over and over again'';   Whereas, Representative Brian Mast's repeated conflation of innocent  Palestinian civilians with Hamas terrorists sends a message to the  world that violence against all Palestinians is legitimate and risks  the incitement of brutal attacks across the Middle East region,  including settler violence in the West Bank and Hezbollah aggression in  northern Israel;  [[Page H5426]]    Whereas, instances of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia have been on  the rise, including the hate-fueled murder of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6- year-old Palestinian American who was stabbed to death in his home in  Illinois on October 15, 2023, because of his identity; and   Whereas, Representative Brian Mast's comments regarding innocent  Palestinian civilians in Gaza are dehumanizing, inflammatory,  unacceptable, and can be reasonably construed as inviting the targeted  murder of innocent Palestinians, fanning the flames of violence in the  Middle East, and violating the international rules of war:   Now, therefore, be it resolved that Brian Mast be censured.
