 Mr. President, I rise to extend a warm welcome to  His Excellency Narendra Modi, the esteemed Prime Minister of the  Republic  [[Page S2114]]  of India. Next week, we will be honored to have him address a joint  meeting of Congress underscoring the significance of the relationship  between the United States and India.   The bond between India and the United States is not just an alliance,  it is a strategic and global partnership. Our two nations' relationship  is built on the strong foundation of shared values--democracy, freedom,  and respect for the rule of law.   India and the United States have long recognized the power of  collaboration and fostering peace, prosperity, and global stability.  United States-India diplomatic relations have only grown since India  gained its independence 75 years ago.   In the face of global challenges ranging from education to energy to  agriculture and health, Prime Minister Modi has worked with the United  States to address these issues, and continues to work toward solutions  that benefit not just our countries but the entire world.   Prime Minister Modi's visit to Washington, DC, is an occasion to  celebrate that progress and to reaffirm our commitment to further  strengthen this vital partnership.   I have had the opportunity to learn more about this partnership from  Dr. Kulkarni, who is the Indian Consulate General in Atlanta, and a  friend of mine. And she is also a friend of my State director, Umesh  Sanjanwala.   So Prime Minister Modi's visit is an opportunity to deepen our  collaboration in areas such as trade, defense, technology, and  healthcare, which will shape the future trajectory of our nations.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in extending a warm welcome to  the Prime Minister as he visits our great Nation.   I yield the floor.
