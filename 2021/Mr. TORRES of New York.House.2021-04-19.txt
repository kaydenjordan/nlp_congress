SEC. 6. IMPACTS OF SHUTDOWN.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding the direct and       indirect impacts of the lapse in appropriations between       December 22, 2018, and January 25, 2019, on--        (1) Department of Homeland Security human resources       operations;        (2) the Department's ability to meet hiring benchmarks; and        (3) retention, attrition, and morale of Department       personnel.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 490, the DHS MORALE Act.   Every day, the Department of Homeland Security workforce carries out  an array of critical missions, from screening travelers to securing  cyberspace, to responding to disasters.   The 240,000 men and women who make up this workforce should feel  appreciated, not only by the American people, but also by DHS.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.   The Office of Personnel Management has found that DHS employees are  consistently less satisfied with their jobs compared to the average  Federal employee. Since 2005, DHS' own employees ranked the Department  dead last among large Federal departments in the annual Best Places to  Work in the Federal Government survey. Scratching below the surface,  the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey found that  DHS' workforce is the most dissatisfied when it comes to training,  teamwork, work-life balance, and support for diversity.   In response to the concerns expressed by the workforce, Chairman  Thompson introduced the DHS MORALE Act to require DHS to create and  implement policies related to leadership development, employee  engagement, career progression, and employee recognition.   Specifically, H.R. 490 requires the Department to prioritize career  development opportunities and leadership development opportunities for  DHS employees.   Additionally, it would require DHS to establish an employee  engagement steering committee comprised of employees across the  Department to better identify the causes of low morale  [[Page H1898]]  and what initiatives are working to improve it, and to establish an  annual employee award program to recognize those in the DHS workforce  who go above and beyond in their work to protect the homeland.   Identical versions of this measure have been approved by the House in  prior Congresses.   This Congress, a new provision was added to the bill to respond to  recommendations issued last month by the Government Accountability  Office regarding morale challenges at the Department.   The provision directs DHS' chief human capital officer to review and  approve DHS component agency plans to ensure they include initiatives  to address the root causes of low morale and performance metrics for  measuring implementation of those initiatives.   Enactment of H.R. 490 will help put DHS on a path toward fixing the  longstanding morale problems at DHS.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 490, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I  am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 490 will improve morale among the Department's  240,000 employees. That is why it has the support of unions  representing DHS employees: The National Border Patrol Council, the  National Treasury Employees Union, and the American Federation of  Government Employees.   Enactment of H.R. 490 will also force DHS to examine the root causes  of the longstanding morale problems and develop responsive approaches  to move the Department forward in a positive direction.   Madam Speaker, I ask for my colleagues' support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 473) to require a review of Department of  Homeland Security trusted traveler programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 473         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H1899]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trusted Traveler       Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       conduct a review of Department of Homeland Security trusted       traveler programs. Such review shall examine the following:        (1) The extent to which the Department of Homeland Security       tracks data and monitors trends related to trusted traveler       programs, including root causes for identity-matching errors       resulting in an individual's enrollment in a trusted traveler       program being reinstated.        (2) Whether the Department coordinates with the heads of       other relevant Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial       entities regarding redress procedures for disqualifying       offenses not covered by the Department's own redress       processes but which offenses impact an individual's       enrollment in a trusted traveler program.        (3) How the Department may improve individuals' access to       reconsideration procedures regarding a disqualifying offense       for enrollment in a trusted traveler program that requires       the involvement of any other Federal, State, local, Tribal,       or territorial entity.        (4) The extent to which travelers are informed about       reconsideration procedures regarding enrollment in a trusted       traveler program.       SEC. 3. ENROLLMENT REDRESS.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary       of Homeland Security shall, with respect to an individual       whose enrollment in a trusted traveler program was revoked in       error extend by an amount of time equal to the period of       revocation the period of active enrollment in such a program       upon re-enrollment in such a program by such an individual.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 473, the Trusted Traveler  Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2021.   Before the pandemic, millions of travelers participated in DHS'  trusted traveler programs, like TSA's PreCheck and CBP's Global Entry,  NEXUS, SENTRI, and FAST programs, to get them where they need to go a  little faster.   These are win-win programs where DHS moves vetted goods and people in  an expeditious manner, thereby freeing up screening resources to focus  on higher-risk travelers.   Given the benefits of these programs, it is troubling to hear about  people being unable to enroll in one of these programs, despite meeting  all of the security requirements needed to participate.   We all have an interest in ensuring that the vetting for these  programs is thorough and, where there are identifying matching errors  or other issues that may result in a qualified applicant being wrongly  rejected, the issues get addressed in a timely way.   To ensure these programs are operating effectively and consistently,  H.R. 473 directs the Government Accountability Office to review DHS'  trusted traveler programs. The GAO's study will provide important  insight into the Department's identity matching process and the redress  options available to those who are improperly rejected.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I  am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security's trusted traveler  programs are important tools in the Department's toolbox to screen  people efficiently and concentrate its resources on high-risk  travelers.   It is critical that the Department's processes to vet enrollees be  fair, consistent, and based on accurate information. The GAO assessment  directed by this bill will help drive DHS to work towards those ends.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Katko) for  introducing this bill. I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 370) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to make technical corrections to the requirement that the Secretary of  Homeland Security submit quadrennial homeland security reviews, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 370         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Quadrennial Homeland       Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall       apply with respect to a quadrennial homeland security review       conducted after December 31, 2021.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 370, the Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act.   Since 2007, the Department of Homeland Security has been required to  produce a quadrennial review of the sprawling Federal department to  help chart its course for the future. To date, DHS has issued two  Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews, or QHSRs. The third review,  which was due by December 31, 2017, was never released by the Trump  administration.   Congress mandated that DHS, like the Defense Department, undertake a  bottom-up review every 4 years in recognition of the fact that it has a  vital, complex, and ever-expanding set of missions that need to be  assessed in regular intervals to help DHS stay ahead of the constantly  evolving threats facing our country.   With the deadline for the fourth QHSR fast approaching, the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) reintroduced this  bill to ensure that deficiencies that the Government Accountability  Office identified in prior reviews are fully addressed.   In 2016, GAO issued a report that identified several weaknesses in  how the Department developed the first two QHSRs. GAO, for example,  expressed concerns about the degree to which the Department retained  documentation to explain its findings and emphasized that documentation  of the review process is essential to ensuring the repeatability of the  review process.                                time  1445    Importantly, H.R. 370 requires that DHS retain and, when requested,  provide to Congress certain documentation related to each QHSR.   It also addresses weaknesses that GAO identified with respect to  consultation with Homeland Security stakeholders and directs robust  consultation with State and local governments, academic institutions,  and other stakeholders.   Finally, H.R. 370 requires DHS to undertake and document a risk  analysis to inform its policy positions, a critical feature that was  lacking in prior reviews.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 370, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, DHS is a sprawling $50 billion  Federal agency with a diverse array of mission sets. As such, it is  critical that, every 4 years, DHS carry out a rigorous bottom-up, risk- informed review of the entire department that reflects robust  engagement with Homeland Security partners to produce a QHSR that can  drive the department's strategic vision for years to come.   Enactment of H.R. 370 will help ensure that happens and that, in the  years ahead, DHS better aligns its budgets and programs with its ever- expanding missions.   An identical version of this measure passed the House last Congress  by a vote of 415-0.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 370 and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 367) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to establish an acquisition professional career program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 367         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 710 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 711. Acquisition professional career program.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 367, the Homeland Security Acquisition  Professional Career Program Act.   H.R. 367 authorizes the Department of Homeland Security's Acquisition  Professional Career Program which, since 2008, has been credited with  helping DHS onboard over 300 new hires into its acquisition workforce.   At DHS, acquisition professionals, such as contract specialists, are  responsible for spending billions of dollars each year on the goods and  services needed for the department to carry out its missions. They  acquire everything from disaster relief supplies for FEMA to Coast  Guard cutters and software designed to protect Federal Government  networks from cyber threats.   Unfortunately, when it comes to hiring and retaining acquisitions  professionals, DHS has experienced chronic staffing shortages that, in  the view of the Government Accountability Office, create a persistent  challenge for DHS that can negatively affect the ability of DHS to  acquire vital capabilities on time and on budget.   H.R. 367 seeks to address this challenge by codifying DHS' rigorous  development program in which participants are provided with acquisition  training, mentorship, department-wide rotations, and other career  development opportunities.   Enactment of this measure will help DHS maintain a pipeline for its  acquisition workforce to directly support the department's frontline  officers and provide them with the tools that they need.   A prior version of this bill passed the House by a voice vote last  September on a bipartisan basis.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again support this  legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague  from Nevada for her leadership on this bill.   Americans look to DHS to respond after a disaster, prevent terrorism,  and protect cyberspace. Within DHS, its leaders at every level of the  organization look to the acquisition workforce to ensure that the  department has the tools needed to get the job done.   Since 2008, DHS' Acquisition Professional Career Program has created  a vital pipeline for the department to hire acquisitions professionals  who develop their knowledge and skills in house at DHS.   Enactment of H.R. 367 would ensure that DHS is able to continue to  run this successful program which the department has come to rely on to  help address chronic staffing shortages within its acquisition  workforce.   Again, I want to thank and commend the gentlewoman, Congresswoman  Titus from Nevada, who is presently presiding over the House, for her  leadership on H.R. 367.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 367. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 408) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to establish a mentor-protege program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 890A the       following new item:  ``Sec. 890B. Mentor-protege program.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 408, the Department of  Homeland Security Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2021.   Since the earliest days of the Department of Homeland Security, it  has operated a mentor-protege program to encourage large businesses to  help small businesses build their capacity to compete for government  contracts.   However, this important program was never codified in law. H.R. 408  not only authorizes the existing program but improves it.   Small businesses, including woman-, veteran-, and minority-owned  firms, are the backbone of our economy, but far too often complex  Federal contracting requirements shut them out of the Federal  marketplace.   Building and sustaining a reliable pool of small business vendors is  critical to ensuring that DHS' ever-evolving contracting needs are met  and America's security is enhanced.   H.R. 408 seeks to build and sustain this pool by incentivizing large  businesses to provide technical, managerial, and financial assistance  and subcontracting opportunities to small businesses.   The bill requires participating businesses to commit to a mentor- protege relationship for 3 years to help establish long-term  relationships between large and small contractors.   Additionally, to ensure that Congress can monitor the effectiveness  of the program in an ongoing way, it requires DHS to annually report on  program participation and the benefits conferred upon small businesses.   Enactment of H.R. 408 will ensure the continued and lasting success  of the mentor-protege program, a vital small business development  program.   It should also be noted that this bill passed the House unanimously  during the 116th Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again support this  legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, formally authorizing the  Department of Homeland Security's mentor-protege program will ensure  the continued success of this important small business program.   John Crosby, the famous conductor, once said, ``A mentor is a brain  to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction.''   DHS is to be commended for recognizing that there are small  businesses with novel technologies that want to help keep America  secure, but may lack experience in the Federal marketplace and need a  mentor to give them a push in the right direction.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin) for introducing  this bill to help grow partnerships between small businesses and DHS.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 408. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 397) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  intelligence and information sharing functions of the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to  require dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to  entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 397         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ANALYZED BY THE                     DEPARTMENT TO STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL,                     TERRITORIAL, AND PRIVATE ENTITIES WITH                     RESPONSIBILITIES RELATING TO HOMELAND SECURITY.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 397, the Chemical, Biological,  Radiological, and Nuclear Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of  2021.   This past year, we have witnessed a global pandemic dominate nearly  every aspect of American life and claim the lives of over half a  million people. As it tore through our communities, it also brought  into stark focus hard truths about inequities in our healthcare system,  the reliability of our PPE pipeline, the need for better information  sharing between the Federal Government and State, local, and private- sector partners.   The legislation before us seeks to promote timely sharing of  intelligence about chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  threats, or CBRN threats. It does so by specifically directing the  Department of Homeland Security to analyze CBRN-related terrorist  threats and share threat information with Federal, State, and local  partners.   In the event of an attack of this nature, situational awareness at  all levels of government is key. Better situational awareness is also  important to help New York City and other DHS grant recipients more  efficiently target their grant dollars to address threats.   Earlier versions of this bill overwhelmingly passed in the House in  the last three Congresses, and I urge my colleagues to support the  measure once again.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, effective prevention and  response to terrorism and naturally occurring threats start with  information-sharing.   At a time when threats are changing at such a rapid pace, H.R. 397  will help to facilitate information-sharing to better safeguard the  homeland from bad actors.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 397, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 396) to amend the Implementing Recommendations  of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to clarify certain allowable uses of  funds for public transportation security assistance grants and  establish periods of performance for such grants, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 396         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transit Security Grant       Program Flexibility Act''.       SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE USES OF FUNDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION                     SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS.         Subparagraph (A) of section 1406(b)(2) of the Implementing       Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C.       1135(b)(2); Public Law 110-53) is amended by inserting ``and       associated backfill'' after ``security training''.       SEC. 3. PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION                     SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS.         Section 1406 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/      11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53)       is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (m) as subsection (n); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (l) the following new       subsection:        ``(m) Periods of Performance.--        ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section       for a use specified in subsection (b) shall remain available       for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than       36 months.        ``(2) Exception.--Funds provided pursuant to a grant       awarded under this section for a use specified in       subparagraph (M) or (N) of subsection (b)(1) shall remain       available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not       fewer than 55 months.''.       SEC. 4. GAO REVIEW.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a review of the public transportation       security assistance grant program under section 1406 of the       Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of       2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53).        (b) Scope.--The review required under paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (1) An assessment of the type of projects funded under the       public transportation security grant program referred to in       such paragraph.        (2) An assessment of the manner in which such projects       address threats to public transportation infrastructure.        (3) An assessment of the impact, if any, of this Act       (including the amendments made by this Act) on types of       projects funded under the public transportation security       assistance grant program.        (4) An assessment of the management and administration of       public transportation security assistance grant program funds       by grantees.        (5) Recommendations to improve the manner in which public       transportation security assistance grant program funds       address vulnerabilities in public transportation       infrastructure.        (6) Recommendations to improve the management and       administration of the public transportation security       assistance grant program.        (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act and again not later than five years       after such date of enactment, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a       report on the review required under this section.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative  [[Page H1906]]  days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous  material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 396, the  Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act.   This legislation, as introduced by my colleague from New York (Mr.  Garbarino), seeks to make commonsense adjustments to a DHS grant  program that helps keep my constituents safe.   H.R. 396 requires technical changes to the Transit Security Grant  Program to allow grant funding to be used for backfill staffing when  associated with security training and give transit authorities more  time to expend grant funds on security improvements for public  transportation systems or infrastructure.   Our transit systems are absolutely vital to daily travel and  commerce. According to U.S. Census figures, 56 percent of all New  Yorkers rely on public transportation. In New York City, over 5 million  people depend on our trains and subways on a normal workday.   Under the TSGP, New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority  received about $20 million in fiscal year 2020 to protect riders from  acts of terrorism and other targeted violence.   H.R. 396 is informed by feedback from grantees about challenges with  the program over the years, and it is intended to ensure that the  Transit Security Grant Program remains current, and that funding  reaches maximum impact.   Enactment of this bill will help improve a key DHS grant program and  better secure our Nation's transportation infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, New York City has the largest  public transit system in the country, and New York City has the  greatest vulnerability to terrorism.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Garbarino, for his leadership in  advocating for transportation systems across the country.   H.R. 396 is a measure that this country needs. I believe all of us in  this body can agree that securing America's transit systems is critical  to homeland security, and so too must we invest to make and keep it  safe.   Enactment of H.R. 396 would bolster the security of what, in the view  of my constituents, is about as critical as critical infrastructure  gets and protect these systems and their riders against terrorist  attacks and targeted violence.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 396, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, Robert Leder, as his name  would suggest, was a natural leader, loved by the thousands of students  whose lives he lifted.   I, for one, would not be here were it not for Robert Leder, who set  me on a trajectory that led from public housing in the Bronx to the  House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. My story is a mere  footnote in the much larger legacy of public service that Robert Leder  left behind after his passing in 2018.   Mr. Leder entered public education in the 1960s as a Spanish teacher.  In the late 1970s, he rose to become the principal of Herbert H. Lehman  High School in the Bronx, a position he held for nearly three decades,  making him, at the time, the longest-serving educator in America's  largest city. As principal, he knew the name of every student. He held  everyone around him to the highest standards, but he held himself to  the highest standard of all.   We, the alumni of Lehman High School, will always love you, Mr.  Leder. We will never forget you.   I will not always be a Member of Congress, but I will always be the  grateful student of the greatest educator I have ever known, Robert  Leder. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
