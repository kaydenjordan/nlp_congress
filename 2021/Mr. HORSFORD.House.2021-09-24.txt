 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a champion for the Build  Back Better Act's $5 billion investment in community violence  intervention.   Last year, our country witnessed the largest spike in murder rates  since national recordkeeping began in 1960. In my home city of Las  Vegas, murders are up nearly 70 percent this year already.   This violence doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens when people  don't have hope or faith that there are better paths forward, to make  money to resolve a conflict, or to feel safe.   For decades, politicians in this Chamber have stoked fear about urban  crime to divide us while refusing to invest in real solutions. I lost  my father to gun violence, so this is not about politics for me. We  need to focus on stopping the bloodshed before it starts.   This summer, I introduced the Break the Cycle of Violence Act along  with my colleagues proposing $5 billion in funding that is now part of  the Build Back Better Act. This money will invest in proven, community- based violence intervention programs to build safer communities.   This is about saving lives, and our constituents are counting on us  to get this done.                            ____________________
