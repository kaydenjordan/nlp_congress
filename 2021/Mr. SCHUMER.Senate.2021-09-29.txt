 Madam President, on the CR, the Senate could take action  as early as today to address a concern that demands the immediate  attention of this Chamber: funding the Federal Government beyond  September 30.   To prevent a government shutdown, Senate Democrats will be  introducing a continuing resolution that keeps the government open  until early December, while also providing long-sought emergency  funding to help Americans still reeling from natural disasters from  this summer, as well as funding to help resettle Afghan refugees. We  can approve this measure quickly and send it to the House so it can  reach the President's desk before funding expires midnight tomorrow.  With so many critical issues to address, the last thing the American  people need right now is a government shutdown. This proposal will  prevent one from happening.   I want to thank my colleagues who are working quickly to prepare this  legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on debt limit, of course, once we  fund the government, we still need to address the urgent matter of  extending the debt ceiling and preserving the full faith and credit of  the United States.   To paraphrase the economist Austan Goolsbee, who just met with our  caucus this morning, throughout history, there have certainly been  governments that have defaulted on their debt, but never has there been  a default caused by pure stupidity--in this case, Republican stupidity.   Well, Democrats are working to prevent such an outcome from happening  now. Over the past week, our caucus has tried to find a workable  solution to avoid default on our sovereign debt, but the Republicans  have stymied us at every opportunity.   On Monday, we considered a continuing resolution which, among other  things, would have extended the debt ceiling until the end of 2022,  allowing us to pay for the debt incurred by the previous  administration. Republicans unanimously voted in favor of default.   So, on Tuesday, we gave Republicans another chance. We offered to  solve the debt ceiling impasse by doing exactly what Republicans  claimed they wanted all along: Raise it with only Democratic votes. We  gave them a chance to oppose it, like they said they would, and allow  Democrats to solve this problem ourselves. Again, it was precisely what  they asked for. And Leader McConnell cited this precedent several times  in the last few days as to how to get out of the debt crisis. But once  again, Republicans blocked that proposal in favor of default, and,  quite frankly, no Republican provided a good answer as to why. When  Leader McConnell came out to rebut, he didn't discuss the merits of our  proposal. He said: We don't want Democrats going forward and doing  other things.   Well, this is about debt that we have already incurred, debts from  the past, spending from the past. It is not about the future.   If we never did debt ceiling--if we always let the debt ceiling lapse  because  [[Page S6750]]  one party or the other didn't like some future action that the other  party would take, we would never do it. It is an absurd argument--an  absurd argument--because they have no real arguments because we were  doing exactly--exactly--what Republicans have asked for: Pass it with  your own votes.   So Democrats have offered Republicans multiple, entirely reasonable  ways to get out of the mess they created, but instead of stepping aside  and letting the responsible party address the debt limit, Republicans  have chosen to actively obstruct. Again, we are not asking for  Republicans to support raising the debt ceiling. If they want to stop  payments from going to veterans and Social Security recipients, be our  guest. We are just asking for Republicans to get out of the way. Get  out of the way, and let us do what they say they wanted us to do: Raise  the debt ceiling without their votes.   Time is short. The danger is real. Yesterday, the Treasury Secretary  wrote that if the debt ceiling is not addressed by October 18, the  government could enter a catastrophic default--catastrophic--for the  first time in history.   Secretary Yellen's warning was unmistakable. A default would be  ``disastrous for the American economy, global financial market and  millions of families and workers whose financial security would be  jeopardized by a delay in payments.'' Yet, every day, the outcome grows  more and more likely because of Republican intransigence, because  Republicans are deliberately preventing the government from being able  to pay its bills.   Now, in solving this crisis, this body cannot and will not go through  a drawn-out, unpredictable process sought by the minority leader. It  risks the full faith and credit of the United States. To do this  through reconciliation requires ping-ponging separate bills back from  the Senate and the House. It is unchartered waters. Individual Senators  could move to delay and delay and delay. It is very risky and could  well lead us to default, even if only one Senator wanted that to  happen. That is very possible. So you can't do it this route. Everyone  who has studied it knows it is risky, and it is simply a political  gambit by Leader McConnell, who has changed his tune several different  times. He said over and over again: Just you Democrats vote for it. We  give them that chance. Now, he has backed off that and moved into this  untenable excuse. It is not a real answer.   If the Republicans really want to prevent a default like they claim  they do, they should step aside and let Democrats do the responsible  thing. As default gets closer and closer to becoming a reality, our  Republican colleagues will be forced to ask themselves how long they  are going to keep playing political games while the economic stability  of our country is at risk. At stake is the well-being of millions of  Americans who did not ask for any of this and would suffer immensely  because of Republican obstruction. If Republicans choose to keep making  this harder, if Republicans choose to drag out this process, they will  own the consequences of their default.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are three bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.
