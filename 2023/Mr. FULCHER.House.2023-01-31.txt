 Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the State of Washington  and my colleague from the State of Montana and I share some very  similar concerns and some very similar demographics, so I am here to  rise in opposition to the attempts to ban any kind of aerial fire  retardant.   Currently, the Forest Service is facing litigation that, if its  opponent is successful, could result in the loss of this critical  firefighting tool.   Aerial fire retardant helps slow the spread of wildfires and creates  a barrier between the fire and unburned fuel load. This makes it easier  for ground crews to access and extinguish fires. It can be applied  quickly in hard-to-reach areas where the ground crews cannot get  access.   Additionally, aerial fire retardant can help protect homes and other  structures, as well as reduce the amount of smoke produced by the fire.   We are seeing the catastrophic results of years of neglect and  mismanagement by the Federal Government. It comes in the form of more  frequent and more destructive wildfires. These fires not only do more  harm to people and property but also to nature itself.   If I can be very clear, our Federal resources are overwhelmed. In my  own State, two-thirds of the land mass, or nearly two-thirds, is  Federal land. They simply don't have the capacity to manage these  lands, and so they don't.   That results in wildfire, and we need every tool in the toolbox we  possibly can access to fight it.   As we prepare for the 2023 fire season, we must maximize these tools  at our disposal in order to better fight the fires that threaten our  local communities, economies, environment, and health.
