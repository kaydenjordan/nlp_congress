 Mr. Speaker, I looked at the calendar today and saw  there was no Dream Act vote on the floor this week. As we approach  tomorrow, a potential CR, Republican and Democrats must support this  bipartisan Dream Act.   These are hardworking men and women, young people. They are doctors  and artists, scientists and police officers, mentors and EMTs. These  are Americans through and through.   We made a promise that we must keep. We need to protect the rights  and principles that our country was founded on and thrives upon.   We demand a vote for a clean Dream Act today. We demand a vote for a  clean Dream Act tomorrow.                            ____________________
