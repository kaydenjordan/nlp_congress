 Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, the Census reported  that the U.S. population grew at its slowest rate since the Great  Depression. Birth rates are falling for the sixth year in a row.   A recent Harvard Business Review study declared that the United  States has the most family-hostile policies of any industrialized  country in the world. This is a wake-up moment for us, and this is why  H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, couldn't be more  important, particularly for the unheard, the suffering expectant mother  who has to time when she can go to the bathroom.   I hear from teachers all across Michigan who explain this to me: the  woman who is bleeding and bloating and wondering when she can check in  with her doctor, and then being egregiously pushed out of the  workplace.   We are talking about stools, we are talking about a place for a  pregnant woman to sit in the workplace. That is why it is so joyous,  Mr. Speaker, that this bill today is bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of this  legislation on behalf of the 1.4 million AFSCME workers.                                                         AFSCME,                                       Washington, DC, May 11, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to support the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) (H.R. 1065). This legislation       would ensure that pregnant workers get adequate       accommodations when they need them without facing retaliation       in the workplace. It also prevents employers from refusing to       make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers unless it       poses an undue hardship on an employer.        More than four decades after Congress passed the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978, women still face inequality       in the workplace when they become pregnant. While the PDA       prohibits discrimination against employees based on       pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,       pregnancy discrimination is still prevalent. In 2015, the       Supreme Court ruled in Young v. UPS to allow pregnant workers       to bring discrimination claims under the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978. The Young decision also set       an unreasonably high standard for proving discrimination.        Research shows that 88 percent of first-time mothers worked       during their last trimester. Employees who are pregnant are       routinely denied water bottles, bathroom breaks, stools to       sit on, and larger fitting uniforms to work in. Many of these       hardships can lead to an increased risk of pre-term delivery       and low birth rate. In addition, for far too many working       women, being pregnant can still mean losing a job, being       denied a promotion, or not being hired in the first place.       And, while women are the majority of the U.S. workforce,       these realities perpetuate challenges that no employee should       have to face.        H.R. 1065 is also important because many pregnant women are       front-line workers who hold physically demanding or hazardous       jobs. Now more than ever, pregnant women working on the front       lines and deemed essential by their employers face the risk       of getting sick because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of       them also lack access to paid sick leave forcing them to       choose between a paycheck and their health. At no time should       anyone ever be forced to choose between financial security       and a healthy pregnancy especially during the coronavirus       pandemic with countless women working on the front lines.       While many states have adopted laws requiring reasonable       accommodations, current federal law does not plainly state       that workers have a right to ask for them to reduce pregnancy       complications without jeopardizing their employment. Pregnant       women's lives and livelihood are on the line when they cannot       work safely. This bill is essential to promote gender equity,       healthy pregnancies, children and family wellness, and the       economic security of pregnant and parenting women over the       course of their terms.        AFSCME strongly supports H.R. 1065 and urges you to vote       for its passage.            Sincerely,                                                Bailey K. Childers,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Madam Speaker, this week honors law enforcement officers  who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities,  and it also recognizes the incredible contributions, hard work,  dedication, and loyalty of our law enforcement officers.   I rise to recognize the nine law enforcement officers who lost their  lives last year while serving Michigan: Stephen Splan, of Bloomfield  Hills, Michigan; Jonathan Parnell, of Wayne County; Waldis Johnson, of  Wayne County; William Darnell, of DeWitt Township; Caleb Starr, of the  Michigan State Police; our beloved Benny Napoleon, of Wayne County;  Bryant Searcy, of Wayne County; Dean Savard, of Wayne County; and  Donafay Collins, of Wayne County.   We also remember our beloved Collin Rose, who lost his life in 2016  to gun violence while serving at Wayne State. Our community rose up to  support his family. We honor his contributions.   My friend, Eddie Osmond, the owner of a Marathon gas station, used  pennies on the dollar as people were pumping their gas to raise $10,000  for this man's family.   That is part of what we are here to recognize, the contributions of  our law enforcement officers.                            ____________________
