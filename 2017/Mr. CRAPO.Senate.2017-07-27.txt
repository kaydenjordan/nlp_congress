 I thank Senator Corker. Mr. President, I thank, too, all  those who were mentioned: the Foreign Relations leadership, Senator  Corker and Senator Cardin; Senator Brown, my colleague in the Banking  Committee; and all the others who have been so involved in this issue.   This is one of the examples of how we can work together in a  bipartisan fashion to craft critical legislation for protecting and  strengthening America. Frankly, it is past time for us to stand strong  as a nation in response to the increasing aggression that we see in  Russia around the world--whether it be in Ukraine, in Crimea, in Syria,  in facilitating corruption globally, or in the cyber security attacks  we have seen that have been directed not only at us but at our allies  across the world.   It is very important that we implement this legislation. I am glad to  see the solid bipartisanship that we have been able to build. I also  hope that we can build this bipartisanship on many, many other issues.   We are going to be looking at North Korea, as has already been said.  I am hopeful and confident that we will stand again on this floor soon  as we deal with the threats we face from North Korea.   Again, I thank all of those who have worked so closely with us on  this legislation and appreciate the opportunity for us to move forward,  united tonight on this critical issue.   I yield back.
