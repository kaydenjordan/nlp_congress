 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3441.   The right of workers to collectively bargain under the National Labor  Relations Act is essential for them to secure fair wages and working  conditions. For workers to be able to bargain effectively they have to  have someone across the table to bargain with, the party or parties  that control their hours, wages, benefits and work environment.  Negotiation with themselves would be a futile exercise.   H.R. 3441 would eviscerate the definition of an employer to the point  that not only might the true employer not have to come to the table but  it might be possible that no employer would have to come to the table.   Current joint employer standards take into account modern hiring  trends, where about three million people work for temporary staffing  agencies, working for companies that do not directly pay them, and  ensure employee protections.   The recent NLRB General Counsel determination in Freshii--where a  restaurant franchisor with over 100 stores was not held to be a joint  employer because its control over its franchisees was generally limited  to brand standards and food quality and did not exercise control of the  terms and conditions of employment of its franchisee's employees-- illustrates the pathway available to franchisors. I am concerned that  this legislation actually harms franchisees by making them responsible  for decisions dictated by their franchisors.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3441.
