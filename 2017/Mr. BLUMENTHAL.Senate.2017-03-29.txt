 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here on behalf of 55 million  working Americans who lack access to retirement savings plans through  their employers. These numbers underscore a very, very uncomfortable  truth for many Americans--that there is a looming retirement crisis in  our Nation.   Congress must do more to preserve, protect, and strengthen retirement  savings for all Americans. I come to the floor to express my strong  opposition to the legislation before us, which would do precisely the  opposite.   H.J. Res. 67 would tear down ongoing efforts at the State and  municipal levels to assist, not obstruct, hard-working Americans in  preparing for financially stable and rewarding retirements.   I also want to express my very deep concern about efforts by my  Republican colleagues to force a vote on H.J. Res. 66 in the very near  future. I would advise my colleagues to reconsider their taking action  on both of these misguided proposals right away.   While many private sector employers have the option to set up and  their employees have the choice to contribute to their own retirement  savings accounts, fewer than 10 percent of workers who are without  access to a workplace plan contribute to retirement savings accounts  outside of their employers.   To address this growing issue, in August of 2016, under the guidance  of the Obama administration, the Department of Labor promulgated what  has become known as the State-sponsored auto-IRA rule. This rule  provides critical guidance for States on how to administer programs  that are designed to improve access to retirement accounts among  private sector employees. These State-facilitated retirement programs  would allow State governments to provide automatic enrollment in State- sponsored IRA programs, with there being the opportunity to opt out at  any time.   There are misguided and progressive proposals that seek to overturn  the critical rulemaking that protects Americans in this process. If  passed, these resolutions, very simply, will cripple ongoing efforts on  the State level to ensure that retirement savings opportunities are  more readily available for all workers.   In my home State of Connecticut, we have led efforts to find secure  and innovative ways to address the growing retirement savings gap for  nearly 600,000 working people in Connecticut who lack access to  employer-based retirement savings. The Connecticut Retirement Security  Authority has led this effort. It was created in 2016, and it is based  on almost 2 years of market research, public hearings, meetings, and  broad input from employers, potential participants, and representatives  of the financial sector.   We are moving in the right direction in Connecticut. Programs that  represent a strong step in the right direction have been fostered and  built by encouraging State facilitation with private providers. These  plans allow workers access to secure, low-cost retirement savings  accounts in Connecticut. That effort would be set back by these  proposals to undercut and reverse progress made at the Federal level.  Incomprehensibly, these bills would severely undercut efforts to  promote State and city auto-IRA programs. It is a blatant attack on  these programs and  [[Page S2095]]  on working families in Connecticut and elsewhere.   I urge my colleagues who believe that Congress should spend time in  expanding, not limiting, access to innovative solutions to the American  savings crisis to join me in opposing these resolutions.   They have broad economic implications. They set back job creation as  well as economic progress. There are 55 million individuals--many of  them in Connecticut--who lack the ability to save for retirement  directly from their paychecks. This gap is exacerbated by the fact that  nearly 20 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 64 have,  virtually, zero in retirement savings. That is true of Connecticut and  every State in our country.   A lack of retirement savings leads to disastrous results and  jeopardizes access to adequate meals, healthcare, and other  necessities. Simply put, no American family and, certainly, no  Connecticut family should be deterred or discouraged from planning for  the future by saving responsibly.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on H.J. Res. 66 and H.J.  Res. 67 because States and municipalities should have the flexibility  to implement proven strategies to support hard-working Americans who  wish to prepare themselves for retirement.                   Russia and Trump Campaign Investigation    Mr. President, I find in Connecticut--and, I am sure, my colleagues  find around the country--that Americans are outraged and appalled by  Russia's disinformation campaign that has been waged against our free  and fair electoral process. There is no question now--the intelligence  agencies have confirmed it--that Russia interfered in the campaign of  this latest election.   Our electoral process is the bedrock of our democracy. Russian  interference in our election is an attack on our democracy. Indeed, it  is an attack on America. Some believe--and I join them in this  concern--that it is an act of war.   As appalling as the Russians' actions have been, I am equally--if not  more--concerned about the ``see no evil, hear no evil'' attitude of  this administration. It was aided in its election by Russia's campaign  of disinformation, malign theft, its dissemination of private data,  propaganda, and cyber attack. That cyber attack was unconscionable and  unprecedented in its scope and scale.   Our Nation's intelligence community has provided chilling and  absolutely horrifying confirmation of this Russian interference in our  democracy. Yet the White House continually dismisses these reports.  This week, we are learning that they actually may be actively  interfering with and trying to redirect efforts by Congress to discover  the full extent of Russia's cyber intrusion.   The bottom line here is that only a special prosecutor at the  Department of Justice can apply sunlight and conduct a vigorous,  independent investigation. Only a special prosecutor can remove this  stain on our democracy. Only a special prosecutor can provide our  Nation with assurance that wrongdoing will be effectively investigated  and then charged and prosecuted. Only a special prosecutor can give us  the closure we need and deserve.   Every day, evidence mounts pointing to the need to investigate these  Russian ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. The more we learn,  the more troubled and outraged the American people become.   Just this week, revelations have surfaced that Representative Nunes,  chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the House, met on White House  grounds with a source who showed him secret American intelligence  reports that he then used to defend President Trump's claims that his  closest associates were under surveillance by the Obama administration.  That this information actually came from a meeting at the White House  has intensified questions about where the information actually  originated and whether the President's team is actually meddling in the  congressional investigation. Chairman Nunes's actions have fatally  tainted the House Intelligence Committee investigation and infected it  with the virus of partisan bias.   Just yesterday, we also learned, based on letters obtained by the  Washington Post, that the Trump administration sought to block former  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the  House investigation, adding additional taint. We all recall she is the  one who blew the whistle on the real risk of General Flynn being  blackmailed by the Kremlin. Instead of thanking her, the President  fired her. After firing her for doing her job, the administration is  now intent on stopping her as a witness from revealing exactly what the  President knew about his adviser's ties to foreign interests.   The House investigation is incontrovertibly compromised by having a  Trump surrogate running and organizing it and the administration--at  least in appearance and likely in reality--controlling its access to  the facts.   There is a growing body of evidence that clearly and unmistakably  indicates that the Trump campaign and his associates were in contact  with Russia during the election, and these deeply troubling claims of  coordination with a foreign government to influence an American  election deserve exacting and aggressive investigation.   The declassified report from the intelligence community clearly  identifies Russia Today as a state-sponsored propaganda source that was  integral to Putin's campaign to interfere in that election, and it  makes it equally clear, and deplorably so, that former National  Security Advisor Flynn accepted $45,000 to praise Russia Today in  Moscow and dine with Putin at the network's request.   We know as well that Attorney General Sessions and Jared Kushner, the  President's son-in-law and now senior adviser, had unreported meetings  with Russian officials, including the head of a Russian bank under U.S.  sanctions. The President's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort,  funneled millions of dollars into offshore accounts from a Russian  oligarch through the Bank of Cyprus, which was owned at the time by  Wilbur Ross, now serving as the President's Commerce Secretary.   These contacts form a network of facts and suspicion, but more than  suspicion, there are real sources of information and facts. As Ronald  Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''   These disclosures are all the more reason--indeed, compelling  evidence--that a special prosecutor is necessary to investigate  Russia's ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. Immediate,  aggressive measures to hold Russia accountable and deter further  aggression must be taken. Those actions must be based on facts as well,  but we must acknowledge publicly that the need for deterrence requires  effective responses, appropriate and necessary measures to send a  message and inflict the kind of cost that is necessary to show Russia  that we will never accept these kinds of attacks. At stake is not only  Russia's view of this country and deterrence to further attacks but  also the credibility and trust of the American people in the Department  of Justice, and that is where a special prosecutor is absolutely vital.   I support the work of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, and I  trust the members of that committee to do their work responsibly. I  believe as well that we should have a select committee--or, even  better, an independent commission--that will make findings of fact,  produce recommendations, have public proceedings, and then, in the  interest of full transparency and disclosure, produce a report with  recommendations that will help provide a path to avoid these kinds of  attacks on our democracy in the future and potential collusion between  Americans and those attacks.   I believe that an independent commission would serve a worthwhile  purpose, but neither the Intelligence Committee, nor a select  committee, nor an independent commission can do what is equally  important, which is prosecute wrongdoers. None of these bodies, whether  congressional or independent commission, can investigate criminal  wrongdoing so as to assure an effective and successful prosecution.  That work must be done with the FBI and supervision of an independent,  special prosecutor who can investigate vigorously and independently and  then take action and bring charges if they are warranted.   I support the investigation of the Intelligence Committee, which  should do its work, the appointment of a select committee that can  produce findings of fact and a report and recommendation,  [[Page S2096]]  and an independent commission that can do the same kind of public,  transparent, open disclosure. A special prosecutor does not produce a  report; they and the team will produce a prosecution, if it is  warranted. They are the only ones who can prosecute.   We cannot stand idle while Russia interferes and threatens our  political infrastructure, which now includes our electoral system.  Neither can we stand idle while our Department of Justice is leaderless  or, worse yet, has a prosecutor who also may be tainted by the fact  that he reports to the Attorney General or to the President. The  Attorney General has recused himself, with good reason, because he was  implicated in allegations surrounding collusion between the Trump  campaign and the Russian interference.   The allegations of collusion are serious. They must be investigated,  and the investigation and potential prosecution must be done by someone  who is independent--a special prosecutor. Revelation upon revelation  day after day leaves us with no choice. In fact, we had no choice well  before now, but the disclosures that have surfaced just within the last  hours and days confirm that justice will not be vindicated unless we  have a special prosecutor. That is why I have chosen to block the  nomination and confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General. I will  consider doing it with other nominees as well. I feel so strongly--and  I hope my colleagues do as well--that a special prosecutor is necessary  to vindicate justice, to make sure that Americans have trust and  confidence in our Department of Justice and in the ability of the  United States to protect its democracy and the integrity of its  electoral process.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
