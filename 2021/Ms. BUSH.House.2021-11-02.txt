 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise, many of us being  survivors of sexual harassment and violence, because we are tired of  victim blaming. We are tired of being told that if we had just done  this or done that it wouldn't have happened to us. We are tired of  being told to feel guilty about what we wore or what we said. We are  tired of our truth being dismissed.   Today, I rise to change the narrative and give some tips instead for  how to prevent sexual violence. So let's talk about it.   If you are thinking about putting drugs in someone's drink, don't.   If you can't keep yourself from committing sexual assault, always  have a trusted friend by your side to stop you from committing sexual  assault.   If you encounter someone who is drunk, unconscious or asleep, do not  commit sexual assault against that person.   If you see someone walking by themselves, just leave them alone.   If you are worried about committing sexual assault, make sure you  wear something that will remind you not to, like a sign or a sticker.   If you think you might commit sexual assault, always carry a whistle.  When you find yourself about to commit sexual assault, blow the whistle  until someone else stops you.   To every survivor of sexual violence, know that no matter how hard  the media or your peers or your family or others try to make you feel  that what happened to you was your fault, it was not.   Hear me when I say this: It was not your fault.   Know that your congresswoman is working every day to build a world  where sexual violence no longer exists, a world where survivors are  protected, where we have access to the care that we need, which  includes abortion care, a world where the instinct to blame the  survivors is replaced with one to provide healing and care.   Know that in this moment that I love you and that there are others  who love you and want to make sure you are healthy, and you are  protected. We see you. We hear you. We love you.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the advocates for giving us all these great  tips.                            ____________________
