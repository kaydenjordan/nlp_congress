 Reserving the right to object, I want to say a few words  about this matter.  [[Page S2176]]    Two months ago, I sent a letter to the Attorney General demanding  answers why the Department of Justice was hanging out to dry four  deputy U.S. marshals who had bravely defended the Portland courthouse  against leftwing street militias in the summer of 2020. Those marshals  are now facing civil litigation, but the Department is refusing to  defend them in court, putting them at risk of bankruptcy, and perhaps  most alarming of all, it won't even tell them why.   Now, the Department still hasn't provided definitive answers; and  after I raised this alarm, they took another step and put the marshals  on limited duty, telling them that after 20 months of active  unrestricted duty they are now under investigation for the events in  Portland. That is despite the fact that they received an award for  their actions in Portland, received outstanding and excellent  performance evaluations for 2020, and were, again, deployed to some of  the most dangerous and high-risk missions that our law enforcement  officers can undertake.   Call me crazy, but I have to say this seems like a case of potential  retaliation. But it does, in a way, give the marshals the information  we were seeking to help them understand their status. I also understand  that at least one marshal has filed a complaint for retaliation against  Vanita Gupta, the Assistant Attorney General.   The facts will come out one way or another. My message to the  Department of Justice today is this: You will be held accountable for  your actions against these law enforcement officers if they are  inappropriate or even unlawful. If not this year, it will happen next  year because I also want to add that yesterday, I and several of my  colleagues, including the Judiciary Committee's ranking member Senator  Grassley and the former Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Graham,  sent a letter to the Department about this investigation. We intend to  get to the bottom of it, and we are committed to an oversight  investigation in the 118th Congress if one doesn't occur in this  Congress.   I have also spoken to our Republican colleagues on the House  Judiciary Committee who have today issued a request to the Department  of Justice to preserve documents in this matter.   Now that I am confident the Department will receive the oversight  that it deserves in this matter, I will no longer object to these  nominees. Therefore, given these developments in this matter, I will  withdraw my objection to the confirmation of today's nominees.    I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to complete  my remarks before the scheduled vote at 3:30.    Madam President, 200 years ago today, one of our Nation's  greatest heroes was born. Ulysses S. Grant rose from humble beginnings  to stand next to Lincoln and Washington as one of America's  indispensable men. This great defender of America won our bloodiest  war, crushed the darkest forces of disunion, bandaged our deepest  national wounds, and bridged the greatest political divides. He was an  unshakable pillar of strength upon which this Nation's future rested  time and again.   Virtually no one foresaw Grant's rise to greatness before the Civil  War. Although he had graduated from West Point and distinguished  himself as a soldier in the Mexican-American War, he had later stumbled  from one failure to another in business.   In 1861, Grant was a man bent by humiliation and ridicule but  unbroken.  [[Page S2177]]  After the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter, Grant rose from his knees  as destiny called, he redonned his uniform, and he marched into the  history books.   For the first 3 years of the Civil War, Grant fought on the western  front, winning several of the Union's early victories while commanders  in the East dithered. After Grant's first great victory, his  Confederate counterpart sued for peace and asked what terms he would  give them. Grant firmly responded that he would accept ``no terms  except an unconditional and immediate surrender.'' This earned him the  nickname ``Unconditional Surrender'' Grant and resulted in the largest  capture of enemy troops in the history of the Western Hemisphere up to  that time.   Grant waged a relentless form of warfare. He knew that, in his words,  ``the art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at  him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can and as often as  you can, and keep moving on.''   Grant's warrior spirit famously moved President Lincoln to declare  ``I can't spare this man--he fights.'' When Grant's enemies spread the  rumor that he was an alcoholic and should be dismissed, Lincoln wryly  responded that if he could find out what brand of whiskey Grant drank,  he would send a barrel of it to all the other commanders.   Grant's famous determination and grit were on full display during the  brutal Battle of Shiloh, one of the bloodiest episodes of the Civil  War. In the first day of fighting, Grant's army was mauled by  Confederate forces under the command of Albert Sidney Johnston, the  Confederacy's most competent general at the time.   William Tecumseh Sherman approached Grant that rainy night beneath a  great oak tree and he said, ``Well, Grant, we have had the devil's own  day, haven't we?''   Grant replied, between puffs of his ubiquitous cigar, ``Yes. Lick em  tomorrow though.'' He made good on this promise, threw back the  Confederate forces, and won the carnage-filled battle.    Sidney Johnston was killed in the fighting, and Confederate President  Jefferson Davis later wrote that ``it was the turning point of our  fate.''   This story remains so legendary in the Army today that it was  commonplace for young officers in the Iraq war to conclude a hard day  by borrowing from Grant: ``Lick em tomorrow.''   Grant continued his brilliant streak of victories, and on July 4,  1863--the 87th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of  Independence--he seized the fortress city of Vicksburg on the  Mississippi, splitting the Confederacy in two and securing the Union's  control of that mighty river. This was perhaps the greatest strategic  victory of the war, and combined with the victory at Gettysburg the  previous day, Grant's seizure of Vicksburg put the Union on the path to  victory.   Soon after Grant's decisive victory in the Battle of Chattanooga a  few months later and capture of the supposedly impregnable heights of  Missionary Ridge, Lincoln promoted him to the rank of lieutenant  general--a position that no one had held since George Washington. A few  days later, Lincoln also named him commander of Union forces.   In his new command, Grant quickly turned eastward and confronted  Robert E. Lee, a skilled tactician who had run circles around the Army  of the Potomac for 2 years. Lee had spooked Union commanders for so  long with his audacious battle plans but not Grant. He said:         I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to       do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to       turn a double somersault and land in our rear and on both our       flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to       think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee       is going to do.    What Grant did was pursue Lee's army ruthlessly. As he marched into  the Confederacy, he told a reporter:         If you see the President, tell him from me that whatever       happens, there will be no turning back.''    In the weeks and months that followed, Grant attacked Lee's army  again and again. Whether he won or not, Grant continued to advance  deeper into the Confederacy. Grant's army fought in the burning forests  of the wilderness and in the muddy trenches of Petersburg, experiencing  extraordinary hardship but never allowing Lee to regroup or  reinvigorate his shrinking army. Less than a year after Grant began his  overland campaign, the Union forces finally took the rebel capital of  Richmond and broke the back of Confederate resistance.   But U.S. Grant wasn't a great leader simply because he won the war;  he was also great because he never lost sight of the first goal of the  war: to reunite our shattered Republic and restore what Lincoln had  called the ``bonds of affection'' and the ``mystic chords of memory''  between Americans, North and South.   Instead of humiliating Lee at Appomattox Court House, Grant offered  him generous and honorable terms. Uncompromising in war, Grant was  magnanimous in peace. He allowed Confederate officers to keep their  sidearms and horses, did not demand Lee's sword, and promised not to  prosecute rebels who laid down their arms. As Lee departed the  courthouse, Grant and his staff took off their hats in respect--a small  act for the victors but an extraordinary gesture to the defeated  Confederates.   Grant remained in the Army after Appomattox and continued to be a  force for reconciliation and union as we stitched the stars back on Old  Glory. He didn't allow vengeance or anger to overcome prudence and  wisdom. He even defended his former antagonist Robert E. Lee when  President Andrew Johnson tried to renege on the terms of Grant's  surrender agreement. When Johnson asked Grant ``When can these men be  tried?'' Grant replied ``Never, not unless they break their parole.''  He went so far as to tell his staff that ``I will not stay in the Army  if they break the pledges that I made.'' To Grant, his word was more  important than any office. Thanks to his principled stand, Johnson  backed down, and our Nation avoided cycles of fruitless recrimination.  At the same time, Grant also opposed Johnson's attempts to weaken  Reconstruction and leave newly freed slaves exposed to inhumane  treatment by vengeful former masters. Grant wanted neither excessive  punishment nor excessive lenience; he wanted justice.   Never a politician, Grant nevertheless acquiesced to popular demand  and Republican entreaties to run for President in 1868 on the simple  platform ``Let us have peace.'' Although his administration was  imperfect, he fought to make good on his promise. He continued his work  to bring the South back into the Union, restoring the rights of  citizenship to over 150,000 former rebels and bringing Robert E. Lee to  the White House as a symbol of reconciliation.   Grant was also one of the greatest civil rights Presidents in our  Nation's history, protecting freed slaves with laws and, when  necessary, with force. When the first Ku Klux Klan terrorized the  South, Grant ordered and empowered the Department of Justice and the  Army to destroy it, and it was destroyed.   Grant also healed the wounds that the Civil War had inflicted on our  relationship with other nations. He settled a spiraling diplomatic  crisis with Great Britain, provoked by Britain's decision to allow  Confederate warships to be built in its ports, which went on to sink  over 150 Union ships. After years of negotiation, the United States and  Great Britain signed the Treaty of Washington, in which Great Britain  formally apologized for its support of the Confederacy. The treaty  further established an independent commission to assess damages  inflicted on American commerce, which in turn ordered the British to  pay our country over $15 million in damages. Grant also worked to  settle other outstanding concerns in the treaty, paving the path to  strong relations with Great Britain in the future.   After his Presidency, Grant sadly was conned in business ventures and  fell deeply into debt. But even as he lay dying of cancer, he resolved  to provide for his family. A week before his death, he completed his  memoirs, a monumental literary achievement that continues to rank among  the greatest ever written by any statesman. He also saved his family  from debt, demonstrating one last time his indomitable will.   Grant's funeral procession was the largest public demonstration in  American history up to that point, with an  [[Page S2178]]  estimated 1\1/2\ million Americans in attendance.   Frederick Douglass described Grant as ``a man too broad for  prejudice, too humane to despise the humblest, too great to be small at  any point.'' Douglass saw in Grant ``a protector'' to freed Blacks, ``a  friend'' to Indians, ``a brother'' to vanquished foes, and ``a savior''  for our imperiled Nation.   Yet progressive historians, a partisan press, and political enemies  tarnished his record from the beginning. They have maligned him as a  drunk and a butcher and a bumbling western rube who was ill-suited to  politics and probably corrupt at that. This is an ahistorical slander  against a great American.   As a deeply honest man and a Washington outsider, Grant perhaps  wasn't always astute in spotting the unscrupulous swindlers and  grifters attracted to our capital then as now. As President, he trusted  some who didn't deserve that trust. His critics have exaggerated this  guilelessness as a mortal sin, using dishonesty of others to besmirch  the record of a good and great man. But Douglas was right; Grant was  ``a savior'' of this Republic, and his few failings pale in comparison  to his extraordinary achievements. And Grant's countrymen agreed,  electing him twice by historic landslides.   I have four photos hanging on the wall of my Senate office, photos of  great statesmen who saved the West in our hour of crisis: Abraham  Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, and U.S. Grant. Throughout  his life, U.S. Grant embodied a profound patriotism and selflessness  that our Nation should remember with awe and reverence. On this  bicentenary of his birth, we should restore him to the pantheon of  American heroes, first among Americans.
