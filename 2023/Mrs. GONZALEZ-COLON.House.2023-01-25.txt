 Mr. Speaker, I would say, first of all, that I  thank Chairman Graves for his leadership and for acting so swiftly to  bring this bill to the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise in support of my bill, H.R. 255. I thank  Representatives Scott Peters of California, Stacey Plaskett of the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Neal Dunn of Florida for cosponsoring this  legislation.   H.R. 255 would establish a process to identify ways to streamline and  consolidate the collection of certain disaster information to start the  recovery process for individuals and families that were devastated by  any natural disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I hear about these issues with delays and confusion  related to requirements and processing of disaster assistance on a  regular basis. I meet with mayors of the island--and this is just in  the case of Puerto Rico--but I know we do have the same process and the  same situation across the Nation. This is a significant source of  frustration for my mayors and my constituents as well as people all  over the country.   While FEMA is the lead Federal agency on disasters, many others are  also often involved in disaster response and recovery, like, for  example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small  Business Administration, just to name a few.   In the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, and the  seismic activity in Puerto Rico in 2020, we discovered that Federal  agency after Federal agency would require the same information in their  preliminary assessments, which meant tens of thousands of site and  damage assessments.   We see some of this repeating itself in the aftermath of last year's  Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida and with  other disasters across the Nation.   This is not just a bill for the islands or the territories. This is a  bill for the rest of the Nation on how to manage and get expedited help  and response from Federal agencies.   Currently, there is no process to share these assessments among  Federal agencies, which ultimately causes significant delays for  immediate relief and prolongs recovery. This is compounded by other  administrative issues like frequent staff changes and constituents and  mayors having to work with multiple personnel to handle a single  application or request.  [[Page H295]]    In 2020, FEMA finally decided to begin consolidating assessments for  Puerto Rico to speed up the delivery process across multiple Federal  agencies. Many of these assessments are small, often one part of a  larger project, which has continuously slowed down the recovery  process.    H.R. 255 would establish a Federal working group led by FEMA, in  collaboration with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity  and Efficiency, to identify ways to reduce duplication and modernize  the Federal management assessment process to make it truly agile and  efficient. We need to ensure assistance is provided while safeguarding  taxpayer funds. I think with this bill we can do both.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is critical that these agencies are working  together to minimize overlaps in their assessments and consider the use  of the newest technologies to streamline processes. Very often, we, in  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have these same  discussions about what happened in Louisiana, what happened in Florida,  what happened on the East Coast, what happened on the West Coast every  time we have a natural disaster. It always is the same problem.   I trust this bill will expedite disaster recovery across the Nation.  As we have learned in Puerto Rico, it is not if the next disaster will  occur, it is when it is going to happen and how we are going to face  it.   Every 1st of June, another hurricane season begins for the  territories and the eastern coast. Since the last time this language  passed the House in the 117th Congress, we had another direct hit with  Hurricane Fiona.   I am pleased we are considering this bill so early in this 118th  Congress, and that is the reason I thanked our chairman for his  marvelous job bringing this bill to the floor.   I can, therefore, work quickly to make this proposal the law of the  land as part of our efforts to better prepare for disaster response.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 259, the  Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act.   Again, I thank Chairman Graves for moving forward with this  bipartisan initiative, for making it possible so early in this  Congress, and for it to be considered today.   I also thank my sister from the Virgin Islands, Stacey Plaskett, as  well as Representatives Malliotakis and Cleaver for their support and  as cosponsors on this legislation.  [[Page H297]]    H.R. 259 would provide an innovative and comprehensive approach to  tracking Federal disaster projects and assistance, as well as the  funds.   It establishes a single online repository to report information about  Federal disaster assistance to provide transparency to the American  taxpayer.   This proposal, developed in collaboration with the Project of  Government Oversight, would establish a subpage for transparency of  disaster assistance on the USASpending.gov website to better inform the  public about the status of the use of disaster funding. And believe me,  Mr. Speaker, every time I go back to the district every weekend this is  the first question I receive from my constituents: What happened with  the funds to the bridge?   What happened with the funds to the school?   What happened to the funds to the roads that are still damaged 5  years after a hurricane?   Many people ask themselves these questions: Where is the Federal  funding that has been approved by Congress?   Where is the money that has been allocated to the Federal agencies?   Does a contractor have it?   Did the local government spend the money well?   Those are general questions that everybody, at least in Puerto Rico,  are asking.   So this bill would require agencies that offered disaster assistance,  including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small  Business Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and many  others, to regularly submit updated information to the Office of  Management and Budget to ensure that the best possible data is  available in an easily accessible format.   The data to be published would include: the amount of disaster  assistance provided by the agencies; the amount of disaster assistance  that has been obligated or expended to projects or activities; and a  detailed list of all projects or activities for which disaster  assistance dispersed by the agency was expended, obligated, or used,  including a description of the project or activity, as well as an  evaluation of the completion status of that project.   I think this will help not just the general public, not just American  taxpayers, but also the government agencies to know where the funding  is and when those projects are going to be completed.   During the last few years, my district, like many others represented  here in the House, has faced multiple hardships due to disasters. In  Puerto Rico, we are still working through the aftermath of Hurricanes  Irma and Maria, the earthquakes of 2020, and last year's Hurricane  Fiona. Much of the support has been approved for rebuilding--this  Congress passed legislation allocating billions of Federal funding not  just to Puerto Rico, but to Texas, to California, and to many other  States--and, of course, we need better accountability and oversight to  ensure this funding is being used as intended by Congress.   H.R. 259 will foster accessibility and transparency of information to  track Federal funding and its status. It will also enable local mayors  and legislators, nongovernmental organizations, and individual  constituents to know what funding has been used for, where the funding  will go, and how much funding is left to be spent, among other  information.    In Puerto Rico we have put money here for hospitals, for piers, and  for bridges, and people don't even know where the money is because the  projects have not even begun yet. This kind of information will not  only help Federal and local agencies but mostly the American taxpayers.   This will allow better awareness of progress and utilization of  resources and to ensure that streams of available funding are not  overlooked or underutilized.   The transparency provided with this bill will be essential for better  congressional oversight of disaster recovery in all the States and  communities where it has been received so agencies can account for how  effectively it is being used, and if it is getting to the hands of the  individuals and communities that need it and that it was intended to go  to.   Mr. Speaker, passing this legislation will assist efforts to improve  Federal disaster response and make it more accountable and effective. I  urge my colleagues to vote for passage of H.R. 259, the Post-Disaster  Assistance Online Accountability Act.
