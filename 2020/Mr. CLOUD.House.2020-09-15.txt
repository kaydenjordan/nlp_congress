 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Dotson Lewis  of Corpus Christi, Texas, on being given the Sam Brown Award by the  Texas Association of Sports Officials. This is the most prestigious  award from the TASO Football Division, and Mr. Lewis is only the third  recipient.   The award honors him for his many years of service, and I can think  of no one more deserving than Mr. Lewis.   Before retiring 2 years ago, Dotson Lewis served our community as a  referee in both football and basketball for 71 years. In 1977, he was  the first executive director of the newly created Southwest Officials  Association, now known as the TASO. He has also facilitated numerous  exchanges between officials in Texas and in Japan, earning him the  title Ambassador of American Football Officiating to Japan.   Even after retirement, he continues to devote himself to service by  teaching a class on sports officiating, but his heart of service  extends beyond the athletic arena.   For 21 years, he served with our U.S. Army. Following his service, he  dedicated himself to serving our veterans. He started and facilitates a  weekly coffee group for veterans to connect with each other and share  their experiences and also to connect them with vital resources in the  area.   His guidance and leadership have benefited many in Texas, the United  States, and others around the world. It is my privilege to recognize  him and his outstanding achievements today.                            ____________________
