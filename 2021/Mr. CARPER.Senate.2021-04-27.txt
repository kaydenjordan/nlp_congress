 Mr. President, I rise today to urge our colleagues to  join me in voting for cloture on the nomination of Janet McCabe to  serve as Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Running an Agency like the EPA requires that person to work with and  serve people regardless of their political persuasion. Some people  strive to be bipartisan. Janet McCabe has a proven record of being  bipartisan. That is one of the reasons why nine former EPA Deputy  Administrators and Administrators support her nomination, including  four Republicans who served in the Reagan, the George H.W. and the  George W. Bush administrations.   Janet has served as a senior EPA manager. She is a pragmatic and a  good listener. That trait comes in no small part from her Hoosier  background and the time that she spent with pragmatic people who will  do the right thing if they understand what is needed. That is what  Janet McCabe will bring with her to the role of Deputy Administrator at  EPA, if confirmed. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on  this nomination.   I yield.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the vote.    Madam President, the Senate has invoked cloture, and I  just want to thank everybody who supported cloture on Janet McCabe's  nomination to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   I rise now to urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of this  outstanding nominee, because Janet McCabe is exactly the leader that  Administrator Michael Regan and the rest of the EPA need right now as  we tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the Agency and in our  Nation's history.   She will do so as one who understands the challenges and  opportunities of working as a director of an air program, within a  State environmental agency, to create a safe, healthy, and nurturing  environment--not just for the citizens of some communities but for all  communities and all ZIP Codes in Indiana, but also for the industry  throughout her State.   I stand before you today, as my colleagues sometimes call me, as a  recovering Governor. I understand how difficult it can be to bring a  genuine interest to hear all points of view, to a job where Agency  actions have consequences in every home and in every business. Perhaps  Janet McCabe's colleague, Fred Cate, vice president of research at the  University of Indiana put it best in an interview in the IndyStar  recently. I just want to quote him. This is what he said:         ``The reason she will be great at EPA is the same reason       she was superb here''. . . . ``It's her ability to get people       behind a common vision and get them to do things and not just       talk about them.''    Janet McCabe is a steady hand who has built a 30-year career of  leadership in environmental protection. Her dedication and her know-how  will be invaluable in protecting clean air and clean water, addressing  the climate crisis, and realizing environmental justice for the most  vulnerable among us.   So it is no surprise that she has garnered support from 48 leading  environmental organizations. At the same time, anyone who has worked  with Ms. McCabe knows that she is a hard-working, pragmatic Hoosier to  the core. She works well with Democrats. She works well with  Republicans and with Independents. And that is why she has the public  support of nine former EPA Deputy Administrators and Acting  Administrators, including four Republican former EPA Deputy  Administrators who served in the Reagan administration and who served  in the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush and who served in  the George W. Bush administration.   Her professional experience includes service in both Federal and  State government, and that includes impressive tenures in both Indiana  and Massachusetts government agencies, as well as years of leadership  experience at EPA.   Based on that experience, Ms. McCabe knows that in order for any  Federal Agency to be successful, its leaders must work closely and  collaboratively with State and local partners, no matter which party is  in charge.   Her pragmatic and inclusive style has also inspired support of the  electric power industry. The Edison Electric Institute, which  represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies, enthusiastically  supports Janet McCabe's nomination. This is an organization--listen to  this--that speaks for companies that provide power to 220 million  Americans. That is right--roughly two-thirds of all Americans.   Let me put it another way. Edison Electric Institute's members  generate electricity for two-thirds of all Americans, and they have  thrown their support behind the nomination of Janet McCabe for this  post.   According to EEI president Tom Kuhn, he says Janet McCabe ``has a  strong commitment to public service and a solid track record of  engaging with diverse stakeholders, including industry, as demonstrated  by her time at the helm of both the Air Program at the Indiana  Department of Environmental Management and EPA's Office of Air and  Radiation.''   That is a quote.   Ms. McCabe has their support because she has demonstrated time and  again that environmental and economic progress go hand in hand. Let me  say that again. She demonstrated time and again that cleaner air, clean  water, environmental progress, and economic progress go hand in hand.  They are inextricably linked. That ethic has earned Ms. McCabe the  support of the American Chemistry Council, the Association of Equipment  Manufacturers, and the BlueGreen Alliance, which represents some of our  largest labor unions.   Ms. McCabe knows that while working to protect clean air and clean  water and address climate change, the Agency must seize the opportunity  to protect and create good-paying jobs across our country. She  understands that the environmental and climate challenges we face are  not just a problem. They offer economic and competitive opportunity.    President Biden's American Jobs Plan embraces these principles, and  Janet McCabe has the experience and she has the intelligence to work  with her Agency colleagues to translate them into action at EPA.  President Biden's American Jobs Plan embraces these principles, and  Janet McCabe has the experience and the intelligence to work with her  Agency colleagues to translate them into action at EPA.   The Association of Equipment Manufacturers put it very well when they  wrote last month, and this is their quote:         Ms. McCabe will bring the leadership and collaborative       spirit needed to address difficult environmental challenges       and improve regulatory processes, and ensure we can continue       to build, power, and feed our country in an innovative and       sustainable way.    Ms. McCabe will help ensure that everyone--everyone who has a stake  in our environment and our economy--has a seat at the table. She has  built a reputation of listening to everyone--everyone--addressing real  economic concerns, making sure government policy helps people and  communities at the local level.   Ms. McCabe embodies these values in her current role as director of  Indiana University's Resilience Institute, where she works every day to  help mayors and to help farmers and communities of all sizes and shapes  prepare for and adapt to climate change.   I will borrow once again from Janet McCabe's colleague from the  University of Indiana, Fred Cate, who said of her career success, and I  quote him again:         ``She understands that at the end of the day, if you don't       bring along finance and industry and local buy-in, then we       won't get things done.''    I couldn't have said it better.   As Deputy Administrator, Janet's role will be the equivalent of a  chief operating officer. She will be primarily focused on EPA internal  policies and procedures--the day-to-day running of the Agency--and will  not play a significant role in crafting new public policies.   One of her key tasks will be to restore the Agency's organizational  health, which suffered during the previous administration, as respect  for science and career staff advice declined and morale deteriorated.  There is no person better suited to overseeing this internal  restoration than Janet McCabe. Under her leadership I have every  confidence that EPA will recover and soar.   I am very grateful that Janet has agreed to serve her country again  in this new leadership role, and I am grateful to her family for their  willingness to share her again with all of us.  [[Page S2210]]  Her personal integrity and work ethic is an inspiration to all public  servants, and her willingness to engage all points of view is a boon to  all who have strong interest in EPA's work.   So in closing, I want to urge my colleagues--all of our colleagues-- to vote to confirm her today so that she can put her robust talents to  work for all the American people.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
