 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of Made in  America Week.   Since taking office in January, I have had the privilege and honor of  meeting with American workers and small-business owners in my district,  from manufacturers to the farmers who feed our community and our world.   Unfortunately, we have seen far too many of our jobs leave this  country. I am focused on addressing the problems in our economy that  are destroying jobs and stalling growth.   We have already made significant progress in reducing the regulatory  burdens that make it hard for businesses large and small to survive.  Congress has passed and the President has signed 14 Congressional  Review Acts overturning excessive and ridiculous regulations. I look  forward to passing comprehensive tax reform that is simpler and fairer  for all Americans so individuals can keep more of their paycheck and  for jobs to stay in America. I will continue to advance solutions to  help Americans gain skills needed to compete in our changing workforce.   Mr. Speaker, let's remain focused on keeping jobs in America and  products made in America.                            ____________________
