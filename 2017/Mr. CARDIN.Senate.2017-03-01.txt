 Mr. President, I will vote against confirming  Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior, and I would  like to take this opportunity to explain why. To put the matter  succinctly, Representative Zinke--if he is confirmed--will be charged  with implementing the Trump administration's ``energy independence  plan,'' which includes maximizing energy production on Federal lands,  including the outer continental shelf,  [[Page S1512]]  OCS. I oppose oil and gas drilling off the coast of Maryland and the  entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. There is too little to gain and too  much to lose.   Last November, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, wisely  did not include any parcels in the Atlantic in the 2017 to 2022 plan to  lease offshore land the Federal Government controls. In December, then- President Obama used his authority under section 12(a) of the 1953  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 to withdraw unleased OCS  lands from future lease sales, too.   This makes sense. According to BOEM, the entire Atlantic OCS, from  Maine all the way to Florida, has 1.15 billion barrels of  ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' oil and 12.80 trillion cubic  feet of ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' natural gas. These  sums sound large, but let's put them in context. The Gulf of Mexico OCS  has more than 40 times as much oil and 10 times as much natural gas.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, recently determined that  the midland basin of the Wolfcamp Shale area in the Permian Basin has  20 billion barrels of oil and the natural gas equivalent of another 1.6  billion barrels. The oilfield stretches over 118 miles from Lubbock to  Midland. It is the largest ``continuous oil'' discovery in the United  States, according to the USGS, three times larger than the assessment  of the oil in the mammoth Bakken formation in North Dakota.   It doesn't make any sense to jeopardize the marine life and the  fishing and tourism industries along the Maryland coast and Chesapeake  Bay when there is so much more oil and gas in other parts of the  country.   Deepwater Horizon was a state-of-the-art rig, but it failed, causing  the largest oil spill in U.S. waters. Eleven crewman were killed. An  oil spill entering the Chesapeake Bay would be a disaster.   An even bigger threat to Maryland and other coastal States is climate  change and rising sea levels. We need to accelerate our transition from  fossil fuels, not our dependence on them. Two years ago, Oceana  concluded that modest levels of offshore wind development over the next  20 years could produce about twice the amount of energy along coastal  Atlantic States as offshore drillings and create more than 1.5 times  the number of jobs.   There is no provision in the 1953 law that permits President Trump to  reverse the Obama administration's section 12(a) OCS withdrawals, but  he is determined to try. When Representative Zinke was first asked  about lifting the moratoria, he responded, ``If I am confirmed, I will  work to implement President-elect Trump's policy.''   That is the problem right there.   I appreciate Representative Zinke's honorable service to our country,  both in uniform as a Navy SEAL and as an elected official in the  Montana State Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. He has  called himself a ``Theodore Roosevelt conservationist'' and supports a  permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   It is possible Representative Zinke will try to resist the  Republicans' zeal for transferring ownership of precious public lands  from the Federal Government, although he supported a House rule change  at the beginning of this Congress to make it easier. Representative  Zinke is an avid sportsman who appears to appreciate the unique role  the Federal Government has in managing these resources for multiple  uses--not just energy production--and preserving them for future  generations.   While these are all positive factors, I am troubled that  Representative Zinke has received a 3 percent rating from the League of  Conservation Voters. He has vacillated on the issue of climate change:  in 2010, he was one of nearly 1,200 State legislators who signed a  letter to President Obama and Congress calling for ``comprehensive  clean energy jobs and climate change legislation.'' Since then,  however, he has repeatedly expressed doubt about anthropogenic climate  change. In an October 2014 debate, Representative Zinke stated: ``it's  not a hoax, but it's not proven science either.'' During his  confirmation hearing, Representative Zinke said that humans  ``influence'' climate change, but did not acknowledge the scientific  consensus that human activity is a dominant cause of climate change. He  also supports using the Congressional Review Act to overturn rules  agencies have spent months and even years to develop.   For all of these reasons, but particularly out of concern for the  Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's beautiful shoreline and coastal  communities, I will vote against confirming Representive Zinke as  Secretary of the Interior.
