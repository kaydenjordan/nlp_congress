 ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called  the children of God.''   Madam Speaker, we are blessed today that joining us are some of the  heroes from the Metropolitan Police Department and Capitol Police, who  defended this Capitol on January 6. And the questions that they are  asking are the questions that our constituents are asking about January  6.   Will we investigate how our democracy was attacked, or will we send a  green light to allow it to be attacked again?   Will we stand with the cops, or roll with the cop killers?  [[Page H3328]]    Do we want the truth, or will we allow history to be erased?   Are we for the Constitution, or are we for chaos?   Madam Speaker, January 6 was a crime against our democracy and the  heroes of this Capitol. Now we must investigate it. Failing that, we  are lawless and lost.
