 Madam President, one cannot say it much better than the  Senator from Massachusetts has said it. Everyone has come to expect a  free and open internet--one that does not charge more for certain  content and charge less for favorite content. It is supposed to be  free. It is supposed to be open. It should be balanced. Hopefully,  since it seems that the Pai regime is, in fact, going down this road,  there will be immediate lawsuits that will be very time-consuming. At  the end of the day, sometime in the future, there may be an opportunity  for a legislative solution, but it has to be a balanced solution that  protects the right of the public to a free and open internet.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize the Los Angeles- class attack submarine USS Jacksonville prior to her decommissioning.  On August 10, the USS Jacksonville returned to homeport at Joint Base  Pearl Harbor-Hickam after completing her final deployment in the  Western Pacific.   The completion of this mission marked the USS Jacksonville's 15th  deployment since the ship's commissioning in May 1981. Over her  lifespan, the USS Jacksonville has completed two around-the-world  cruises, visited ports in nearly every continent, and completed  countless critical missions. While assigned to the Enterprise battle  group on September 11, 2001, the Jacksonville provided critical  intelligence support as the Nation prepared to respond to the horrific  attacks.   In a tribute to its namesake, the Jacksonville's nickname is ``The  Bold One,'' based on the city of Jacksonville, Florida's slogan of  ``The Bold New City of the South.'' I am sure the entire city of  Jacksonville, with its rich naval tradition, is honored today by this  submarine's legacy, and the outstanding service provided by her crew  and their dedication to our great Nation.   Current and former crew will be hosting a reunion this November in  Hawaii to say one final good-bye to the USS Jacksonville. I invite my  colleagues to join me in honoring the boat, her current crew, and all  of our Nation's courageous sailors who have served on board in years  past.                            ____________________
