 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this honor for  Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey.   As a single mom with three small children, she went on welfare before  working her way to success in both business and local politics. She  went on to serve with distinction in Congress but she never forgot the  children.   In Congress she was a fierce advocate for peace her entire career and  she was right. She was a founding member of the Out of Iraq Caucus when  that was not very popular with the general public and with most of our  congressional colleagues. She was right about social policy. She was  right about war and peace. And she is a delightful human being. I am  pleased to support this commemoration.
