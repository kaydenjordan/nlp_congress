 Mr. President, I listened to the statement of my  colleague and friend from Texas Senator Cornyn on the issue of  immigration. It would seem that we are miles apart, Democrats and  Republicans, on this issue.   Let me state from my own personal point of view, speaking just for  myself, what I think we are facing and what we should do to address it.  Here are the basics as far as I am concerned: We need an orderly  process for immigration in America, both at the border and off the  border. That means laws and rules, numbers that work for both the  immigrants as well as the economy of America.   No. 2, we should never knowingly allow anyone dangerous to come into  this country; or, if they are here in immigrant status and pose a  danger to our country, they have no right to stay, as far as I am  concerned.   No. 3, it is a great compliment that so many people all over the  world are desperate to come to our country. If the opposite were true  and people were flowing out of the United States, it would be a sad  commentary. But America has always been a magnet of opportunity, and so  the fact that so many people want to come here is a compliment, in a  way.   But the reality is this: We cannot absorb everyone who wants to come  into America from all over the world in a limited period of time. It  can only be considered, in an orderly fashion, over a longer period of  time.   No. 4, we haven't touched this immigration set of laws in 30 years.  So to blame Joe Biden for this is to ignore the obvious. There wasn't  much, if anything, done under the Trump administration that was helpful  and, going back years and years before, very little, if anything, to  show for it.   The only time we finally did a bipartisan bill and brought it to the  floor of the U.S. Senate, I was part of the Gang of 8, and we brought  it to the floor. We debated it at length in the committee and on the  floor, and it passed with a vote, I believe, of 65 here in the U.S.  Senate, a bipartisan vote.   We sent it over to the House of Representatives, which was under  Republican control with Speaker Ryan. They never raised the issue. They  never brought it to the floor. They never discussed it in committee. So  that was the end of the effort.   So to argue that we haven't tried--we have. On various individual  bills, like the DREAM Act, which I introduced 21 years ago--I brought  it to the floor of the Senate five times and got a majority vote all  five times. But that is not enough in the Senate. It didn't get 60  votes. So we lost the bill to a filibuster each and every time.   So to argue that the effort has not been undertaken is not quite  accurate.   The question is: Where do we go from here? Title 42 was basically a  public health announcement that we could deny access to the United  States to people based on public health considerations. This week, a DC  judge, Federal judge, concluded that whatever our initial rationale was  for title 42, it no longer applied. If it was for COVID-19 or public  health, he found reason to question whether or not, in today's  circumstances, it still applied.    Why is this important? Because 40 to 50 percent of those who come to  the border are turned away under title 42; so the Border Patrol is  saying to us: What is going to happen when this expires? We will have  even more people seeking entry into the United States and no basis for  turning them away.   So it is a situation which is a real and challenging situation, and I  think it argues more than ever that we have to do something and do it  soon so that the situation at the border does not get worse.   Why is it so bad? Well, there are a variety of circumstances that  have given rise to this situation, not the least of which is the  countries that are sending the most people to the United States include  Venezuela--where millions have fled Venezuela and the dictator that is  running that country to neighboring countries--and they are now coming  to the United States.   Venezuela does not have a government that we are in regular  communication with, and so it is not a matter of working out our  differences to slow down this flow of immigration. Our State Department  notifies American citizens not to travel to Venezuela because it is too  dangerous. So when Venezuelans come to our border and say: We are  fleeing persecution and danger in our country, we have recognized that  as a fact through the State Department directives. It is a dangerous  country. I have been to it. I have a general feeling about how  dangerous it is.   So the situation is not easily resolved. Let me say to the Senator  from Texas--he said he is ready to sit down. I am too. We need to sit  down--he, a Republican; myself as a Democrat--and find some common  ground.   There are some things which we can come to an agreement on. First,  when it comes to fentanyl and drugs, overwhelmingly, by a margin of 6  to 1, drugs are flowing into the United States under regular ports of  entry. It isn't a matter of some young person with a backpack full of  heroin or fentanyl coming across the border in the middle of the night  so much as it is truckloads coming through that escape detection.   That is inexcusable. Do you want to vote for more security, more  technology, stopping the drugs coming in from the border? Count me in.  It is not just a Republican platform. It is a Democratic platform as  well. We are suffering from a drug crisis in my State of Illinois just  as much as in the State of Texas--maybe more, in some circumstances. So  count me in for more security.   Do you believe it is too long between a person arriving in the United  States and being given a court date before they finally do appear? I am  for changing that too. We need more immigration courts. We need more  judges in those courts. I will vote for the money to see that happen.   What are we going to do in terms of people who come into this  country? Are they needed? Well, they are desperately needed. Just  recently, the Governors of Texas, Arizona, and Florida decided to pull  a political stunt--I call it a stunt--of sending people who had just  crossed the border on buses to communities around the United States.  These people got on the buses believing that, at the end of the path,  at the end of their trip, they would be taken care of: jobs, houses,  and all sorts of things were promised to them. None of it was true.  They were misled into getting on those buses.   How do I know that? Because I sat down with them in Chicago--4,000 or  more have already arrived--and I heard their stories. And when you  listen to their stories, you understand the fundamentals of this  decision.   Carlos came with his wife and his 5-year-old daughter and his little  baby infant. His wife was nursing. He left Venezuela on May 5. It took  him 5 months to finally make it to our border. And when he got there,  he was in a circumstance where everything had happened to him. He had  been robbed, beaten, had his cell phone taken away, and he thought he  was going to die under the circumstances. He was so desperate to come  to the United States and escape Venezuela, he trucked on, carrying both  babies at one point because his wife had hurt her leg.   That kind of determination belies the argument that these people are  trying  [[Page S6759]]  to swindle our system. They are as desperate as many of our parents and  grandparents to come and find freedom and opportunity. It is a natural  human instinct.   It says to me that they are being exploited, I am sure, by smugglers  and others and coyotes who try to bring them to our border, who charge  them exorbitant amounts of money, often abandoning them in flight. The  fact of the matter is, the push factor is dramatic, and we have to deal  with it.   Now, what the administration has said is that they are going to allow  a certain number of Venezuelans to illegally enter the United States as  long as they have sponsors in our country. Twenty-four thousand is the  number that they gave. I think that is beginning of talking about the  legitimate needs of America for workers.   Many of these people coming off the buses in Chicago are offered jobs  right on the spot; we have so many vacancies in employment right now.  But we have to do this in an orderly fashion. That is one of the points  that I made earlier.   I would like to say a word about the Dream Act. I see my other  colleagues on the floor who are seeking recognition.   Yesterday, we had a rally for people who are protected by DACA. I  introduced the DREAM Act 21 years ago. We couldn't pass it because of  the filibuster on the floor of the Senate. I appealed to President  Obama, who created DACA, which allowed young people brought here as  children and infants to apply for 2 years of protection so they could  work--and not be deported--in the United States, called DACA.   Well, there are 600,000 to 800,000 who have qualified for that. They  have frozen their numbers over the last several years. But those are  the ones who were in place at the time. They showed up, a lot of them,  yesterday. One woman said to me: I am DACA, and I am also 40 years old.  Senator, is this ever going to be resolved?   It is a legitimate question. So many of them are teachers and nurses  and doctors and members of our military who are doing their best at  essential work occupations. They deserve an opportunity to be in this  country. And there is a feeling that some court could pull the rug out  from under them in a matter of hours or days. So we need to act on that  quickly.   I am going to submit for the Record the statement that I was going to  make on the Ukraine situation. But I rose to respond to my friend from  Texas. I accept his challenge. Let's sit down on a bipartisan basis, on  a timely bipartisan basis, the Monday we return from Thanksgiving and  start the conversation.   I am willing to talk honestly about border security, and I am sure he  is willing to talk honestly about DACA and Dreamers and the critical  needs of people who are coming into the United States.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, nearly 9 months ago, I was sitting in an airport  departure lounge in Lithuania with Senator Coons when the news broke of  Russia's reprehensible effort to seize Ukraine by military force. Many  may have forgotten, but Russian dictator Vladimir Putin actually  thought Ukrainians would welcome the Russian military with open arms.   Based on that delusion, he gambled the reputation of his nation and  the lives of more than 100,000 Russians troops who have died--all for  one man's selfish pursuit and warped nostalgia for a Soviet dystopia.  Vladimir Putin's illegal war on Ukraine also has unleashed untold  horrors on millions of innocent Ukrainians, so many of them children.   CNN and PBS recently aired a heartbreaking segment by Christiane  Amanpour about the countless Ukrainian children who are suffering  terrible emotional turmoil living through the unspeakable terror and  fear from Putin's war.   Some of the children are unable to speak, emotionally paralyzed after  witnessing unimaginable violence against their parents or others. Putin  and his cowardly enablers must face justice for these war crimes. And  the United States is committed to seeing that justice done.   Despite the horrific violence unleashed by Putin, the Ukrainian  people have prevailed and thrived. Their courage and sacrifices for  freedom are truly inspiring. Ukraine's defenders not only repelled the  initial military invasion, they have continued to recapture land  illegally occupied by Russia in eastern and southern Ukraine.   A key victory came last week when Ukrainian forces liberated the  provincial capital of Kherson. Kherson has suffered months of cruel  Russian occupation. Innocent civilians experienced arbitrary arrest,  torture, and forced disappearances. Many residents were forced at  gunpoint to vote in a sham referendum--Russia's attempt to whitewash  its illegal occupation.   Even in retreat, Russian forces continued to brutalize Kherson by  destroying important infrastructure and sabotaging key services.   And yet Kherson is liberated. And despite all of the destruction and  the tremendous rebuilding and healing that lies ahead for its people,  the tears of joy have been palpable.   Just look at these photos--President Zelenskyy's recent visit to a  freed Kherson--watching the Ukrainian flag being raised over the city  once again, citizens hugging and kissing Ukrainian soldiers in an  outpouring of relief and gratitude.   There is no doubt where the momentum in this war rests: with the  Ukrainian people. Ukraine's military has reclaimed hundreds of villages  and more than a thousand square miles of territory. The world has  rallied to Ukraine's side, leaving Russia isolated in retreat of  Putin's folly.   The nations of the free world understand that Ukraine is the  frontline in the battle for freedom over autocracy. It is the frontline  in the struggle for the rule of law over the rule of chaos and brute  force. And now is not time for the United States and the rest of the  free world to let up in our support for Ukraine. The unified support  and military assistance of NATO has been invaluable to the brave  Ukrainians fighting to protect their nation. And this Congress has been  largely unified in providing this aid--and the results are both  stunning and clear.    Russia is losing the war in Ukraine. Its leaders are now trying to  break the will of the Ukrainian people with random terror bombings of  civilian targets and critical infrastructure.   Make no mistake: Putin and his cronies are watching what we do in  this Chamber. They are hoping that we and our allies will grow weary in  our support for Ukraine. That is why it is essential we include in the  supplemental spending bill that we must pass before the end of this  year the critical military assistance that will allow Ukraine to  continue to defend its people and reclaim its territory.   Let me end with a quote from the retired curator of the Kherson Art  Museum, Iryna Rodavanova. Russian soldiers had beaten her husband.  After Kherson was liberated, she said of President Zelenskyy, ``I agree  with our president . . . better without electricity, without water, and  without heat if also without the Russians.''   To Iryna, her husband, and all Ukrainians: You are not without  friends; the American people and our Congress will be with you until  Ukraine is again free and at peace.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from  Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.
