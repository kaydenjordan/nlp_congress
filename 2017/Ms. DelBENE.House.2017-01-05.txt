 Mr. Speaker, at this very moment, House and Senate  leaders are working on a dangerous plan to dismantle the Affordable  Care Act and strip more than 20 million Americans of their health  insurance. And if they succeed, it will have devastating consequences  for our constituents, particularly women.   Repealing the ACA means allowing insurance companies to charge women  more, simply for being a woman; endangering access to care for 65  million women with preexisting conditions; and stripping more than 55  million women of free preventative care, like birth control and cancer  screenings.   It is easy to forget how broken the system was before the Affordable  Care Act. But make no mistake: dismantling it now means being a woman  will once again be treated as a preexisting condition. It will mean  fewer options, less access, and higher costs for tens of millions of  women.   We should be building on the progress we have made, not turning back  the clock. Women deserve better.                            ____________________
