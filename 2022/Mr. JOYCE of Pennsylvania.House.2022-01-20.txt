 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New  Jersey, Mr. Smith, for his leadership in this incredibly important  issue. Year after year he has stood for the unborn. Personally I want  to thank him for that leadership.   Mr. Speaker, in the 49 years since the case of Roe v. Wade was ruled  on by the Supreme Court, 63 million innocent unborn children have lost  their lives to abortion.   Now, members of the radical left are trying to raise the number of  abortions performed in the United States by repealing the Hyde  amendment, which for decades has ensured that no taxpayer dollars are  used to fund this barbaric procedure.   As a doctor, I swore an oath to ``first, do no harm.''   When I was in medical school I swore that I would never perform,  assist, or support an abortion procedure. As a medical student, as an  intern, as a resident, and as a board certified physician for 25 years,  I lived up to that pledge.   As a legislator in the United States Congress I took a pledge to  continue to stand for life.   Now is the time for Congress to pass legislation that defends the  rights of the unborn.   Now is the time for us to end abortions in this country.   On this 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade let us remember the lives  that have been lost and recommit ourselves to defending human life.
