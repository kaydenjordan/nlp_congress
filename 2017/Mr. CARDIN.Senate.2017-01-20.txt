 Mr. President, I have said many times that the Senate is  a family, and today we are a family in mourning. Tim Mitchell, the  assistant Democratic secretary and a 25-year Senate staffer, lost his  battle with brain cancer this past Saturday night. It was a battle he  waged with uncommon courage and grace. We are disconsolate that such an  outstanding person in the prime of his life has been taken from his  family and from the Senate. We send our deepest condolences and prayers  to his beloved wife Alicia; his cherished son Ben; his father, the  Reverend Dr. Philip Mitchell; his sister Christi; and the rest of his  family and many, many friends.   While Tim spent part of his formative years in Binghamton, NY, he was  born in Boston and also grew up in New Hampshire, so he ultimately  pledged his sports allegiance to Boston and New England. He called  himself a P-K--a preacher's kid. He earned his undergraduate degree  from the State University of New York at Fredonia. He earned his juris  doctor degree at night while he worked here in the Senate, from  Catholic University's Columbus School of Law. Tim loved his family most  of all, but he also loved the Senate, and he loved the Boston Red Sox-- I am not sure of the order there; maybe they were tied. He actually  acquired two seats from Fenway Park and put them in his basement for  when he wanted to watch a game. They were just part of his extensive  collection of Red Sox memorabilia, hats, ties, and the like. I don't  think any other fan was as excited and as proud as Tim was when the Red  Sox won the World Series in 2004, ending an 86-year drought.   Tim started his Senate career following his junior year in college as  an intern for then-Senator Don Riegle from Michigan. He returned to the  Senate after he graduated to work as a staff assistant in Senator  Riegle's office, where he quickly displayed his talents and work ethic  and was promoted to a job on the Senate Banking Committee. Later, he  worked on the special Whitewater Committee. He also worked for former  Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, on his personal staff and on the  Democratic Policy Committee, before joining the floor staff in 2001.   As a member of the floor staff, Tim was intimately involved in every  bill, every nomination, every accomplishment of the Senate. Throughout  it all, he was always calm, always patient, always courteous, and  always exhibiting his innate sense of decency and fairness. He was a  parliamentary expert and a trusted adviser.   I hope Tim's wife Alicia, his son Ben, and his other family members  know just how much Tim was loved and respected here in the Senate.  Given the partisan nature of his job, that is, perhaps, the best  testament to the type of person Tim was. Our hearts, like theirs, are  broken. I hope they may find some solace in these words written by the  Reverend Henry Scott Holland, originally as a sermon, but usually  reprinted as a poem:       Death is nothing at all.      It does not count.      I have only slipped away into the next room.      Nothing has happened.       Everything remains exactly as it was.      I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so             fondly together is untouched, unchanged.      Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.       Call me by the old familiar name.      Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.      Put no difference into your tone.      Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.       Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we             enjoyed together.      Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.      Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.      Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a             shadow upon it.       Life means all that it ever meant.      It is the same as it ever was.      There is absolute and unbroken continuity.      What is this death but a negligible accident?   [[Page S359]]        Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?      I am but waiting for you, for an interval,      somewhere very near,      just round the corner.       All is well.      Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.      One brief moment and all will be as it was before.      How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet             again!                            ____________________
