 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 9th anniversary  of the Oso landslide. On that tragic day, 43 people lost their lives  when an entire hillside collapsed, smothering the town and burying it  in mud.   Washington State was forever changed.   Among the victims were a nurse, veterans, even elementary school  students. There were parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and  children--all beloved members of their community. We remember them  today.   On this anniversary, I would extend my condolences to the friends and  family members of those victims. While we cannot change the past, we  can honor those who passed away by working toward a safer future.   As a Representative of this resilient community, I have worked to  increase funding for emergency communications and services and  supported the National Landslide Preparedness Act, all of which help  ensure that we are ready if such a disaster strikes again.   People of Oso, my heart is with you today.                            ____________________
