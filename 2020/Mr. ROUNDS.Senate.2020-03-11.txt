 Mr. President, today I would like to remember the  life of Dick Ambrosius. Mr. Ambrosius passed away on January 24, 2020,  at the age of 73.   Dick Ambrosius was born in Huron, SD, and graduated from Huron High  School in 1964. He attended the University of South Dakota, USD, in  Vermillion, SD, where he earned a master's degree. He was actively  involved in the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity and the Reserve Officer  Training Corps during his time at USD and continued to advocate for the  value of Greek life and the importance of military service throughout  his career.   Following his college graduation in 1968, he was commissioned as an  officer in the U.S. Army, where he ultimately attained the rank of  captain prior to his separation from service. He served in Vietnam and  was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals.   In life, Mr. Ambrosius was a tireless advocate for senior citizens  and disabled veterans. He served as executive director for Warriors  Never Give Up, a nonprofit organization that provides outdoor  adventures for disabled veterans.   I commend Mr. Ambrosius for his devotion to his community, disabled  veterans, and seniors. I offer my sincerest condolences to his family  and friends, including his wife Karen, daughter Jennifer, sons Matt and  Jacob, sister Nancy, and numerous grandchildren.                            ____________________
