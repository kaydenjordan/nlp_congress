 Mr. President, the United States places special trust and  confidence in the integrity, judgement, and abilities of those men and  women chosen to represent the United States abroad as an Ambassador.  The Constitution balances the President's need to have officials  overseas able to execute U.S. foreign policy as directed by the  President, with Congress' interest in ensuring that these officials  will serve honorably and ably in the positions for which they are  nominated. Apart from the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the Ambassador  nomination process has changed very little since our Nation was  founded. However, it is fair to say that Presidents of all parties have  on occasion appointed individuals Ambassadors whose profiles indicate  political closeness with the President more than deep substantive  experience in a particular foreign country.   Historically, the majority of Ambassadors are selected from the  career ranks of the State Department. Roughly 30 percent of Ambassadors  are typically selected outside of those ranks, including from among  political supporters of the President. This is not categorically  problematic--Ambassadors who are not professional diplomats have long  served our country admirably, from Benjamin Franklin in France to  former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield in Japan. A foreign  country may benefit from having a U.S. Ambassador who has a close  relationship with the President and the  [[Page S2095]]  ability to elevate issues to the highest levels or the independent  gravitas to bring substantial public attention to that country's needs.  That said, I do believe it is appropriate to ask Presidents and their  Secretaries of State to explain their rationale for choosing Ambassador  nominees outside of the Foreign and Civil Services so that the public  can understand the rationale for these appointments. This would give  both the U.S. public and foreign publics the assurance that the White  House is not merely doling out political sinecures but is devoting  meaningful thought to these selections.   The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Booker would not  constrain the President's discretion to choose appointees but would  require him or her to justify these selections and explain to Congress  why someone from outside the State Department is the optimal choice to  represent America's interests abroad. I am proud to introduce this bill  to ensure that U.S. foreign policy and our national security interests  are advanced by the most qualified Americans, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is swiftly  considered by the Senate.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Cardin):   S. 4039. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide guidance to States regarding Federal reimbursement for  furnishing behavioral health services and treatment under Medicaid and  the Children's Health Insurance Program using telehealth services, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
