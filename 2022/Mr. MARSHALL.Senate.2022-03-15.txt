 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we finished up some three or four  townhalls this weekend, bringing us, I think, over nine. And I will  tell you this, Americans know they are being lied to. They know the  decisions coming out of the White House and the CDC are politically  driven. Let me tell you this for sure: Kansans are mad, and they are  upset, and they know this lie is continuing, and their anger continues  to grow. And at the end of every townhall, I can tell you, two or three  people will grab me and say: Please, please keep fighting for our  freedoms.   This is what else they tell me. They tell me they don't trust the CDC  anymore, that the CDC has lost their reputation; and I am telling you,  it will be difficult for them to ever get it back.   Now, they are being told that we have to wear masks on airplanes for  another month or so--another horrible decision coming from the White  House, more ill advice from the CDC. And all the time we know that  these masks--with these masks comes a psychosocial downfall, that it  creates problems. But the CDC continues to lust for control--to control  our lives and exert their control over us, over me, over our children  and our grandchildren.   My concern is this: The CDC continues to make decisions as if they  are in a vacuum without consideration of the big picture.   Let's just take a moment and talk about where we are today. Ninety- five percent of Americans have some level of immunity--95 percent. New  infections are down 94 percent, hospitalizations down over 80 percent.  As far as we know, there is no new variant of concern anywhere in the  world that is rearing its ugly head right now.   What do we truly know about the science and the benefits of wearing a  mask? What do you know about the risk of wearing a mask? Well, I asked  the CDC that same question, I am sure, over a year ago now. I asked  them for the studies that support their recommendation to wear masks-- some 80 studies. I looked at every one of them. I would say half of  them weren't worth the paper they were printed on--poor scientific  quality, cherry-picking data--but most were still very inconclusive.   A few suggested masks might help if they are worn perfectly, if it is  the right type of mask. Some of the studies even said that masks were  harmful.   Now, I will acknowledge that in a perfect world that, for a brief  period of time, wearing an N95 mask properly could theoretically give a  person benefit. But we now know and have now proven that cloth masks  have offered little benefit, and they may actually make viruses and  infections more common.   Does the CDC really believe masking would help in an airplane? And if  they did so, why wouldn't they suggest we wear N95 masks, and why do  they allow cloth masks? It just seems very inconsistent.   The big problem is always compliance. Seatbelts don't work unless you  wear them. An airbag on the car doesn't work unless you have it turned  on. Just look around. Nobody can wear these masks for hours and hours  at a time without touching their nose and touching their mouth and  adjusting  [[Page S1175]]  the mask. Then we take it off to eat and to drink just for moments at a  time. In the real world, it doesn't make any sense that the mask would  work and certainly not in schools. I think that has been well-proven.   I think we look at Sweden as a country whose mortality is a fraction  of ours from the COVID virus, a fraction of its neighboring countries-- a country that had very limited use of masks without mandates as well.   I think the big opportunity with airlines is they made a big  investment in air exchange. We know air exchange works. From our  experiences in surgical centers, we know that when we moved to the  modern air exchangers, that a number of infections--post-op infections  for joint replacements--went down significantly. We always knew the air  replacement was a big part of this.   But, no, this administration continues to want to control our lives.  Their healthcare infectious disease czar, Dr. Fauci, decreed that even  after airline executives gave testimony that masks were of no benefit,  Dr. Fauci decreed that he didn't think masks would ever come off on  airplanes. Why? Why would he make such a bombastic, ignorant claim?   It is time to stop all the mandates. It is time to stop all the  travel mask mandates. It is time to let our people go.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 37     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
