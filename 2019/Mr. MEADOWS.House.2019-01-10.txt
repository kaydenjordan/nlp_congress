 Mr. Speaker, I find it just fascinating that my  Democratic colleagues come down here to the well of the House to talk  about opening up the government when, indeed, it is their reluctance to  negotiate at all that is keeping the government shut down. On day 1 of  the shutdown, it was zero money for new border barriers. On day 20, it  is still zero money for new border barriers.   And to suggest to this body and to the Nation that, indeed, they are  negotiating in good faith, I just find it incomprehensible.   I can tell you that we are ready to negotiate. In fact, they have  been saying, it is their way or the highway. And do you know what? They  are going to hit the highway in just a few hours and get out of here.   I think we ought to all stay here, let's negotiate, let's get a  result, let's open the government, but, more importantly, let's protect  our borders and communities across the country.                            ____________________
