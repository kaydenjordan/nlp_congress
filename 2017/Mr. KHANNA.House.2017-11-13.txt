 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his work on this resolution,  Ranking Member Engel, and leadership on both sides: Majority Leader  McCarthy and the Speaker, and Minority Whip Hoyer and Leader Pelosi.   I think one thing we can all agree on, as Chairman Royce mentioned,  is the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It is, arguably, the largest  humanitarian crisis currently in the world. There are almost a million  people suffering from cholera. This is a manmade crisis because of the  bombing of civilian targets that has made the treatment of water  impossible. Almost 7 million people face famine.    One hope out of this debate, the first one on the House floor on  Yemen, is that we will collectively demand humanitarian access to  people in Yemen. There is no justification for the ports to be closed.  There is no justification for the Sanaa Airport to be closed.   In The New York Times just this morning, there was an article stating  that chlorine medicine tablets are not being allowed in for people  suffering from cholera. That is not a Republican or Democratic issue.  That is an American issue. This Nation stands for human rights. We  stand for compassion and decency.   We should demand, collectively, that there is humanitarian access to  people who are suffering and that the ports and airports be opened.  This resolution calls for that, as has our U.N. Ambassador, Nikki  Haley, who made that clear.   The second part of this resolution, which I think goes a long way, is  the acknowledgment of our own role in the refueling of Saudi planes and  in the assistance of Saudi targeting.   The resolution explicitly acknowledges that the United States has  been engaged in the assistance of Saudi refueling and assisting the  Saudis in targeting. It explicitly also recognizes that the 2001  authorization of force that the United States Congress passed does not  apply to the Yemeni civil war.   Chairman Royce was absolutely correct that there is an al-Qaida  threat in Yemen to the United States. Our military, under the 2001  authorization of force, has the full authority to take counterterrorism  measures to deal with al-Qaida; but what our military is not authorized  to do is assist the Saudi Arabian regime in fighting the Houthis. In  many cases, the Saudis have aligned with al-Qaida to fight the Houthis,  undermining our very counterterrorism operations.   This resolution makes abundantly clear that we cannot be assisting  the Saudi regime in any of its fight with the Houthi regime. We have to  limit our involvement in Yemen to take on al-Qaida and to take on the  terrorists that threaten the United States.   The chairman and I have a disagreement about the War Powers  Resolution, but I will say that the negotiations were in good faith. As  I told some of the groups that were upset about the resolution, this is  a body of 435 Members. Every Member has their perspective. Ultimately,  we have to come to a consensus that moves the debate forward. In our  view, the War Powers Resolution does apply.   If I can quote from a plain reading of section 8(c), it says that,  for purposes of the War Powers Act: ``the term `introduction of the  United States Armed Forces' includes the assignment of members of such  Armed Forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or  accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign  country or government. . . .''   I believe a plain reading of that statute suggests that refueling  Saudi planes constitutes coordination with a foreign government in a  foreign conflict. Frankly, it is precisely what the drafters of the  statute wanted to prevent after Vietnam. They wanted to prevent us from  getting entangled in foreign conflicts where our national security was  not at stake without a debate on the floor of Congress.   We currently have troops in harm's way in 13 countries around the  world. In many of those countries, we have not debated in the United  States what the mission is or whether we should be there or whether it  is making us any safer. That is certainly the case in Yemen.   We know that, to the extent Iran is involved with the Houthis, that  has been exacerbated because of the Saudi actions. It is debatable how  much Iran was involved in the first place, but what we do know is that  their minimal involvement--or, perhaps, now, greater involvement--was  triggered because of the Saudi escalation in bombing Yemen.   What is the United States' stake in a proxy war in Yemen? How is that  making us any safer?   If anything, it is creating another generation of Yemeni who will  view the United States with suspicion.   Nicholas Kristof wrote, in The New York Times: ``We Americans have  sometimes wondered how Russia can possibly be so Machiavellian as to  support its Syrian Government allies as they bomb and starve civilians.  Yet we're doing the same thing with Saudi Arabia, and it's just as  unconscionable when we're the ones complicit. . . .''   Our military has the highest standards. We take such great care in  minimizing civilian casualties. Why would we want to aid Saudi Arabia,  which doesn't share American values, which doesn't have the regard for  human life that we in the United States do? We are bearing the brunt of  their horrible actions.   So it is time, I believe, not just to stand up for humanitarian  access in Yemen, but to question whether the aid that we are providing  Saudi Arabia is making our country any safer and whether it is  consistent with American values.                                time  1715    Finally, I will say to those who argue that we need to support the  Saudis as a counter to Iran, there is no question that Iran has taken  actions that are not in the United States' interest, but I suggest that  we learn from our own history.   I remember, from history, the time when so many in our country said:  Let us arm Saddam Hussein to be a counter to Iran.   That didn't work out so well for the United States. It was our arms  that fueled Saddam Hussein's rise that led to two costly wars for the  United States.   My belief is the balance-of-power framework that has dictated our  foreign policy and the interventionism has not made us any safer. I  wish we would exercise more restraint in our foreign policy and return  to the traditions of John Quincy Adams who said:         We should not go overseas for monsters to destroy. These       are not conflicts where we can judge who is on the right       side; rather, we should be restrained, offer our hopes and       prayers to those fighting for freedom, offer our humanitarian       good will but not engage in interventionism abroad.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who has been a real advocate and champion  for the War Powers Act in this institution.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  California for yielding me the time and for his leadership to bring  before this House the critical issue of U.S. policy towards Yemen.   Most importantly, I want to thank him for his determination to  provide this House with at least 30 minutes to debate the complicity of  the United States through its support of the Saudi-led forces in the  civil war in Yemen in one of the greatest humanitarian crises taking  place on this planet.    I personally believe that the House should be considering Mr.  Khanna's original resolution, H. Con. Res. 81, but Republican leaders  made that impossible by threatening to put forward a rule that would  have blocked the right of Congressman Khanna to ever call his  privileged resolution up for debate.   Mr. Speaker, according to the United Nations, Yemen is suffering the  fastest growing cholera epidemic ever recorded. At the same time, Yemen  faces the world's biggest food emergency.   Saudi Arabia has blocked Yemen's ports and airports. Just last week,  it sealed the country's borders. As a result, the people of Yemen have  been cut off from nearly all humanitarian aid during this horrific  famine and cholera epidemic, and the ability of humanitarian agencies  to provide relief has been significantly impeded.   The U.N. has called the Saudi closure of Yemen's borders to aid  deliveries catastrophic. Even the International Committee of the Red  Cross was forbidden to cross the northern border with a delivery of  chlorine tablets to prevent cholera.   We learned today from the Saudis that two smaller southern ports and  one Red Sea port will be open soon, although we don't know what that  means, but the main port, where over 80 percent of Yemen's food  supplies enter, will remain blockaded and closed.   Mr. Speaker, it is well documented that the Saudi-led coalition and  Saudi forces, in particular, have carried out a ruthless, brutal  bombing campaign that deliberately targets hospitals, schools, food  markets, and civilian population, including children. The World Food  Programme has warned that hundreds of thousands of children will be on  the brink of starvation if the blockade lasts for even 2 weeks.   That deadline of death and starvation will arrive next Tuesday, just  2 days before we, here in the United States, sit down to enjoy our  Thanksgiving with our family, friends, and loved ones.   Will the Members of this House spare a thought for the children,  mothers, and fathers of Yemen as we sit down and feast in the warmth  and comfort of our own homes? Or will this Congress finally, after more  than 2\1/2\ years of sheer horror, send a clear message to Saudi Arabia  that its actions are intolerable?   Mr. Speaker, Saudi Arabia's actions, thus far, and the coalition it  leads in the Yemen civil war may very well rise to the level of war  crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the United Nations.   It is past time for this House to clearly and unambiguously declare  that the United States will no longer provide or sell military aid,  equipment, and munitions to potential war criminals; that the United  States will no longer supply midair refueling to Saudi and coalition  bombers headed to Yemen to wreak havoc on the suffering Yemeni people;  that the U.S. will no longer share intelligence with the Saudi  coalition; and that we will no longer remain a complicit and passive  partner in carrying out one of the world's greatest humanitarian  crises.   Mr. Speaker, I know the Houthi rebels attempting to take power in  Yemen are also guilty of war crimes. Last November, the Tom Lantos  Human Rights Commission held a hearing on the human rights situation  and humanitarian crisis in Yemen, so I know full well the atrocities  committed by all parties in this war.   Mr. Speaker, Yemen is just one more proxy in the region of religious  and political struggle for dominance between Sunnis, Saudi Arabia, and  Shiite Iran. For some in Congress, that power struggle trumps every  other consideration.   For me, it is yet another reason to act with extreme caution and  examine whether and how we allow ourselves to support potential war  criminals in pursuit of consolidating their own regional agenda and  power.   I am concerned that this power struggle is escalating further  throughout the region. Rather than the U.S. policy working to cool  things down, we seem to be encouraging it to heat up.   I, for one, Mr. Speaker, do not want the United States to be  complicit in supporting the killing and maiming of children. I do not  want the United States to be complicit in the deliberate targeting and  attacks against schools, hospitals, markets, and homes. I do not want  the United States to be complicit in bombing water treatment plants at  any time, let alone in the middle of the worst cholera epidemic in the  world. I do not want the United States to be complicit in supporting a  blockade that condemns tens of thousands of children to famine and  death by starvation.   Once again, I thank Congressman Ro Khanna and my other colleagues who  have supported this effort to have this  [[Page H9152]]  debate. I want to thank them for their leadership on this important  issue, but this is serious.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record a Washington Post, November 9,  2017, editorial, and an article from The Guardian.            [From the Washington Post--Editorial, Nov. 9, 2017]                            The Crisis in Yemen         Saudi Arabia's blockade could trigger a full-blown famine.        Saudi Arabia has charged that a missile launched from Yemen       toward Riyadh's international airport on Saturday was       supplied by Iran and assembled by Tehran's Lebanese client,       Hezbollah. It says this could be considered ``an act of war''       and claims the right to ``respond to Iran in the appropriate       time and manner.'' Yet the only action taken so far by the de       facto Saudi ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has been to besiege       some of the world's most desperate people--the cholera-      stricken and literally famished civilian population of Yemen.        The press of multiple international crises and President       Trump's monopolization of media attention have helped obscure       the severity of the humanitarian emergency in Yemen, a poor       country of 28 million that has been devastated by civil war       and a Saudi-led military intervention. According to the       United Nations, it is suffering the fastest-growing cholera       epidemic ever recorded, with about 895,000 cases and nearly       2,200 deaths since April. At the same time, it is facing the       world's biggest food emergency, with 7 million people       requiring urgent assistance.        Children have been disproportionately afflicted. According       to U.N. figures, 27 percent of the cholera victims are under       the age of 5. Officials estimate that Juvenile cholera cases       will reach 600,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, hunger       has left half of children under 5 stunted, and 2.2 million       are affected by either moderate or severe malnutrition.        Saudi Arabia bears heavy responsibility for this suffering.       For 2\1/2\ years, it has pursued a ruthless but unwinnable       war against ethnic Houthis who have captured much of the       country, including the capital, Sanaa, and the largest port,       Hodeida. Bombing raids have repeatedly struck hospitals and       food markets. Worse, in the name of preventing Iran from       delivering weapons to the Houthis, the Saudis and their       allies have blockaded the country by sea and air, closing       Sanaa's airport to commercial traffic and slowing food       imports at Hodeida.        Now, in reaction to the missile firing, the Saudis have       announced a more thorough closure of ``all Yemeni ground, air       and sea ports.'' Though a government statement said it would       take ``into consideration the continuation of the entry and       exit'' of humanitarian supplies and aid workers, UN.       officials say that aid flights have been blocked. The World       Food Program warned that hundreds of thousands of children       would be ``on the brink of starvation'' if the blockade       lasted even for two weeks.        Saudi officials say the siege is meant to prevent what they       claim was the smuggling of missile parts into Yemen from       Iran. It has offered no proof of the rocket's origin, and       experts point out that Yemen is known to have imported Scud       missiles from North Korea before the war. In any case, the       blockade will not deter either Iran or the Houthis, but it       could trigger a full-blown famine among innocent children.       The Trump administration, which has blithely backed Crown       Prince Salman in his reckless adventures, should consider the       cost.                                   ____                      [From the Guardian, Nov. 7, 2017]    Closure of Yemen's Borders To Aid Deliveries is `Catastrophic', UN                                   Warns                             (By Karen McVeigh)         After Saudi-led coalition seals stricken country's borders,       aid agencies caution that deliveries of food and medicine are       critical for population's survival.        Humanitarian groups and the UN have urged the Saudi-led       coalition to reopen aid channels into Yemen, after a decision       to seal the stricken country's air, sea and land borders.        The UN described the closure of aid channels as       ``catastrophic''. Food, medicine and other essential supplies       are ``critical for the survival'' of the country's 27 million       population, weakened by war, the International Committee of       the Red Cross (ICRC) added. Yemen is in the grip of the       world's worst cholera outbreak and 7 million people are       already on the brink of famine.        The coalition said on Monday it would close the borders to       stem the flow of arms from Iran, after it intercepted a       missile attack by Houthi rebels near the international       airport in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Iran has denied       supplying the missiles. Humanitarian operations, including UN       aid flights, are blocked because the air and sea ports,       including Hodeidah, where most aid is delivered, are closed.        The UN reported it was not permitted flight clearance for       two humanitarian flights bound for Yemen on Monday. A Red       Cross shipment of chlorine tablets, to prevent cholera, was       not allowed in at the country's northern border, the ICRC       said. Medical supplies, including insulin, are expected.        Yemen has been named the UN's number one humanitarian       crisis.        ``We hear reports this morning that prices of cooking gas       and petrol for cars and so on [are] already spiralling out of       control,'' Jens Laerke, from the UN office for the Co-      ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told a news briefing.       ``So this is an access problem of colossal dimensions?'        Johan Mooij, Yemen director of Care International, said:       ``For the last two days, nothing has got in or out of the       country. Fuel prices have gone up by 50% and there are queues       at the gas stations. People fear no more fuel will come into       Hodeidah port.''        He explained that food insecurity was helping cholera to       spread. ``People depend on the humanitarian aid and part of       the cholera issue [is] that they do not eat and are not       strong enough to deal with unclean water?'        There have also been ``daily airstrikes'' in Sana'a, he       said, adding: ``People fear the situation is escalating.''        Robert Mardini, ICRC's regional director for the near and       Middle East, said: ``Insulin cannot wait at a shuttered       border since it must be kept refrigerated.        Without a quick solution to the closure, the humanitarian       consequences will be dire.''        Mardini said he was also concerned at the ``steadily       growing'' number of civilian casualties and the targeting of       non-military infrastructure, such as water treatment plants       and civilian airports. ``Such actions are in violation of       international humanitarian law,'' he said.        The war is between the Houthi rebels, who are allied with       former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and forces loyal to       another president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was ousted by       the Houthis. Saudi Arabia has led a military intervention       since 2015 to counter the advance of the Houthis, and aims to       reinstate Hadi.        Both the coalition and rebels have been criticised by the       UN for blocking aid to civilians.        Rupert Colville, a spokesman from the UN high commissioner       for human rights, told Reuters the agency would study whether       the blockade amounted to ``collective punishment'', unlawful       under international law, and said he hoped it would be       temporary.        The agency has expressed concern over a series of recent       attacks on markets and homes that have killed scores of       civilians, including children.        Last month, the UN put the coalition on a draft of its       blacklist for killing and maiming 683 children during the       conflict in 2016 and for carrying out 38 verified attacks on       schools and hospitals.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), who is a constitutional law professor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  and I thank Mr. Engel for his leadership on this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again Chairman Royce for working with us  to get to this resolution.   I want to acknowledge people on my own staff: Geo Saba, who really  led the efforts with Keane Bhatt from the Progressive Caucus; Chris  Schloesser and Pete Spiro. I also want to recognize Mira Resnick and  Mark Iozzi, who really helped with the language; of course, most of  all, the peace groups who brought this important cause to the Congress.   I know there is some disappointment in wanting to go further, and  people are very sincere in wanting to help civilians who literally face  famine and cholera, but I believe democracy is a messy and a long  process.   There are, as I mentioned earlier, 435 Members from different parts  of the country. I think today we have shown good faith in taking this  step forward, in highlighting the issue, in calling for humanitarian  assistance, in making sure that we curtail our support for Saudi  bombing.   I am confident that with the continued involvement of everyone in  this body, we will ultimately uphold our values and human rights, which  every person in this Chamber cares about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
