 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor World War II veteran  Anthony R. von Klock.   Anthony is 95 years old and was born in Waltham, Massachusetts.  Anthony was drafted into the Army Air Corps, where he served as an  airplane and engine mechanic. He completed his basic training at  Lackland Air Force Base in Texas before he was stationed at Great Falls  Air Force Base in Montana and Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, and in  Japan.   He received an honorable discharge in 1949 and earned the World War  II Victory Medal and the Japanese Occupation Medal. During the Korean  war, Anthony was called back to service, where he was stationed at the  Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi.   After serving in the Air Force, Anthony worked for Mackey and Eastern  Airlines while living in Florida with his wife, Leah, and two  daughters. He received the Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award in 1996  for his accomplishments as a senior mechanic.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Anthony von Klock as the  Tennessee Second District's July 2023 Veteran of the Month. I thank  Anthony for his service to our great Nation.              Do Not House Illegal Immigrants in Public Schools     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the latest  scheme to house illegal immigrants in public schools.   The mayor of New York City announced plans to house illegal  immigrants in gyms on up to 30 public school campuses, which is a move  that poses a serious risk for the students attending those schools.   Our children's safety should come before anything else, and we need  to stop  [[Page H3647]]  this kind of nonsensical policy in its tracks before it is too late.   This is just another addition to the long list of Democrat schemes  that waste taxpayer dollars and fail to prioritize the safety and well- being of American citizens. It dries up resources that should be used  to improve our students' education, and it also puts those children at  risk.   Parents should not have to send their children to schools knowing  that they are sharing a campus with illegal immigrants whose  backgrounds we know nothing about.   We need to protect our schools' true purpose: educating our children  and keeping them safe, not providing shelter for illegal immigrants.                      Recognizing Leo and Judy Whiteside     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Leo and Judy Whiteside  for more than 50 years of dedicated service to the people of Knoxville  and their continued love for each other.   These two have spent a lot of their free time doing great things for  those in need in and around our community. They have delivered Mobile  Meals to homebound residents, given communion to church members who  were unable to attend the church service, and even advocated for a  citywide class reunion at the Austin-East High School. Go Roadrunners.   When people volunteer in their communities, it demonstrates what is  really in their hearts. It shows they are willing to sacrifice their  free time, effort, and money to help those in need and expect nothing  in return.   Madam Speaker, I am so proud to represent people like Leo and Judy,  who love the people around them. They love their family and friends,  but they also love strangers they have never met before and take true  compassion on them.   If you want to know how to care for your community, I think you  should look to Leo and Judy for an example. Leo and Judy have been  doing it for over 50 years, and so many lives have been made better  because of them.   Madam Speaker, I thank Leo and Judy. Their service and kind hearts  have made the Knoxville community a much brighter place. I am proud to  represent them.                            ____________________
