 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. It is  badly needed.   First, I want to thank Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Ranking Member    James Comer for their quick work. I have been trying for a long time  to try to get this bill passed. I have asked everybody to put it in the  CR and into the National Defense Authorization Act, but we didn't get  it there. But the gentleman has brought it to the floor, so I thank  both Representatives for doing that. Of course, I thank Speaker Pelosi,  Chairwoman DeLauro, and Leader McCarthy.   This is badly needed, as was mentioned by the previous speakers. We  are now 23 days away, and a tremendous amount of money is on the table.   It wasn't their fault. A lot of litigation was occurring so the money  couldn't be spent. Consequently, if they don't spend it, they lose it,  and they can't take care of the health problems caused by COVID. So  this is a good piece of bipartisan legislation.   But we are not done because we do have to continue this as it goes to  the Senate. I am urging my leaders to ask the Senate to really get this  bill done. It is needed, it is right, and it is justified. Let's take  care of those first Americans in this legislation because of COVID. It  can be done.   Again, I thank both Members for the work they have done and the body  of the House for voting ``yes'' on the legislation.
