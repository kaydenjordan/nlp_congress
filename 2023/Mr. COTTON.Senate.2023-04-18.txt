 Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize the  tremendous accomplishments of COL William V. Wenger on the occasion of  his receipt of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts  of America and the National Eagle Scout Association. Colonel Wenger has  lived a life of honor, faith, and service. He is a patriot who has made  America a safer and better nation.   Colonel Wenger served in the U.S. Army for more than 42 years,  commanding American soldiers across the country and around the world.  He served in the Gulf war, helped reestablish order in Los Angeles  after the Rodney King riots, and provided military support to law  enforcement after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.   In 2000, Colonel Wenger retired from the military, only to return to  Active service after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He then  volunteered for two tours of duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan, where  he worked to bring stability, security, and the rule of law to lands  haunted by terrorism. Among other contributions, he trained Iraqi and  Afghan police and led counter-IED training efforts to save the lives of  his fellow coalition soldiers and police.   Throughout his military career, Colonel Wenger demonstrated  extraordinary tactical, strategic, combat advisory, and logistical  leadership abilities. He consistently volunteered for difficult  assignments, overcame daunting challenges, and relentlessly pursued  excellence. He is precisely the kind of clear-eyed, tough minded,  mission-oriented leader that every soldier should aspire to become.   In the civilian world, Colonel Wenger has earned distinction as a  manager, trainer, author, business leader, and professor of business,  history, and military science. He is husband to Robin D. Wenger and  father to two sons, John Paul and Patrick.   He is also a committed philanthropist who participates in his local  Kiwanis, Rotary Club, and Knights Templar, among other civic  organizations. He is a U.S. Army Reserve ambassador and a leader of the  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, which supports our Reserve  servicemembers, their families, and their employers. The ESGR recently  awarded Colonel Wenger its highest award, the prestigious James Roche  Spirit of Volunteerism Award.   More than any other civic organization, however, Colonel Wenger has  demonstrated an exceptional, lifelong commitment to the Boy Scouts of  America. He joined the Boy Scouts in 1954 and earned his Eagle Scout  Award in 1963. He has since served in senior positions in the  organization, including being elected the chief of the Tribe of  Tahquitz. While serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, he devoted much of his  limited free time to support the development of the Boy Scouts and Girl  Scouts in those nations. For his work, he will receive the highest  honor bestowed by Scouting on April 23--an honor well earned.   A nation is only as good as its people. America is not made great by  its geography or its founding documents alone. It is made great by the  patriots who serve the Nation and make us proud when we look up and  salute the American flag. It is made great by men who dedicate decades  of their lives to protect this Nation in uniform, more than half a  century to educating our youth to be ``physically strong, mentally  awake, and morally straight,'' and who spend their later years teaching  young adults about our Nation's history. In short, it is made great by  men like Colonel Wenger.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to thank Colonel Wenger  for his contributions to our Republic.                            ____________________
