Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Isakson) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from North Dakota  (Mr. Hoeven) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I congratulate the majority leader for  securing these important confirmations of nominees who have been  waiting, for no good reason, simply to get an up-or-down vote and get  confirmed. This is a big day, with roughly 65 nominations confirmed  just here in the last few minutes--things that should have been handled  but for the obstruction and foot-dragging of our colleagues across the  aisle.   I want to focus for just a minute on things we have been able to do,  notwithstanding the lack of cooperation of our colleagues across the  aisle since this new administration came into office.   I know the focus of the press--and, frankly, some of our own focus-- has been on the unfinished business, like healthcare reform. I can  assure my colleagues that issue is not going away and gets more  difficult to address as each day goes by.   Perhaps one of the most significant things we have done in the last  few months is confirm Neil Gorsuch as a Justice on the Supreme Court.  It is undeniable that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified, high-caliber  nominee, and he is already serving our Nation well on our highest  Court.   We have also worked together with the President to deliver  legislation that is a priority for our veterans and police departments  around the Nation. The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, which I was  proud to sponsor, will help our returning veterans continue to serve  their country by creating incentives for police departments to hire  them once they take off their military uniform and put on a new uniform  as a member of local police departments. This legislation will help  keep our communities safe while supporting those who have served our  country. I am proud we were able to work together on a bipartisan basis  to make it the law of the land.   On this side of the aisle, we are absolutely committed to helping  businesses and job creators do what they do best--innovate, create more  jobs, and employ more people--and not waste time dealing with onerous  rules and regulations. With a friend in the White House--somebody  sympathetic to the needs to grow the economy, create more  opportunities, and let people pursue the American dream--we have been  able to finally deliver some relief to the American people.   One of the ways we have done that is through one of the more obscure  laws, perhaps--but one we have brought to life--the so-called  Congressional Review Act. Until just this year, I think the  Congressional Review Act had been used only one time to repeal the  ergonomics rule years ago.   The Congressional Review Act was created to give Congress an  opportunity to do away with or repeal regulations which were put in  place as the Obama administration was headed out the door. Using these  Congressional Review Acts, and with an ally in the White House, we  undid some of the thousands of burdensome rules and regulations created  by the Obama administration--rules and regulations which added up to a  hefty pricetag for our country and which have strangled our economic  recovery since 2008 and the great recession.   That is not all. We have also passed important bipartisan legislation  imposing tough sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea.   In the case of Iran, the overwhelming vote was a strong message that  the United States will not tolerate Iran's complicity in terror and is  a clear indicator of just how important this legislation is. Now, most  people listening to me would be surprised we did this because, frankly,  there wasn't a whole lot of coverage about it because it was done with  such broad and overwhelming bipartisan support, but it is important,  and it is an important signal to our adversaries in other countries  that we will not sit idly by and leave our Nation undefended and their  acts undeterred.   This week, we continue to build on these additional accomplishments  for our veterans. I commend, in particular, the Senator from Georgia,  Mr. Isakson, for his great work in getting these bills passed.   Over the last several years, we have heard about VA facilities across  the State of Texas and across the country which have been plagued by  inefficiency, unaccountability, and quality of care issues. The VA has  been hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles which have been  incredibly frustrating and costly for our veterans. The Veterans Choice  Program was created to fix that by ensuring veterans can receive timely  appointments close to home. The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act,  which we passed earlier this week, continues that program and  guarantees veterans that they will continue to have access to care  without interruption.   Of course, we still have additional work to do before leaving for the  August work period. There are still vacancies in the executive branch  that need to be filled. In order for President Trump to do the job he  was elected to do on November 8, he needs his team in place. While I am  glad that today, just a few moments ago, roughly 65 of his Cabinet  nominees and sub-Cabinet nominees were confirmed, I hope our  [[Page S4801]]  colleagues across the aisle will stop their stall tactics so we can  confirm the rest of the nominees of this administration.   I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for the work he did  to see passage of the Food and Drug Administration User Fee Program.  This is an incredibly important, although somewhat obscure, law that  helps establish partnerships between the private and public sector  which ensure patients have access to safe and effective drugs and  medical devices, while also maintaining the position of the United  States as a global leader in medical innovation.   It is simple. Faster approvals mean treatments and cures reach  patients sooner, and increased competition leads to lower cost, and  that, in turn, leads to more lives saved.   I also congratulate Senator Johnson from Wisconsin. He has been  trying to get this bill called the Right to Try Act, which passed  unanimously earlier today. This is designed to give dying individuals  one last chance to try perhaps sometimes experimental medications to  see if that will help them extend their quality of life and their  longevity. I know he feels passionately about it, and I congratulate  him for his leadership and perseverance.   With these remaining items, it is clear we have been able to  accomplish a lot in a short time for the American people. Again, we  focus on our unfinished work--like the healthcare bill. I assure my  colleagues, once again, that remains broken, people remain hurting, and  we should not rest or give up until we are able to give them some  relief, and we are determined to do that.   Mr. President, I want to mention one other piece of legislation that  was introduced today which we have been working on for a long time-- years, literally, but since the Trump administration came into office,  and particularly with Secretary of Homeland Security General Kelly, who  has now become the Chief of Staff for the White House.   We have introduced something called the Building America's Trust Act,  which is border security legislation that increases resources at our  borders while boosting trade through ports of entry and strengthens  enforcement of existing laws.   Earlier this year, several of my colleagues and I went to my home  State to tour our southern border, including the Rio Grande Valley,  Laredo, and Del Rio, TX. The reason I was so glad to welcome my  colleagues to visit Texas with me and see the borders is because it is  a unique part, not only of our State but a unique part of our Nation.   Each mile along the border presents its own challenge in terms of  what is needed to protect it. On this trip, we spoke most notably with  Manny Padilla, chief of the Rio Grande Patrol Sector and commander of  the Joint Task Force of the West and South Texas Corridor. Chief  Padilla presides over the busiest Border Patrol sector in the United  States. He said something then which stuck with me. He pointed out that  any border security plan must include a combination of three things,  and the way those three things come together may well vary, and will  vary, depending on the particular location:   The first is physical infrastructure.   Here is an example of some of the fencing that exists along the  border where the Border Patrol believes it is necessary in order to  control the flow of people across the border in a way they can be  allowed to do their job.   The second is technology--things like this aerostat, with its radar  capability. It is literally eyes in the sky, which can allow the Border  Patrol to do their job better.   Here is another example of some of the ground-based radar which is  available. You can imagine, with a 1,200-mile border between Texas and  Mexico alone, it is a huge job and a very complex environment.   Of course, the third thing, in addition to physical infrastructure  and technology, is things like personnel. Literally, we need to make  sure we have an adequate number of Border Patrol available to deal with  people who are coming across the border in violation of our immigration  laws.   I believe, until we secure the border and enforce the law, we will  never be able to regain the public's confidence, which allows us to do  other things we need to do to fix our broken immigration system.   That is why we call this bill the Building America's Trust Act. It  does these things--secures our borders with expanded resources,  enhances ports of entry to increase trade--because it is important to  separate the criminal activity from legitimate trade and commerce,  which creates 5 million jobs in the United States alone. That is just  by our national trade with Mexico. Of course, it strengthens  enforcement of our immigration laws. That is why we have gotten support  from the National Border Patrol Council, the Federal Law Enforcement  Officers Association, the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition, and  the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition as well, and we have had  supportive statements by the Fraternal Order of Police and others.   I firmly believe that until we accomplish this goal--until we regain  the public's confidence that we are actually serious about it and we  have a plan to do it--we will not be permitted by our constituents to  do the other things we know we need to do to fix our broken immigration  system.   I know the Presiding Officer was at the White House yesterday with  the President, talking about his plan to try to make our legal  immigration system more merit-based. This is something we have been  trying to do for years now, and I congratulate the Presiding Officer  for helping restart that discussion because we need to focus not only  on border security and enforcing our laws, we need to think about and  talk about what a 21st century immigration system for our country  should look like. Should it be based strictly on family relationships  or should it be based on some of the attributes of the immigrant which  would benefit the United States--people with advanced degrees and  capability, people who can come here and help make our country better,  not just come here to become dependent on our country.   The Building America's Trust Act is a chance for our Democratic  colleagues who have said they actually believe in border security to  demonstrate their support. In fact, we supported one of the toughest  border security packages there is. I believe that is what this  represents.   It is clear the President has made obvious from the beginning that  border security would be a top priority for him. I think it is one of  the reasons he was elected on November 8 of last year--because the  American people sensed, even if maybe they didn't know the details,  that things had gotten out of control, our borders were in chaos, and  thousands of people were coming across the border who had no legal  right to be here in disregard of our laws. They sensed, in their core,  that something was fundamentally wrong--that, yes, we are a nation of  immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws--and we have lost that.  This is about regaining trust in government and keeping our commitment  to the American people.   Over these last few months, I have been working with colleagues, not  only in the Senate and the House but with General Kelly in the  Department of Homeland Security--now Chief of Staff of the White  House--to come up with a strategic plan which addresses various facets  of border security and interior enforcement as well. We know about 40  percent of illegal immigration is people who enter the country legally  but who overstay their visa and simply melt into the great American  landscape.   For too long, those on the frontlines have not had the tools they  need to get the job done. These are public servants, like our Border  Patrol, who risk their lives to keep us safe, and we simply haven't  lived up to our commitment to give them the tools and the political  will necessary to support them.   We know the borders are also cause for our local, State, and Federal  officials to have to work together, and it makes sense for us to do  more to help them do their job at the State and local level as well.   Our bill authorizes additional resources for Border Patrol agents,  Customs and Border Protection officers, for agricultural inspectors,  and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE officers. We also  provide for additional immigration judges and Federal prosecutors for  State and local law enforcement to aggressively fight drug  [[Page S4802]]  trafficking, smuggling, and other crimes that, unfortunately, occur  along our borders because the organizations--these transnational  criminal organizations--really don't care about human life.   We saw that recently when a number of immigrants died in the back of  a tractor trailer in a parking lot at Walmart in San Antonio, TX. They  are a commodity, a way to make money in the eyes of these cartels who  care nothing about human life. Drugs, weapons, and other threats to our  country are also part of what they move across the border, and that is  why border security is so important.   Our bill also focuses on criminals, gangs, and repeat offenders who  return to the United States in defiance of our laws. We have zero  tolerance for those criminals in this bill. We end catch-and-release,  and we include Kate's Law, a bill recently passed by the House that  increases penalties for those who repeatedly cross our borders  illegally. The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was so tragically  murdered in San Francisco.   We hold sanctuary cities accountable because no city should be able  to defy cooperation with Federal law enforcement officials. We are not  asking them to do the Federal Government's job, but they do have an  obligation, as we all do as American citizens, to cooperate and work  with our law enforcement officials.   We impose tough penalties on Federal funds for jurisdictions that  fail to comply with lawful Federal immigration enforcement requests. To  curb the abuse of visas, our bill utilizes a biometric entry-exit  system at ports of entry to identify visa overstays and cut off  immigration benefits to those who exploit the system.   We also make sure to invest in our ports of entry. These are the ways  that people come into our country legally and engage in commerce and  trade, which is mutually beneficial. We can't neglect our trading  partnerships with our neighbors to the south because we depend on that  trade to create and sustain 5 million jobs in the United States alone.   The Building America's Trust Act will also help boost the flow of  commerce through our ports so that legitimate trade can continue to  flourish. This bill also includes a large investment of resources to  improve our ports of entry, to help target and isolate illegal  immigration and drug trafficking at ports while facilitating increased,  legitimate trade and travel.   Perhaps most importantly, this bill also requires that the Department  of Homeland Security and law enforcement officials consult with local  officials every step of the way. The people who live in our border  communities know best how to help control illegal traffic and illegal  activity, but it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step up  and help them. They understand the benefits of legitimate travel and  trade and traffic, all of which are important parts of a successful  border security effort.   Border security really is not a one-size-fits-all plan. As Chief  Padilla said, it is always a combination of technology, personnel, and  tactical infrastructure--wall systems, fences, and the like. We need an  approach that will work for each unique area with input and stakeholder  consultation at every step to ensure that the right solution is  achieved for all involved.   As I have said, I am happy to have support for this legislation from  several law enforcement organizations. I look forward to working with  all of my colleagues in both Chambers, as well as the administration,  toward our goal of protecting our Nation and securing our borders.   I firmly believe that border security, ultimately, is a matter of  political will. This President has the political will, and this  Congress should have the political will to get the job done. This was  the commitment that he made and that we need to make to the American  people and that, I think, informed their vote on November 8, 2016.   With this legislation as a guide, we aren't just securing our borders  for tomorrow. We are looking ahead and locking in a framework that will  exist long after President Trump leaves office.   With the Building America's Trust Act, I hope we can do just that  and, again, finally regain the public's confidence by earning that  confidence and restoring order and lawfulness to our broken immigration  system.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1757         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
