General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Montana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Montana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4171, a bill I  introduced with Congressman Connolly, to extend Federal agencies'  authority to conduct a telework pilot program.   The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 provided Federal agencies, and  specifically the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with the authority  to conduct a pilot program to incentivize telework. The pilot program  allows agencies to waive the reimbursement of travel costs for  teleworking employees who return to headquarters for mandatory training  programs.   Both agencies and employees benefit from this arrangement. Agencies  benefit from having an additional tool for recruitment and retention.  Agencies also realize cost savings by allowing employees to work at  different locations.   For example, according to the USPTO, its telework program saved $77.4  million in fiscal year 2016 alone. The savings are related to lower  real estate costs and increased personnel retention.   In turn, teleworking employees can work from almost anywhere in the  United States. The teleworking program moves USPTO employees into the  communities that they serve. For example, in my State of Montana, the  pilot program allowed the USPTO to place patent examiners in Bozeman,  Butte, Billings, and Missoula.   Teleworking can grow opportunities in our communities that aren't  close to highly populated areas that house Federal agencies. It has the  promise of bringing more good-paying jobs to Montana and other rural  areas across the country.   Now that agencies are seeing the cost savings associated with  telework, this pilot program can be wound down. Absent congressional  action, this program expired last week. However, the USPTO has  requested an extension in order to allow it to budget for increased  travel expenses related to paying for employees to return to agency  headquarters in northern Virginia or one of its regional offices. This  bill extends the program for 3 years.   I thank the congressman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for working  with me in a bipartisan fashion to bring this bill to the floor. I urge  my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would make the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings) aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4171, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1208) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 9155 Schaefer Road, Converse, Texas, as the  ``Converse Veterans Post Office Building''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3655, introduced by the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). The bill names the United States  Post Office at 1300 Main Street in Belmar, New Jersey, after Dr. Walter  S. McAfee.   Dr. Walter McAfee was a scientist, educator, and adviser to the U.S.  Army Communications-Electronics Command. He is credited as the first  person to calculate the speed of the Moon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the sponsor of the bill.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the  gentleman from Montana, for yielding and for the support that he and  the ranking member provided for this important legislation.   It is an honor to bring H.R. 3655 to the House today to designate the  facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 1300 Main Street in  Belmar, New Jersey, as the Dr. Walter S. McAfee Post Office Building.   Dr. Walter McAfee was a scientist, educator, and adviser to the U.S.  Army Communications-Electronics Command and the Fort Monmouth  community.   Mr. Speaker, I reached out to the leaders of the Information Age  Learning Center, also known as InfoAge, several months ago and asked  them if they could recommend a member of their community who they  believed ought to be honored in this way, and they recommended Dr.  McAfee.   As some of you may know, InfoAge has been the leading organization  preserving scientific history, innovation, and communications located  at the former Army camp, Camp Evans, and subpost of Fort Monmouth.   Dr. McAfee was instrumental in the success of Project Diana, an  effort by scientists at Camp Evans that pierced the Earth's outer  atmosphere with high frequency signals, in other words, radar. It was  his mathematical calculations that enabled the team to bounce the first  radio signals off the Moon's surface. Without the success of his  calculations that allowed for communication to occur between Earth and  space, the achievements of launching the satellites into space or  sending a man to the Moon would have not been possible.   It is the achievement of this extraordinary man that actually helped  launch us into the space age. During his time at Fort Monmouth, Dr.  McAfee also developed sensors which were used to detect and track enemy  movements during the Vietnam war. He served as director of a NATO study  on surveillance and target acquisition, high-priority technologies,  during the Cold War.   Dr. McAfee was the first African American to be promoted to GS-16, a  supergrade civilian position in the U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC,  and to be inducted into the AMC Hall of Fame. Throughout his lifetime,  his achievements were recognized through dozens of awards and honors  that he received for his contribution to science and to the defense of  the United States and our allies.                                time  1515    He was known for his love of learning, his high ethical standards,  and great sense of humor.   He passed away in 1995 in Belmar, New Jersey. He and his wife, Viola,  were married for close to 54 years and are survived by their daughters,  Diane Mercedes McAfee and Marsha Bera-Morris.   I thank my colleagues for their anticipated support for this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The bill names the United States post office building at 123  Bridgeton Pike in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, after James C. ``Billy''  Johnson.   Billy Johnson joined the United States Army in 1941 as a private and  was later commissioned as an officer. Second Lieutenant Johnson was  killed in action in 1944.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), who is the sponsor of the bill.  [[Page H9821]]        Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring H.R. 4285, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 123 Bridgeton  Pike in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, as the James C. ``Billy'' Johnson  Post Office Building, to the floor for consideration.   Second Lieutenant Johnson was born and raised in my district in  Richwood, New Jersey, in 1920. Due to his strong desire to serve his  country, Billy enlisted as a private in the United States Army in 1941.  He was later commissioned as an officer.   He was assigned to the 370th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Division during  the height of the Italian Campaign in World War II. Second Lieutenant  Johnson made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when he was  tragically killed in action in October of 1944.   It is because of his steadfast commitment to his country, along with  his valor and dedication to his country, that I support the naming of  this post office after Second Lieutenant Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
