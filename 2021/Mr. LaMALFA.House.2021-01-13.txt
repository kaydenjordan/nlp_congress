 Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the  second annual impeachment show extravaganza, brought to you by the  censors in left-wing media, the fact-check ministers of shutdown in Big  Tech, and the Democrat Party.   Today, the second annual impeachment of President Trump isn't really  about actual words spoken at a rally. No. This is all about, Madam  Speaker, the unbridled hatred of this President.   You use any extreme language and any process to oppose the core of  what he has really fought for. You hate him because he is pro-life, the  strongest ever. You hate him for fighting for the freedom of religion,  to not be persecuted by unfair mandates and limitations on speech.   You hate him for not subscribing to and shackling us with the  religion of  [[Page H182]]  climate change and one-sided Paris accords. You hate him for Israel.  You hate him for defending our borders.       You hate him for letting families and small businesses keep what they  earn, for trying to keep the agents of government off their back.   You hate him for putting America first, which is what I thought we do  when we swear the oath.   No, this shabby show isn't about a threat to our Republic. This is  the impeachment and muting of at least half of the American people.  This is a shameful abuse of a process.    Madam Speaker, I pray people of all stripes wake up to  the spectacle and exercise their rights to put a stop to it through  free speech and through fair elections.
