 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I had a speech prepared to give, but I am not going to  read that speech because I think the chairman from Massachusetts  highlighted the crux of the problem we face in this Chamber today.    We don't trust each other any longer in this institution. As he just  alluded  [[Page H4730]]  to, don't give over the floor, don't give over control of this body to  the other side because we don't know what the Republicans will bring  up.   I give my word that what we would bring up is a bill that will  provide immediate relief under the Paycheck Protection Program of $138  billion to our small businesses, our families, and individuals who are  suffering in America today.   We need to start trusting each other again. We don't trust each other  in this institution and that is what is causing the American people to  suffer.   I ask my colleagues: When you vote ``yes'' on this previous question,  be on notice. You are turning your back on the American people that  need the Paycheck Protection Program assistance today. And when you  make that vote, you do it with your eyes wide open. You do it on notice  that you will be turning your back on those individuals who cry out for  help as we speak here on this floor today.   What we are talking about here is that we need to do our job as  Congress. Now, I have done everything in my power personally over the  last 3 months to work with our Senate colleagues, to work with the  White House, to work in a bipartisan fashion to do a bigger package  than the Paycheck Protection Program. But I will take what I can get.   There should be bipartisan support for this Paycheck Protection  Program relief that we are talking about here today.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, vote ``no,''  and join us and trust us in standing with the American people.                                time  1200
