 Mr. President, the Senate just passed the legislative  tools needed to repeal and replace ObamaCare. This is a critical step  forward--the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law.  The resolution now goes to the House. They will take it up soon. The  next step will then be the legislation to finally repeal ObamaCare and  move us toward smarter health policies.   The repeal legislation will include a stable transition period as we  work toward patient-centered health care. We plan to take on the  replace challenge in manageable pieces with step-by-step reforms. We  can begin to make important progress within that repeal legislation,  and we will continue to work with the incoming administration and the  House in developing what comes next.   There are other steps we can take as well, including important  administrative steps like confirming Tom Price as Secretary of Health  and Human Services and Seema Verma as CMS Administrator. They can start  stabilizing the health insurance markets that ObamaCare has thrown into  turmoil, and they can start bringing relief to the American people.  There is a lot they can do.   There is lot we can do. We may not be responsible for ObamaCare and  the harm it has done to so many, but we have been clear about our  commitment to bringing relief from it. From skyrocketing premiums and  deductibles to dwindling options on the exchanges, too many families  don't know how they will continue to endure the consequences associated  with ObamaCare. These families have called for a helping hand. They  have called for Congress to listen to their concerns, and they have  called for us to finally build a bridge away from ObamaCare and toward  health policies that put them first. We just took a decisive step  toward that goal last night.   Repealing and replacing ObamaCare is a big challenge. It isn't going  to be easy. Nonetheless, we are committed to fulfilling our promise to  the American people--and we will.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
