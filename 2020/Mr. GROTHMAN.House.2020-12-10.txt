 Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on vitamin D a bit in the  past, and I know we are on the verge of passing another coronavirus  bill.   I would ask people negotiating that bill to do something to make sure  that the public is aware of the benefits of vitamin D.   Yesterday, I talked to a Dr. David Meltzer at the University of  Chicago, a very brilliant man, and I hope some of the negotiators talk  to him before a final deal is cut.   While he cannot nail down a specific amount of people who will not  have to suffer the severe consequences of vitamin D deficiency, or even  die at the hands of vitamin D, it is probably somewhere between 40 and  70 percent. Right now, about half of Americans have a vitamin D  deficiency. That is going to get worse as we head into the winter  months and people are not outside getting vitamin D.   So, I strongly request the negotiators to do something to make sure  that we stand up to the public health establishment and educate people  on the importance of vitamin D and see what we can do about getting  products to the market which accelerate getting vitamin D into your  bloodstream, because even if you start taking vitamin D tomorrow, you  don't get the level that you should have for quite a while.   I am encouraging the negotiators to talk to Dr. David Meltzer, who  will also fill you in on studies from Ireland, Spain, MIT, Harvard, and  Northwestern.                            ____________________
