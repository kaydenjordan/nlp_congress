 Mr. Speaker, today I stand to honor and celebrate  the achievements of my constituents with Down syndrome and the  worldwide Down syndrome community. I also want to recognize all of  their families and loved ones who witness the tremendous struggles  individuals with Down syndrome face and the wonderful victories they  achieve every day.   This past month, on March 21, marked World Down Syndrome Day. On this  day, people with Down syndrome, and those who live and work with them  throughout the world, organized and participated in activities and  events to raise public awareness and create a single global voice for  advocating for their rights, rights such as inclusive education, access  to quality and affordable healthcare, meaningful employment, and  protection of their civil rights.   On March 21, we celebrated the contributions of individuals with Down  syndrome in our communities and the meaningful work of organizations  and individuals who dedicate their personal and professional time to  ensure individuals with Down syndrome and other disabilities achieve  their optimal abilities.    Every year, this day is a time for education, increased community  awareness, and giving thanks. When individuals with Down syndrome and  other disabilities are included, we all benefit. Our goal as a society  is to prepare today's children for tomorrow's leaders, including those  with Down syndrome and other disabilities.   Enabling individuals with Down syndrome to live, work, and  participate with confidence and autonomy, fully included in society  alongside of their friends and peers, is our duty as a Nation. I  personally have seen the hard work of constituents in ensuring  individuals with Down syndrome and other disabilities have the same  educational, financial, civil rights, and opportunities afforded to  others, as well as access to services that help them achieve their full  potential.   I am appreciative of the work of the Pennsylvania Down Syndrome  Advocacy Coalition, the Montgomery County Down Syndrome Interest Group,  the Bucks County Down Syndrome Interest Group, The Arc of Pennsylvania,  The Arc Alliance, the National Down Syndrome Congress, and other  national organizations that are collaborating on  [[Page H3154]]  behalf of the rights and needs of individuals with disabilities.   I ask all of my colleagues to commit to working with us in bringing  the concerns and needs of the Down syndrome and disability communities  to the bipartisan discussions occurring within Congress.   The special needs community are the most special among us, Mr.  Speaker. We need to be here for them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of  thoughtful and innovative students in my district from Bensalem,  Pennsylvania.   Six students at Bensalem High School have been working in their  industrial design class to build a snow sled for the blind. Working  with students from Villanova University to make their prototype as  strong as possible, they came up with a design that included a backrest  and steering handles, and they also enhanced this device with sensors  that vibrate the handles when obstacles are detected.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the hard work of students Jonathan  Champagne-Cox, Brandon Gomez, Jakub Hajduk, Tom Kelly, Eric Rosenberg,  and Michael Wible. I would also like to commend Bensalem curriculum  coordinator Dan Lubacz for his guidance and for teaching his students  that their gifts and talents could be used in compassionate ways.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on my first day serving in this  Congress, I introduced a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution,  and I am honored to be cosponsoring the resolution on the floor today.   As I travel back home in my district, I get this question--as I am  sure so many of my colleagues do--I am repeatedly asked, why doesn't  Congress manage the national budget the same way businesses manage  their budget and families manage their budget? Why doesn't Congress  follow the same rules that businesses and families do, that we only  spend what we generate in revenues?   And it is a good question, Mr. Speaker, which gets us to the need for  a balanced budget amendment. One would think that we would not need to  amend the Constitution to do what Members of this body should be doing  anyway.   This is common sense, Mr. Speaker. But for decades, we have seen the  problem perpetuate, which is the responsibility of both parties. I am  convinced this is the only mechanism to force this body to balance the  budget. We are $21 trillion in debt, Mr. Speaker.   To my friends voicing opposition, we need to be honest about what  this resolution does. This resolution does not necessitate any cuts of  any kind. It simply requires that the budget balance. A commitment to  raising revenues through progrowth economic policies is the answer. And  that is what this resolution will force this body to do: raise revenues  to offset expenditures on a dollar-for-dollar basis.   Mr. Speaker, prior to this Congress, our economy was sluggishly  growing at about 1.6 growth in GDP, which is fiscally and financially  unsustainable. We are now well over 2 percent, on our way to 3 percent,  and we need to get to 4 percent.   As one of only a handful of CPAs in this Congress, I know that  economic growth has three essential components: tax reform, regulatory  reform, and a balanced budget. When you balance the books, you create  jobs, which leads to more revenue, which leads to an expanding economy,  making it easier for us to fund our critical priorities, like serving  our veterans, protecting our troops, funding public education, and  preserving our environment.   Mr. Speaker, that is what this resolution is about. And that is why I  am proud to cosponsor this legislation.   This is common sense, Mr. Speaker. The American people want this by  overwhelming margins. We need to get this done for them. It is our  moral responsibility.
