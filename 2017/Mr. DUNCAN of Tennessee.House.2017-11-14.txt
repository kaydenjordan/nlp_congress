 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the University of Tennessee College of Law's Legal Clinic on its 70th  anniversary. The UT Legal Clinic is a national leader in clinical  education.   The clinic has been ranked one of the top 10 legal clinical programs  among public universities and 19th among all U.S. law schools. The UT  Legal Clinic was founded in 1947, by Professor Charles Miller, and is  the longest, continually existing legal clinic in the country.   The clinic provides law students many opportunities to learn by  doing. This approach prepares students for both the practice of law and  providing legal services to the underprivileged. The work at the clinic  has further advanced the cause of justice by serving thousands of  indigent clients who cannot afford legal representation.   I want to honor and congratulate the UT College of Law's Legal Clinic  on its 70th anniversary and thank it for its honorable service to the  legal profession, the people of the State of Tennessee, and to the  entire Nation. I wish only the best for the Legal Clinic in future  years training and educating outstanding law students.                            ____________________
