 Mr. President, I rise today ahead of the Senate's vote on  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.  There are few responsibilities the Senate has that are more important  than confirming judges and, in particular, confirming Justices on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   The Supreme Court is charged with the responsibility of defending and  upholding the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It is charged with  the responsibility of upholding the rule of law and protecting your  rights and my rights.   Judge Jackson is someone that I have known personally for 30 years.  She and I went to law school together. We were both on the law review  together. Judge Jackson is someone who, on a personal level--she is  smart; she is talented; she is charming. I have always liked Judge  Jackson. But the responsibility given to the Senate is not to make an  assessment on a personal level, but rather to assess a nominee's record  and the kind of job they would do for the position to which they have  been appointed.   Now, many Democrats in this Chamber and their cheerleaders in the  corporate media insist that we cannot examine Judge Jackson's record.  They insist, in fact, that any scrutiny of her record, any difficult  questions directed her way, and, certainly, any opposition to her  nomination must, must, must be rooted in racism or sexism. Sadly, this  is a common talking point for Democrats. Whenever anyone disagrees with  them on substance, you must be a racist. If you are not a socialist,  you are a racist. That is their standard go-to.   And in this instance, all should acknowledge and should celebrate the  historic milestone that would be having the first African-American  woman serve as a Justice on the Supreme Court. Given our Nation's  troubled history on race, that is a major important milestone. I would  note, though, that the Democrats celebrating that fact--patting  themselves on the back--there is more than a little irony in their  celebrating that fact because the reason that we have not, to date, had  an African-American woman on the Supreme Court--a major reason--is that  the Democrats who are so proud of themselves filibustered a qualified  African-American woman nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  DC Circuit. Her name was Janice Rogers Brown. She was a justice on the  California Supreme Court, and 20 years ago, President George W. Bush, a  Republican, nominated her to the DC Circuit. And Senate Democrats  realized that a qualified African-American woman on the DC Circuit was  a real threat to go to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Janice Rogers Brown is a conservative and a constitutionalist, and  for Democrats, that was unacceptable. So Democrats filibustered Janice  Rogers Brown. Chuck Schumer filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. Joe Biden  filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. Dick Durbin filibustered Janice  Rogers Brown. Pat Leahy filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. Dianne  Feinstein filibustered Janice Rogers Brown.   So now, all the Democrats who are celebrating putting the first  African-American woman on the Supreme Court have themselves to thank  for that because it could have happened 20 years ago.   But in Senate Democrats' way of viewing things, if a Black woman or a  Black man or a Hispanic woman or a Hispanic man dared to disagree with  leftist orthodoxy, they do not count. Indeed, it was not just Janice  Rogers Brown. Democrats also filibustered Miguel Estrada to the DC  Circuit. Miguel Estrada, an advocate with superb credentials, was  criticized, as the staff for Senator Ted Kennedy wrote at the time in  internal memos that they could filibuster ``because he is Hispanic.''   Mr. President, this was before your time and my time in this body.   Here is what Ted Kennedy's staff told them:         Identify [Miguel Estrada] as especially dangerous . . .       because he is Latino.    That is racism--which the Democrats put in writing. If you are Black,  if you are Hispanic, we will target you, we will filibuster you, we  will block you, and that is what they did. For that matter, that is  what Democrats have done for three decades now to Justice Clarence  Thomas, one of the greatest Justices to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme  Court. And yet, in Democrats' minds, he is not a Black man because he  dares disagree with their leftist ideology. It is wrong; it is racist;  it is cynical; and it is offensive.  [[Page S1997]]    What we should be doing--what every Senator should be doing--is  examining Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's record, her actual record. If  you look at her substantive record, it is far out of the mainstream. It  is an extreme record. If you look at her record, I believe it  demonstrates that Judge Jackson, if she is confirmed, will be the  single most liberal Supreme Court Justice ever to serve on the Supreme  Court. I believe she will be to the left of Justice Sotomayor; she will  be to the left of Justice Kagan; and she will be way, way, way to the  left of Justice Stephen Breyer, the Justice she would be replacing.   What does that mean as a practical matter, left and right? Why do the  American people care about the Supreme Court? They care because they  care about their rights. As a practical matter, what it means--I  believe the odds are nearly 100 percent that Judge Jackson would vote  to overturn the case of Heller v. District of Columbia.   What is that case? It is the landmark case that upholds the Second  Amendment right to keep and bear arms, a fundamental protection for all  of us. That case was decided 5 to 4. Judge Jackson, I believe, is a  vote to overturn that case to take away our Second Amendment rights,  and that means every Senator who votes to confirm her is voting to take  away the Second Amendment rights of Americans.   Judge Jackson, I believe the odds are nearly 100 percent that she  would vote to overturn the Citizens United case. What is Citizens  United? It is a landmark case that protects our right to free speech,  our right to speak in the political process to support candidates, to  oppose candidates, to express our views, and participate in democracy.  Citizens United was 5 to 4, one vote away from being taken away.    By the way, in the Citizens United case, the Obama Justice Department  argued that the Federal Government has the power to ban books. The case  was 5 to 4. There were four Justices willing to go there. Judge  Jackson, I believe, would support the assertions of government power to  silence you, to silence me, to silence the men and women we represent.   When it comes to religious liberty, I believe Judge Jackson will vote  consistently over and over again against the religious liberty of  Americans, against our right to live according to our faith, according  to our conscience. One of the most precious rights, the very first  right protected in the first clause of the First Amendment of the Bill  of Rights--that is what our Framers thought about it--is that without  the right to seek out and worship the Lord God Almighty with all of  your heart, mind, and soul, no other rights matter. I believe she will  consistently vote to undermine that right and, in particular, one of  the applications of that right, the context of school choice.   School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century. If you  care about civil rights, if you care about advancement and opportunity  for young kids, for young African-American kids, for young Hispanic  kids, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that matters more than school  choice. And yet, the Supreme Court, in the case of Zelman v. Simmons- Harris, upheld Ohio school choice program by one vote, 5 to 4. I  believe Judge Jackson would vote to overturn Zelman v. Simmons-Harris  and vote to strike down school choice programs across the country.   You know, one of the problems with politics today is Members of this  body like to avoid accountability for what they are doing. But everyone  in this body is on notice that this is a Justice who will vote to take  away our free speech rights, vote to take away our religious liberty  rights, vote to take away our Second Amendment. And that means every  Senator that votes for her cannot avoid responsibility for those  lawless outcomes.   When it comes to abortion, Judge Jackson's record is extreme. I  believe she would vote to strike down every single restriction across  the country on abortion. I believe she would vote to strike down  prohibitions on Federal partial-birth abortion, a truly horrific  practice opposed by the vast majority of Americans. The Supreme Court  upheld the Federal ban on partial-birth abortion by a vote of 5 to 4-- one vote away. Judge Jackson, based on her record of being a radical  advocate for abortion, will consistently vote to strike down reasonable  restrictions.   All of those are extreme positions. But if you want to understand  just how extreme, there was one portion of the confirmation hearing  that I thought spoke volumes: when Senator Marcia Blackburn asked Judge  Jackson, ``What is a woman?''   ``What is a woman'' didn't used to be a trick question. One hundred  fifteen men and women have served on the Supreme Court, and all 115 of  them would have no difficulty whatsoever answering the question, ``What  is a woman''--not so Judge Jackson. Judge Jackson's response: I can't  define a woman.   ``I am not a biologist'' was her defense.   Now, does that really mean that Judge Jackson doesn't know what a  woman is? Of course not. What it does show is her sensibility that she  is completely in line with the radical left that wants to redefine what  a woman is and erase it from the dictionary. You know, yesterday, a  reporter stopped me. A reporter from a left-leaning publication said he  was asking every Senate Republican on the Judiciary Committee the  following question: What is a woman?   You could tell from the expression on his face he thought this was a  great ``gotcha'' question.   I looked at him and said: An adult female human.   He looked at me astonished, and he said: Did you look it up? He said,  That is actually the dictionary definition.   I said, No. I just speak English. If you would like another  definition, how about this one: A Homo sapien with two X chromosomes.  For all of recorded history, people have known what a woman is, but  Judge Jackson is such a fellow traveler with the radical left that she  cannot acknowledge common sense.   There is a reason the radical left groups in this country pressured  the Biden White House to nominate Judge Jackson because she was the  most extreme of the nominees being considered. There is a reason they  pledged billions of dollars to support her confirmation because she is  the most extreme of the nominees being considered.   Let me give an example of just how extreme. In the written questions,  I submitted a question to Judge Jackson that says:         The theory that humans possess inherent or inalienable       rights is reflected in the Declaration of Independence, which       states:        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are       created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with       certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,       liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.    Do you hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights,  yes or no?   Judge Jackson answered--this is in writing:         I do not hold a position on whether individuals possess       natural rights.    That is a radical broad statement. Our country was founded on the  quote I just read from the Declaration of Independence, with those  words that Thomas Jefferson penned.   We declared our independence from Great Britain. We declared that we  were our own Nation. We started a revolutionary war. We drafted a  Constitution based on the proposition ``We hold these truths to be  self-evident.'' They are not evident to Judge Jackson.   She doesn't hold a position that ``all men are created equal, that  they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that  among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.'' Judge  Jackson says she has no position on whether you have a right to life.  She has no position over whether you have a right to liberty. She has  no position on whether you have a right to the pursuit of happiness.   If you are a modern leftist, if you are a socialist who wants the  government to control every aspect of your life, every aspect of your  freedom, then a judge who has no view on whether we have natural rights  is exactly the kind of judge you want.   By the way, to understand how radical her opinion is, you can look at  the Make the Road decision. This is a decision in her court, in the  district court, that was challenging the Trump Department of Homeland  Security deporting people illegally in this country.   The statute under which the Secretary was removing illegal aliens  explicitly gave the Secretary discretion  [[Page S1998]]  and said that discretion is unreviewable in Federal courts. It was a  clear and explicit authorization and a removal of the authority of  Federal courts to second-guess the policy determinations. That didn't  stop Judge Jackson at all. She ignored the plain text of the statute.  She issued a nationwide injunction to stop the Federal Government from  removing illegal aliens. Her decision was so extreme that, on appeal,  it was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit  unanimously. This is a left-leaning court, with a majority of Democrat  appointments, and unanimously, the DC Circuit reversed her because she  ignored the plain language of the statute.   But there is no area that is more extreme than Judge Jackson's record  on crime. This was the central focus of the confirmation hearing, and  her record is far, far, far out of step with the mainstream.   When it comes to crime generally, nationally, the average for Federal  judges sentencing criminals is 45.1 months. That is the average  sentence nationally. Judge Jackson's average is 29.9 months--33.8  percent less than the national average. If you are a criminal, you want  to be in Judge Jackson's court because you are going to get a sentence  more than a third less than you will get in the average district court.  That is far out of the mainstream.   As you know, there was considerable focus not just on her leniency on  criminals, her leniency on violent criminals, her leniency on sexual  predators, her leniency on drug dealers, but there was a particular  focus on her very disturbing record as it concerns child pornography.   When it comes to child sex offenders, it is a truly grotesque problem  we face in this country. I spent a number of years in law enforcement.  As the solicitor general of Texas, I worked on many criminal cases.  There were no cases that were more disturbing to me personally than the  cases where people abused kids, where they hurt kids, the evil, sick  predators who carry out unspeakable acts on little children.   I have to say, when I first heard that there was a concern about her  record on child pornography, I thought, come on now, that can't  possibly be the case. Who is soft on child pornography? That didn't  sound plausible. Then I examined her actual record. I examined cases.  She had roughly a dozen child pornography cases as a district judge. In  every single case where she had discretion, 100 percent of the time  where she had discretion, she sentenced the defendant way, way, way  below the Federal sentencing guidelines and way, way, way below what  the prosecutors recommended, the very liberal DC prosecutors.   Now, when this issue was first raised, the Democrats responded: Well,  Federal judges across the country sentence defendants below the  sentencing guidelines, especially concerning child pornography. And  that claim, insofar as it goes, is true. But her record is not simply  sentencing below the guidelines; it is sentencing way, way, way below  prosecutors.   Then we examined, how does she sentence in child pornography cases  compared to other Federal judges? Let's compare apples to apples. When  it comes to possession of child pornography, the national average for  all Federal judges is 68 months, a little over 5 years. It is a serious  crime with a serious prison sentence. Judge Jackson's average is 29.2  months. Now, note, the national average sentences child porn offenders  to a longer sentence than your typical crime. Judge Jackson sentences  child porn defendants to a shorter sentence than your typical crime.  When it concerns possession of child pornography, it is a 57-percent  difference.   But it is even more disturbing in a separate category, and that is  distribution of child pornography. Distribution of child pornography,  the national average is 135 months--11 years--a long time for a  horrific crime. Judge Jackson's average sentence was 71.9 months. That  is a full 47 percent less than the national average.   But it is even more egregious than that when you understand that with  distribution of child pornography, Congress has passed into law a  minimum sentence of 60 months. So Federal judges have no discretion to  sentence below 60 months. That is the bare minimum. When you look at  that, you realize that judges across the country--and we are not  talking just Republican judges; we are talking Democrat judges: Bill  Clinton judges, Barack Obama judges, Joe Biden judges--they sentence,  on average, 75 months longer than the minimum. Judge Jackson sentences  on average 11.9 months longer. It is a consistent and disturbing  pattern.   Now, why does she do this? Well, when you sit down and read the  transcripts of her sentencing hearings, which I have done, it is  disturbing stuff. When you read the transcripts, she is very explicit  that she has clear policy concerns.   Under the sentencing guidelines, there is a stricter sentence for  child pornography involving very young children. She refuses to apply  that. There is a sentencing enhancement for child pornography involving  sadomasochistic abuse of children, children being tortured. She refuses  to apply that.   If you look at what she has said, she said to the prosecutors--this  is a quote from Judge Jackson at a sentencing hearing in United States  v. Cane--she said, ``[You are] obviously aware''--she is talking to the  prosecutors--``[You are] obviously aware of my policy disagreement. I  just think it's very, very hard to deal with number of images as a  significant aggravator.''   Now, what does this mean? There are two other aggravators for child  pornography. One is use of a computer, and the other is number of  images. In case after case, she refuses to apply them.   On use of a computer, she says: Well, at the time the guidelines were  passed, this crime was primarily carried out through the mail. Now,  everybody does it through a computer, so I am not going to use an  enhancement for a computer.   Now, I don't agree with her on that, but I understand that point.  That point is not out of the mainstream. But there is another  aggravator, an aggravator up to five levels for the number of images,  and over and over again, she says she won't apply the number of images.   I asked at her hearing. I said: So you are saying that somebody who  has videos of a thousand children being sexually abused and somebody  who has an image of one child being abused--that those are the same  crimes, that you shouldn't punish the one offender more than the other?   She refused to answer that question.   That is extreme. It is radical, and that is not the law. Her  disagreement--I would note, I believe I have 25 minutes, and Senator  Thune extended--had a UC to change the time.    When it comes to Judge Jackson's record, it is far out of  the mainstream. This is a judge who, as a Justice--the odds are 100  percent, I believe, she will vote to strike down the death penalty  nationwide, and she will rule repeatedly to release violent criminals,  to release murderers, to release sex offenders. This is a pattern that  is highly, highly disturbing.   Our Democratic colleagues like to say they don't support abolishing  the police. When you nominate and confirm judges who let criminals out  of jail, you have the responsibility for the consequences of your  actions.   Judge Jackson's record is extreme, and I urge my colleagues to vote  against her confirmation.
