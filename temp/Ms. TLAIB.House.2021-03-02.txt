 Madam Speaker, I rise because voting is a right that must  be extended to all people, and, yes, that includes currently and  formerly incarcerated individuals.   Madam Speaker, in a country that has yet to fully make amends or pay  restitution for its racist past, we must recognize that taking away the  right to vote as punishment for a crime is directly tied to the racist,  mass incarceration system that continues to wreak havoc on Black and  Brown communities.   The stripping of the right to vote of incarcerated people, especially  Black folks, is directly connected to the racist past of our country,  from slavery and Jim Crow laws to mass incarceration. It was done with  intent, to disenfranchise them for the most sacred right: to choose the  people and policies that govern.   Madam Speaker, people need to look it up. There are countries that  allow formerly incarcerated people to vote.
