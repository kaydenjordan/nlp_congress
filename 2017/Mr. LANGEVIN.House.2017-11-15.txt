 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, in strong opposition to this House  Republican tax bill, which was developed in secret without a single  public hearing.   Despite repeated calls for Republicans to engage in a bipartisan  process with Democrats, this bill was written without Democratic input  and with enormous giveaways to wealthy interests.   It makes you wonder, doesn't it, Mr. Speaker?   To pay for them, Republicans have eliminated critical tax provisions  that are important to the middle class--such as deductions to medical  expenses, for State and local taxes, for student loan interest, and  other expenses--on which middle class families rely. What Republicans  can't pay for, they add to the Nation's credit card to the tune of $1.7  trillion.   Mr. Speaker, we are out to support this plan, but most Americans are  only given the crumbs of this tax reform pie.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this bill. We  need a fair and balanced tax reform package that helps everyday Rhode  Islanders and that helps everyday Americans get ahead, not just the  well-off and well-connected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
