 Mr. Speaker, I come from Memphis, which is a  transportation hub, but I am an American, and transportation moves  goods and products and creates jobs.   I am proud to be for this bill. I would have preferred having the  bill that the Transportation Committee came up with. We worked until 4  in the morning to come up with a bill.   But that is not reality. This is the only bill that in reality can  happen. This is much more of a Republican bill; bipartisan from the  Senate, endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, endorsed by many, many  Republican groups.   Nobody do I think more of than the dean of the House, and I am so  happy   Don Young endorsed this bill. I hope more Republicans will join  with him. This is a good bill for America. I will vote for it to move  America forward.
