 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 591 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 591         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.       Res. 54) relating to a national emergency declared by the       President on February 15, 2019. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure; and (2) one motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H8000]]  from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 591, providing for consideration of  S.J. Res. 54, relating to a national emergency declared by the  President on February 15, 2019, under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure and provides one motion to commit.   Mr. Speaker, this joint resolution, pursuant to the National  Emergencies Act, would terminate the national emergency declared by the  President issued in July of this year. The same day that President  Trump declared a state of emergency at our southern border, he,  himself, said, ``I didn't need to do this.'' It is now clear that  statement is true.   The President used an authority commonly used for construction at  military bases in foreign countries during a time of emergency. That  authority is now being used to divert $3.6 billion away from needed  military construction projects to build a wall that does not have the  needed political support in the House and Senate to be funded through  normal appropriations.   This emergency declaration was a politically motivated power grab  seeking to undermine congressional authority to oversee Federal  spending.   The executive cannot run roughshod over this constitutional principle  when the President fails to gain enough support for his policies. And  exaggerating the threat posed by asylum seekers at our border has not  been a convincing argument.   The American people have spoken. Over 60 percent of the public  opposed this emergency declaration.   What has been the result of the Presidential proclamation? Life  safety violations and fire risks at dilapidated military facilities are  going unaddressed. The Pentagon has been forced to defund billions of  dollars from 127 different military construction projects around the  Nation and the globe.   In Portsmouth, Virginia, a warehouse has life-threatening conditions,  but 330 servicemembers and civilian workers will continue to work in a  building without enough fire exits and without a working fire alarm or  sprinkler system. That doesn't seem to matter to President Trump,  though. Fencing and barriers along the border are more important to our  Commander in Chief.   In Maryland, money is being diverted from a planned childcare  facility to help soldiers balance their family commitments with their  service to our country.   In Kentucky, a middle school has lost out on $66 million in  construction funding.   In South Carolina, they won't be getting the fire station approved  and funded by Congress.   Our Armed Forces are also being denied a drone pilot training  facility, a ballistic missile field, a submarine maintenance building,  multiple training facilities, access improvements, and safety upgrades.   In my home State of New York, a $160 million appropriation is being  taken away from projects at the United States Military Academy at West  Point, including a state-of-the-art engineering facility to support the  Center for Innovation and Engineering.   After being promised that Mexico would be paying for this wall, we  are, instead, harming military readiness, safety, and innovation in  response to a politically exaggerated threat.   We, in Congress, have already done our job to put military  construction dollars where they are needed most. Now it is time for  Congress to do our duty again and prevent this overreach by the  President.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and for the  underlying resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may consume, and thank my  colleague. Let me just point out, I will admit, when I arrived here in  November, having been elected in a special election, I was somewhat  curious that--I think the last emergency meeting of the Rules Committee  in the 115th Congress, the last one dealt with cheese curds. So I am  not exactly sure how my friend and colleague defines emergencies.   What I do know is that this section of the National Emergencies Act,  really, was constructed to help the President and the country deal with  emergencies that arise before the Congress can act, but it is not  intended to overrule congressional action. The Congress did act on this  issue--there can be no question about that--during the last  appropriations process.   The other thing that the gentleman mentions, which I do want to make  clear, is the reason that we are doing this now, it is different.  Perhaps the resolution is not different, but we now have a complete  list of all of the projects that are now being defunded in order to  move dollars over to the wall.   I would also just point out that, not only was the original  resolution bipartisan in the Senate, but the resolution which passed  within the last few days had 11 Republican Senators support it. I think  one was unavailable who had supported it in the past and indicated that  he would continue to support the resolution. So it is bipartisan.   This is truly the act of Congress. I know that my friend and  colleague is well-associated with Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the  United States Constitution: ``No money shall be drawn from the  Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law. . . .''   So we are bound, and the Congress has acted. The Congress made the  decision not to fund this. The President is using powers in a way that  were not intended and diverting dollars away from much-needed,  necessary projects that enhance our military readiness.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, this is nothing more than smoke  and mirrors. The bipartisan Debbie Smith Act was included in the  Violence Against Women Act that was supported by this House and was  funded in the CR which we just enacted, which I was proud to support. I  am not sure all Members voted for the CR, but I did, and the funding  for the Debbie Smith Act is included in that.   Obviously, to suggest that this majority in this House is not  interested in supporting women and women who are victims of violence,  is, frankly, reprehensible.  [[Page H8002]]    But let me move back to the rule of law, which is what we are  actually debating here, and it relates to our authority under the  Emergency Powers Act.   I do want to note, to Mr. Woodall's point, we are not adding new law.  This is a resolution, which is clearly a provision in the National  Emergencies Act that allows the Congress to make the point that the  emergency, if it ever existed, no longer exists and this funding is  inappropriate, this shift of funding.   This is, again, a simple resolution passed by the Senate, and it  indicates that, in our view, the congressional authority is where the  appropriations process lies. It is articulated well in the  Constitution, and the Congress has acted, has acted before and will act  again.   The projects that are necessary for military construction around the  globe and throughout the United States are vital, and support of this  resolution and the rule would be something that I would think Mr.  Woodall and Members of the House would agree to.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge I am a bit of a football fan--not much of  an expert, but a fan--and I know that from time to time a play will be  called and a quarterback will follow all the offensive line moving to  the right of the field and follow behind them and appear to be handing  the ball off to a running back behind the offensive line, but actually  the quarterback has the ball, turns around, and goes the other way. It  is called misdirection. And that is what is happening on the floor, as  we speak.   I understand why my colleagues don't want to talk about the  President's actions. I understand why the Members on the other side  don't want to talk about actions that we consider to be considerably  outside what was intended by the national emergency powers given to the  President. So I would like to get back, if I may, though, to the issue  at hand.   I want to just read something.   ``We will vote on a resolution to reverse the President's ill-advised  national emergency declaration that funds the construction of a border  wall using money that Congress has appropriated and the President has  signed into law for other purposes, such as military construction. . .  .''   ``By declaring a national emergency, the President's action comes  into direct conflict with Congress' authority to determine the  appropriation of funds--a power vested in Congress by the Framers of  our Constitution in Article I, Section IX. That is why this  [[Page H8003]]  issue is not about strengthening our border security, a goal that I  support and have voted to advance. Rather, Mr. President, it is a  solemn occasion involving whether or not this body will stand up for  its institutional prerogatives and will support the separation of  powers enshrined in our Constitution.   ``Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that,  `Only Congress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing  moneys to be spent from the U.S. Treasury.'   ``For the past 65 years, the courts have determined the boundaries of  Presidential authority, vis-a-vis Congress, under the doctrine of  Youngstown Steel Sheet & Tubing, the 1952 Supreme Court case which  reversed President Truman's seizure of U.S. steel companies during the  Korean war. As Justice Robert Jackson explained in his profoundly  influential concurrence in that case, the question of whether a  President's actions are constitutionally valid should be determined by  examining the source of the President's authority, and in this  concurrence, the Justice goes through three scenarios in which he  assesses the President's power.   ``According to Justice Jackson, when acts taken by the President are  against the express or implied will of Congress, the President's power  is at its lowest ebb. Mr. President, President Trump's declaration  clearly falls in that category.   ``Now, the President rests his declaration on the National  Emergencies Act, and that act fails to define precisely what  constitutes an emergency, but there is a commonsense rule that we can  apply. It is a five-part test that was used by the Office of Management  and Budget under former President George Herbert Walker Bush to  determine whether or not requested funding merited an emergency  designation under our budget rules. Under that test, a spending request  was designated as an emergency only if the need for spending met a  five-part test. It had to be necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and  not permanent. Now, whether or not one agrees with President Trump that  more should be done to secure our southern border--and I do agree with  him on that goal--his decision to fund a border wall through a national  emergency declaration would never pass all of this five-part test.    ``Another concern that I have with the President's declaration is  that it shifts funding away from critical military construction  projects. We don't know which ones. We have not been able to get a  list, but this could have very real national security implications.  And, again, I would note that the military construction appropriations  bill incorporated projects recommended by the President and his  Department of Defense, was passed by both bodies and signed into law by  the President.   ``Let me emphasize once again that the question presented by this  resolution is not whether you are for a border wall or against a border  wall. It is not whether you believe that border security should be  strengthened or whether it is sufficient. It is not whether or not we  support or oppose President Trump. Rather, the question is a far more  fundamental and significant one. The question is this: Do we want the  executive branch now or in the future to hold the power of the purse--a  power that the Framers deliberately entrusted to Congress?   ``We must stand up and defend Congress' institutional powers as the  Framers intended that we would, even when doing so is inconvenient or  goes against the outcome that we might prefer.   ``I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval and  our Constitution.''   Now, some might think that was authored by a Democrat, but it was  not. Senator Susan Collins of Maine issued that back in March of 2019  when we considered the resolution for the first time, and, frankly, she  is far more eloquent than I.   I think I will let it stand at that, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H8004]]    Mr. Speaker, I don't disagree with my colleague that we all grow  weary. I never do of spending time with him on the floor. I just want  to acknowledge that.   I would say a couple of things, because there is a lot to unpack  here. But fundamentally this resolution should--I think he read it--say  that, Pursuant to the National Emergencies Act, the emergency  declaration finding is hereby terminated. That is actually in the law.   What we are doing in this resolution that was already passed by the  Senate and it, hopefully, will pass--not only the rule, but the  underlying resolution as well--and do exactly what the law does. There  is no need to change the law.   We may disagree, and obviously we do, about whether or not the  President's use of the provisions violates the Constitution. I say,  yes, my learned colleague differs, but what is clear is we are using  this within the context of the existing law, and so that is why we are  here.   I think the one difference, however--and I apologize, I have to put  my eyeglasses on to see this fine print--but one of the differences  that I note is--and I may have noted this earlier, I apologize if I am  repeating myself--but we now have a specific list of projects. So when  I look at, for instance, in Virginia the Joint Base Langley-Eustis in  January of 2020 is expected to have dollars for the construction of a  cyber-ops facility. That is money that is being redirected.   If you look at in Oregon, Klamath Falls, replacing fuel facilities at  the base there. If you look at--I mentioned the child development  center, I believe. In Florida the Fire/Crash Rescue Station at Tyndale  Air Force Base. The list goes on and on.   We now have more evidence of the fact that these projects are vitally  needed by the military and by members of our Armed Forces and advance  the security interests of the people of the United States and around  the world.   So we have details now of, in my view, what amounts to an  unconstitutional move of dollars without congressional approval. We  have that. We are acting, once again, in conjunction with our  colleagues in the Senate to end the national emergency declaration by  the President. While we might agree or disagree as to whether or not  that is really an emergency, and we might disagree or agree on whether  or not the use by the President of the act in the way he did is  constitutional.   What is incontrovertible is that the current law allows us to do what  we are doing today to end the emergency, and that is really the  question before us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, I should note that I probably shouldn't get into a  football argument with the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, with  its long history of that sport. I also shouldn't do it because if my  wife is watching, she will be very unhappy that I used a sports  analogy, which she decidedly does not like.   But just to torture the analogy a little more, because Mr. Woodall  raised it, misdirection does have a quarterback, but the whole point is  to fool the opposition.   I think that is what, frankly, some of my colleagues here today were  trying to do, is to fool the American public about what this resolution  before us is all about. I think that is unfortunate because the  resolution on the floor is critically important.   Before I close, I want to compliment my friend. I do enjoy this. I  know this is a serious topic--and no one should see it as anything  else--but I always appreciate his passion, his intellect, his  eloquence. It is always a joy to be with him in the Rules Committee and  here on the floor, and I so appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank all of my colleagues in the Rules  Committee for their support of S.J. Res. 54, relating to a national  emergency declared by the President on February 15,  [[Page H8005]]  2019, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:        At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (S. 820) to strengthen programs authorized under the       Debbie Smith Act of 2004. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of S. 820.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
