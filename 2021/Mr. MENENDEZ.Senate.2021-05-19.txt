 Mr. President, I like calling the Presiding Officer  ``Mr. President.''   Let me appreciate the Presiding Officer's support about what I am  going to speak today to address one of the most significant foreign  policy challenges of our time, which is the U.S.-China relationship; a  challenge that the Senate, I believe, is ready to meet with bold,  bipartisan action.   Just weeks ago, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made history  when we passed the Strategic Competition Act of 2021 by an overwhelming  bipartisan vote of 21 to 1. This historic, bipartisan legislation is  clear-eyed about the challenges we face, and it is designed to meet  this consequential moment in U.S.-China relations.   Over the past few years, China has accelerated its rise to power and  sharpened its efforts to undermine the liberal international order that  brought the American people and our allies so much prosperity and  stability in the 20th century.   We invited China to be engaged in the international order. We invited  them into the World Trade Organization. We invited them into an  international forum. We opened markets with them, all with the  expectation that China, by being ultimately invited into the  international order, would be part of the international order.   Unfortunately, instead of playing by the rules, China, under Xi  Jinping, has  [[Page S2758]]  sought to undermine them. Today, China is challenging the United States  across every dimension of power--political, diplomatic, economic,  innovation, military, even cultural--and advancing an alternative and  deeply disturbing model for global governance based on old-fashioned  military antagonism, predatory economic practices, and digital  authoritarianism.   The breathtaking scope, scale, and urgency of these challenges  demands a policy and strategy that is genuinely competitive. Because of  China's actions, the national security and economic future of the  United States depends on framing our relationship with China today  through the lens of strategic competition.   This is not about a zero-sum relationship or resurrecting a cold war  mentality. This is about recognizing that in the 21st century, our  strategic competition will revolve around the geo-economics of the  future and America's ability to successfully compete in new and  emerging technologies and other hotly contested domains. This is about  securing a regional and international order for the 21st century built  on progressive values, one that encourages healthy and fair economic  competition, promotes global security and stability, and strengthens  human rights around the world.   So how do we achieve this vision? Ranking Member Risch and I  incorporated input from almost every member of the committee to build  the Strategic Competition Act. I believe the Presiding Officer had  amendments as well, which mobilizes all of our strategic, economic, and  diplomatic tools to clearly confront the challenges China possesses to  our national and economic security.   So I am eager to see the Strategic Competition Act move on the floor,  alongside the other pieces of this package, recognizing, as I have for  years, that America's ability to compete with China begins at home,  replenishing the sources of our national strength. That is why the  investments in the Endless Frontier Act provisions and the other  domestic measures drafted by various committees are equally important.   But even if we did all of those things alone, it would not meet our  challenge with China because, first and foremost, China is a foreign  policy challenge. That is why the Strategic Competition Act reaffirms  our alliances and partnerships. It prioritizes building functional,  problem-solving regional architecture in our Indo-Pacific strategy.  Every witness we had before the committee, as we prepared for this  legislation, said, You have to get your Indo-Pacific strategy right in  order to be able to meet the challenge of China under Xi Jinping.   It promotes U.S. leadership within international organizations. It  counters malign efforts by the People's Republic of China and the  Chinese Communist Party to influence those institutions, and it grounds  our foreign policy in American values by authorizing a broad range of  human rights and civil society measures to address abuses in Xinjiang  with ethnic Uighurs and to demonstrate our commitment to the people of  Hong Kong, Tibet, and China's civil society.   It counters China's predatory economic practices by addressing their  rampant intellectual property theft and unfair state subsidies. It  helps other countries work together to counter China's corrupt  practices. China goes throughout the world holding itself out as being  generous to nations in Africa and Latin America and elsewhere, but what  it ends up being is a debt trap of diplomacy where these countries  become hostage to China--not only economically, but then, in a  transactional basis, China says, Well, you can't recognize Taiwan  anymore; or China says, You have to vote with us at the U.N. Human  Rights Commission and a whole host of other international forums.   And it bolsters U.S. economic statecraft, those economics tools we  can deploy to advance our foreign policy goals like investing in supply  chain security, infrastructure development, digital connectivity, and  cyber security.   Now, I do want to take a couple of minutes today to directly address  an emerging line of criticism I have heard that this bill is somehow  seeking to ignite a new cold war with China. Nothing could be further  from the truth. The reality is that for more than 40 years, the United  States has sought to draw China into the international community as a  responsible stakeholder. But any clear and accurate assessment of  China's behavior and, particularly, its behavior in recen years under  the hypernationalist leadership of Xi Jinping suggests that simply  continuing down that path would only result in disaster for the United  States, for China, and for the entire world.    Let's just review some of China's actions. China is committing  genocide in Xinjiang against the Uighur people through forced labor.  China has dismissed, out of hand, the ruling of the International  Tribunal for the Law of the Sea with regards to its excessive maritime  claims in the South China Sea, which it is militarily building up on  and trying to intercede in the rightful passage of nations in the South  China Sea.   China has walked away from the commitments it made to respect  intellectual property rights. China has chosen to betray its legally  binding obligations and its own commitments to the people of Hong Kong,  crushing ``one country, two systems'' and the vibrant democracy,  economic activity, and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong.   China refuses to respect the religious, cultural, and linguistic  autonomy of the Tibetan people and is seeking to subvert the religious  succession of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. China is using its Belt and  Road Initiative to exploit lesser developed economies to its own  advantage. China threatens the efforts of the international community  to deal with climate change by building more coal-fired power plants at  a rate that outpaces the rest of the world.   So we must empower Americans, our partners, and our allies to protect  against these egregious efforts to undermine human rights, security,  and our environment. We simply cannot turn a blind eye to China's  actions or wish it into becoming a better international actor.   Now, I realize that in discussing the Strategic Competition Act, I  laid out a laundry list of big, structural policy issues with China  that we will need to confront as a nation, but it is essential that the  United States meets this moment if we hope to build a more perfect  world, one that reflects our cherished commitment to free societies,  free markets, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and the  dignity of all humankind. At the end of the day, that is what this  Strategic Competition Act is all about.   So I look forward to a robust debate and discussion with my  colleagues over the next week or two about how to restructure and  rework U.S. policy towards China so that we can be, after far too long,  genuinely competitive. Together, we have to ensure the United States  reclaims our place as a leader of nations and a force for good in a  chaotic and increasingly complex world.                                 Middle East    Mr. President, now, on another note, I know we have great challenges  in the world. We are having a great challenge in the Middle East. I  would just simply say that I am not a fan of having resolutions brought  to the floor of the Senate without the appropriate consideration of the  committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee--so that informed, deliberate debate and consensus agreements  come together in the best pursuit of foreign policy.   It is easy to get caught up in the passions of the moment. It is much  more difficult to think about what is the right policy and procedure  and action the United States should take in any given part of the  world.   So I know there is a bunch of resolutions that are being flown  around--none of which have gone to the committee--some that have merit  in each and every dimension but also have challenges. They fall short  of what I think would need to be done, and I would urge colleagues to,  particularly at this moment, have restraint, and I would urge the  ability for the committee to be able to consider what is the  appropriate course of action, whether it be at this time or any other  time, as our Nation faces global challenges.   I yield the floor.
