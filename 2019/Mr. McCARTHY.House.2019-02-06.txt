 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I can assure you there are no objections  on the Republican side. Is the Chair saying that the Democrat  leadership has not cleared this important legislation to protect  children who have been born alive?    Madam Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, as I said, there is no objection on the  Republican side, and it is just 2 p.m. on a Wednesday. Is the Chair  saying there is not enough time left today to consider this bill that  would save the life of a child who is born alive?    Madam Speaker, no further inquiries.                            ____________________
