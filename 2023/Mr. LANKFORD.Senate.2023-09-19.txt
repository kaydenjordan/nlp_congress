 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Navy Petty Officer  First Class Duane B. Pearson. HM1 Duane Pearson originally hailed from  the Bronx, NY, and as an Army family, he moved throughout the Nation;  in Lawton, OK, he decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy and follow his  family history of military service.   His initial oath was in November 2001 in Oklahoma City, OK; he  completed Navy boot camp and Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes, IL,  and went on to Expeditionary Medical Facility Training, Cherry Point,  NC, and Physical Therapy Technician School, San Antonio, TX, where he  was also promoted to third class petty officer.   His enlisted assignments include Naval Hospital Cherry Point, NC;  National Naval Medical Center Bethesda, MD, where he was deployed to  Camp Lemonnier to Djibouti, Africa; Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan; and  the Office of Attending Physician, Washington, DC.   While at the Office of Attending Physician, he continued providing  expert physical therapy services, but also managed an emergency  response medical call center, and provided advanced cardiac life  support response to multiple Nation special security events, including  three Presidential inaugurations, nine State of the Union Addresses,  seven Peace Officers Memorials, and scores of gold medal ceremonies and  summer concerts. Additionally, he was instrumental in administering  over 30,000 Covid vaccines in direct support of both the Supreme Court  of the United States, and U.S. Congress.   His military decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps  Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Joint  Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Meritorious Unit  Commendation, Armed Forces Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal,  and various other personal and unit awards.   His military career has been successful because of the support and  confidence of Jasmine, his wife and best friend of 18 years. He also  has two supportive children, who are both talented athletes--Micah and  Imani.   In May 2019, he received his bachelor of arts Degree, with honors,  from Southern Illinois University in healthcare management and will  complete his master's in healthcare administration from the University  of Baltimore this December.                            ____________________
