 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss an issue that has impacted  far too many women across the United States, triple-negative breast  cancer, or TNBC.   One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer in  her lifetime. In Arizona, there will be approximately 6,240 new breast  cancer-related cases just this year.   TNBC is an invasive breast cancer that accounts for 10 to 15 percent  of all breast cancers. Unfortunately, TNBC tends to grow and spread  faster than any other cancer, has fewer treatment options, and tends to  have a worse prognosis.   Researchers at the University of Arizona have been working to create  a less toxic treatment for TNBC, and a new study has provided clues  about potential new approaches to treatment.   This is good news in the fight against cancer, but we must continue  to invest in research and innovation to combat TNBC and protect women.                            ____________________
