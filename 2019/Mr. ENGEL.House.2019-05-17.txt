 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the  Equality Act.   Currently, it is legal to fire an individual, prevent access to  credit, and even deny or evict someone from their home just because  they are LGBTQ.   The Equality Act will guarantee Federal protections by ensuring the  LGBTQ community is provided full protections under Federal civil rights  laws. No longer will our fellow Americans be deprived from buying a  home, fired from their job, or denied a meal in a restaurant just  because of who they are.   I am as pleased to help pass this landmark bill today as I was back  in 1996 when I voted against the discriminatory DOMA, or, so-called,  Defense of Marriage Act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.
