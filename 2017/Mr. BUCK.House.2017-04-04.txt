 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 240 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 240         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1343) to       direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise its       rules so as to increase the threshold amount for requiring       issuers to provide certain disclosures relating to       compensatory benefit plans. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-11 shall be considered as adopted. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; (2) the further amendment printed in the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, if       offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall       be in order without intervention of any point of order, shall       be considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for a division of the question; and (3) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. Americans have always been a people known for  taking ownership. We take ownership of our lives and livelihoods,  working hard to provide for our families. We take ownership in our  communities, setting standards of conduct. We take ownership in all our  political process, voting for the right candidates. We have even taken  ownership in our world, fighting evil actors and regimes to maintain  peace.                                time  1230    H.R. 1343, the bill we are discussing today, allows employees to take  ownership in their companies. This is the American way.   Under SEC rule 701, private companies can offer their own securities  to employees, enabling those employees to take a stake in the company.  This is a great deal for both businessowners and employees. I doubt  either side of the aisle would disagree.   Rule 701 allows employers to better recruit talented employees and  pay them without having to borrow money or sell securities. For some  companies, especially younger ones, compensating employees through  equity is vital for survival.   These younger companies need the top talent but often can't pay the  top salaries. Rule 701 allows them to offer potential recruits a  tradeoff: accept a lower salary now for more equity in the company  later.   By giving the employees a stake in the company, businessowners reward  the employees for their continued hard  [[Page H2642]]  work and innovation. Workers have an opportunity to buy into the  mission and future of the company. They have the opportunity to reap  what they sow, making their work more meaningful and fulfilling.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1343 simply raises the reporting threshold for  companies who issue securities to their employees as compensatory  benefits. Right now, any company that issues more than $5 million of  securities in a yearlong period faces significant reporting  requirements, including financial statements and disclosure of risk  factors. These requirements cost small businesses time and money,  making them less likely to issue stock as compensation for their  employees. That is why this legislation moves the threshold up to $10  million.   The original $5 million threshold was added to rule 701 in 1999 and  hasn't been updated since. By easing the threshold and indexing it to  inflation every 5 years, we allow companies to increase the amount of  stock they offer to employees. Additionally, raising the threshold will  prevent private companies from having to disclose confidential  financial information.   America is known for taking ownership, but we are also known for  innovation. Our technology industry, especially, has propelled our  economy and quality of life forward. But so many great tech companies  started as small startups, struggling along from month to month before  the financial rewards of their hard work could be achieved.   Thinking about the young companies right now that have grand  innovative visions for improving our quality of life, this legislation  will help them thrive. The employees already pour so much of their  livelihoods into the venture. This bill will reward those workers with  equity so that their perseverance and investment will pay off.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to discuss the broad  support for this bill. I indicated earlier that both sides of the aisle  can support this legislation, and I want to highlight that bipartisan  support for the bill.   H.R. 1343 has equal numbers of Republican and Democratic sponsors.  Further, the bill passed out of the Financial Services Committee 48-11.  A majority of the Democrats on the committee supported the bill. A  similar bill passed with a bipartisan vote last Congress, with more  than two dozen Democrats joining Republicans to pass the bill. And in  the Senate, this same basic proposal passed the Senate Banking  Committee by a voice vote just a few weeks ago.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear to see why this proposal is generating so  much bipartisan support. With a higher threshold, companies can focus  their time on innovating and creating jobs instead of filling out  paperwork. Employees, meanwhile, can take a stake in their company and  their own future. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important rule  and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond briefly to my friend  from Colorado's comments about the nature of the rule. The Rules  Committee did make in order every single germane rule that was offered  to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we often talk about coming together in support of good  policy. We all have friends on both sides of the aisle, and we  routinely promise to work together on issues upon which we agree. Most  of us speak in front of our constituents about our desire to work with  the other party. However, we all know that Americans perceive us to be  constantly engaged in partisan conflict.   It is unfortunate that we are not able to work together on good  legislation more often. It is understandable that Americans feel  disappointed by Washington's partisan sniping. But here before us today  is a bill with wide bipartisan support. Not only has it already  received numerous bipartisan votes, there were only two amendments  offered to the bill. One amendment was withdrawn because it was not  germane. The other amendment from my good friend from Colorado and the  Rules Committee, Mr. Polis, is simply requiring a report.   Why is this bill so noncontroversial?   I believe it has to do with the process by which we received this  legislation. The Committee on Financial Services held hearings as far  back as 2015 in which problems with the SEC rule were raised by small- business owners.   The sponsor of this bill, Mr. Hultgren, worked with his Democratic  [[Page H2647]]  colleagues on the committee and introduced a proposal to reform the SEC  rule. Chairman Hensarling held a full committee markup last month which  allowed for full debate and amendment, and now we have the bill on the  floor this week. Good process produces good policy. But perhaps equally  as important, good process helps instill faith in this institution.  When Americans see us take up an issue, hear their concerns, and work  together to find a commonsense solution, they will trust us to tackle  even bigger problems.   This may not be the largest legislative product that Chairman  Hensarling and the Financial Services Committee produce in this  Congress, but, nevertheless, it is an important work that is helping us  solve problems faced by American small businesses. This legislation  ensures that the employees of America's small businesses can take  ownership in their companies and their jobs. It reduces regulatory  encroachment on America's job creators and helps our small businesses  expand and grow.   I thank Representative Hultgren for bringing this bill before us. I  commend Chairman Hensarling for working with both sides of the aisle  and for following a good process on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and  vote ``yes'' on the bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 240 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1869) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to       provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination       in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and the Workforce. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1869.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an altemative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . .  [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with altemative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
