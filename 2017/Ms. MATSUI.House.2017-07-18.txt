 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 806,  better known as the ``Smoggy Skies Act.''   Because of the Clean Air Act, families have safer air to breathe,  fewer emergency room visits, and healthier futures. The bill before us  today is a direct attack on that progress, delaying lifesaving  protections against ozone pollution.   H.R. 806 will be particularly devastating to children with asthma,  the elderly, and people with lung and heart disease. Dirty air remains  a public health hazard.   If this bill becomes law, we will be rolling back the Clean Air Act's  protections and successes and putting people's health at risk.   The Sacramento region in my district sits in California's Central  Valley, which traps pollution from other parts of the State. And  despite these challenges, we have fostered a strong partnership between  the Federal Government and Sacramento's local agencies to improve our  air quality. But in order for this progress to continue, the EPA must  set its clean air requirements at a level that truly protects public  health.   The bill before us today would block ozone protections and  permanently damage the Clean Air Act. Between this ``Smoggy Skies Act''  and TrumpCare, Republicans are waging an all-out assault on Americans'  health.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and protect the well-being  of future generations.
