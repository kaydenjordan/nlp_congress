 Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of my  constituents who deserve action on issues that will improve their lives  and strengthen our Nation. However, instead of focusing on bipartisan  solutions, House leadership is focusing on partisan antics to impeach  the President.   On November 8, 2016, nearly 138 million Americans cast their votes to  decide the occupant of the White House. Now these voters are being  disenfranchised by Washington Democrats who seek to nullify the  election results. They are using any means necessary to remove the  President because they cannot beat him at the ballot box. Now, the  latest attack is the deployment of a costly and partisan impeachment  process.   Madam Speaker, I was elected to represent the great people of  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, and they have spoken. They  want Congress  [[Page H8377]]  to work on everyday issues, such as the rising cost of healthcare,  crumbling roads and bridges, and an opportunity to increase trade by  passing USMCA.   Madam Speaker, let's get back to work.                            ____________________
