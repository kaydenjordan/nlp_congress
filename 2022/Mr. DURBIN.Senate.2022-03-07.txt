 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 260 years ago, a young nobleman from  Poland and a military officer helped lead a rebellion against what he  and many others saw as a Russian puppet King in what was known as the  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was driven into exile in France,  where Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin urged him to go to America to  join in the fight, the Revolutionary War.   That young Polish nobleman's name was Casimir Pulaski. When he  arrived in America, he wrote to General George Washington and said to  him:         I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it,       and to live or die by it.    Pulaski was at Washington's side and is credited with saving George  Washington's life at the Battle of Brandywine. He is remembered fondly  as the Father of the American Calvary.   Pulaski died at age 34 in the fight for freedom and independence in  America.   Today is Casimir Pulaski Day, which we know full well in Illinois,  where it is a State holiday. Today, however, we look at the world and  realize that freedom is being defended in Ukraine. And today, we seek  Casimir Pulaski's spirit and fierce commitment to freedom and human  dignity in a historic young Ukrainian President and in Ukrainian men  and women who are fighting to save their Nation from another would-be  Russian czar.   I have been in Congress for a few years. Over the weekend, I had an  experience unique to my service in Congress.   Early on Saturday morning, hundreds of Members of Congress joined a  video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I have never  seen anything like it.   With the Russian military laying siege to his country and a Russian  bull's-eye on his back, President Zelenskyy spoke to us with remarkable  dignity and courage. He didn't mince words about what is happening in  Ukraine--the brutal Russian assaults literally trying to destroy his  nation. He said we all share the same basic values and dreams: to live  our lives in peace, watch our kids grow up, and to kiss them. He said  the Ukrainian people are fighting for these basic freedoms, and they  are prepared to be friends and share culture with their Russian  neighbors, if they can.   But over the last 12 days, his country, Ukraine, has faced full- fledged war with barbaric attacks on kindergartens, nuclear  powerplants, apartment buildings, infrastructure, and innocent  civilians.   Last Thursday, Russia and Ukraine agreed to create humanitarian  corridors in Ukraine, to allow civilians in areas under the heaviest  Russian attacks to evacuate safely. Twice over the weekend, Ukraine was  forced to close those corridors because Russia was attacking them  mercilessly. This is Vladimir Putin's war, deliberately targeting women  and children who have left everything and are trying just to reach  safety.   This photo shows the result of one horrific attack by Russian  soldiers on the people of Ukraine. Many people have seen it. It was on  the front page of the New York Times this morning. It took place in the  city of Irpin on Sunday. A Russian mortar struck an evacuation point  where these civilians were waiting to board a bus to go to safety.   Irpin's mayor said the attack killed at least eight people, including  a family. Sadly, you can see the children lying on the street. These  are among the 364 Ukrainians killed during the last 12 days of Putin's  barbaric war.   Mr. Putin, these deaths, like the death of that little girl I showed  on the floor last week, are your doing. Your reputation as a war  criminal and a bloody tyrant is now sealed in history.   More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled as refugees to neighboring  countries, such as Poland and Moldova. The open arms of the Polish  people and Moldovan people to their Ukrainian brothers and sisters is  remarkable and a reminder to the rest of us that we do share common  human bonds.   Some of you may have seen the moving stories last night on ``60  Minutes'' of the families with their children, desperately trying to  reach Poland, other countries nearby so that they can escape the bonds  of Vladimir Putin.   This strategy is like nothing we have seen in Europe since World War  II. But Putin's war on Ukraine is not simply an attack on one young  democracy; it is an attack on democracy itself.   I am proud to represent the city of Chicago, prouder still that it is  the home of so many immigrants who have made a difference in that city  and in America, Polish immigrants and descendants of Polish immigrants.  Per capita, there is a larger number in Chicago than anyplace outside  of Warsaw.   We are also home to many immigrants who trace their heritage to the  Baltic States. I happen to be one who does as well.   We have such a long history of Ukrainian immigrants coming to our  city that there is a neighborhood in Chicago called Ukrainian Village.   Last Friday, I went over to the Ukrainian National Museum. It is near  their Orthodox church. I take great pride in it. One woman there, who  is a Ukrainian artist, had displayed many of the creations she had made  on the wall. She said to me: They are for sale, Senator.   And I said: Well, I am glad to know that.   And she said: All the proceeds are going to the Ukrainian Army.   Naturally, I left with one under my arm.  [[Page S1003]]    Putin's war on Ukraine and the wave of refugees pouring into Poland  and other neighboring nations hits home in Chicago. People from all  backgrounds are donating money and goods--whatever they can--to help.   Meest-Karpaty is a Chicago-area shipping company with experience in  Eastern Europe. For 7 days now, the company's shipping facility on the  Northwest Side of Chicago has been an operations center for an  incredible volunteer effort to rush critical supplies to Ukraine.  People and companies are dropping off supplies of first aid equipment,  non-perishable food, diapers, and basic essentials: warm clothes,  sleeping bags, tents, flashlights.   Scores of volunteers assemble the donations into first aid kits and  baby kits--whatever is needed. They pack the donations in the boxes  that will be flown and delivered to the Polish border, where more  volunteers deliver them to Ukrainians who need them. People are doing  everything they can to support Ukraine's fight for freedom and  democracy.   Andriy Herha is a banking executive from Oak Brook, IL, who was born  in Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. His dad, in-laws, cousins, friends-- they are still there in Ukraine. In one day last week, he raised  $40,000, personally, to buy bulletproof vests, helmets, first aid kits,  and other supplies. When he learned that it would take weeks for the  supplies to reach those who needed them, he decided to pack them into  suitcases and board a flight to Poland and deliver them himself. As  Andriy Herha told a reporter, ``we are trying to do anything possible  to help them.''   We in this Senate must also do what we can to help Ukraine in its  fight for freedom and democracy. Last week, I led more than 40  Senators--both parties, Democrats and Republicans--in asking President  Biden to extend temporary protected status to the 75,000 Ukrainians who  are currently in the United States, including on student and work  visas. On Thursday, as I knew he would, the President responded  favorably. He is granting that protection.   Congress should also act without delay to approve $10 billion this  week in emergency aid to assist Ukraine and bolster our NATO allies, as  well as support neighboring nations like Poland and Moldova that are  providing safe havens to the refugees.   And after listening to President Zelenskyy on Saturday, I thought to  myself: How can we possibly be importing Russian oil and gas, giving  the profits of those transactions to Vladimir Putin to pay for his war  machine?   I believe now--and I have cosponsored the legislation that reaches  this goal--that the United States should ban the purchase of Russian  oil to further tighten economic pressure on Putin. I joined in the  legislation introduced by Senators Murkowski and Manchin to do that.   Secretary of State Antony Blinken was talking with our NATO allies.  Many of them also seem willing to consider a ban on Russian oil.   Vladimir Putin is threatening not only the security of Ukraine; he is  threatening the security of the world. We must not even indirectly fund  his war machine. While Putin wages war on democracy, the world,  including the United States, will likely pay more to fill our tanks at  the gas stations and heat our homes. We have to be ready for that  reality, but that is the price today of defending freedom and  democracy. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives. We may end up  paying some more at the pump.   Amid all this utterly outrageous and unnecessary suffering and  destruction, all to assuage Vladimir Putin's warped sense of grievance  and his twisted nostalgia for the dark days of the Russian Empire,  President Zelenskyy ended his talk with us on Saturday morning on a  memorable note. He said we are all one big, undefeatable army for  freedom and that we should all live in peace and openness and, despite  the horrors inflicted on his people, we must hold on to our humanity.   He was a standup comedian at one point. He did a movie, which was a  spoof on someone as unlikely as himself being elected President. Lo and  behold, in the next free election, he was elected President of the  country.   Many people questioned whether he was up to the job. Boy, his  detractors are very quiet now. This man has risked his life for his  country, as so many are in Ukraine. It is time for us to stand behind  Ukraine solidly--solidly for their leadership.   I hope this crisis ends soon. Until then, the United States and the  rest of the civilized world must stand with Ukraine for freedom and  democracy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr.  Padilla) is necessarily absent.
