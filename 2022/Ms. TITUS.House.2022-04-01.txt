 Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act is a historic piece of  legislation, no question about it. It removes criminal convictions for  marijuana use that have stigmatized the lives of thousands of  individuals in our country, particularly those of color. In addition,  tragically, our veterans have been denied access to medical marijuana  for treatment of pain management and also post-traumatic stress  syndrome after they have offered their lives and put their lives in  danger for us.   Supported by public vote, Nevada legalized medical marijuana in 2001,  decriminalized marijuana use in 2017, and has shown that regulating  marijuana works. Most of the other States have done the same, so it is  time for the Nation to follow suit.                                time  1030    With the passage of the MORE Act, the marijuana industry can become a  key element of growing and diversifying our economy, creating more good  jobs, and putting more folks back to work as we recover from the  pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.  [[Page H4103]]
