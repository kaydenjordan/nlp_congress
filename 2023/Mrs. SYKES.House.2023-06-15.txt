 Mr. Speaker, I proudly represent Ohio's 13th  Congressional District, and this Pride Month I rise to recognize Queer  in Canton as Ohio's 13th Congressional District's Champion of the Week.   Queer in Canton was founded in 2020 by Abby Henry and Curstynn Marks,  two young, dedicated, and inspiring people who saw a gap in resources  available to queer people in Canton and Stark County, and they resolved  to make a change.   Queer in Canton works to cultivate the LGBTQ+ community in Stark  County and create a more equal community in Canton and beyond.   During the second annual Stark Pride Festival last weekend, Abby  announced that after 2 years of fundraising, Queer in Canton has  successfully raised the $20,000 they needed to open Stark County's  first community center to support those who identify as LGBTQ+ and  their allies.   This community center will offer LGBTQ+ residents a safe place to  call home, a space where the queer community can socialize, access  resources, and have the freedom to be their authentic selves.  [[Page H2947]]    Once again, congratulations to Queer in Canton for this monumental  achievement and for their advocacy this Pride Month and beyond. They  are truly making a difference in Ohio's 13th Congressional District and  making it the best place to live, work, and raise a family, no matter  who you love or how you identify.                            ____________________
