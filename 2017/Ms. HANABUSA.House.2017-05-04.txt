 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Save  Medicaid in Schools, a coalition of dozens of organizations. This  letter states that this bill jeopardizes health care for the Nation's  most vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students in  poverty.                                                       May 2, 2017.      Re The American Health Care Act Vote       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Minority       Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader Pelosi: The undersigned       member organizations of the Save Medicaid in the Schools       Coalition are concerned that the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) jeopardizes healthcare for the nation's most       vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students       in poverty. Specifically, the AHCA reneges on Medicaid's 50+       year commitment to provide America's children with access to       vital healthcare services that ensure they have adequate       educational opportunities and can contribute to society by       imposing a per-capita cap and shifting current and future       costs to taxpayers in every state and Congressional district.       While children currently comprise almost half of all Medicaid       beneficiaries, less than one in five dollars is spent by       Medicaid on children. Accordingly, a per-capita cap, even one       that is based on different groups of beneficiaries, will       disproportionally harm children's access to care, including       services received at school. Considering these unintended       consequences, we urge a `no'' vote on The American Health       Care Act (AHCA).  [[Page H4160]]         Medicaid is a cost-effective and efficient provider of       essential health care services for children. School-based       Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to children who can't       access critical health care and health services outside of       their school. Under this bill, the bulk of the mandated costs       of providing health care coverage would be shifted to the       States even though health needs and costs of care for       children will remain the same or increase. Most analyses of       the AHCA project that the Medicaid funding shortfall in       support of these mandated services will increase, placing       states at greater risk year after year. The federal       disinvestment in Medicaid imposed by the AHCA will force       States and local communities to increase taxes and reduce or       eliminate various programs and services, including other non-      Medicaid services. The unintended consequences of the AHCA       will force states to cut eligibility, services, and benefits       for children.        The projected loss of $880 billion in federal Medicaid       dollars will compel States to ration health care for       children. Under the per-capita caps included in the AHCA,       health care will be rationed and schools will be forced to       compete with other critical health care providers--hospitals,       physicians, and clinics--that serve Medicaid-eligible       children. School-based health services are mandated on the       States and those mandates do not cease simply because       Medicaid funds are capped by the AHCA. As with many other       unfunded mandates, capping Medicaid merely shifts the       financial burden of providing services to the States.    Medicaid Enables Schools to Provide Critical Health Care for Students         A school's primary responsibility is to provide students       with a high-quality education. However, children cannot learn       to their fullest potential with unmet health needs. As such,       school district personnel regularly provide critical health       services to ensure that all children are ready to learn and       able to thrive alongside their peers. Schools deliver health       services effectively and efficiently since school is where       children spend most of their days. Increasing access to       health care services through Medicaid improves health care       and educational outcomes for students. Providing health and       wellness services for students in poverty and services that       benefit students with disabilities ultimately enables more       children to become employable and attend higher-education.        Since 1988, Medicaid has permitted payment to schools for       certain medically-necessary services provided to children       under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)       through an individualized education program (IEP) or       individualized family service program (IFSP). Schools are       thus eligible to be reimbursed for direct medical services to       Medicaid-eligible students with an IEP or IFSP. In addition,       districts can receive Medicaid reimbursements for providing       Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment Benefits       (EPSDT), which provide Medicaid-eligible children under age       21 with a broad array of diagnosis and treatment services.       The goal of EPSDT is to assure that health problems are       diagnosed and treated as early as possible before the       problems become complex and treatment is more expensive.        School districts use their Medicaid reimbursement funds in       a variety of ways to help support the learning and       development of the children they serve. In a 2017 survey of       school districts, district officials reported that two-thirds       of Medicaid dollars are used to support the work of health       professionals and other specialized instructional support       personnel (e.g., speech-language pathologists, audiologists,       occupational therapists, school psychologists, school social       workers, and school nurses) who provide comprehensive health       and mental health services to students. Districts also use       these funds to expand the availability of a wide range of       health and mental health services available to students in       poverty, who are more likely to lack consistent access to       healthcare professionals. Further, some districts depend on       Medicaid reimbursements to purchase and update specialized       equipment (e.g., walkers, wheelchairs, exercise equipment,       special playground equipment, and equipment to assist with       hearing and seeing) as well as assistive technology for       students with disabilities to help them learn alongside their       peers.        School districts would stand to lose much of their funding       for Medicaid under the AHCA. Schools currently receive       roughly $4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements each year. Yet       under this proposal, states would no longer have to consider       schools as eligible Medicaid providers, which would mean that       districts would have the same obligation to provide services       for students with disabilities under IDEA, but no Medicaid       dollars to provide medically-necessary services. Schools       would be unable to provide EPSDT to students, which would       mean screenings and treatment that take place in school       settings would have to be moved to physician offices or       hospital emergency rooms, where some families may not       visit regularly or where costs are much higher.        In addition, basic health screenings for vision, hearing,       and mental health problems for students would no longer be       possible, making these problems more difficult to address and       expensive to treat. Moving health screenings out of schools       also reduces access to early identification and treatment,       which also leads to more costly treatment down the road.       Efforts by schools to enroll eligible students in Medicaid,       as required, would also decline.      The Consequences of Medicaid Per Capita Caps Will Potentially Be                          Devastating for Children         Significant reductions to Medicaid spending could have       devastating effects on our nation's children, especially       those with disabilities. Due to the underfunding of IDEA,       districts rely on Medicaid reimbursements to ensure students       with disabilities have access to the supports and services       they need to access a Free and Appropriate Public Education       (FAPE) and Early Intervention services. Potential       consequences of this critical loss of funds include:        Fewer health services: Providing comprehensive physical and       mental health services in schools improves accessibility for       many children and youth, particularly in high-needs and hard-      to-serve areas, such as rural and urban communities. In a       2017 survey of school district leaders, half of them       indicated they recently took steps to increase Medicaid       enrollment in their districts. Reduced funding for Medicaid       would result in decreased access to critical health care for       many children.        Cuts to general education: Cuts in Medicaid funding would       require districts to divert funds from other educational       programs to provide the services as mandated under IDEA.       These funding reductions could result in an elimination of       program cuts of equivalent cost in ``non-mandated'' areas of       regular education.        Higher taxes: Many districts rely on Medicaid       reimbursements to cover personnel costs for their special       education programs. A loss in Medicaid dollars could lead to       deficits in districts that require increases in property       taxes or new levies to cover the costs of the special       education programs.        Job loss: Districts use Medicaid reimbursement to support       the salaries and benefits of the staff performing eligible       services. Sixty-eight percent of districts use Medicaid       funding to pay for direct salaries for health professionals       who provide services for students. Cuts to Medicaid funding       would impact districts' ability to maintain employment for       school nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech-      language pathologists, school social workers, school       psychologists, and many other critical school personnel who       ensure students with disabilities and those with a variety of       educational needs are able to learn.        Fewer critical supplies: Districts use Medicaid       reimbursement for critical supplies such as wheelchairs,       therapeutic bicycles, hydraulic changing tables, walkers,       weighted vests, lifts, and student-specific items that are       necessary for each child to access curriculum as closely as       possible to their non-disabled peers. Replacing this       equipment would be difficult if not impossible without       Medicaid reimbursements.        Fewer mental health supports: Seven out of ten students       receiving mental health services receive these services at       school. Cuts to Medicaid would further marginalize these       critical services and leave students without access to care.        Noncompliance with IDEA: Given the failure to commit       federal resources to fully fund IDEA, Medicaid reimbursements       serve as a critical funding stream to help schools provide       the specialized instructional supports that students with       disabilities need to be educated alongside their peers.        We urge you to carefully consider the important benefits       that Medicaid provides to our nation's most vulnerable       children. Schools are often the hub of the community, and       converting Medicaid's financing structure to per-capita caps       threatens to significantly reduce access to comprehensive       health and mental and behavioral health care for children       with disabilities and those living in poverty. We look       forward to working with you to avert the harmful and       unnecessary impacts the AHCA would impose on Medicaid, which       has proven to benefit children in a highly effective and       cost-effective manner.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  TrumpCare Act. I am fortunate to have been born and raised in Hawaii  where we are taught to never forget our seniors, our kupuna.   AARP, with a national membership of 38 million and over 150,000 in  Hawaii, remains steadfastly opposed to TrumpCare. The amendment  proposed today makes the bill worse. And for our kupuna in Hawaii and  nationally, they will have no relief from the age tax.   This chart shows how much more at age 64 a person will pay in  premiums, almost $6,800 in Hawaii where we have one of the best health  cares. A 55-year-old will see a premium increase of almost $3,600 a  year. Why? What did the seniors do that TrumpCare wants to penalize  them and pay such a premium when they are moving towards retirement?  TrumpCare is out to get those 50 to 64 with this terrible age tax.   Vote against H.R. 1628. These numbers will not be different in your  districts.
