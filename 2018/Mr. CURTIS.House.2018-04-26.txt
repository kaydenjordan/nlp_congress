 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand before you today to  celebrate National Small Business Week.   With 30 million small businesses in the country, and nearly 280,000  of those in Utah, I was proud to join with my colleagues on the Small  Business Committee to coauthor H. Res. 840 to recognize the vital role  of small businesses.  [[Page H3588]]    It should come as no surprise that Utah is consistently ranked among  the best in the Nation for innovative startups and small businesses. In  fact, small businesses make up over 99 percent of Utah's business,  employ one-half of all employees in the State, and are responsible for  two-thirds of our job growth.   After spending much of my career as a scrappy small-business owner  myself, I strongly believe that small business is the heartbeat of our  economy. From emerging tech companies in Silicon Slopes to mom-and-pop  shops in rural Utah, I am proud to salute the overwhelming impact of  these small businesses.                            ____________________
