 Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing history at this time:  historic peace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the  UAE and Bahrain, both negotiated with the help of the Trump  administration.   But judging from the media coverage, you would hardly know it. In  fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we actually saw a banner headline like  this: Extra! Trump kills U.S. defense jobs! President brokers Middle  East peace deals.   I made this front-page parody, but it is trying to make a point.   When President Jimmy Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between  Egypt and Israel, the achievement was celebrated. He was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize. It was a defining moment in history.   There have been just four peace agreements negotiated between Israel  and its Arab neighbors. President Trump played an important role in two  of these, as well as his administration.   Let's give credit where credit is due, and let's work together for  even more peace in the region.                            ____________________
