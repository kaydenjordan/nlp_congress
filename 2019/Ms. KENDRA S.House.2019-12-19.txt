 HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the passage of the  United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.   I am proud to support this bipartisan agreement that strengthens  trade and is good for both economic growth opportunities and for our  workers.   A stronger trading relationship with Mexico and Canada is good for a  stronger economy for Oklahoma. These two countries are already the  Sooner State's largest trading partners, accounting for $2.4 billion in  Oklahoma exports in the last year alone.   This newly-agreed-to USMCA is a monumental step in strengthening this  trading relationship. This agreement not only ensures fair trade for  Oklahoma businesses and workers--who continue to create world-class  products--by guaranteeing that exports that enter Canada and Mexico are  all tariff-free, but it also gives Congress the necessary tools of  enforcement to combat the high cost of prescription drugs and is good  for our workers.   This strongly improves labor standards, as well as allowing workers  to compete on a level playing field.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this USMCA and other  bipartisan solutions.
