 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Dr. Burgess, for  all the hours of work. It is not just a lot of fun up there on the  Rules Committee, but I appreciate the work on behalf of our Conference.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a tragic number of days emanating from Santa  Fe, Texas, due south of my home in east Texas, down in Randy Weber's  district. It truly is tragic.   It is tragic, as well, when people in this country have become so  comfortable persecuting Christians, demeaning Christians, that they put  no stock, in fact, belittle anyone's mentioning of praying for the  families or even praying for the country, which is where we have got to  be.   There is a God. It is the same God that is referenced above my head  and behind me, that same God in whom a lot of us trust. It just says:  ``In God we trust.'' That is the national motto, but I guess it would  be more accurate to say, ``In God, whom a lot of us trust'' because of  the condescending, demeaning comments made about Christians, about  praying.   Prayer does work, it does matter, but not when a majority of the  country is prevented from discussing Christianity publicly. I mean,  this was a country where Christians from different parts of the world  fled to. It was a destination, a glorious destination where people  could come and live as Christians and not be persecuted, because Jesus  himself said we would be hated, but he said: Remember, they hated me  first.   We were told we would suffer for His sake, and He has certainly shown  how brutal that could be. But as the oligarchs in black robes have  taken over legislating, executive activities, as well as their own  judicial activities, they have walked our country to the brink of  despair. They have taken prayer--and I am talking about the oligarchs  in black robes, the judges.   I was once a judge, felony judge, then a chief justice of a court of  appeals, and I know how easy it is to think so highly of oneself. When  a black robe is donned, our imperfections are covered up. And by our  office, we are supposed to have some higher form of reason than our  fellow people.   It is just not so. It is not so.   People have had it forced down their throats that, when it comes to  education, it can't be education about religion, particularly  Christianity. Oh, you can talk about Islam. You can talk about  Buddhism. You can give glowing reports about such things and what it  takes to believe about the four pillars of Islam, but you don't dare  talk about Christianity, because that is when the courts go nuts, say  you have exceeded your bounds.   Schools have been told that they need to reinforce in a child's mind  the relativism of different positions, where right to some may be wrong  for others, and wrong for some may be right for others. There is no  black and white, right or wrong. There is simply relativism.   John Adams, in 1797, as our second President of the United States,  gave a warning that cries through over 200 years, over 220 years. He  said it clearly:   This Constitution is intended for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate for the government of any other.   He was a very wise man. This Constitution of ours, the one we took an  oath to follow here in this very Chamber, it doesn't work in a country  where the people are not taught morality.   When John Adams said morality and religion, he was particularly  talking about Christianity and Judeo-Christian morals as one finds in  the Ten Commandments, as symbolically evidenced by the fact that Moses'  supposed likeness directly above and in front of me is the only face of  all of those profiles that is full face and not the side, because at  one time he was considered to be the greatest lawgiver of all times.    At the time, it was the Ten Commandments that were considered to be  so vital that those who came before us believed were the greatest laws  ever given. But through the oligarchs across the street in black robes,  they have said: Don't mention God. It is okay to use ``Jesus'' as long  as you use it as a one-word exclamatory statement. It is fine to take  God or Jesus' name in vain, that is fine, that is okay, but don't use  it in a statement that you have sincerely with all your heart chosen to  follow Jesus. That is just too inappropriate.   So Adams, he was right. Whether you call them oligarchs, multiple  monarchs, they have helped lead this country in a direction it really  didn't want to go, been ahead of the country forcing us down this road  to the dustbin of history.   It is just so clear. If you are not going to teach the Judeo- Christian morality on which this country was founded, on which the  revolution came about--without the churches of the day and the Great  Awakening of the 1700s, there would not have been a revolution. Without  a Second Great Awakening in the 1800s and some of the churches'  leadership, we would never have seen the end of slavery in America.   The world will never see the end of slavery. There will always be  slavery in the world, but it is such a hideous form of people  mistreating other people, I literally pray that it will not revisit  this Nation, this once great Nation.  [[Page H4281]]    I do believe we can be great again, but not when we fail to bow our  head in reverence to the God that we once trusted, most of us.                                time  2115    But if we are not going to teach the morality that would lead to a  revolution, that would lead to an end to slavery, that would lead an  ordained Christian minister to bring about another peaceful revolution  of civil rights--read letters from the Birmingham jail. This man,  Martin Luther King, Jr., was an ordained Christian minister. It was the  biggest part of who he was and whose he was.   And as we have removed those things that motivated a country toward  freedom and motivated a Nation toward freedom for everyone, and an end  to slavery, and then motivating them yet again through the words of the  Bible through leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., we are headed in a  moral declination that ends in the dustbin of history.   I just caught a few things that were said by my colleagues across the  aisle before I came up. My friend Bobby Scott from Virginia indicated  something to the effect that the lack of discipline robs students.   We have come a long way from the days where students got paddlings. I  have been paddled. I was an A student, honor student, head of the  National Honor Society. I still got paddled.   I had friends on the football team and other athletic teams, who had  coaches that cared about them enough to take the time out of their busy  schedule, not to give a time out to the offending student, but actually  apply the board of education to the seat of knowledge.   And I really believe that I had friends, both white and black, in  sports that would have headed for prison if not for a coach caring  enough to paddle them when they got out of line, even though they were  grown; not adults by law, but certainly full-bodied adults. They got  them on the path that would lead them away from prison and lead them to  being productive.   So when we claim, well, we have a Second Amendment right to bear  arms, we have a First Amendment, very first amendment we have, a right  to freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,  but when we have forsaken God and the teachings found in the Bible that  were such a foundational part of our Nation's founding, then the  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, don't work.   You have got to give up the freedom of speech because some things you  say motivate others to commit acts of violence. So instead of  condemning and punishing the violence, we silence the offending  speaker, because those days when we defended what others said that we  disagreed with them, those appear to be a distant memory.   Not only do we disagree with what others say, but we will offend to  their death to try to prevent their right to say them. It is a long far  cry from the calls during the Revolution often attributed to Voltaire,  maybe it was him, maybe it was some other, but ``I disagree with what  you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.'' They  thought this would be a country where that could happen.   But schools, public schools at least, are not allowed to teach the  kind of morality that was taught for at least the first half of our  country's existence.   Yes, Thomas Jefferson had slaves. I have often pondered the  incredible irony how Thomas Jefferson could have slaves, and yet in the  first draft of the Declaration of Independence, put on paper how  offensive slavery was and make that as an enumerated grievance against  King George for ever allowing slavery to begin here in the United  States.   That was taken out before the Declaration of Independence was finally  agreed to and signed.   But the only discussion, it seems, about the Bible in public schools  is when it is demeaned and belittled.   So are we shocked that there is violence? Yes, we are still shocked.  We still grieve for the families that have lost loved ones that will  never be there again.   Put ourselves in their places. Think what could have been done  differently.   Well, everybody is pretty safe in this building. Going back to 1998,  when two law officers were killed, when it was so easy to come into the  Capitol, they were by the majority leader's office, and one was able to  shoot the shooter, though it cost him his life.   So we have had metal detectors. We have had people screened to come  in here, but not in the schools.   It is unfortunate, but if we are not going to teach biblical  morality, then to be free, we just can't be. We have got to give up  freedoms of speech, religion, assembly. We have got to give up our  right to bear arms. Not only give up our right to keep and bear arms,  but we have got to give up our right to keep pressure cookers, our  right to have fertilizer that could be used for bombs. We have got to  give up knives.   It is amazing to me. I went to school in elementary school where we  prayed most days, said the pledge of allegiance every day, were not  afraid to talk about lessons from the Bible, and I carried a  pocketknife to school. There probably weren't 5, 10 days in all my  growing up where I didn't carry a pocketknife to school.   And I just noticed in my bedside stand I have got three knives that  belonged to my grandfather that he carried for much of his life,  because they didn't have a problem with kids having knives in school.   But when you don't teach Judeo-Christian morality, then you better  take people's knives, guns, anything that might be used as a weapon.  Vans. We will have to make it tougher to ever get a van. Maybe have a  cooling off period before you can apply for and get a van or something  that can run people down.   Eventually we will have to have cars that are driverless that only  the government can set in motion so that we can protect ourselves and  only go where the government will allow us to go. That is where we are  headed. And it is where you have to go if you are not going to teach  the morality and the religion that John Adams spoke of as our second  President in 1797.   But that has also seen its way into our Federal Government. It is  okay to lie if it helps your political team. It is okay to violate the  law if it is for your team. It is okay to violate the Constitution and  your oath to the Constitution if you are the head of the CIA or are  intelligence and you want to stop the opposing party's candidate from  winning or remove that candidate from office after he has fairly won.    This May 12 article from Andrew McCarthy, National Review, he points  out that ``The Steele dossier author told Fusion GPS' Glenn Simpson  about a human source.   ``Something tells me Glenn Simpson did not make a mistake. Something  tells me the co-founder of Fusion GPS was dead-on accurate when he  testified that Christopher Steele told him the FBI had a human source,  i.e., a spy inside the Trump campaign, as the 2016 Presidential race  headed into its stretch run.   ``When he realized how explosive this revelation was, Simpson walked  it back: He had, perhaps, `mischaracterized' what he had been told by  Steele, the former British spy and principal author of the anti-Trump  dossier he and Simpson compiled for the Clinton campaign.   ``Simpson gave his testimony about the FBI's human source at a closed  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on August 22, 2017. He did not try  to retract it until the uproar that followed the publication of his  testimony on January 9, 2018. The latter date is significant for  reasons we will come to.   ``Simpson's testimony on this point is worth revisiting because of a  pitched battle between the House Intelligence Committee and the Justice  Department. Essential reporting on the controversy has been done by The  Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel. On Thursday, she related that, yet  again, Congress had faced down a DOJ/FBI attempt to stonewall the  committee's probe of investigative irregularities during the 2016  election season--particularly, abuse of government surveillance powers,  which the Obama-led agencies used to monitor the Trump campaign.   ``Unable to get voluntary cooperation, committee chairman Devin Nunes  issued a subpoena demanding the Justice Department disclose information  by the top secret intelligence source who is said to have assisted the  [[Page H4282]]  Russian investigation. That investigation is now being run by Special  Counsel Robert Mueller. But more interesting is how it got started.   On that question, officials have been surprisingly fuzzy in their  explanations, and hilariously inconsistent in their leaks: initially  settling on an origination story that hinged on the Steele dossier and  a trip to Moscow by the obscure Trump campaign adviser Carter Page;  later pivoting to a tale of boozy blathering by an even more obscure  Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, when the first story  proved embarrassing--the dossier allegations having been unverified  when the Justice Department included them in warrant applications to  the FISA court.''   Mr. Speaker, it has become clear to me, as a former judge, that the  FISA courts have got to go.   For some reason, these judges that have been nominated by a  President, confirmed by the Senate, do an okay job when their court  proceedings are open, obvious, and they have some accountability,  reaction from the American public. But apparently, when they act in  secret, they don't care so much about the Constitution. They have no  pride in their own courts so that people can come in, take an oath, lie  to them, create a fraud upon the court, and we don't hear a peep out of  those judges. Not one lawyer or witness has been held to account by the  courts that they offended by their fraud and deception.                                time  2130    And that includes Rosenstein and, apparently, at least the fourth  application to renew the warrant that should never have been issued in  the first place--and surely would not have been if the FISA court had  not been meeting in secret away from public eyes.   Is there any secret this country has that is worth the destruction of  our judicial system as we have seen through the fraud and the  misrepresentations that have been allowed with no consequence? No  offended judge is offended.   It tells me that this pitiful little gathering we have allowed to be  called the FISA court needs to stop. They are doing more damage to our  country than they could ever possibly help by their secrecy. And the  more we find out about what has been kept secret, the darker it appears  for this country and for our future.   We have Brennan and Clapper who perjured themselves multiple times  before Congress and didn't seem bothered by it in the least. And then  Brennan makes clear that, if you come up against them, you can do so at  your own peril because they have ways of making you pay the price.   That is exactly what our Founders were concerned about. The King had  his ways, too, King George III. And, apparently, that is the kind of  kingdom we have come into here in the 21st century when an opposition  campaign for President can pay for a warrant to be issued for no just  cause, no probable cause, and no consequences.   We have seen the Justice Department, these career people, they  weren't interested in ensuring that justice was done. If they had been,  they would have gotten some Republicans to investigate. They were  interested in being political to the damage of this country and our  judicial system. It has got to stop. Mueller needs to resign, and  Rosenstein needs to be fired.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, May 22, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
