 Mr. Speaker, today I have the honor of introducing  our guest pastor, Dr. Michael Lewis, from my home district and from the  great city of Marietta, Georgia.   Dr. Lewis graduated in 1996 with a master of divinity degree from  Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. In May of 2005, he received  an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Liberty University. He has  had the honor of serving in churches in South Carolina, Texas, and  Florida as their pastor.   Currently, Dr. Lewis serves as pastor of Roswell Street Baptist  Church in Marietta, Georgia, where he lives with his wife of 25 years,  Liliana, and their three wonderful daughters.   It is my privilege to introduce Dr. Michael Lewis, who opened us this  morning in prayer.                            ____________________
