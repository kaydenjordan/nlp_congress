 Madam Speaker, this isn't Russia; this is America. Yet  right in this building, a Soviet-style Star Chamber to remove the duly  elected President is occurring.   The person who leads it lied to the American people for 2\1/2\ years  about evidence he didn't have. The person who leads it is literally  guilty of what he accuses the President of doing when he is caught on  tape negotiating with foreign people about getting dirt on the  President.   The person who leads it lied to the world in his reading of a mock  transcript about the conversation that the President had with the  President of Ukraine, and the person who leads it misled the world  about his relationship with the whistleblower, or the so-called  whistleblower.   Madam Speaker, we need to end this Stalinist, guilty-until-proven- innocent Star Chamber now.                            ____________________
