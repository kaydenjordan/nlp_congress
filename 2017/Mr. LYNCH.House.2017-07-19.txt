 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 12, after line 9, add the following:       SEC. 3. PIPELINE SECURITY.         In considering an application for an authorization under       section 3 of the Natural Gas Act or a certificate of public       convenience and necessity under section 7 of such Act, the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall consult with the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration       regarding the applicant's compliance with security guidance       and best practice recommendations of the Administration       regarding pipeline infrastructure security, pipeline       cybersecurity, pipeline personnel security, and other       pipeline security measures.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, at the outset, I would like to thank Chairman Upton and  Ms. Castor, the ranking member from Florida, for their articulate  debate this afternoon on this important issue.   I would also like to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member  Slaughter, and all of the members of the Rules Committee for making  this amendment in order.   This commonsense amendment will simply ensure that the Transportation  Security Administration, the Federal agency with the primary  jurisdiction over pipeline security on behalf of the American people,  will retain a meaningful seat at the table when it comes to  determinations made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC,  on whether to approve a pipeline construction permit.   In particular, this amendment provides that, in considering a  pipeline permit application, FERC must simply consult with TSA  administrators as to whether a pipeline developer is compliant with  existing TSA guidelines and best practice recommendations governing  pipeline security. That includes an examination of facility security,  cybersecurity, and other critical measures that are designed to  safeguard the American people against the threat of terrorists and  cyber attacks perpetrated on the U.S. pipeline system.   While H.R. 2910 seeks to expedite the FERC review process for  pipeline construction projects in the name of efficiency, we also know  that recent terrorist and cyber attacks launched against pipeline  facilities nationwide  [[Page H6009]]  have more than demonstrated that we cannot place expediency above  national security and public safety.   In 2015, a domestic terrorist received a maximum 20-year sentence  after pleading guilty to Federal charges relating to his use of a  highly volatile explosive device to damage a natural pipeline in Texas.  Four years earlier than that, a similar attack was perpetrated in  Oklahoma by an individual armed with a homemade improvised explosive  device.   In addition, the 2017 series on ``Pipelines in Peril,'' published by  Energy and Environment News, reported that advanced cyber threats  targeting U.S. pipelines have only increased and evolved over the past  5 years, following a so-called pipeline hacking spree undertaken by  members of the Chinese military. The theft of sensitive data from at  least 23 separate U.S. pipeline companies in 2011 and 2012 constitute  the sort of cyber breach that the Congressional Research Service has  described as allowing hackers the ability to ``disrupt pipeline service  and cause spills, explosions, and fires all from remote locations.''   I would also like to express my concern regarding an issue that was  the subject of an amendment of mine which was not ruled in order, and  that is the issuance of pipeline construction permits by FERC in areas  where a project site and its surrounding community is already  experiencing preexisting unsafe levels of air pollutants.   In my own congressional district in Massachusetts, FERC recently  approved a proposal for a natural gas compressor station in the  beautiful town of Weymouth, Massachusetts, and as evidenced by the  certificate of independent and quality testing conducted by Dr. Curt  Nordgaard and other community stakeholders, the air quality in Weymouth  is already at toxic levels of so-called criteria air pollutants such as  benzene.   My amendment would have suspended the certificate issued by FERC for  the Weymouth compressor station and other projects that the commission  approves for construction and communities that have unsafe air quality  levels.   In addition to my concerns around air quality, I have to highlight  the public safety issues surrounding the route of a natural gas  pipeline that FERC approved in West Roxbury, a local neighborhood in  the heart of my district. The pipeline runs through a densely populated  neighborhood. It runs right through an active blasting area in a quarry  that is located next to a residential area, and I don't know how that  happens if public safety and national security are considerations.   Whether a pipeline is blown up because of stupidity because FERC has  located it in a blasting zone or it is because of a nefarious attempt  of outside actors, the bottom line is that FERC should sit down and  talk with TSA when they are looking at these siting decisions. The  bottom line is, what this amendment will accomplish, it will require  that to happen, that consultation to happen between TSA and FERC.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to vote in support of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, first of all, I thank the gentleman very much  for accepting the amendment. I agree, there may be some other areas  that are not particularly addressed, such as the LNG situation.  Obviously, we want to increase the level of safety with respect to LNG  as well, but I understand those questions can be answered during our  debate with the Senate as well and in conference.   But the bottom line is I thank him for accepting the amendment.
