 Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saluting the more  than 5,000 firefighters from 40 cooperating agencies that assembled  under the coordination of CAL FIRE to battle the Detwiler fire that  threatened Yosemite Valley and its gateway communities.   I spent Saturday at the command centers in Mariposa and Merced  Counties, and what I said is what I have seen time and again at so many  fires we are having these days in the Sierras: cool, calm  professionalism; selflessness; and devotion to duty.                                time  1115    CAL FIRE is an agency that works. I want particularly to salute and  thank Nancy Koerperich, CAL FIRE's unit fire chief for Madera, Merced,  and Mariposa. She and her operation literally saved several towns,  including Mariposa and Coulterville, from annihilation last week.   Sheriff Doug Binnewies of Mariposa County is rightly being hailed for  his courage and leadership in directing the orderly evacuation of the  town of Mariposa as the fire bore down upon it.   You can literally see how the fire burned right up to the town's  edge. I can't tell you how many homes I saw where firefighters stopped  it literally within a few feet of their front doors. CAL FIRE Battalion  Chief Jeremy Rahn told me that the difference between saving and losing  so many homes was defensible space.   CAL FIRE has produced a superb phone app to assist homeowners in  preparing their homes so that if, God forbid, the need arises,  firefighters will be able to defend them. It also provides fire alerts,  and anyone in the mountain community should have it. It is free for  downloading at your phone's app store.   I cannot say enough about the firefighters who have been working in  triple-digit heat on 24-hour shifts to battle the flames or the air  crews that dropped a staggering 500,000 gallons of fire retardant in a  single day at the height of the conflagration. Their effectiveness can  be seen by red borders of fire retardant that separate the blackened  ground of the fire on one side from the landscape they saved on the  other.   They not only saved these communities and hundreds of homes, they  also stopped the fire within just a few miles of the Stanislaus  National Forest, a forest that is dying because of Federal  environmental restrictions on forest management. The firefighters  warned that, if the fire had reached these vast stands of dead trees,  the fire would have exploded with atomic force. And that is the fine  point of the matter.    I spoke with Mariposa County Supervisor Marshall Long and many of the  other firefighters at the Mariposa command center, and the one thing  that they stressed time and again is that they need relief from the  regulations that are making it almost impossible to create firebreaks,  thin the forests, or remove the excess fuels.   These policies, imposed 45 years ago through legislation like the  National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act,  promised to improve the forest environment. After 45 years of  experience with these laws, I think we are entitled to ask: Well, how  is the forest environment doing? The answer is damning. These laws have  made it virtually impossible to keep our forests properly managed, and  the result has been severe tree overcrowding.   The Sierra Nevada normally support between 20 and 100 trees per acre,  depending upon the topography. The average tree density is now 266  trees per acre. This extreme overcrowding has stressed the trees to the  point they can no longer resist drought and beetle infestation and  disease. This has caused a massive tree die-off, and we have entire  national forests now just waiting to explode with over 100 million dead  trees.   The heroic firefighters of the Detwiler fire have kept it out of  these hazard zones, but the hazard zones are still there. And consider  this: we are only at the very beginning of the fire season that  combines fresh brush from last year's rains with millions of dead trees  that were too stressed from overcrowding to survive the drought. The  firefighters I spoke with on Saturday bitterly complained that they  can't even cut firebreaks to isolate these zones because of the same  so-called environmental laws.   The House has pending before it the Resilient Federal Forests Act of  2017 that would allow us to restore good forest management, but we may  already have run afoul of what Churchill called history's ``terrible,  chilling words: too late.''   Mr. Speaker, I call for expeditious consideration of the Resilient  Federal Forests Act and other legislation aimed at restoring management  to our forests in the hope that firefighters can hold these fires at  bay until we restore good management to our public lands.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jack and Marianne  Cox on the occasion of their upcoming golden wedding anniversary.   Jack served for many years as chief of staff for Congressman Barry  Goldwater, Jr. In fact, I first met him in that capacity when I was  still in high school. I have done quite a bit of aging since then. Jack  and Marianne have not, which I find annoying, but there it is.   Jack was the quintessential congressional chief of staff. He was  always one step behind Barry, whispering names in his ear as he went  from handshake to handshake.   Jack was also one of the moving forces behind the creation of the  Republican Study Committee.   Somehow he also found time to marry and raise a family in those  years. And, even more surprisingly, Marianne put up with it.   Jack and Marianne have sort of retired to the town of Copperopolis,  and I extend to them heartiest congratulations on the celebration of  this family milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H6329]]  bill (H.R. 2370) to authorize Escambia County, Florida, to convey  certain property that was formerly part of Santa Rosa Island National  Monument and that was conveyed to Escambia County subject to  restrictions on use and reconveyance.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), the author of  this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by assuaging the concerns raised  by my friend from Missouri. A provision in the bill--and I will simply  read it--I think, answers his concerns rather clearly. It says:   ``. . . the county shall preserve in perpetuity the areas of the non- Federal land that, as of the date of enactment of this act, are  dedicated for conservation, preservation, public recreation access, and  public parking, in accordance with any resolutions of the Board of  Commissioners of the county.''  [[Page H6330]]    As my friend has pointed out, Congress established the Santa Rosa  National Monument and directed the Secretary of the Interior to convey  the Federal land in the monument to Escambia County, Florida, back in  1946. Just 6 months later, the land was deeded to the county. Under the  terms of the conveyance, Escambia County was given the authority to  lease the property on Santa Rosa Island; however, they were not allowed  to issue title on the property or otherwise dispose of it or reconvey  it.   In the intervening years since then, Santa Rosa Island has  experienced tremendous economic growth. This growth prompted county  leaders to assess property taxes on the leased lands. The imposition of  taxes led to several lawsuits centered on the question of whether  island residents and businessowners paying lease fees for their land  could be taxed, despite not having outright ownership of the property.   Courts have reached different conclusions based on differences in the  language of particular leases, which has created fairness issues for  the county governments of Escambia and Santa Rosa. One property may be  subject to property taxes, while a virtually identical property next  door may not. This uneven treatment has prompted interest in removing  the deed restriction prohibiting reconveyance, which then allows the  county governments to convey ownership and create a uniform tax  treatment for all properties on the beach.   Recently, both Escambia County and neighboring Santa Rosa County  passed resolutions asking for a Federal solution to allow current Santa  Rosa Island leaseholders the option of attaining fee simple title while  protecting public access to the beaches and conservation areas on the  island.   I commend my colleague, Congressman Gaetz, for listening to his  constituents and working to find a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I would simply add that one of the overarching objectives of the  Federal Lands Subcommittee is to restore the Federal Government as a  good neighbor to those communities impacted by the public lands. This  bill is an example of that principle at work, and I would urge adoption  of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1927) to amend title 54, United States Code, to establish  within the National Park Service the African American Civil Rights  Network, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1927         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``African American Civil       Rights Network Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to recognize--        (A) the importance of the African American civil rights       movement; and        (B) the sacrifices made by the people who fought against       discrimination and segregation; and        (2) to authorize the National Park Service to coordinate       and facilitate Federal and non-Federal activities to       commemorate, honor, and interpret--        (A) the history of the African American civil rights       movement;        (B) the significance of the civil rights movement as a       crucial element in the evolution of the Civil Rights Act of       1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.); and        (C) the relevance of the African American civil rights       movement in fostering the spirit of social justice and       national reconciliation.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1927, the African American Civil Rights Network  Act, introduced by our distinguished committee colleague, Congressman  Lacy Clay from Missouri, directs the National Park Service to identify  and create a national network of historic sites, research facilities,  and educational programs connected to the modern African-American civil  rights movement. The network will be comprised of existing units and  programs of the National Park Service related to the African-American  civil rights movement as well as the properties and programs of other  Federal, State, local, and private entities that join the network.   Establishing this network of historic sites connected to the African- American civil rights movement will help preserve the legacy and the  struggle of the many courageous individuals who risked their lives to  secure racial equality and to put the full measure of the Declaration  of Independence and its sacred principles into action.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to reciprocate the kind  words of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay). It has been a pleasure  working with him on this bill.   Shakespeare put it best:         This story shall a good man teach his son.    This bill tells that story of how the full measure of our Nation's  founding principles came to fruition.   I would ask for Members' support and adoption of this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
