House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 1153, agreed to       June 8, 2022), is amended by striking ``June 17, 2022'' each       place it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``June 22,       2022''.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  [[Page H5500]]  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1170, for three measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 2543 under a structured  rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides 1 hour of  general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on Financial Services, makes in order 27  amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2773 under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides  1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources, makes in  order eight amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Third, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7606 under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides  1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture, makes in order two  amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same day authority through June 22, 2022.   First, I will say a few words about the Lower Food and Fuel Costs  Act. Times are tough for working families across our country. Food  prices are rising and gas prices are at an all-time high. At the same  time, food companies and Big Oil are making record profits at the  expense of these same hardworking Americans.   Costs are rising up and down the supply chain. The cost of fertilizer  and pesticides has risen 50 percent over the past year, in part due to  the ongoing war in Ukraine. Rising energy prices, increasing trucking  costs, and the worst outbreak of avian flu in 7 years are all  contributing to the higher prices consumers are paying at the grocery  store.   Plus, combine oil companies' irresponsibility with Putin's war in  Ukraine, and you have an unbearable situation for American consumers.  The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act will help us look out for working  families, not just big corporations and their billionaire CEOs. This  package of bipartisan legislation supports farmers and lowers prices  for America's families at the grocery store and at the gas pump.   This rule also allows us to consider a package of legislation aimed  at addressing racial and economic inequities that limit opportunities  for Americans to buy homes, access loans, and earn fair wages.   Income and wealth inequality is higher in the United States than in  any other developed country, and there are examples of it in almost all  parts of our lives. The reforms in this package will help us better  target and measure outcomes for underserved populations.   Finally, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act helps protect the more  than one-third of all fish and wildlife species in the United States  that are at risk of extinction.   This legislation funds conservation efforts for more than 12,000  species of wildlife and plants, and the recovery of 1,600 species  already listed as threatened or endangered.   Taken together and taken separately, these bills will all lead to  real important change for Americans.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I always, as we have these debates  with my good friend from Pennsylvania, encourage that we do work  together acknowledging that we have differences of opinion and  reminding people who are maybe watching that we are in a global economy  that has inflation globally and that what we are doing in this package  is to try to provide some small instruments for oversight  accountability so that we can have as much control as we can in a  global economy that is impacting this inflation that is so hard for  working Americans.  [[Page H5501]]    So with all due respect to my friend from Pennsylvania, I am always  willing to work with him. But this package is intended to provide more  accountability, not more bureaucracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to remind folks that 50 percent of  inflation is caused by the war in Ukraine and actions by Vladimir  Putin. In terms of energy, we believe in supporting American energy,  but we also accept the reality that we are transitioning to more  choices in energy like we do in California.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a June 10, 2021, USA Today  article titled: ``Fact check: Rising gas prices due to high demand and  low supply, not Biden's policies.''                      [From USA Today, June 10, 2021]   Fact Check: Rising Gas Prices Due to High Demand and Low Supply, Not                              Biden's Policies                             (By Miriam Fauzia)            The claim: Joe Biden is to blame for higher gas prices         The rising cost of gasoline is being felt across the U.S.,       as the national average price has gone up from $2 per gallon       last year to $3 per gallon as of June 9, according to data       from the American Automobile Association.        Many on social media claim President Joe Biden is to blame       for this change. A June 1 Instagram post put the title ``Joe       Biden's America'' atop a graphic showing the price jump from       January to May 2021.        ``Man I haven't seen gas prices this high since the last       time (a) Democrat was in office!'' claims one meme shared to       Facebook on May 22.        ``It's called the Biden effect,'' commented one Facebook       user under a similar May 18 Facebook post. Blaming Biden for       this uptick isn't a new phenomenon. These claims have been in       circulation since January and particularly allege Biden's       cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline significantly       impacted gasoline, ``ensur(ing) a huge increase in gas prices       for millions of us.'' USA TODAY has reached out to the       posters for comment.        While it's true gasoline prices have risen significantly       since Biden took office on Jan. 20 the upward trend predates       Biden's time in office and is related to COVID-19 and market       factors, not who occupies the White House.                    Pandemic's effect on supply and demand         As with any commodity, the price of gasoline is determined       by the simple balance of supply and demand: a high supply and       low demand means low prices, while a low supply and high       demand mean prices rise.        The most important driver of this fluctuation is crude oil,       from which gasoline is derived. This fossil fuel typically       accounts for between 50 percent and 60 percent of the price       at the pump, said Jeanette McGee, a spokesperson for AAA.        In 2020, crude oil prices became extremely cheap, so much       so it was being traded at negative prices, McGee told USA       TODAY. Brent crude oil, for example, a blend supplying most       of Europe, was being sold at $9 a barrel, its lowest price in       decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)       reported.        The primary reason for this drop in crude oil prices was       the pandemic, said McGee and Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice       University's Center for Energy Studies.        ``The pandemic drove the world's oil market to become       massively oversupplied, inventory dramatically increased and       prices collapsed,'' Finley told USA TODAY.        In response to the low demand due to reduced travel and       lockdown restrictions, Finley said major oil-producing       countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia and member countries of       the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or       OPEC, decided to cut down on their own oil production. But       the cut meant oil producers weren't ready to meet the demand       for crude oil once it renewed this year thanks to easing of       COVID-19-related restrictions.        ``This year, demand has so far increased more quickly than       production rates, which means the United States had to draw       more on its gasoline storage inventories, which has       contributed to prices going up,'' EIA spokesperson Chris       Higginbotham said in an email to USA TODAY. ``We expect oil       producers in the United States and globally to increase their       production levels through 2022, which we expect to contribute       to lower crude oil prices, and lower gasoline prices.''                       Gas price uptrend predates Biden         While presidential actions and policies can have some       impact on the crude oil market, they don't have as much       influence over gasoline prices as one might think.        ``Some of (a president's) decisions can impact or       contribute to market changes, which can then impact (future)       crude oil, but they don't dictate gas prices,'' said McGee.       ``If you go back and look at historical data, whether it was       Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden, (gas prices) go up and down no       matter who's in office.''        During former President Donald Trump's term, the national       average for gasoline had gone up to nearly $3 a gallon in May       2018 and hovered close to that price until fall 2018,       according to data maintained by AAA. The cost rose yet again       to nearly $3 a gallon in May 2019 before dropping slightly       below $2 per gallon when state and local governments mandated       lockdowns in March 2020.        Gas prices slowly crept from $2.20 per gallon in September       2020 to $2.40 by the time Biden took office in January 2021.       McGee said elections typically drive gasoline prices up.        This upward trend was expected to continue due to pandemic       recovery, reduced crude oil supply and the approach of       summer--historically considered a peak travel season--but       arrived sooner due to the ransomware attack on the Colonial       Pipeline, the East Coast's major fuel supplier.        ``We have expected gas prices to hit $3 a gallon around       Memorial Day, but with the (Colonial) pipeline offline, it       actually jumped the national average to $3 and more prior to       Memorial Day,'' said McGee.    Keystone XL, other Biden policies don't affect today's gasoline costs         Many critics point to Biden's decision on the Keystone XL       pipeline as fueling the gas price spike, but experts say       there's no such connection.        The extension of the Keystone pipeline, first proposed in       2008 by TC Energy based in Calgary, Canada, was rejected by       former President Barack Obama in November 2015 but later       approved by Trump in March 2017. Biden then suspended the       project in January. And on June 9, TC Energy announced it was       terminating the project.        Even if construction wasn't halted, the Keystone XL       pipeline wasn't in operation and therefore wouldn't have an       impact on current gas prices, said Finley of Rice University.        ``That was something that would impact down the road,'' he       said.        David Dismukes, economist and executive director of       Lousiana State University's Center for Energy Studies,       agreed, telling USA TODAY the pipeline would have had a       ``longer-run impact in providing a diversity of supply for       refineries in the Gulf Coast.''        Similarly, other energy policies rolled out by President       Biden, such as postponing oil lease sales, have a long-term,       but not short-term, effect.        ``If you look at some of the actions taken by the       administration with regard to offshore drilling, drilling on       federal lands, the outlook for fossil fuel energies in       general, those are impacting the price of crude and       expectations about crude oil,'' said  [[Page H5503]]       Diskmukes. ``(Biden's policies do) have an impact, but that's       not what you're seeing at the pump right now.''                              Our rating: False         Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim President       Joe Biden is to blame for the current higher gas prices. The       upward trend in gas costs we see now began months before       Biden took office. Because of reduced demand amid the COVID-      19 pandemic, oil companies had to cut back on the amount of       crude oil produced. Now with restrictions being lifted and       more travel happening, the demand has increased, which,       coupled with lagging supply, has led to increased gasoline       prices. Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and other energy       policies enacted by Biden have a long-term effect on crude       oil supply but no present impact on gasoline prices.     Madam Speaker, President Biden nor his administration  have direct control of setting gas prices. The real issue is Big Oil's  desire to pad their profits.   The CEO of Occidental Petroleum said it herself, ``I feel now that we  do need to return cash to the shareholders in the form of dividends or  buybacks, especially during the better cycles.''   They are thinking in their shareholders' best interest, not the  interest of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and the Rules Committee for his  remarks.   I remind folks that the economy under Joe Biden has created over 8  million jobs since he took office. The unemployment rate has dropped  from 6.4 percent to 3.6 percent under President Biden. And his first  year was the greatest year of job creation in American history.   The Federal Reserve has found that household financial well-being  reached an all-time high last year. GDP grew in the President's first  year by 5.2 percent, the fastest rate since 1984.   The U.S. was the first advanced economy that reached prepandemic  rates of growth, and we are seeing wages increase for workers.                                time  1345    There is no doubt that inflation and the high cost of gasoline are a  challenge. That is the purpose of some of our actions today. It is to  hold the private sector accountable, to be responsible to their  consumers and the American people. That is why these bills are on the  floor, to do something about inflation and the high cost of energy.   At the same time, we are preparing for an energy transition.  Michigan, California, we are aware of the realities of the current  energy economy, but we are getting ready for the new one.  [[Page H5505]]    In the area I represent, Madam Speaker--you have been out to visit  me--I have five refineries. I have represented them in local, State,  and Federal Government. Two of them are closed because of the pandemic.  They are about to reopen using biofuels that will help everybody, and  they are a better business model, according to the oil industry. So all  of these things have combined for a challenge.   I would agree with my colleague. This is too important, although we  have our differences about the approach, that we should engage in  problem-solving for Americans.   I thank all of my colleagues for these bills and their ideas to deal  with inflation and the challenges to American workers. Each of these  bills in this rule are worthwhile and impactful, and I look forward to  voting for them all soon.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler  is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1170         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
