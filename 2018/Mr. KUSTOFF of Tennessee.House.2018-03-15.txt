 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  remember Joel Orgill, a friend of mine and a great west Tennessean who  passed away this week at the age of 80.   Joe was a lifelong Memphian who inspired so many with his business  prowess, his strong faith, and, most importantly, his kindness and  commitment to giving back to his community. Through the years, Joe was  always very nice to me and offered great advice and counsel.   Like most Memphians, I knew Joe as an astute businessman who started  in the family business as a salesman and worked his way up to president  and chairman of the board. Joe played a major role in growing Orgill,  Inc., the company as it is known today, into one of the largest  hardware distributors of its kind in the entire world and the longest  running business in Memphis history.   Joe Orgill was a real titan in the hardware industry. Besides leading  one of the major privately held companies in the Memphis area, Joe was  a real people person. He had the rare ability to connect and to  interact with people of all types and, more importantly, treated  everyone the same way.   But much more importantly, Joe was a philanthropist who always gave  back to his community. Joe Orgill dedicated an incredible amount of his  time and resources to charitable organizations throughout the Midsouth:  the United Way, Meals on Wheels, Church Health Center, Rhodes College,  the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, and many more.   I mentioned Meals on Wheels. Joe took great pleasure in stopping  whatever he was doing, whatever meetings, to personally deliver these  meals to those most needy. To me, that really personifies Joe Orgill.   But most importantly, Joe enjoyed spending time with his family.   Roberta and I send our condolences to Joe's wife, Irene, as well as  his four daughters--Adele, Irene, Anne, and Kate--and to the entire  family.   While we mourn the loss of Joe, I know that his spirit lives on in  his wonderful family and in the Memphis community, and I have no doubt  that Joe Orgill's legacy will inspire generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act. I also want  to thank Representative Tipton for bringing this fine legislation.   In the Financial Services Committee, we often focus on relieving the  regulatory burdens our smaller financial institutions face. While  larger banks have the bandwidth, if you will, to comply with various  regulations, our smaller financial institutions have their hands tied  with onerous regulations and high compliance costs. Too often, this  strains the ability for our smaller banks and credit unions to loan  money to people who rely on them for capital.    The legislation that we are discussing today creates more  transparency and certainty for community banks and credit unions  undergoing each regulators' examination process. Currently, each of the  four regulators has its own appeals process. As we know, each regulator  has their own rules about what decisions can or cannot be repealed.   In many instances, this exam process can take months and is conducted  secretively, often leaving the institution in the dark about the  possible violations. If an unfavorable determination results from the  exam, the financial institution is then forced to limit its ability to  open new branches or from offering certain financial products.   Folks in every community across the country rely on these financial  institutions to access credit, grow a business, purchase a new car, or  pay for an unexpected expense. This important legislation restores some  of the transparency to the examination process and prevents regulators  from being the cop, the judge, and the jury.   In addition, this legislation will restore accountability on the part  of the regulators to review their own decisions, and to do so in a  timely fashion to limit the impact to our community financial  institutions.   As we all can agree, our community banks and credit unions are best  equipped to work with communities in which they serve.    This legislation provides a system of  checks and balances by establishing clear standards to ensure the  consistency and transparency of all examinations.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and the Financial Services  Committee for their hard work. I urge all of my colleagues to support  this legislation.                                time  1345
