 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I move to the bulk of my remarks,  let me respond to the majority leader's comments on CHIP.   First, let me say I am a good friend of Leader McConnell. We are  getting along quite nicely. I know what a difficult job he has, but  sometimes he says things that are just way over the top, and I have to  respond, as this morning, to his remarks on CHIP.   Of course, Democrats support CHIP, Leader McConnell. You know that  darn well. If we were in charge of this Chamber, we would have never  let it expire, but your majority did, Leader McConnell. Your majority  let health insurance for 9 million children expire, even though there  were bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress that would have  extended it.   Now it is placed on the CR. That is a bad idea for so many reasons  that I will get to shortly, and Republicans pretend Democrats are  against CHIP. It is outrageous.   We are leaders of our parties, and we say certain things, but it  seems the lack of straightforwardness, the lack of relying on any facts  that is endemic at that end of Pennsylvania Avenue is seeping over to  the majority leader's desk, and I regret that because what he said this  morning about CHIP was outrageous. To suggest that Democrats are  standing in the way of CHIP is drawing, Leader McConnell, on a deep  well of bad faith.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let's get to the issue at hand.  Government funding expires at midnight tomorrow and still the House  Republican majority is moving forward with a continuing resolution that  is very likely to be unacceptable to the Senate and may well be  unacceptable to House Republicans. The CR prepared by the Speaker is  not an honest attempt to govern. As typical of this Republican  majority, it was done with zero negotiations with Democrats. They could  get away with that strategy on the tax bill when they forced it through  reconciliation; they can't here.   When are our Republican leaders going to learn that the best way to  [[Page S267]]  govern--the best way to accomplish things--is by talking to us, not  dropping ultimatums on us that bear none of our input? That is what  happened with the FISA bill. It nearly went down. That had divisions on  both sides of the aisle. That is what is happening here, and it doesn't  look good for the CR coming over from the House for that very reason.   Furthermore, the CR leaves out so many priorities that the American  people want and demand--opioids, veterans, pensions. It doesn't resolve  the fate of the Dreamers. It doesn't include an increase in military  funding that Members from both sides of the aisle would support. It is  just another kick of the can down the road because the Republicans-- both in the Senate and the House and the White House--can't get their  act together.   Even President Trump tweeted this morning that he opposed including  CHIP on this bill. Does that mean he is against the CR? Who knows? It  is a mess. We can't keep careening from short-term CR to short-term CR.  If this bill passes, there will be no incentive to negotiate, and we  will be right back here in a month with the same problems at our feet.  Eventually, we need to make progress on the biggest of issues before  us.   Don't ask me; ask Secretary Mattis. When you talk to him, he knows  how bad it is to continue CRs on the defense side. Why would our  Republican colleagues go along with that?   So this CR can't get the job done. House Republicans don't even know  if they can pass it. Some Senate Republicans, like my friends from  South Carolina and South Dakota, have said they don't want to vote for  it. We are going to have to go in a different direction.   Ideally, we would all roll up our sleeves and try to reach an  agreement on all of the issues we need to resolve. We can resolve the  issues of caps for defense and nondefense spending; we can resolve  disaster relief; we can resolve the healthcare issues; we can resolve  immigration issues; and we can do all of this in a rather short time  because work has already been done on each of them for a while.   We could easily sit down and find a cosmic agreement that would get  the support of the majority on both sides, in both Houses, and keep the  government open. Despite all the rhetoric around here, I genuinely  believe that.   The one thing standing in our way is the unrelenting flow of chaos  from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. It has reduced the  Republicans to shambles. We barely know whom to negotiate with. The  President, on national television, tells Congress to bring him  something, and he will sign it. The majority leader says he needs the  President's imprimatur before we cut any deal. The President is like  Abbott and Leader McConnell is like Costello: You do it. They point at  each other and nothing gets done.   Of course, the principal reason the Republicans are in such disarray  is, the President and his team have been agents of chaos in these  negotiations since day one. After all, President Trump was the one who  said last year that we need ``a good `shutdown' . . . to fix mess!''  The President said we need a government shutdown.   Mr. President, 95 percent of all Americans, I would guess, do not  agree with you. I would guess in their hearts, 95 percent of all  Senators and Congressmen--Democratic and Republican--don't agree with  you, President Trump, when you say we need a good shutdown.   Don't just ask me. Here is POLITICO. They are a rather down-the- middle publication. No one thinks they are leftwing or rightwing. No  one thinks they are FOX or MSNBC. Here is the headline: ``Negotiators  on Hill find Trump an unreliable partner.'' Lawmakers find it difficult  or impossible to negotiate when the President can't seem to stick to a  position for more than a few hours. Let me read the first paragraph of  this article:         Donald Trump ran for President as a bipartisan deal-maker.       But if there's one thing he's proved after a year in office,       he's better at killing bipartisan deals than clinching them.    Again, that is the first paragraph in this paper. I am going to read  it again so the American people hear it loud and clear--and I know some  of the rivals of this publication don't like it too much, but c'est la  vie. ``Negotiators on Hill find Trump an unreliable partner.'' The  first paragraph:         Donald Trump ran for President as a bipartisan deal-maker,       but if there's one thing he's proved after a year in office,       he's better at killing bipartisan deals than clinching them.    No truer words were ever written. That is not fake news, Mr.  President. We all know it to be true.   Exhibit A, yesterday regarding the discussions on DACA, the majority  leader said: ``I'm looking for something that President Trump is going  to support. And he has not yet indicated what measure he is willing to  sign.'' Mitch McConnell said that. He said he still has to ``figure out  what [the President] is for.''   How can you negotiate when the President--who has to sign  legislation--is like a sphinx on this issue or at least says one thing  one day and another the next?   The President rescinded DACA 4 or 5 months ago. Had he not rescinded  DACA, we would not be here today. Remember, the vast majority of the  American people--even a narrow majority of Trump supporters--support  keeping the kids here, not sending them home. The President rescinded  DACA 4 or 5 months ago and told Congress to fix it. Yet the majority  leader of his party seems to have no firm idea what policy the  President would support to get that done. At this late hour, that is  astonishing.   Exhibit B, the President's Chief of Staff has insisted that Senator  Cotton and Representative Goodlatte be in the room for negotiations on  DACA. I have great respect for each of them as individuals--or the  respect every Senator gives to every other Senator and Member of  Congress, although I so objected to what Senator Cotton did to Senator  Durbin the other day. But having said that, there is no deal that  Senator Cotton or Representative Goodlatte supports that would earn the  support of the majority in either the House or the Senate.    If Senator Cotton and Representative Goodlatte, who have opposed DACA  all along and have basically been strongly anti-immigration, have veto  power over an agreement, everyone knows there will not be an agreement.  General Kelly must know that.   Then, just this morning--exhibit B prime--President Trump rebuked  General Kelly, his own Chief of Staff, on Twitter for saying that he is  fighting for a wall different from the one he campaigned on. So that is  exhibit B on the incompetence of the Republicans on both sides of  Pennsylvania Avenue--mixed messages, conflicting signals, chaos.   Exhibit C. Today, with the government shutdown one day away,  President Trump is off campaigning in Pennsylvania instead of staying  in Washington to help close a deal. We are 1 day away from a government  shutdown, and there is no one home at the White House. The President  should be here negotiating. There is no better evidence that the  President doesn't give a hoot if the government shuts down than the  fact that he is away campaigning today, 1 day before the shutdown  looms.   We have spent the last few months negotiating in good faith with our  Republican counterparts, trying desperately to find a deal we could all  live with, but it has been nearly impossible to reach final agreement  with this President. He has oscillated between completely opposing  positions in a matter of days, sometimes hours. He has signaled an  openness to a deal, only to have his staff pull him back. He has given  only vague indications of what he wants, even at this late hour.   Mitch McConnell was right; he doesn't know what the President stands  for. Now Mitch McConnell ought to have the strength and courage to  start negotiating on his own for the good of the country, but that  hasn't happened yet either.   The White House has done nothing but sow chaos, confusion, division,  and disarray, and it may just lead to a government shutdown that no one  wants and that all of us here have been striving to avoid.   The fact remains that there is a bipartisan deal on the table, led by  Senators Graham and Durbin. Seven Democrats and seven Republicans are  on the bill right now. I hope and suspect more will join. It includes  significant concessions from Democrats on  [[Page S268]]  almost every item the President requested, including his full budget  request for border security, changes to family reunification--which he  calls chain migration--and an end to the diversity lottery system.   There is no other alternative on the table. I repeat: There is no  other alternative on the table. If my Republican friends want to  protect the Dreamers, as over 70 percent of Americans say we should,  this is the deal.   The White House is not going to help us; we know that. We have to do  it ourselves. Once we do it, we can solve all of our other problems on  defense and domestic spending, on healthcare, including CHIP, community  health center extenders, disaster relief, and more.   Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work on both sides of the aisle,  regardless of the dithering, the indecision, and the contradictory  statements of the White House.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I will have much more to say after this  vote on the motion to proceed, which Democrats will support because we  want to move forward. We want to get something done. We don't want to  keep kicking the can down the road. But I just had to answer the  leader, briefly.   The leader is looking to deflect blame, but it just won't work. We  all know what the problem is; it is complete disarray on the Republican  side.   The bottom line is very simple. Our Republican leader has said that  he will not negotiate until he knows where President Trump stands. That  is why negotiations haven't gotten anywhere. Let me quote. Here is what  the leader said just yesterday: ``I am looking for something that  President Trump is going to support, and he has not yet indicated what  measure he is willing to sign.'' Mitch McConnell said that he still has  to ``figure out what the President is for.'' How can you negotiate when  the President, who has to sign the legislation, is like a sphinx on  this issue or says one thing one day and one thing the next?   So here is what we can do to solve the problem. We could solve it  right now. The four leaders could sit down--there has been a lot of  discussion--and come to an agreement and do what the President said at  one point: Send it to his desk and he will sign it. We could get that  done before the deadline of tomorrow night expires, or we could give  the President a few days to come to the table, now that he knows this  plan won't work, and we could get this done in a few short days and not  kick the can down the road.   This is the fourth CR that we have done and accomplished nothing.  There is no promise and no likelihood that another kicking of the can  down the road will get something done. We have to sit down together and  solve this, with the President or without. Until that happens, no  amount of CRs will get this done.   I would suggest we all vote for the motion to proceed but instead  move a very short-term CR, and we will either negotiate it ourselves or  the President will join us, and we can get the job done.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I would simply like to read a statement  from Dana W. White, chief Pentagon spokesperson:         We have been working under a Continuing Resolution for       three years now. Our current CR expires tomorrow, 19 Jan.       This is wasteful and destructive. We need a fully-funded FY18       budget or face ramifications on our military.    The leader wants to move that very CR that the Pentagon objects to  even without a 60-vote margin. I strenuously object.    Mr. President, to delay a vote on cloture makes no sense  when we all know the outcome. The government's funding expires tomorrow  night at midnight. Let's vote tonight on cloture so we can move forward  so, perhaps, we can bring the President to the table--if not, so we can  undergo serious negotiations to get things done.   You have just heard from the Pentagon. The Pentagon thinks this CR is  wrong for our military. This is again the statement from Dana White,  the chief Pentagon spokesperson. I want to repeat it so my colleagues  can all hear it.         We have been working under a Continuing Resolution for       three years now. Our current CR expires tomorrow, 19 Jan.       This is wasteful and destructive. We need a fully-funded FY18       budget or face ramifications on our military.    Because of the urgent needs we face--the military and so many of the  others: opioids, veterans, pensions--we should not delay any further.  We should move cloture tonight and see the outcome--I think we all know  it will be defeated--and start serious negotiations tomorrow morning.  That is what we should do.   I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived and  that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motion filed on the motion  to  [[Page S306]]  concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195 ripen  at 10 p.m. on Thursday, January 18--10 p.m. tonight.    Mr. President, the leader addressed extensively what was  happening before the vote on the motion to proceed. I would like to  address that now.   The House of Representatives has sent the Senate a continuing  resolution that has been constructed by the Republican Speaker and  passed without the consultation of House Democrats or Senate Democrats,  whatsoever. The Republican leader is now saying to us: Take it or leave  it.   Here is why Members from both sides of the aisle want to leave it. We  have been skating by on continuing resolution after continuing  resolution for almost 6 months. First, we passed a 3-month CR. Then we  passed a 2-week CR and then a 1-month CR. Now we are offering another  month-long delay of the inevitable.   We cannot keep kicking the can down the road and shuffling our feet  after it. In another month, we will be right back here at this moment  with the same web of problems at our feet and in no better position to  solve them. The government of the most powerful nation in the world  should, simply, not be run this way.   These successive, short-term funding bills hurt our military, as I  have mentioned. Just ask Secretary Mattis if this is what he would  prefer we do--another continuing resolution--or an honest to goodness  budget that allows our Defense Department to plan ahead and meet its  obligations. We all know he would prefer the latter.   That is why some of my Republican colleagues have already said they  join with Democrats to reject this bill. They know, like I know, that  this is no way to do our business. This is not a partisan issue. We  should be united in trying to come to a solution, not just kick the can  down the road.   The truth is that we don't have to do it this way. In his speech  earlier, the majority leader, my friend, tried to reduce this to a  binary choice: Take my bill or else shut down the government.   That is not the case. It is simply not. These aren't the only options  available to him or to any of us. Democrats and Republicans have been  negotiating for months about several issues. A bipartisan deal is  within reach on lifting the caps for both defense and domestic  spending, on healthcare issues, on disaster relief, on immigration  issues. A bipartisan deal is within reach. I have been a part of those  negotiations on all of these issues, and now is the time to reach it,  not a month from now.   One reason we haven't gotten one already, frankly, is that the  President has been impervious to compromise for several months. Another  is that he cannot maintain a consistent position. We all know that. He  accepts bipartisan overtures on one day only to reject them on the  next. He makes and then rescinds and then remakes demands. He  encourages compromise one day only to thwart it the next by saying he  will only accept a deal that gives him 100 percent of what he wants.  That is not what a great deal maker does.   Folks, the people in Congress in his own party don't even know what  he wants. I feel for them. I feel for our leader. He is in an awful,  difficult position. I know that. We all know that. Yesterday, Leader  McConnell said that he is still trying to figure out what the President  is for. Only a few moments ago, the leader said the President's views  have not been made fully apparent yet. Letting this ambivalence and  chaos continue for another month is just not the answer. It is not a  good way to get a deal. It is not the right way to run our country--our  dear, beloved country.   Tonight or tomorrow, the President will see--I had hoped it would be  tonight; we cannot waste any time--that this approach was rejected on a  bipartisan basis. Hopefully, he will see the light, come to the table,  and negotiate seriously for the first time in this lengthy process.   Ultimately, the answer here might be to pursue an idea that has been  floated by a few of my Republican colleagues--pass a clean extension of  government funding for 4 or 5 days to give us a hard, final deadline to  finalize a deal. Passing a short-term continuing resolution ensures  that both sides remain at the table and can quickly reach a deal that  funds our military, our domestic priorities, like the fight against  opioids, that protects Dreamers, and that funds healthcare and aid for  those harmed by recent disasters. Everyone in this Chamber wants some  of those things, if not all.   Frankly, I think we can still solve this by the deadline tomorrow. As  my friend from South Carolina said: We could solve all of this in 30  minutes if only folks were willing. It may not quite be 30 minutes, but  knowing the negotiations as I do, we could do it rather quickly.  Certainly, it wouldn't take us 30 days.   Hopefully, after the CR goes down, folks will be willing, and with a  little more time on our hands, maybe the majority leader--we are trying  to help you, Mitch--can pin down just what President Trump wants in  order to get a deal. Nobody wants to shut down the government.  Democrats don't want to shut down the government, and Republicans don't  want to shut down the government. I believe that sincerely. The only  person who has ever rooted for a shutdown, frankly, is our President,  who said our country could use a good shutdown. Only President Trump  could come up with that phrasing. Nobody else thinks it is a good  shutdown. Of course, no shutdown can be good for the American people.  Let us strive to avoid one.   I urge my colleagues to reject this measure for the reasons I  mentioned. It was not fair. We were not consulted. It was take it or  leave it. That is not how it should work. That is how almost none of us  want this to work.   If we cannot figure this out by tomorrow night, I urge the majority  leader, in particular, and the majority to support a clean extension of  funding for a few days so that we can finally come to a resolution and  get down to so many of the other things that we need to do in this  Chamber.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, just a brief rejoinder. First, there have  been very good attempts, bipartisan attempts to solve this problem.  Three Democrats and three Republicans met the problem right in the  middle. It was the other side, your side, Leader, that didn't want to  go along with that agreement. It was a fair and decent agreement in  which each side gave. It is an important agreement. It is a vital  agreement, and no one--no one--no one--has figured out a way to pass a  bill independently in February. Any vote, any bill that might get a  majority of the Republicans in the House on this issue will not get  Democrats, and any bill that gets a majority of Democrats will not get  a majority of the Republican side in the House and will not be put on  the floor. So this is the way to go on that issue, but there are many  other issues out here too. Make no mistake about it.   Opioids. Our national lifespan rate has declined, how long we live  has declined because of opioids. We haven't funded it. Every one of us  in our States knows we need that. This resolution does nothing on  opioids.   Veterans. In my State and in your States, veterans are waiting in  line for treatment after they risked their lives for us. This  resolution doesn't fund it. You say: Well, maybe we will do it after a  month, but we sure haven't done it for 6 months.   What about pensions? The millions of Americans, working people, who  have paid in month after month who lost salary--they declined salary  increases so they would know they could live a life of decency--hardly  wealth--when they retire, that is being extinguished. We have an urgent  obligation to deal with those people. We feel it, and I know many  people on the other side feel it.   There are so many other issues. Healthcare issues. I see my friend  from Maine. We had a discussion last night, and I talked subsequently  to my friend from Washington State and my friend from Florida. We could  come to an arrangement on that rather quickly and deal with that issue.   Disaster relief for Texas, for Florida, for Puerto Rico, and for the  West. We need to deal with that issue as well. So there are lots of  issues to deal with, and on all of these important issues, all of them,  this resolution kicks the can down the road and gives us no reason to  believe it will be any different than the first CR, the second CR, the  third CR, and the fourth CR.   What we are proposing is not original with us. It was proposed by  three or four Members on that side of the aisle. A very short-term  increase would force the President to the table, hopefully, because  that has been the barrier, in the words of the majority leader, for  solving the DACA problem and other issues and would get us to act.  These are not such easy issues. Without a deadline, we may never get  them done, and the fears of the Pentagon, so well stated tonight by the  DOD spokesperson, will get worse and worse and worse.   So I would, in an act of bipartisanship--not accusing one side or the  other--I didn't accuse one side or the other of shutting down the  government. I am not trying to play for political points, even false  ones. I am trying to get us to come together in a bipartisan nature to  get something done. I hope all of us on both sides of the aisle rise to  the occasion.   I yield the floor.
