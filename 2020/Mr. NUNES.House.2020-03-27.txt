 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 748, the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.   The dire situation facing our nation's businesses today are not of  their own creation. Instead, businesses are endangered by the drastic  actions taken by governments at the local, state, and federal level to  combat the spread of the Coronavirus. The stark truth is that without  immediate government action to assist these hard-hit businesses, many  of them will not survive the current crisis. We have already seen  record unemployment claims during the coronavirus shutdown, and our  nation cannot afford for businesses to continue to go under and  millions of employees to lose their jobs, their livelihoods, and their  ability to pay rent and make ends meet.   The CARES Act will provide crucial assistance to keep businesses  solvent during this emergency, keep people employed, and to help  individuals and families struggling with these extraordinary  circumstances. I regret that the Democrats, from the beginning, have  exploited this bill to try to ram through extraneous and partisan  measures with no connection whatsoever to helping families and  businesses overcome their current hardships. Nevertheless, at a time  when many Americans are unsure how they'll pay next month's rent and  many American businesses are unsure how much longer they can last, this  bill will provide vital support to the American economy. That's why I  will vote for the CARES Act.
