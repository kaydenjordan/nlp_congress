 Mr. Speaker, Arizona's First Congressional District  is home to some of the most beautiful forests in the country, including  the Grand Canyon, but paired with the dry conditions and high heat, the  First District is historically home to some of the worst wildfires in  the country.   Earlier this month, my constituents in rural Arizona faced off  against the Tinder Fire, which spread more than 16,000 acres before  being mostly contained. It could have been far worse.   I rise today to commend the hundreds of brave first responders,  community leaders in Arizona and across the West, public safety  officials, who worked tirelessly over the past 3 weeks to contain the  fire and protect residents and their homes.   It was their quick thinking and expert training that prevented this  fire from spreading even further and destroying hundreds of homes.   The fire, which was reported on April 27 by Coconino Forest  officials, and before the fire even reached 50 acres on the second day,  the decision was made to bring in the Type 1 Southwest Area Incident  Management Team to oversee the firefighting efforts and safety efforts.   This is unheard of for fires of this size, but it turns out that it  was the right call.   The Type 1 IMT team was able to set up a strong line of defense and  get hotshots and firefighting crews on the ground to save hundreds of  homes, ranches, and lives.   This was not the only proactive measure that was taken during the  early stages of the fire, Mr. Speaker.   During my visit to the Type 1 incident command center earlier this  month and to the fire site, the team shared with me their work. I have  to extend my sincerest gratitude to the Coconino National Forest,  Coconino County Sheriff's Office, and the county staff in their work.   They saw the dry conditions in the area, they saw the weather report  of high winds coming, and the decision to evacuate residents was made  before the fire grew to a significant size. It was made correctly.   They made this decision as that fire moved towards large  subdivisions, and it was moving at a rate of 3 miles in 1.5 hours. The  wind speeds were up to 50 miles an hour.   This contributed to one of the smoothest evacuation efforts these  teams have ever seen, and it made a difference. It saved lives.   My team worked with local county and State officials to deliver  information and resources to those who were evacuated to the centers.   In addition to the more than 800 personnel on the ground, I want to  thank the communities who stepped up to help from all across the  Western United States and from all across Arizona. In both Coconino and  Navajo Counties, businesses opened up their doors to evacuees and their  livestock and their pets, and volunteers signed up to assist at  evacuation shelters.   It was interesting when I visited the site, the trees were not burned  except for underneath. The fire was moving so  [[Page H3985]]  fast, that the crown fire did not occur, but you could see where the  trees were bent and the needles on the tree were all pointing in the  direction of the wind.   The fire spread out throughout and then hit those homes, and then the  homes went up in fire, over 3 dozen homes.   Fighting efforts were aided by the work of homeowners. These  residents over time had personally cleared fuel, like small trees and  underbrush, from their home. They followed fire-wise community  planning.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the brave men and women who worked  to contain this fire.   I would advise anybody to look into this more to understand the  difficult conditions that they have to work in: 18 hours, 19 hours, 20  hours on the line, going back to pup tents to sleep for a few hours,  and then going back out into the field to save lives and save homes.  Then after this fire, they will move right on to another one. That is,  sadly, the condition of our forests in the West.   This fire and the prevention of loss of life and death from other  destruction was to be accomplished only by professionals who did this  in a way that brought honor to their service.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong opposition  to H.R. 2. Some may call this a farm bill, but for my district, this is  a ``harm'' bill.   Unfortunately, this year's farm bill is deeply flawed. This bill  lacks a significant commitment to the needs of rural communities, with  no guaranteed funding for the rural development title.   It is unclear to me how members of the committee say they understand  the need of investment in rural America, but decided to cut $517  million from rural development programs.   As we work to help communities build stronger economies, we must  ensure that we have a plan in place that lends a helping hand to those  who need it. In Arizona, this bill will take food out of the mouths of  tens of thousands of children and veterans. It is a sad day in America  when we are debating a proposal that would make children go hungry.   I hope for a robust debate on how we could promote rural economic  development and how to improve the business climate for rural  communities and work to address resource concerns by improving  conservation programs like EQIP.   Sadly, this bill was written in a back room and kept secret until the  last possible moment. We owe the American people something better.
