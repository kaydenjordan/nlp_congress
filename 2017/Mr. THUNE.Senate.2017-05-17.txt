Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Thune pertaining to the introduction of S. 1144  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, there is no doubt that the last 8 years  were not good ones for the American economy. Yearly economic growth  under the Obama administration averaged just under 1.5 percent. That is  less than half the growth needed for a healthy economy. That kind of  weak growth has consequences: fewer jobs, fewer opportunities, and  lower wages.   Wage growth was almost nonexistent during the Obama administration,  and new jobs and opportunities were few and far between. There have  been a few encouraging signs since the election. Both wage and job  growth have shown some improvement, but we are still a long way from  getting our economy back to full health. The GDP report for the first  quarter of this year underscored the need to implement the kind of  progrowth policies that were lacking during the Obama years.   One major way to spur economic growth and improve the health of our  economy is to reform our Nation's Tax Code. Our current Tax Code is  strangling businesses, both large and small. Our Nation has the highest  corporate tax rate in the developed world, putting American businesses  at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.   Small businesses and family farms face high tax rates, at times  exceeding those paid by large corporations. These tax policies have  consequences. A small company that owes a large tax bill to the Federal  Government is unlikely to be able to come up with the capital necessary  to expand the business or hire new workers.   When American businesses are taxed at a far higher rate than their  foreign counterparts, it is likely to be the foreign rather than the  American company that expands and thrives. Tax reform needs to address  these obstacles to growth. Later this year, the Senate plans to  consider a major tax reform package. Two of the most powerful tax- related things we can do to increase economic growth are lowering  business tax rates and allowing business to recover their investments  in inventory, machinery, and the like faster.   The Senate tax bill will do both. Today, I am introducing legislation  that I hope will be a part of the final tax reform package in the  Senate. My bill--I am calling it the Investment in New Ventures and  Economic Success Today Act, or the INVEST Act for short--focuses on  helping small- and medium-sized businesses by allowing them to recover  their costs faster.   Earlier this year, the Economic Innovation Group released a report on  economic dynamism. Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group  defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and  die. In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high  and significantly outstrips the rate of business deaths, but that  hasn't been the case in the United States lately.   New business creation has significantly dropped over the past several  years. Between 2009 and 2011, business deaths outstripped business  births. While the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery  has been poor and far from historical norms.   The Economic Innovation Group notes that 2012, the economy's best  year for business creation since the recession, ``fell far short of its  worst year prior to 2008.'' Well, this is deeply concerning because new  businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of  the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of  innovation.   When new businesses are not being created at a strong rate, workers  face a whole host of problems. A less dynamic economy--the Economic  Innovation Group notes--``is one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower  labor force participation, slack wage growth, and rising inequality,  exactly what we see today.''  [[Page S3012]]  Again, that is from the Economic Innovation Group.   Well, starting a new business always has a substantial element of  risk. We don't need to make it harder by throwing up tax and regulatory  obstacles. If we want to see our economy thriving again, we need to be  encouraging the creation of new businesses, but our Tax Code, too  often, does the opposite.   My bill, the INVEST Act, would encourage new business creation by  allowing new enterprises to deduct a substantial part of their startup  costs within the first year. Under current law, new businesses are only  able to deduct $5,000 of their startup costs within their first year.  Any startup expenses above that amount can be deducted, but that  deduction is stretched out over a 15-year period. That is a long time.   The faster a new business can recover its startup costs, the faster  it can establish itself on a secure footing. Entrepreneurs are far more  likely to take the risk of starting a new venture if they know they  will be able to recover their startup costs quickly. My bill would  substantially increase the amount of a business's startup costs that  can be deducted in the first year from $5,000 to $50,000.   Plus, any additional startup costs can be deducted over a 10-year  period instead of the current 15. This will go a long way toward  encouraging new business creation and the economic dynamism that comes  along with it.   The second part of my bill focuses on increasing cashflow for  businesses, farms and ranches, and particularly those that operate as  corporations and partnerships, by allowing them to use the so-called  cash method of accounting. Under current law, these businesses, farms,  and ranches are generally forced to use what is called accrual  accounting. Basically, what that means is, a business has to pay tax on  income before it receives the cash, and it cannot deduct all of its  expenses when it pays the invoice.   For a company with inventory, this means it has to deduct the  investments it makes over an extended period of time. A small business  might have to spend the majority of its available cash on inventory but  be unable to fully deduct that expense until all of that inventory is  sold.   In the case of some businesses, it might be well beyond the current  tax year before that substantial investment can be fully deducted. That  can leave a business increasingly cash poor. Cash poor businesses don't  expand. They don't hire new workers. They don't increase wages.   Well, the INVEST Act would allow businesses to deduct investments and  inventory up front, leaving them with more cash on hand to put back  into their operations. It would also reduce the need for businesses to  hire armies of lawyers and accountants to ensure that they have  properly adhered to complex accounting rules.   Finally, the INVEST Act would substantially reform the depreciation  and expensing rules. Traditionally, farms and businesses have been  forced to deduct expenses like machinery, property, or agricultural  equipment over an extended period--anywhere from 5 to 10 years or as  many as 39 years for commercial buildings. That could leave a farm or a  business with its cash tied up for years in all the property it takes  to run the enterprise. Of course, that means a farm, LLC, or S  corporation can spend years without being able to increase its  investment in a business or to hire new workers.   My bill would permanently allow all businesses to deduct 50 percent  of their investment in equipment, vehicles, machinery, and certain  other kinds of property during the year in which they are purchased. It  would also help small and medium-sized farms and businesses to recover  an even greater portion of their capital investments by allowing them  to deduct at least $2 million of new investments in business property.   My bill expands current law so additional building improvements-- things like roofs, heating, and air conditioning units would qualify  for immediate expensing. Farmers and ranchers who may reach the limit  on full expensing are not forgotten either. The bill substantially  increases the rate at which they can deduct the costs of tractors,  combines, and other machinery.   Finally, for those farms and businesses that rely on cars, light  trucks, and vans, this bill would substantially increase the amount of  their vehicle investment that can be deducted when the business  determines its taxable income each year. Currently, a light truck used  on a farm or ranch could cost upwards of $30,000. Yet a farmer is only  allowed to deduct $19,000 of that cost over the required recovery  period for a business vehicle. My bill would substantially increase  that limit to bring it more in line with the real-world costs of  business vehicles.   These changes to expensing rules all have one goal: putting more  money back in the hands of business owners--particularly, small  business owners, farmers, and ranchers. Forcing business owners,  farmers, and ranchers to lock up their capital for 5, 10, or nearly 40  years discourages growth and job creation. Under my bill, businesses,  farms, and ranches would be able to redeploy that hard-to-raise capital  back into business expansion, increase in wages, new jobs, and even new  ventures.   The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the economy will grow  at a rate of just 1.9 percent over the next 30 years. That is a full  percentage point lower than the average growth rate over the past 50  years, which was over 3 percent, or between 3.2 and 3.5. That will mean  decades of fewer jobs and opportunities, low wage growth, and a reduced  standard of living. We don't want to resign ourselves to that, and we  don't have to. If we eliminate the antigrowth features of our Tax Code,  if we lift the regulatory burdens facing American businesses and free  up businesses to grow and create jobs, we can achieve a future of  strong economic growth--the kind of strong growth that will fuel  employment and wage growth, along with greater opportunities for  American workers.   I hope the INVEST Act will help us develop the kind of tax reform  legislation that will help us restore strong, sustainable economic  growth, and I am looking forward to working with Chairman Hatch and all  of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to put together the  final bill and to get it to the President.   It is time that we give the American people a tax code that actually  works for them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KENNEDY:   S. 1150.
