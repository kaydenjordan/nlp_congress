 I would be delighted to yield to the senior Senator  from Maryland and his colleague, Senator Van Hollen.    The Senator from Maryland is correct. The Commerce  Committee has no intention of trying to pressure NASA to establish a  university affiliated research center unless NASA leadership identifies  a technical need for a mission requirement that the agency cannot  satisfy through the standard competitive processes. In addition, the  intended results of the reports called for in sections 818 and 819  should not be viewed as seeking to avoid either peer review by the  National Academy of Sciences or very broad consultation with the  scientific and aerospace communities.    The Senator has my assurance to work to accommodate his  concerns and those of his colleague from Maryland before we proceed on  any comparable legislation in the 117th Congress
