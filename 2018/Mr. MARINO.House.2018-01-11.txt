 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes to make a  statement.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 139, the FISA Amendments  Reauthorization Act. As a former United States attorney, I know  firsthand the enormous value that programs like section 702 provide in  protecting our country.   The worst threats have been thwarted due to our intelligence and law  enforcement communities having tools like section 702. Chairman  Goodlatte, along with the members of the Judiciary Committee, worked  diligently on legislation to implement meaningful reforms while  ensuring the law enforcement and Intelligence Committee still had the  necessary tools available. This bill includes many other reforms from  the USA Liberty Act, enhances section 702 protections, and maintains  law enforcement abilities.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask all Members to join me in voting ``yes'' on  this legislation to implement real reforms, while ensuring that we  still provide the tools necessary to keep American citizens safe.   In conclusion, as a U.S. attorney, I have used this section. My  office used this section. We followed the law to the letter. There were  no complaints, and I want the American people to realize something: we  in law enforcement, law enforcement throughout the U.S., we have to be  right and on spot every second of every day. It only takes a terrorist  a moment to get lucky and set off a bomb killing Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Poe).
