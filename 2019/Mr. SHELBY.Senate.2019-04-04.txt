 Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, these unanimous consent requests are  political and, I believe, are not productive at the moment. We know  that for two reasons.   First, earlier this week, my Democratic colleagues rejected a  disaster assistance package that contained assistance for the Midwest.  Instead, they supported a different version that did nothing for folks  in Iowa, in Nebraska, and in other States who have been the victims of  catastrophic flooding. In fact, if the Democrats had gotten their way  the other night, their bill would have gone straight to the President's  desk.   That brings me to the second reason these procedural requests are  empty gestures. My Democratic colleagues know that the measure they  raise today does not have the President's support, not unlike the bill  they supported earlier this week. Those measures cannot secure the  President's signature.   My Democratic colleagues have regrouped today and have decided to  provide assistance to the folks in the Midwest--the same folks they  left stranded earlier in the week. Yet they are willing to help the  Midwest only if Puerto Rico gets billions more in Federal assistance-- billions more they cannot justify right now.   Look, we all want to help the people of Puerto Rico, and I know the  Presiding Officer has been deeply involved in this. Congress, in its  recognition of those needs, has already committed significant resources  to the island. In fact, Puerto Rico is eligible for more than $90  billion in funding from the previous supplemental.   For example, FEMA estimates that Puerto Rico will be eligible to  receive more than $60 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result  of the 2017 storms; yet Puerto Rico has only spent approximately $10  billion of this amount thus far.   Another example is Congress has approved $20 billion in Community  Development Block Grant--or CDBG--funding for Puerto Rico--$20 billion.   In February 2018, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  allocated $1.5 billion of this amount to the island; yet more than a  year later, it has spent only $42,000 out of the $1.5 billion  allocation. Still, HUD allocated another $8.2 billion just over a month  ago. In addition, Puerto Rico has been granted an enormous amount of  flexibility to expend these resources.   FEMA used its administrative authority to extend the 100-percent  Federal cost share for emergency work in Puerto Rico longer than it has  for any  [[Page S2249]]  other disaster in more than 10 years, and not once has FEMA denied  Puerto Rico access to funding on the basis of its ability to provide  its own share of the costs when required. More importantly, even if  cost share were an issue, which I don't believe it is, Puerto Rico  could use its ample CDBG funding to meet any cost share requirement.   However, it does not appear that access to resources for cost share  is actually an issue in Puerto Rico. According to the Treasury  Department, Puerto Rico has billions of dollars in unrestricted cash on  hand. In fact, the Treasury Department reports it has $5.6 billion in  unrestricted cash, to be precise. What is more, the land of Puerto Rico  continues to collect tens--if not hundreds--of millions of dollars a  month because revenues are exceeding costs on the island, which only  adds to that $5.6 billion balance.   Despite all of these resources, we have agreed that the Government of  Puerto Rico needs additional funding for nutrition assistance. My  Democratic colleagues have been in the forefront. The question is, Why?  It is that this money is actually being spent. In fact, it is running  out. So not only did my Democratic colleagues leave folks in the  Midwest behind when they rejected the Shelby amendment earlier this  week, but they also passed up an opportunity to help the people of  Puerto Rico immediately.   Where do we go from here?   I think we need to find areas of agreement, which we have before in  my working with Senator Leahy, Senator Schumer, and Senator McConnell.  I am pleased that my Democratic colleagues have discovered a newfound  concern for the people in the Midwest. We want to stay on that too. It  is promising that we not only agree on that but also that we should  provide funding for nutrition assistance for the people of Puerto Rico  now. Yet, when it comes to additional funding beyond nutrition  assistance for Puerto Rico, I believe that our constituents--the  American taxpayers--deserve a detailed explanation of exactly why  existing funding is insufficient and why the resources that we have  provided have not been spent.   How do we know Puerto Rico needs more when it hasn't come close to  spending what we have already provided it? Communities, meanwhile, that  experienced disasters in 2018 are truly suffering because Congress has  provided them with nothing.   Unless my Democratic colleagues can demonstrate this urgency, I  believe they should stop holding hostage those who are suffering in the  Midwest and those who have been impacted by disasters all over the  United States. These people are in urgent need of funding so they can  begin the rebuilding process, and many of them have been waiting for  months and months for relief.   I hope we can come together and work this out in a deliberate and  fact-based manner. Until then, I will continue to object to these  haphazard unanimous consent requests that will get us nowhere.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the  retirement of Whit Armstrong, a native of Montgomery, AL, from the  Alabama Power Company board of directors, effective on April 26, 2019.  Whit is an acknowledged leader in the financial and investment arena  with over 30 years in the banking industry, including service as a  member of the Alabama State Banking Board. He has provided decades of  service to improve the quality of life in his community and across the  State of Alabama with numerous civic, economic development,  educational, and business organizations.   Mr. Whit Armstrong previously served as president, chief executive  officer, and chairman of the board of The Citizens Bank in Enterprise,  AL, and of its holding company, Enterprise Capital Corporation, Inc. He  currently serves as managing member of Creeke Capital Investments, LLC,  also located in Enterprise, AL.   Whit has earned many recognitions for his contributions, among them a  Silver Beaver Award for Outstanding Service to the Boy Scouts and the  1975 Alabama Jaycees' Outstanding Young Man of Alabama Award. He earned  his bachelor's degree and master of science in finance with a focus in  banking from the University of Alabama.   At home in the Wiregrass, Whit is married to Dr. Rebecca Brown  Armstrong. They have a son, Whit Junior, and four grandchildren, Whit  III, Charlotte, James, and Katrina Armstrong. An engaged resident in  his community, Whit is an active member of First United Methodist  Church of Enterprise.   His extensive experience in business and civic life, along with his  seasoned judgment and knowledge of the Alabama Power Company, have  provided great value to Alabama Power's board of directors.   What is truly remarkable are Whit Armstrong's many accomplishments  and contributions to the State. I am proud to take this time to  recognize him for his service on the Alabama Power Company board of  directors, which has benefitted the customers of Alabama Power, the  people of Alabama, and the State. His achievements and dedication to  advancing the industry have not gone unnoticed. I join Whit Armstrong's  friends, family, and colleagues in wishing him the best of luck as he  transitions into a new chapter of his life, and I thank him for his  commitment to Alabama.                            ____________________
