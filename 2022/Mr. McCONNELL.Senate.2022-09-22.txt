 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, first this morning, I was deeply  saddened to learn we lost a dedicated and long-serving member of the  Senate family this week.   Officer William Thomas of the United States Capitol Police passed  away after a battle with cancer. He was only 38 years young.   Officer Thomas joined the force nearly 14 years ago. He quickly  became a familiar face to many of the Senators and staff serving on  this side of the Capitol. By all accounts, his dedication, his  professionalism, and his service in the Senate Division and most  recently in the Communications Division were a credit to the entire  Department and to our institution.   The loss of Officer Thomas leaves a hole in the close-knit community  of brave men and women who keep us safe here at the Capitol.   The entire Senate joins Officer Thomas's brother Vincent, as well as  his brothers and sisters here in uniform, in mourning this tragic loss.                                  Inflation    Madam President, now on an entirely different matter, the painful  story of Washington Democrats' runaway inflation is playing out in  hard-working communities all across our country. We learned last week  that food inflation is now at its highest level since 1979.   For folks in the Phoenix metro area, where inflation already outpaces  the national average, that has meant a       3-percent inflation tax on  food in just the last 2 months. According to one Arizona shopper:         It's all almost $300. I used to get the same groceries like       around $150 before.    Across the border in Nevada, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported  recently how local coffee shops are caught between eating higher costs  for supplies and chasing their customers away with higher prices. The  owner of one shop says that as everything from coffee beans to cups  gets more expensive, they have had to raise prices by about 10 percent:         We've done our best not to pass this on to our customers,       because we do understand that we are all in the same boat       together.    The Colorado Sun spoke with one new resident of Westminster who said  he had moved to town to ``lower the impact of an 18-percent rent  increase.'' He has cut back on cable, driving, and buying meat at the  grocery store.   In Washington State, the Seattle Times is reporting that 4 in 10 area  renters are now spending more than 30 percent of their paychecks on  rent. When one resident learned her rent would be increasing by nearly  10 percent, she said:         I just wanted to cry. I'm barely making it. I'm just a       senior citizen.    In Georgia, the Augusta Press reports that local small businesses are  still facing a rocky road. According to the owner of one power-washing  business in Evans: ``Materials are getting more expensive,'' and  potential clients are ``more hesitant to get any work done right now.''   And further north, with winter cold fast approaching, one resident of  Manchester, NH, told the local news that heating oil subsidies were  appreciated, but ``I feel like it's a Band-Aid after they've stabbed  you.''   So these are the real-world consequences--real-world consequences--of  Washington Democrats' inflation. Every corner of every State is writing  its own painful story. But the ones I just mentioned have something  unfortunate in common. Every resident of Arizona, Washington, Nevada,  New Hampshire, Colorado, and Georgia is represented by two Senators  each who cast the deciding vote to set this inflation in motion. If  just one single Senator--just one--from Georgia, Arizona, Colorado, New  Hampshire, or Washington had refused to give their vote to President  Biden's reckless spending, the working families and small business  owners of these States would not be dealing with this much inflation,  period. But every one of those States' Senators cast tie-breaking votes  to bring on the worst inflation in four decades, and now every American  is paying the price.                                 DISCLOSE Act    Madam President, now on one final matter, Democrats' reckless  policies have stuck the American people with an inflation crisis, a  border crisis, a violent crime crisis, and an energy crisis.   Today, this Democrat Senate majority is spending time on legislation  that tackles none of these things. They aren't addressing any of the  problems that keep moms and dads up at night. They aren't tackling any  of the issues that are leaving small business owners unable to pay  their bills or unsafe in inner-city locations, or both. They aren't  spending 10 seconds of the Senate's time exploring the disconnect  between Vice President Harris who says ``we have a secure border'' and  the illegal immigrant who told a reporter last week:         Everybody believes the border is open . . . we see it on       the news that everybody comes in illegally, so we do the       same.    So, the Democrats don't want to spend time on the people's business  today. They would rather spend time on their business--something we  have seen time and time again over the last 2 years.   Today's liberal pet priority is a piece of legislation designed to  give unelected Federal bureaucrats vastly more power over private  citizens' First Amendment rights and political activism and to strip  privacy away from Americans who speak out about politics in their  private lives.   More power for Washington, DC, censors; less privacy for private  citizens; and throw some ice on the First Amendment. That is what our  colleagues across the aisle have made their top priority for the day.   So I have to state, it is a novel response to flagging poll numbers  and public outcry. Instead of trying to clean up the border mess, the  crime mess, or the inflation mess, my Democratic colleagues decided it  would be easier just to erode the American people's right to complain  about it in the first place.   The legislation I am speaking about itself is an insult to the First  Amendment, and the notion that it gets Senate floor time today above  everything else is truly an insult to the working people of this  country.   So I would urge my colleagues on both sides to stand with the  Constitution, stand with our citizens who deserve better, and vote no.
