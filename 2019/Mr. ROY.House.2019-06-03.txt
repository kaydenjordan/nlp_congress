 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas and  appreciate all that she does for the great State of Texas.   I rise in gratitude that this disaster relief bill will be debated  and voted on today. It is important legislation that impacts people  suffering in the wake of numerous emergencies and natural disasters.   My Democratic colleagues tried three separate times to pass this $19  billion disaster supplemental, which is unpaid for and most Members  haven't read, without Members present for a vote through simple consent  with, solely, two Members in this Chamber.   I objected, along with my colleagues Mr. Massie and Mr. Rose, to that  process because, as I said throughout the past week, Members should  cast an up-or-down vote on major legislation that spends a significant  amount of taxpayer money.   The American people send their Representatives to Washington to  represent them. They deserve to see how we vote.   While I am happy the Speaker chose to go back to regular procedure, I  am still troubled that we are poised to spend $19 billion that is not  paid for when we are racking up approximately $100 million an hour in  national debt. At some point, before it is too late, Congress will get  serious about restraining out-of-control spending.   In the 10 days this body recessed since the Friday before Memorial  Day, we have racked up approximately $24 billion in additional debt. At  least today we are voting, which is what I requested all along.
