 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address the  infrastructure crisis our country is facing.   Today, in Oakland County, Michigan, in the heart of my district, we  are struggling with a major water main break. In my district, schools  are being closed and hospitals are transporting patients to nearby  areas. It will be days before the region will receive access to  reliable, safe drinking water.   This is not an isolated incident. We are not investing in our  Nation's infrastructure. Not surprisingly, Michigan's infrastructure  received a D grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers. This  is unacceptable.   Lack of investment, lack of action is a matter of public health and  public safety. It is a matter of life and death. It is obvious today in  my district, but also in districts across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to ignore this crisis. We need  an infrastructure plan. Flint, Michigan, showed us that infrastructure  is about the lives of American citizens. Let's work together to fix our  Nation's infrastructure.                            ____________________
