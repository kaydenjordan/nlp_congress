 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize District Attorney  Nancy O'Malley who is retiring after serving as the chief law  enforcement officer in Alameda County for 13 years.   Nancy's career began as a rape crisis counselor volunteer where she  witnessed firsthand the way in which victims of crime were disregarded  or disrespected by the justice system. It inspired her to go into law  enforcement and rise to the rank of chief assistant district attorney.   She has now served the county for 37 years and has developed a  national reputation for excellence as the county's first elected female  district attorney.   She also created the one-stop shop idea of a family justice center  replicated across the country providing legal, health, housing,  psychological, and other support services. She has also written and  sponsored 60 bills that have become law in California helping people  with disabilities access the courts, as well as making sure that  victims of crime have their day in court, too.   Nancy also founded the Human Exploitation and Trafficking Unit, or  HEAT, which has led the Nation in response to human trafficking.   Furthermore, I am fortunate for Nancy's guidance as my former boss,  mentor, friend, and even officiant at my wedding. As Nancy's service to  the office comes to an end next year, her work to serve justice will go  on.   I congratulate Nancy and wish her and her husband, John, a happy  retirement.                            ____________________
