 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am really beginning to believe everyone  in the White House is clueless. After promising to lead us away from  crisis and chaos, President Biden has instead made achieving the  American dream  [[Page S2309]]  more challenging and, folks, a heck of a lot more expensive while at  the same time making the world a much more dangerous place. Then, to  cover up the connection between his actions and their disastrous  outcomes, the President plays the blame game.   Since Joe Biden was sworn in as President just a little over a year  ago, we have experienced record-setting inflation, making everyday  essentials unaffordable; an unprecedented number of migrants rushing  our southern border; our national debt topping $30 trillion for the  first time; the Taliban's retaking control of Afghanistan; and the  world being brought to the brink of nuclear war.   Are these events purely the result of chance or are they direct  consequences of the choices being made in the White House? You don't  need to be a detective to solve this whodunit. Let's go ahead and  examine the case.   All right. Over the past year, the cost of nearly everything has  increased at the fastest pace in over four decades. A gallon of milk is  up nearly 50 cents, and 2 pounds of ground beef costs over $1.50 more  than it did a year ago. Add in rising rents and home prices, and these  numbers really add up quickly.   While Iowans and the rest of Americans are struggling to adjust their  family budgets to the ever increasing cost of living, the Biden  administration has repeatedly dismissed concerns about the price  problem.   Last summer, the President said:         It's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term       inflation that's going to get out of hand.    Now that the problem can no longer be ignored, he is actually blaming  corporate greed.   Get a clue.   The Federal Reserve says the reason prices in the United States have  been outpacing inflation in other countries since 2021--when Biden  became President--is as a direct result of Washington's unprecedented  spending spree. It turns out you can't just print trillions of dollars  and hand it out for free.   Republicans in Congress and even some Democrats warned that this  would happen when the President began pushing one trillion-dollar  spending bill after another. Now hard-working Americans are stuck  paying for the Biden binge-spending twice--first with higher taxes and  then again with higher bills. When you add it all up, Bidenomics is  costing every family almost $500 more a month today than a year ago to  buy the same exact items.   So, despite the President's finger-pointing, this problem isn't being  caused by corporate greed for profits, and it isn't caused on Wall  Street.   The White House is using a similar setup to hide the true cause of  higher prices at the pump. President Biden wants us to believe that the  skyrocketing costs to fill up your tank are all Vladimir Putin's fault,  but gas was on the rise for more than a year before the Russian  invasion of Ukraine. In fact, gas prices have steadily increased since  the President's first day in office when he signed an Executive order  to shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline. On that day, January 20, 2021, a  gallon of gas cost less than $2.50. The President then signed an  Executive order turning off all new oil and gas leases on public lands.   While the President was shutting down U.S. energy, he was helping to  make the world more dependent on Putin for power. In May of last year,  the Biden administration waived the sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2  gas pipeline. By then, gas here in the United States had reached $3 a  gallon. When Putin invaded Ukraine in February, the price was already  more than $3.50 per gallon.   So don't be fooled, folks. It is really Biden's war on American  energy that has been fueling the soaring costs. While the Russian  dictator is guilty of many horrible things, the higher gas prices we  have been paying for over the past year and a half did not begin as a  result of Putin in Ukraine because of the war.   It is impossible to miss the irony of President Biden's pointing the  finger at Putin since the Russian dictator's aggression against Ukraine  may have been emboldened by Biden's abrupt abandonment in Afghanistan.  The poorly planned evacuation also turned over billions of dollars of  weapons and equipment to the Taliban and other terrorists and left  countless Americans and our allies behind while costing the lives of 13  of our brave servicemembers.   The President blamed our own military--he blamed our own military-- for not warning him of the catastrophe that would occur if he withdrew  all U.S. forces, but those claims were contradicted under oath before  the Senate Armed Services Committee by his own advisers, who said the  President was told Afghanistan would collapse. Try as he might to lay  the blame elsewhere, the President singlehandedly made the call to  completely withdraw from Afghanistan, which will go down as one of the  worst foreign policy decisions in U.S. history.   Now Biden's blunders are threatening to turn the crisis at our  southern border into total chaos. The number of illegal crossings last  year exceeded 1.7 million--the most ever recorded. To make matters  worse, the administration has announced that those attempting to enter  our country illegally will soon no longer be turned away under the  authority provided by title 42. As a consequence, Homeland Security  officials are expecting a record surge of border crossings, which could  reach as many as 18,000 people a day.   Just like his other abrupt, poorly thought-out decisions, the  President has no plan to deal with the inevitable repercussions. When  the predictable disaster occurs, the President will be surprised and  confused and look for someone else to blame.   I could go on, but I am all ready to rest my case since the same set  of fingerprints is on all of the evidence of these problems.   But, President Biden, if you still haven't figured it out, I will  give you a clue. Spoiler alert: The culprit is you.   Whether signing Executive orders to turn off American-made energy or  signing budget-busting bills that are fanning the flames of inflation,  the source of these problems can all be traced back to President Biden,  with the pen, in the Oval Office.   It is right there, folks. Case closed.   That is how all of these crises were created over the past year.   Now, imagine how some of the other policies being proposed by  Democrats, like defunding the police, abolishing ICE, or enacting the  Green New Deal, could turn out if President Biden is given the chance  to sign them into law.   Taxpayers can rest assured that Republicans in Congress will keep  doing our part to make sure those bills never make it to the  President's desk. And if the President tries to bypass Congress and  enact its radical agenda by signing Executive orders behind the closed  doors of the White House, Americans can count on Republicans to clue  you in.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct conferees,  which is at the desk.    Mr. President, the Small Business Innovation Research and  Small Business Technology Transfer Programs provide critical innovation  support to America's small businesses. While this program is  celebrating 40 years in business, SBIR continues to be exploited by  foreign adversaries due to lack of controls within the programs to  prevent the transfer of new American technology to our adversaries.   China has become one of the largest beneficiaries of the SBIR  Programs because of the lack of adequate oversight. China and other  foreign adversaries, like Putin's Russia, know this and have been  establishing shell companies, acquiring beneficial ownership in  American enterprises, selecting key awardee personnel for talent  recruitment, and other state-directed technology acquisition. China has  also infiltrated businesses known as SBIR mills that have won numerous  grants.   This is a clear national security threat and is wholly unacceptable.  Serious and comprehensive due diligence reforms are needed to combat  adversarial foreign influence in these programs and to protect our  national security.   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  effort.
