 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am one of the few parents of young  children in the Senate. But almost every one of us here is a parent, so  you know that one of the most spectacular things your kid can do is to  write you a letter. Sometimes--frankly, most of the time--when I have  gotten those letters,  [[Page S2077]]  it is because my kid wants to protest something that I have done. I  have gotten a few of those where my kids are so upset about a rule or a  decision that we have made as parents, they sit down and they catalog  their grievances on paper.   Maybe if you are lucky, you get a nice letter. My in-laws have one  still plastered up on their wall from their youngest daughter who wrote  them a nice list when she was young about the things she appreciated.  But those ``Dear Mommy'' or ``Dear Daddy'' letters, that is one of the  rare joys of parenthood.   On March 6, 2018, Patricia Verbeeck awoke to find one of those  letters for her left by her child Eric. It was laying on the pillow of  his bed. She picked it up, and she read it to herself. ``Dear Mommy,''  her child wrote. Maybe her eyes twinkled thinking of what sweet or  funny thoughts might come next. But this is what the letter said:         Dear Mommy, I am sorry to do this to you, but I have killed       myself by jumping off the top floor, the 12th floor, of your       building . . . at the nearest stair exit to the elevators on       that floor.        I felt I could no longer live my life as a lie, living as a       boy, instead of the girl I knew I could become. I am sorry I       lied to you. I was losing hope in the world and could not see       my way out of the wrong body and I decided it was time for my       life to end . . .    As you might imagine, Patricia didn't get beyond that first line.  Upon reading it, she dropped the letter, and she ran straight to her  balcony and below, she saw the vague outline of a body and police  officers surrounding it.   I follow President Trump's family members on social media. I do it  because I know how influential they are. I know how many Americans-- good, decent Americans--admire them and listen to what they say.   Lately, the posts from Trump's family members have just been of one  theme: America should fear transgender children. The Trump family and  their network of supporters and sycophants have decided that Eric  Verbeeck and other kids like them are the No. 1 problem facing America  today. And over the past year, this crowd has orchestrated a relentless  and unceasing campaign to marginalize, demonize, and bully kids whose  gender identity is different from their biological sex.   This year alone, Republican State legislatures across the country  have introduced 150 bills to deny rights to transgender Americans.   Today, the Alabama legislature introduced legislation that is fast- tracked, from what I understand, to become law that makes it a felony-- a felony--for a doctor to provide healthcare to a transgender child. In  Texas, the Governor directed his child welfare agency to investigate  parents like Patricia who are simply determined to support their  children if they help them secure the gender-affirming treatment they  need. Criminalizing parents of transgender children is just around the  corner in some States.   In Congress, Trump's allies spent more time talking about transgender  kids than they spent talking about healthcare or taxes or education.  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene--perhaps Trump's best ally in the  House--had a sign outside her office calling the experience of  transpeople a ``fiction'' just to bully her hallway neighbor,  Representative Marie Newman, who has a transgender daughter.   And in the Supreme Court hearings here last month, at least one  Senator used their time on the national stage to suggest that the  entire idea of being transgender is a leftwing hoax.   All across America, Republicans--not all Republicans but the Trump  wing of the Republican Party has declared war against transgender kids,  and these children have noticed. A recent survey of transgender youth  showed that half of them--52 percent--had contemplated suicide over the  last year.   Just think about that for a second, my colleagues, half of all the  kids who are transgender come to the conclusion at some point in their  young lives that they would be better off dead than live in a world  that believes they are threats to be marginalized or expunged. That is  a national crisis, and we need to talk, honestly and candidly, about  what has led us to this moment.   We need to start by acknowledging that this conversation is long  overdue. This dialogue about transgender children, it may feel new, but  transgender kids aren't, transgender adults aren't. The only difference  between today and, say, 50 years ago, is that today there is space for  kids and adults to be open about who they truly are.   We are all born with a biological sex. And centuries of tightly  controlled constructs about what a man should be and what a man should  act like and what a woman should be and what a woman should act like,  they have sorted human beings into personality and professional  profiles based on that gender.   But there are many of us--this has been the case for human history-- who don't associate with the gender that biological chance ascribed to  us. There are people who are assigned male at birth who feel, in their  bones, that they are female. That is what Eric felt. That is what Eric  knew. And there are people who are assigned female at birth, but know,  they just know, that they are male.   And there is nothing wrong with that. That process of figuring out  which gender you identify with, it poses no threat to anyone. But we do  have to acknowledge how hard it is, given those centuries of gender  identity and stereotypes, for some Americans to understand what a kid  like Eric was going through.   For Americans, for instance, who were born a male and feel like a  male and who are surrounded by family and friends who associate with a  gender that matches the sex they were born into, the whole notion of a  boy becoming a girl or a girl becoming a boy--I get it--that can be  disconcerting. It can be difficult to understand. But I also know that  this discomfort will pass as more Americans learn what I have learned.  Transgender and nonbinary children aren't any different than any other  kids.   You might not know a transgender or nonbinary kid, but, trust, me,  you do. You know what these kids are like because they are no different  than any other children. My son has transgender and nonbinary friends.  He has nontransgender friends, but when they are all sitting around our  kitchen after school, there is no difference between them in terms of  how they act and how they talk, what they are like, what they like,  what they don't like. They are kids. They are just kids.   And so here is my message to the adults with power who have decided  to spend their days bullying these kids: Stop it. Grow up. So you are  not ready to accept transgender people, fine. I hope you come around  someday. But these kids threaten no one. They are hurting no one.   And, well, there are important conversations we need to have about  how we include transgender kids fully in sports. I could walk into a  room of a thousand people in my State and ask how many of them have had  a child lose a sporting event to a transgender girl and not a single  hand would raise.   Saving girls sports is not the reason why Donald Trump and Marjorie  Taylor Greene and their whole political movement has made bullying  transgender kids their top priority. No, it is their top priority  because they know hate and fear of what some people don't understand  has a habit of selling in this country. I wish that weren't true, but  it has always been true.    There is always going to be a constituency in America that will  listen to an argument for why Black people or Mexicans or Muslims or  gay people or transgender people are ruining America, why we should  fear them.   It is not true. It has never been true. But demagogues and their  movements, they tend not to have actual ideas, things they are for.  Demagogues normally just focus on what they hate.   Let me say it again. Half of all transgender children in this country  have thought to themselves, at some point, that they would be better  off dead than live in a world where so many people fear them. That is  heartbreaking to know that we are doing that to these kids.   Being a teenager today--I know; I have one--with social media and the  pandemic, it is hard enough, but imagine being a teenager who wakes up  every day knowing that they aren't the gender they were assigned by  biology at birth. Imagine keeping your feelings about that secret for  years, worried--worried--about what your parents or your friends might  say.   Imagine the anguish of a scared 12-year-old or 14-year-old sitting in  bed  [[Page S2078]]  awake for hours each night trying to process all of that alone with no  help. Imagine the courage it then takes for that kid to have the first  conversation with a parent or a friend. And then layer on top of that  some of the most powerful people in the world deciding to use their  power not to cure disease or end poverty or hunger but instead to use  their power to target those very scared, desperate kids and to use  their powers to harass and bully and shame them.   Imagine how small, how insecure, how weak a person must be to have  all that power and to use it to bully children.   Seth Walsh was gay, not transgender, but his experience was not much  different than Eric's. Students at his school were systematic in their  targeting of him because of his sexual orientation. They pushed him  down the stairs. They kicked him until he was badly bruised. They  screamed at him. They called him names. No doubt these bullies took  direction and inspiration from adults who paved the way, who endorsed  this kind of hateful behavior.   One day, after one of these incidents, a frightened Seth called his  mom and he said: ``Mom, you have to come get me right now.'' His mom  could feel--hear the fear in his voice, and so she grabbed Seth's  little brother and they got in the car and they rushed to pick him up.  His mom was so supportive. That afternoon they sat and they talked.   Seth took a shower to calm himself down, and afterward he asked his  mom for a pen and told her that he was going to go outside and play  with the dogs. About 10 minutes later, his mom went outside to continue  this conversation with her son, but it was too late. Seth had hung  himself from a tree. The pen that he asked for was for his suicide  note.   I tell you these stories because they are consequences of adults'  behavior. Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene and their ilk, they  aren't murderers, but make no mistake, there is a direct through line  from the hateful words and the policies of leaders and the misery that  too many transgender, nonbinary, and gay kids are going through today.   But I am also here to tell you that Trump and Taylor Greene, others  like them, they are not the majority. And I want to make sure that I  finish by sending a message to transgender children and adults that  these hateful people, this movement that is growing out there to try to  target you, it is not going to win. We are going to build a community  of love and protection for you. No matter how bad things may seem right  now, they are going to get better. The world is going to get kinder.  Adults are going to learn their lessons. And if you don't have it now,  as you are struggling with your identity, you will find a support  structure that will nurture and support you. It is out there for you.  You should be who you are. Don't feel like you need to hide your true  self just because of these idiot adults who feel big by bullying people  who are different from them.   Be who you are and know that there are a whole lot of us who are  going to work our tails off to support you, to love you, and to make  sure that you get a chance to thrive--because in the long run, the  bullies never win. They never do.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be  removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on April 7,  2022, by the President of the United States: the extradition treaty  with the Republic of Albania, Treaty Document No. 117-2. I further ask  that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that  it be referred with accompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign  Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message  be printed in the Record.   THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The message of the President is as follows:  To the Senate of the United States:   With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to  ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the  Government of the United States of America and the Government of the  Republic of Albania (the ``Treaty''), signed at Tirana on December 22,  2020. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of  the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.   The Treaty would replace the extradition treaty between the United  States and Albania, signed at Tirana on March 1, 1933. The Treaty  follows generally the form and content of other extradition treaties  recently concluded by the United States. It would replace an outmoded  list of extraditable offenses with a modern ``dual criminality''  approach, which would enable extradition for such offenses as money  laundering, cyber-related crimes, and other newer offenses not  appearing on the list. The Treaty also contains a modernized  ``political offense'' clause and provides that extradition shall not be  refused based on the nationality of the person sought. Finally, the  Treaty incorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline  and expedite the extradition process.   I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to  the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.                                                  Joseph R.
