 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember someone  who dedicated his life to public service in the First Congressional  District of Georgia, Mr. James Mondell DeLoach, Sr., who passed away on  July 3 at the age of 86.   Jimmy DeLoach truly dedicated his whole life to serving others. He  was a staple of government in Garden City, Georgia, between 1970 and  1990, serving three terms as the mayor of Garden City and then for 8  more years as a Chatham County commissioner.   As county commissioner, Mr. DeLoach was integral in the construction  of the nationally important Mighty Eighth Air Force Heritage Museum  dedicated to the airmen who served in the European theater during World  War II.   Because of his exceptional service to the area, one of the area's  most popular roadways was given his name, the Jimmy DeLoach Parkway.   Jimmy DeLoach was the epitome of a public servant. And he set the bar  high for all of us who followed him in public service.   His family, including his son, the mayor of Savannah, Eddie DeLoach,  are all in my thoughts and prayers. We truly lost a giant in west  Chatham County.  [[Page H6101]]                                ____________________
