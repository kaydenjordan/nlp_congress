 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about the Nation's first line of defense against hunger--the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.   Since day one in the Senate, I have fought to pass a farm bill that  stands up for North Dakota's farmers, ranchers, and low-income  families. In 2014 we passed a strong farm bill, which I helped to  write, negotiate, and pass. Since then, I have been working on the next  farm bill.   Now the Senate is incredibly close to passing the next farm bill,  which we crafted with strong support from Democrats and Republicans.  This important bill shows that the Senate can work to find compromise  and support the American people.   A key component of any farm bill is the safety net for farmers and  ranchers during tough times, like crop insurance. It also includes a  safety net for families who fall on hard times.    Our Nation is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Yet,  despite our great wealth, more than one out of seven Americans live  below the poverty line. SNAP provides the critical safety net for these  Americans who are food-insecure.   In my own State of North Dakota, about 54,000 North Dakotans  participate in SNAP on any given day. SNAP plays a critical role in  helping these families put food on the table in what is oftentimes one  of the most stressful periods in a person's life. Of those 54,000 North  Dakotans, 43 percent are children, 28 percent are seniors, and about 4  percent are veterans.   Families can find themselves needing this assistance for a number of  reasons. First, their hours may have been reduced at work, they may  have been laid off, their places of employment may have gone out of  business, or an individual may be unable to work due to a disability or  serious illness. Additionally, nearly 9 percent of seniors  [[Page S4712]]  live below the poverty level. SNAP helps those seniors with their basic  needs, many of whom live on fixed incomes.   Not one of us can predict when an unexpected life event will happen  to us. Thankfully, SNAP is available to provide at-risk families with  the safety net they need.   Other than those with disabilities, the elderly, or others who cannot  work, very few people stay on SNAP for more than 3 months in a 36-month  period. Half of those new to the SNAP program will leave it within 9  months once they become financially stable.   Yesterday, I stood here to talk about the critical, bipartisan work  of the chairman and ranking member on the Senate Ag Committee and what  they have done for ranchers and farmers.   This bipartisan farm bill includes a number of provisions that work  to improve employment and job-training opportunities and programs that  help parents find new jobs or obtain new skills so that they can  qualify for higher paying jobs. This includes expanding SNAP employment  and training demonstration pilots that were authorized under the 2014  farm bill. These pilot programs create more opportunities to build  evidence on what works best in helping SNAP participants secure and  retain jobs and advance in the labor market.   Additionally, the Senate farm bill encourages States to create new  public-private partnerships around job training and leverage existing  private sector job-training programs for SNAP participants.   During consideration of the 2014 farm bill, the Senate Ag Committee,  on which I proudly sit, also worked to responsibly cut $4 billion of  waste, fraud, and abuse from the program, while protecting low-income  families who rely on this lifesaving program during times of need. The  Senate bill continues to improve SNAP's integrity by preventing dual  participation by enabling States to check whether applicants have  already enrolled in other States.   In other words, the SNAP program as laid out in the farm bill that we  will be considering is a program that has the necessary reforms and the  necessary balance. No one--no one--in this body wants someone who is  unworthy to receive SNAP benefits, but we also do not want families who  need that critical benefit to find it onerous or impossible to access  food for their children, food for their grandchildren, or food for our  veterans.   A week ago, the House of Representatives narrowly passed its version  of the farm bill by two votes, which would drastically cut SNAP. This  partisan bill was even opposed by 20 Republican Members. As ranking  member of the House Agriculture Committee, Collin Peterson said the  following about the vote:         The partisan approach of the Majority has produced a bill       that simply doesn't do enough for the people it's supposed to       serve. It still leaves farmers and ranchers vulnerable, it       worsens hunger, and it fails rural communities.    This approach makes reckless cuts to the nutrition safety net and in  so doing significantly jeopardizes our chances of passing a farm bill.  Any effort to separate farm programs from nutrition programs threatens  the urban-rural coalition that has kept the farm bill a bipartisan  effort for years.   Simply put, the House bill threatens these critical lifelines for  struggling families, seniors, and Americans with disabilities. There is  no place for politics when it comes to protecting these vulnerable  members of our society.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the House  farm bill would cause more than 2 million individuals in more than 1  million households to lose their benefits. This simply will not impact  single adults, but when a parent loses their food assistance, there  isn't enough money to buy for the whole household, including children.   The House farm bill would pull the rug out from underneath low-income  families by expanding the already rigid work requirements in SNAP. This  includes working parents, children, seniors, veterans, and disabled  Americans. A quarter of a million children would lose their access to  school lunch.    Last Saturday, I was asked to participate in a discussion with the  faith-based community in my State regarding their concerns about the  SNAP program. At that time, we were told a couple of stories that I  think are significant for review here in the Senate.   I want to start off by telling you about Kim. Kim is a woman, a  single mom with two beautiful children. She lives in Bismarck, ND. She  works as an accounting assistant, and when she doesn't have full-time  hours, she works as a substitute at area daycares. Since her divorce 3  years ago, her family has been eligible for SNAP benefits.   Kim said: ``We do what we can, but usually we are eating ramen by the  end of the month--don't want to eat cheap food, but there's never  enough money to buy healthy foods.''   To stretch their food budget, Kim tries to get the children to The  Banquet, which is a local feeding ministry, for meals two to three  times a week. They also visit the local food pantry.   She told us:         I can only speak for myself, but I'm grateful for this       program every single day. I'm working hard. If I don't have       enough to eat, I can't work. If I'm not healthy, I'll need       even more support.    This is an incredibly common theme among SNAP families.   I think it is worth mentioning that the average meal benefit in North  Dakota--I want to repeat this--the average benefit per meal in North  Dakota is $1.32. You can't even get a bowl of Senate bean soup for  $1.32.   Next, there is Ricky. Ricky was born in Minot, ND, where he grew up  in poverty, and his family spent the majority of their lives on what  was then known as food stamps. Ricky has since moved to Fargo, and a  number of years ago, Ricky suffered an unfortunate accident in his  workplace. So Ricky was working. He got injured, and he woke up from a  coma 3 weeks later. He was later diagnosed with epilepsy, and he no  longer can drive or work. Like Ricky, his parents are also disabled,  and the program has offered them a consistent safety net during their  difficult times.   From his childhood, Ricky recalled that his family rarely had money  for food. He said:         If it wasn't for food stamps, we could have starved easily.       There were times when my family couldn't even celebrate       birthdays because we didn't have anything.    Now in his late twenties and living on his own in Fargo,  unfortunately the difficult times surrounding hunger are still a  concern for Ricky, for reasons outside of his control. Understanding  his difficult situation and all that the SNAP program has meant to him  and his family, Ricky is passionate about stopping lawmakers from  making unnecessary cuts to this program. For Ricky and his family, the  SNAP benefits they have received are more than just a benefit; they are  a way of life and a lifeline.   For individuals who are homeless or trying to get back on the right  track, SNAP can play an invaluable role in providing a bit of security.   Folks who have benefited from the helping hand SNAP provides are all  around us. They could be our neighbors. They could be our friends. They  could even be a rural pastor.   Many years ago--about 6 years ago--when I was traveling the State, I  had an opportunity to have a discussion in a rural community. That  discussion went something like this:   Many people raised concerns about people taking government benefits  when they didn't need them. I sympathized. I don't think that we  should. I think we need to stop waste, fraud, and abuse. But we know  those government programs are there for a purpose.   After there was a long discussion about SNAP, or food stamps, the  room cleared, and a young pastor came up to me. His wife was with him,  holding their latest child, who looked to be about a 2-year-old  toddler.   He said: I didn't want to say this in front of the community. I  didn't want to tell you about this in front of the community, but I  want you to know that I am on SNAP. My family is on SNAP. We still  can't buy milk. We still buy powdered milk to feed our children. If I  want to do my rural ministry, I am not paid enough to support and feed  my family, so I am working, and I am on SNAP. I can't afford food as a  rural pastor.   I think many times we don't realize those around us who are  struggling, those who contribute as teachers, as teachers' aides, CNAs.  People are working hard. They may be tripped up by  [[Page S4713]]  some of the onerous standards and onerous bureaucratic requirements in  the farm bill that was passed by the House.   I think it is critically important that we understand that there are  very, very few people in America who are abusers of this program. There  are very, very few people in America who would take a handout unless  they absolutely needed it. They need a hand up. They need job training.  They need sympathy for their disabilities. And they need to know that  we live in a country that cares for the hungry around us.   As we consider the farm bill, it is important to remind ourselves  about those who are not as fortunate as we are, those who struggle to  put food on the table for their families or who might not be able to  put food on the table because they were laid off or their hours were  reduced at their minimum wage jobs.   The chairman and ranking member have worked diligently to find ways  to continue to improve SNAP's integrity and operations.   I hope the Senate votes on and passes this strong bipartisan farm  bill in the next few days. I hope the House decides to keep working  through August, just as the Senate will do, to reach an agreement and  pass a strong farm bill before it expires and jeopardizes SNAP further.   The farm bill gives farmers the certainty they need to get through  tough times, and it is important that it also maintain a strong safety  net to give certainty to our Nation's families that they can get the  support and food they need at the same time.   I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the ranking member and the  chairman and all of the Senate Agriculture Committee in supporting this  farm bill and supporting the nutrition title of this bill.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
