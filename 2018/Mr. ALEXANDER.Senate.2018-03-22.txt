 Madam President, I rise to say a word about my friend  Thad Cochran, who is retiring from the U.S. Senate.   In 1968, I had the job of recruiting State chairman for Citizens for  Nixon-Agnew. I was a very young, wet-behind-the-ears former legislative  assistant to Senator Howard Baker. We were working in the Willard Hotel  in the fall of 1968. The idea was to try to find outstanding citizens  who weren't necessarily Republicans because in the southern part of our  country, there weren't a lot of Republicans, especially in the State of  Mississippi.   So I called around the State of Mississippi to find out who might be  willing to head up this Nixon-Agnew campaign. Everybody I called said:  Well, there are two young men here who are just the most outstanding  young men, both are cheerleaders at Ole Miss, or had been, and both are  going to grow up to be the Governor of Mississippi, which was, at that  time, I guess, the nicest thing one could say about some aspiring young  man because nobody thought the two U.S. Senators, Eastland and Stennis,  would ever retire. So growing up to be the Governor of Mississippi was  really a great compliment to a young man in Mississippi at the time.  One of those young men was named Trent Lott, and one of those young men  was named Thad Cochran.   I telephoned Thad Cochran, and I invited him to become chairman of  the Citizens for Nixon-Agnew. He was a Democrat, but he agreed to do  that. We met in October of that year in Indianapolis. The mayor of  Indianapolis then was Richard Lugar, a young mayor at that time and  later a Member of this body. That was the beginning of Thad Cochran's  Republican Party activity.   He and that other young man--who were so promising--both ran for U.S.  Congress in 1972, and to the surprise of a great many people, they were  elected, the first Republicans since Reconstruction, I suppose, from  Mississippi--Thad Cochran and Trent Lott.   In 1978, Thad Cochran did something nobody had done from his State  since the Reconstruction; he became a Republican who was elected to the  U.S. Senate, and he has been here ever since.   The reason he was able to be successful is not surprising. Thad was  and is an engaging, pleasant person. His parents were educators. He  learned to play the piano. He was a terrific baseball player--good  enough to play professional baseball. He joined the Navy. He was, in  every respect, an outstanding young man, just as he has been a  distinguished public servant throughout his life.  [[Page S1893]]    He has been widely respected here by his colleagues, elected to be  chairman of the Republican conference, and most recently he has been  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, which is as important as any  position in this body.   In an era where not everybody seems to think it is important to act  like a gentleman, Thad Cochran is a gentleman, and we respect that and  the example he has set.   So he has been a pioneer for the Republican Party, he has been a good  example for young people, and for all of us, really, in terms of what  we should expect and try to emulate in public life, and, to me, he has  been a great friend.   So my wife Honey and I would like to say to him and to Kay, his wife,  that we respect him, we look forward to the next chapter in his life,  and we honor his service to this country.    Mr. President, the Senator from Maine will arrive in  just a moment, and I ask unanimous consent for up to an hour for us and  Senator Graham and Senator Rounds to address the Senate within that  hour--the four of us, and others who wish--to speak on the health  insurance issue within that hour.    Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the  plumber making $60,000 whose health insurance is $20,000 and he pays  for all of it and about the fact that the bill we are about to vote on  today could have had in it bipartisan legislation--supported by the  President of the United States, the majority leader, and the Speaker of  the House--that would have reduced that plumber's health insurance bill  from $12,000 to $8,000, according to the Oliver Wyman health consulting  experts, who have evaluated the bipartisan legislation that we have  proposed.   The only reason it doesn't have that in there is because Democrats  have objected to putting on this bill we are voting on today the  traditional Hyde amendment that governs how dollars are spent when an  abortion is involved. The traditional Hyde amendment is a compromise  that has been on every appropriations bill--and this is an  appropriations bill--since 1976 and that Democrats have voted for  hundreds of times and Republicans have voted for hundreds of times. On  this very bill that we are voting on today, more than 100 times the  Hyde language applies to other programs.   So Democrats are scrambling and embarrassed, coming up with excuse  after excuse, trying to explain to the self-employed businessperson-- the farmer, the songwriter, the plumber--who might be making $60,000 or  $70,000 and paying $20,000 for their insurance, and paying it all, with  no government subsidy--why they are blocking a 40-percent reduction in  their health insurance and why they will not apply the Hyde language to  the health insurance rate reduction and they will apply it to 100 other  programs. Not just in past voting but today, every single Democrat  today who votes for the omnibus bill will be voting to apply the Hyde  language restricting abortion to at least 100 other programs.   For example, how will they explain this to the plumber, the farmer,  and the self-employed businesswoman: I will apply the Hyde language and  restrict Federal funding for abortions to the National Institutes of  Health but not to reduce your health insurance rates by 40 percent. I  will apply the Hyde language to community health centers today, but I  am going to block the bipartisan proposal to reduce your health  insurance by 40 percent that is supported by the President, the  majority leader, and the Speaker of the House. I will vote today to  apply the Hyde language to the Federal Employment Health Benefits  Program, which provides health insurance to 3 million or so employees,  but I will not vote for a health insurance program to reduce your rates  by 40 percent because I will not apply the Hyde language to it?   How are they going to explain today and next October, when the  insurance rates are announced for 2019, 2020, and 2021, that they had  an opportunity in March of this year to reduce rates in 2019, 2020, and  2021 by 40 percent and they refused to do it because they said: We will  not apply the traditional Hyde language to health insurance, even  though we are going to apply it to the Indian health programs, to the  VA, to women's medical care, to global health programs, to the Ryan  White HIV/AIDS program--to 100 programs that Democrats will be voting  on today to apply the Hyde language to. They will do that, but they are  going to block bipartisan legislation--supported by the President, the  majority leader, and the Speaker--that will reduce the health insurance  rates of the plumber making $60,000 from $20,000 to $12,000?   I want to speak about that plumber. I want to speak ahead to October  1, when the rates for 2019 are announced. I want to talk about Marty,  the farmer in Tennessee who I met at the Chick-fil-A, who came up to me  and said: I was paying $300 a month for my health insurance, and over  the last 5 years it has gone up to $1,300, and I can't afford it.   I said: I have a Christmas present for you. Then, I thought I had a  Valentine card for it. Then, I thought I had an Easter present for it,  because we got bipartisan legislation, supported by the President, the  majority leader, and the Speaker. I said: We can put that in the  omnibus bill, we can pass it by the end of March, and we can reduce  your rates.   There are 9 million Americans who don't get insurance on the job.  They don't get insurance from the government. They buy it themselves.  They are hardworking Americans. They are the plumber, the farmer, the  small businessperson. They are making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000,  $90,000 a year. Their insurance bills are $15,000, $20,000, $25,000 a  year. They are rapidly approaching a point, if they haven't already,  that they have to go without insurance because they can't afford it,  and we have a way to do something about that.   It is happening in my State of Tennessee. Rates went up another 57  percent last year for those people. That is thousands of dollars. Yet  we could have today reduced their rates by thousands of dollars. Here  is how:   We have developed two bipartisan bills, beginning in the fall. Our  committee--the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--held  four hearings. We had roundtables to which we invited all the Senators.  Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat, and I presided over this.   We talked about all of the issues and tried to see what we could do,  and we came up with what we call the Alexander-Murray bill. It had two  parts to it. The first part was regulatory reform. We took something  already in the Affordable Care Act--the 1332 innovation waivers--and we  made it possible for States to streamline it and use it.   We also added a few other things. We changed the law so that  Minnesota and New York could use the basic health plan and could tap  into the subsidies in the way that those States wanted to do  [[Page S1906]]  it. That is $130 million a year in Minnesota and $1 billion in New  York. Democrats are blocking that today--$130 million in Minnesota and  $1 billion in New York, and Democrats are saying no to that today. Why?  Because they will not apply the Hyde language to the health insurance  rate decrease, even though they are going to vote to apply it to 100  other pieces of legislation in this very bill.   We did the regulatory reform, and then we did something many  Republicans didn't want to do and the President didn't want to do to  start with. We extended the cost-sharing subsidy payments for 3 more  years. These are payments to reduce rates for low-income people on  their copays and deductibles. We agreed to do that.   Then, Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, a Republican and a  Democrat, came up with a plan--the House did, too, with Representative  Costello--to add reinsurance. Reinsurance is something about which, in  our hearings and in our meetings, virtually every Senator in both  parties said: We really need to do that, because the reason the  individual market is in such trouble is that it has so many of the  sickest Americans in it and they are soaking up all the money.   The reinsurance program that we suggested and have in Senator Collins  and Senator Nelson's bill--3 years, $10 billion a year--would give  States funds as well as planning money to set up those invisible risk  pools, those reinsurance programs, that were meant for the sickest  Americans to have their needs taken care of, and you lower the rates  for everybody else.   So we have regulatory reform, 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies, 3  years of reinsurance, $10 billion a year. The Congressional Budget  Office says: If you score it based on real spending, it actually saves  the government money by reducing the premiums that taxpayers have to  pay for--a $1 billion advantage for New York for each of the next 3  years, $130 million for Minnesota for each of the next 3 years. We fix  the problem in New Hampshire, to allow both Democratic Senators and the  Republican Governor to say: Please do this; we want to be able to mix  our ObamaCare and Medicaid savings.   We said: Yes, you can do that, and so can every State.   Within the Affordable Care Act, we did what Democrats have been  saying to do ever since we couldn't repeal and replace it last August  and said: We will work with you to fix it.   The part that needs fixing is the part causing the plumber who makes  $60,000 to pay $20,000 for his health insurance, and we have a way to  fix it--to reduce it by 40 percent, according to Oliver Wyman  consulting; by 20 percent, according to the Congressional Budget  Office. Yet the Democrats are blocking it today because they will not  apply the traditional Hyde language that they voted for every single  year since 1976 in the omnibus bill and that they will be voting on  today for 100-plus times.   How do you explain that to the plumber? How do you explain that to  the farmer? How do you explain that to the 9 million Americans who see  their health insurance rates going through the roof?   Let's not make any mistake about who is doing this. We are big boys  and girls in the Senate. When we take a stand, we ought to admit it.  What the Democrats are doing is they are blocking a 40-percent rate  decrease for one single reason--one single reason. The President of the  United States supports it, the Speaker supports it, the majority leader  supports it, and we are ready to put it in the bill, and they say no.   Let's look down the road to October. All of the insurance companies  will announce their rates for 2019, and we will be looking ahead to  2020 and 2021. Rates will be going up instead of going down. The  farmer, the self-employed person, the songwriter are going to be  saying: How am I going to be able to afford this?   Nothing is more important to Americans than healthcare. Nothing is  more frightening to Americans than the prospect of not being able to  afford to buy healthcare. That is what we are doing here.   I am disappointed by this. I have spent hundreds of hours on this  since September. We had a piece of legislation introduced on this floor  by 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats that the Democratic leader said  every single Democrat would vote for and the national Democratic  chairman said was great bipartisan legislation. That is two-thirds of  our bill.   What is the other third? The other third is the Collins-Nelson bill,  which adds $10 billion a year for reinsurance. The Governors like this.  The State insurance commissioners like this. The plumber and the  songwriter like it. Who doesn't like it? A few Democrats who are saying  that the Hyde language, which says--let's be specific about what it  says--you can't use Federal funds for elective abortions, but you may  use any other funds. That is exactly the law that we have in our bill.   The Hyde language is in the bill we are going to be voting on later  today. It was put there in 1976. It is adopted year after year. It is  on page 1036, if anybody wants to look it up. Then, there is language  in the bill that we are going to be voting on today restricting Federal  employee health benefits with Hyde-like language, which is on page 588.  You will be voting for it today. Then, there is the title X family  planning legislation. That is in the bill you are going to be voting  for, as well, today. That is Hyde language. Then, there is the Mexico  City legislation. You are going to vote for that today.   But you are going to tell the farmer, the songwriter, and the  employer that they are not allowed to have a 40-percent health  insurance decrease. They are going to have to not be able to afford  health insurance for their family. As to Federal funding for the DC  government, you are going to vote for that today. Using funds for  elective abortions is restricted in the bill that we are voting on  today.   Senator Collins from Maine is here, and the Senator from South  Carolina is here. They have worked hard on this. We are a group of  Senators who I think are fairly, usually seen as trying to get results  around here. We are greatly disappointed by this--not just for this  institution but for the people we serve because the hard, simple fact  is that we have legislation that could be in this bill that will reduce  your health insurance rates by 40 percent starting in 2019 and  continuing for the next 2 years, until it gets up to 40.   We have the support of the President. We have the support of the  Speaker. We have the support of the majority leader. But the Democratic  leader says: You can't have it in the bill. We are going to vote 100  times to apply the Hyde language to everything from the National  Institutes of Health to community health centers, but we are not going  to let you reduce healthcare rates.   That is why Democrats are scrambling, coming up with excuse after  excuse. They are going to have to really come up with scrambling and  excuse after excuse on October 1, when the rates are announced.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maine  for her lucid and heartfelt description of what is before us. She has  been an exceptional leader, and she continues to be. She looks for ways  to get results.   She sees people--the plumber I talked about making $60,000, the  stylist, a farmer--the person who is working and paying all of his or  her insurance with no subsidy help and who sees the real prospect  coming that when the rates are announced October 1, they may not be  able to afford any insurance, and they can see we have a solution for  that.   Now, this isn't a Republican solution or a Democratic solution. This  is a solution that began to be developed almost the day Republicans  failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare. I walked across the aisle to  see if we could do what the Democrats were asking. Let's fix what we  have temporarily so nobody is hurt. As we have explained this  afternoon, we did that.   We have a proposal that is the original Alexander-Murray proposal,  developed in four hearings, in which more than half the Senate  participated, which at one point the Democratic leader said every  single Democrat would vote for. It takes an existing part of the  Affordable Care Act and makes it work--that is the innovation waiver-- gives States more flexibility to create more choices and lower cost  choices without changing the essential health benefits, without  changing the guarantee for preexisting conditions. It is really a  modest change, but it is a significant change. Then it has 3 years of  cost-sharing subsidies--remember, the President said he did not want to  pay those, but he supports this--and then 3 years of reinsurance so we  can help the sickest people who are in the individual market, take them  out, pay their needs, and reduce rates for everybody else. These are  the best Republican and Democratic ideas that have been put together in  a package and, as Senator Collins has said, virtually everyone who has  looked at this--starting with the Oliver Wyman Health consultants who  say it reduces rates up to 40 percent, the Congressional Budget Office  says 20. That is thousands of dollars.   If you are paying $20,000 for your insurance, if we do nothing, you  might be paying $24,000. If we do this, you might be paying $16,000.  That is a lot of money. If we do this, you might be paying $12,000.  That is thousands of dollars less. That is a big tax cut for you, and  it is a big tax increase. Why are we not doing this?   Let's not kid ourselves. There is a lot of scrambling and embarrassed  running around over on the other side of the aisle to come up with an  excuse for this, but let's be honest about it. The Democrats are  blocking this for one reason. They have convinced themselves they do  not want to apply to the health insurance rate reduction in the omnibus  bill the same law that applies to more than 100 other programs in this  omnibus bill. So every single Democrat over here who says: I can't vote  for a 40-percent rate reduction for you, Mr. Plumber or Ms. Hairstylist  or Ms. Farmer. I can't do that because I can't put the Hyde amendment  on it, but I am going to vote to put the Hyde amendment on the National  Institutes of Health, I am going to vote to put the Hyde amendment on  community health centers, I am going to vote today to put it on Federal  employee health benefits and family planning grants under title X and  100 other programs Democrats are going to vote to put the Hyde language  on--yet they say we can't put the same language on a 40-percent health  insurance reduction that is composed of three sections of bipartisan  legislation that the Democratic leader has said, at least on two-thirds  of it, that every single Democrat supported. Now, what is that? What is  that?   I mean, this should not be a partisan issue. I am not surprised there  is  [[Page S1912]]  scrambling and embarrassment on the other side of the aisle. I don't  know how they are going to explain this to the American people. I know  a lot of people in Tennessee are desperately hoping we succeed. I hear  it every time I go home.   Health insurance is the No. 1 concern of the people in my State, and  the most frightening prospect is, if they can't pay their bills, then  they can't buy insurance. They might get sick and have no way to take  care of it.   Mr. President, I will ask consent to put into the Record a few items.  The first is a list of 20 programs that are included in the omnibus  bill we are likely to vote on today that have Hyde protection.   Now, remember what the Hyde protection is. It is a compromise that  was created in 1976 that said Federal funds may not be used for  elective abortions, but basically you may use any other funds, and you  may create a contract or arrangement to do that. So that is what we do  with Medicare. That is what we do with Medicaid. That is what we are  voting today to do at the National Institutes of Health, in the  community health centers, voting today for the Federal Employee Health  Benefits Program, for family planning grants, for the Indian health  programs, for the VA women's health medical care, for global health  programs, for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and school-based health  centers. We are voting to put the Hyde protection on area health  education centers, on maternal and childcare block grants, on the  National Health Service Corps, but we can't put Hyde protection on  health insurance--a 40-percent rate reduction on health insurance, a  bipartisan proposal that has the support of the President, the majority  leader, and the Speaker. They are all willing to put it in this bill,  but you say no. You say no, and there is no good reason for that. There  is no good reason whatsoever.   We are going to vote to put the Hyde amendment on childcare community  development block grants.   I ask unanimous consent that a list of 20 of those programs be  printed in the Record, although, there are more than 100 we will be  voting on today.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               20 Programs Have Hyde Protections in the Omnibus         1. National Institutes of Health        2. Community health centers        3. Federal Employee Health Benefits Program        4. Family Planning Grants under Title X        5. Indian Health Programs        6. VA women's health medical care        7. Global health programs at the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention (CDC)        8. Ryan white HIV/AIDS Program        9. School based health centers        10. Area Health Education Centers        11. Maternal and child health block grant        12. National Health Service Corps        13. Bureau of Prisons health programs        14. Childcare Community Development Block Grants        15. Community Mental Health Services Block Grant        16. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant        17. State Grants to Respond to the Opioid Crisis        18. Rural Outreach Grants        19. Domestic trafficking victim's fund        20. Garrett Lee Smith youth suicide and early intervention       strategies    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent also to have  printed in the Record a short summary of the three-part, bipartisan  proposal that will produce the 40-percent rate decreases in the  individual market, according to Oliver Wyman, and up to 20 percent,  according to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 3 years.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Lower Premiums, More State Flexibility, Avoid Chaos in 2019, 2020 and                                    2021         President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and Speaker       Ryan support this proposal.      Premium Reduction through State-based Reinsurance Program        Adds funding for 1332 reinsurance and invisible high risk       pool programs at $10 billion a year for 2019, 2020, and 2021,       with a federal fallback in the first year.        Oliver Wyman projected premium decreases and coverage       increases:        2019, 2020, and 2021: 40% lower premiums in states that       receive a 1332 waiver than what people in the individual       market would pay if Congress doesn't act.        Will provide insurance coverage to an additional 3.2       million individuals.        An alternate analysis by the Congressional Budget Office,       based on real spending on Obamacare subsidies, indicates that       the proposal would save over $9 billion over 10 years.      Make Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers Work        More flexibility for health plan designs        Example: Iowa waiver proposal        Example: higher co-pay opioids, lower co-pay statins        ``Alaska for All'' (Maine, Minnesota)        State-based program to help cover costs of the very sick       20% premium decrease for everyone        Streamline approval process        Let Governors apply for waiver        Cut federal waiver approval time from 180 days to 120        Create fast-track approval for emergency situations        Create fast-track approval for ``copycat'' waivers        Make the waiver last longer        Make it harder for a waiver to be cancelled, giving states       certainty        Create model waivers to help states get approved faster          New Copper Plan: Catastrophic Insurance Regardless of Age                    Interstate Health Insurance Compacts       Consumer Notification        Directs state insurance commissioners to require short-      term, limited duration insurance display prominently in       marketing materials, the contract, and application materials       a notice to inform consumers that coverage and benefits       differ from coverage offered on the exchanges.      Consumer Outreach, Education, and Assistance        Allows HHS to contract with states to conduct outreach and       enrollment activities funded by existing user fees designated       for these activities.                 No bailout, ends ``silver-loading'' gimmick       Funds Cost-Sharing Reduction Subsidies        October through December of 2017, for 2018 for plans that       did not silver load and Basic Health Plans.        Helps those who are below 250% of the poverty level who       receive government assistance to help them pay for their       deductibles and co-pays.        All plans for 2019, 2020, and 2021.      Standard Hyde Protections:        Includes the same Hyde protections that already apply to       Medicaid, Medicare, Children's Health Insurance Program,       TRICARE, Indian Health Service, Federal Employees Health       Benefits Program, Veterans Affairs, and the Labor-HHS       appropriations bill. Clarifies that Hyde exemptions and       effect on non-federal funding remain the same.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the Oliver Wyman analysis entitled ``A Proposal to Lower  ACA Premiums by More than 40% and Cover 3.2 Million More'' Americans.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:                              [March 12, 2018]  A Proposal To Lower ACA Premiums by More Than 40% and Cover 3.2 Million                                    More        (By Tammy Tomczyk, FSA, FCA, MAAA and Kurt Giesa, FSA, MAAA)         In our December 9, 2017 article, we analyzed the effects of       a proposal the US Senate was considering to fund cost-sharing       reduction (CSR) payments and appropriate $5 billion in 2019       and 2020 for states to establish reinsurance programs to       stabilize their individual insurance markets. We discussed       how pass-through savings could provide reinsurance coverage       equal to roughly $15 billion in protection for high-cost       claimants, and how this protection, combined with CSR       funding, would bring more people into the individual market       and lower premiums by over 20 percent.        More recent congressional attention is focusing on a       proposal that includes an extension of CSRs and a reinsurance       program in 2019, 2020, and 2021, funded with a $10 billion       appropriation in each year, with a federal fallback option       available to states in 2019. The federal fallback option       would likely be based on--and use the federal infrastructure       built to administer--the Transitional Reinsurance Program in       place from 2014 through 2016.        Our healthcare microsimulation model, used to understand       this package's likely effects on the market, assumed states       would use federal pass-through savings under Section 1332 of       the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to supplement and leverage the       $10 billion the considered legislation would authorize and       appropriate each year. Pass-through savings result from the       fact that the premium subsidies available under the ACA cover       the difference between the second lowest cost silver plan       available in a rating area and a fixed percentage of a       household's income, varying only by federal poverty level       (FPL). Lower premiums result directly in lower premium       subsidies, and under a Section 1332 waiver, these savings       from lower premiums may be used to provide additional       reinsurance.        In our modeling, we are presuming that states will take       advantage of these pass-through savings in 2019. In reality,       states that have not already begun working on a waiver will       be challenged to get a 1332 waiver  [[Page S1913]]       filed and approved under the current regulatory regime in       time to impact 2019 premiums. The current regulatory regime       includes a requirement that a state enact enabling       legislation, develop an application, hold public hearings       during a 30-day public comment period, and submit the       application to the US Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS       then undertakes a two-step review process that can span up to       225 days--up to 45 days for a completeness determination       followed by up to 180 days for review. But even those states       unable to get a waiver in place for 2019 would still benefit       from that year's federal fallback program.        Therefore, we estimate, under the assumptions described       above, that an additional 3.2 million people will be covered       in the non-group market, and the proposal would result in       premiums that are at least 40 percent lower than they would       have been without the proposal in place, across all metal       levels. In those states that are not able to obtain a 1332       waiver and take advantage of pass-through savings for 2019,       we estimate that premium would decline by more than 20       percent across all metal levels. Those estimates include an       average 10 percent reduction due to the funding of CSRs, with       the remaining reduction coming from the reinsurance program.        As a note, our modeling reflects elimination of the mandate       penalty, but does not consider the proposed regulation's       likely effects on association health plans or on short-term,       limited duration coverage.     Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office  estimate looks at this proposal two different ways, but it says that if  we base it on real spending--that is, as if Congress actually passed  this bill--the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal that reduces  insurance rates 40 percent saves the Federal taxpayer money. In other  words, it doesn't cost anything.   As a U.S. Senator who came here to get results, who enjoys more than  anything working across party lines to cause that to happen--because it  takes 60 to get a result--who admires Senators like Senator Collins,  who spends her time doing that, I am very disappointed, not just for  me, not just for Senator Collins, who has spent hundreds of hours on  this, not just for the Senate as an institution, but I think of people  who come up to me like Marty at the Chick-fil-A, who said: I was paying  $300 a month, and now I am paying $1,300 a month. I can't afford it; I  am a farmer.   I said: I have a Christmas present for you. And then I thought, well,  I have a Valentine's present for you, and then I thought maybe I could  say I have an Easter present for you, and now I can say I can't do  it because the Democratic Party voted to put the Hyde protection on  more than 100 programs today--as it has done every year since 1976--but  it refused to put the Hyde protection on a 40-percent rate decrease  that was developed across party lines, in long hearings that were  attended by more than half the Senators--all of them coming in and  saying: Oh, this is a wonderful thing.    They came up to me and said: Chairman Alexander, this is so good. We  wish the Senate would act like this more. We like the fact that you are  having open hearings. Democrats are coming. You are letting us all come  without being a member of the committee.   Why are we not doing more of this? This is why we don't do more of  it. We come to a result. We come up to a partisan end that hurts  people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senator from Washington knows the  deep respect I have for her, and we have worked together on some  important legislation on our committee when we have had differences of  opinion, including on the 21st Century Cures legislation and No Child  Left Behind. Yet I have to say, with all due respect, the last 7 months  of working with the Senator and the Democrats on trying to fix the  Affordable Care Act, as they have asked us to do, has been the most  frustrating time in my 16 years in the Senate.   For example, she made three points.   One is that the Democrats were unhappy that we had reduced taxes and  repealed the individual mandate. We know they are unhappy about that,  and we know it raised individual rates somewhat, maybe as much as 10  percent. OK. That was last year. So what are we supposed to do--not  work to reduce rates? We continue to work to reduce rates.   According to the Oliver Wyman experts, the proposal Senator Collins  and I have put on the floor, which is basically a combination of  bipartisan proposals, would reduce rates by up to 40 percent, taking  into account what we did in the tax bill. The CBO, the Congressional  Budget Office, said it would reduce rates by up to 20 percent. That is  the first point.   I understand the Democrats don't like to cut taxes, and they don't  like to get rid of the individual mandate, which is a tax on a lot of  poor people, but they have to get over that at some point. If you think  it raised rates, let's cut rates. We have a proposal to cut rates on  plumbers and songwriters who pay for their own insurance by 40 percent.  So that is not a very good excuse for blocking this rate decrease.   The second thing is, the distinguished Senator from Washington said  the Collins-Alexander proposal interferes with preexisting condition.  It does not. Only someone who hasn't read the bill carefully could  think about that for a moment. I mean, we deliberately made sure the  proposal we would present would not disturb the essential health  benefits, which most of us would like to do, and most of them would  not. It does not change the preexisting condition requirement.   It does codify the proposals the President made on short-term  insurance, at the suggestion of the Democrats, who were afraid the  President might be able to do some things. What we were trying to do  was limit what he could do, to say the States have the responsibility,  and to make sure the consumers knew what they were buying. After all,  the short-term plans, which the Democrats don't like, can only be done  if States choose to do them. They were afraid the President might do  them, so we made sure he could not. So that is not an issue.   The third thing is in terms of the Hyde amendment. Now, the Hyde  amendment is a very simple amendment. Usually, when you oppose  something, you just stand up and say: Look, this is the reason I am  opposing it. You may disagree with me or you may not, but this is my  reason.   This is the only reason the Democrats are blocking this 40-percent  rate reduction. They have said so publicly and privately. That is it.  That is the only reason. They don't like applying the Hyde amendment to  health insurance in this bill. If they don't, fine. That is their  prerogative. I respect that. I don't question their motive, and I don't  question their right to do it. I would just like for them to stand up  and say that is what they are doing. Then they can explain to the  American people what sense that makes.   We have been working for 7 months to develop this proposal that  includes two parts. One is fundamentally the Alexander-Murray proposal  that Senator Schumer said every single Democrat would vote for, and the  other part is 3 years of reinsurance at $10 billion a year. That is it.  Those are bipartisan ideas. The only issue is, shall we also apply Hyde  to it?   What we have planned to do for the last several months is to put it  in this bill that we are voting on today, the omnibus bill, to which  the Hyde language has applied since 1976. What that means is, the Hyde  language is a compromise. It says you may not use Federal funds for  elective abortion, but it makes clear that States, individuals,  churches, and nonprofits may pay for elective abortions. That is the  compromise. We counted them up. The Hyde language applies to more than  100 Federal programs that the Democrats will be voting on today.   The Democrats will be voting today on applying the Hyde language to  the National Institutes of Health, but Senator Murray is saying they  can't apply it to a 40-percent health insurance rate reduction. They  will be voting to apply the Hyde language to community health centers,  but she is saying, no, they can't apply it to a 40-percent health  insurance rate reduction. They are going to be voting to apply it to  the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--that is for all of us  who get insurance, all the Federal employees--but that they can't apply  it to a health insurance rate reduction. We are going to apply it to  Federal family planning grants under title X, but for some reason, we  can't apply the same law to a health insurance rate reduction. I can go  down that list, as I did earlier, but I will not read the whole thing.  There is the VA, global health programs, the Ryan White school-based  health centers.   The Democrats have voted for Hyde protection hundreds of time. What  the Democrats are arguing is, when they had 60 Senators here and  President Obama and a Speaker of the House named Pelosi, they passed  the Affordable Care Act, and they watered down Hyde for the purposes of  the Affordable Care Act. They want that language. No Republican has  ever voted for that language in the Senate. The Democrats have voted  hundreds of time for Hyde.   How can we continue, how can we expect to make any progress in fixing  the Affordable Care Act if the Democrats will not apply the Hyde  language to any funding under it? I don't see any prospect for it.   I don't like the insinuation that I have walked away from anything.  Most of the Republicans are usually willing to work with the Democrats,  and I have spent hundreds of hours. I walked over to the Senator on the  night we failed on repeal and replace and said: Let's do something. We  had long discussions. We had hearings to which half the Senate came.  Everybody was just cheering. It was like going to summer camp. Why  don't we do more of this? So we did it, and we came up with something  the Democratic leader said everybody could vote for over there. Then  they got mad about the tax cut. OK. They can be mad but not forever,  maybe.   So we came up with a cure for that. We got a 40-percent rate  reduction despite what we did in the tax bill. All we want to do is to  apply to this health program the same health program that every  Democrat who votes for this bill  [[Page S1921]]  will be applying to every other health program today. If they will not  do that, how can they stand up and say they expect to make progress on  fixing the Affordable Care Act? I don't know any way to do it.   I am as willing as anybody to try to work things out here, but I am  no magician. I greatly respect the Senator from Washington and enjoy  working with her, but on this issue, I think we have reached an  impasse. They have yet to give us any language at all that applies to  the Hyde language. All of their suggestions are saying: We want to do  what we did when we had 60 Senators, a President of the United States,  and Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Well, they may want to, but that is the  one time that ever happened, and here we are today--with no one  objecting on the Democratic side.   I mean, should I offer an amendment to take the Hyde language out of  applying to the National Institutes of Health? Why don't they offer to  take it out of family planning grants under title X? That should be  just as offensive as applying the Hyde language to health insurance.   I don't understand this. They have been scrambling around all day.  The staff has been putting out memos. They are making up things. They  are misleading, and they are misreading. They are making excuses. There  is only one reason. They are blocking a 40-percent health insurance  rate decrease for the plumber who is making $60,000 and paying $20,000  for his insurance. We could cut that $20,000 insurance to $12,000 over  the next 3 years. That person is hurting, and the Democrats are  blocking that. They will say: We will apply Hyde to everything else but  not to the rate decrease for that plumber. I don't understand it, and I  don't see any way to make any progress on it as long as they take that  position.
