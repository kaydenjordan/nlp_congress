 Madam Speaker, as we prepare to consider the National  Defense Authorization Act, it is vital that we continue robust support  for the United States Navy's submarine program.   In recent years, we have seen that the world is still a dangerous  place. Authoritarian actors all across the world pose a threat to the  United States, to our democratic allies, and to peaceful people across  the world.   Against that backdrop, America's submarine fleet is one of the most  important advantages that we have in our vital work to make the world  safe for democracy. Vessels like the Virginia-class fast-attack  submarines and the upcoming Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines  are powerful and difficult for our enemies to detect. That makes them  an essential deterrent that keeps our would-be adversaries from  committing acts of aggression.   As we work on the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, it is  imperative that we continue to fund production of the Virginia- and  Columbia-class vessels at the Pentagon's recommended levels and that we  also invest in workforce training, housing, and additional support for  the thousands of tradesmen and -women in Rhode Island and across the  country who are building these ships.   In that spirit, I urge all of my colleagues to approve the amendment  that I have submitted to direct the Department of Defense to study and  implement strategies for expanding access to affordable housing for  tradesmen and -women involved in Navy shipbuilding.   President Franklin Roosevelt once said that for the world to be safe,  America must be an ``Arsenal of Democracy.'' Those words continue to be  true today, particularly when it comes to our vital naval submarine  program.                            ____________________
