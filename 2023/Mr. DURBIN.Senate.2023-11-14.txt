 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I  understand the concerns raised by my colleague from Kansas. I share  many of them. We have all seen the horrifying videos and  [[Page S5488]]  images, the scenes of death and destruction perpetrated by Hamas  terrorists from October 7--the deadliest single day for the Jewish  people since the Holocaust. We all know that return to the status quo  is unacceptable. So I support the Senator's sense of urgency that we  must get security aid to Israel as it seeks to defend itself.   As a former chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, it was  my privilege and honor to appropriate literally millions of dollars for  Iron Dome, the air defense which today protects Israel. I believe in  supporting our allies in France. In fact, I joined a quarter of my  colleagues in the Senate in a letter to President Biden just last week  with this very same message.   But I want to be clear. Many of my colleagues harken back in history  to the days of Munich and say we are stuck in that thinking. I would  say: Forget Munich for a moment. Think of the days of Moscow. Think of  this impromptu visit by the Hamas terrorists to Moscow to sit down with  Vladimir Putin. Coincidence? Just happened to be part of the travel  plan? No. Hamas had already attacked Israel. They were branded as a  terrorist group. Where did they go to find solace? Where did they go to  find a friend? They went to Moscow and Vladimir Putin. Why would we get  soft on Putin at this moment?   What is happening in Israel is a mirror of what is happening in  Ukraine--a tyrant, atrocious conduct, an unprovoked invasion of a  country, innocent people killed. That is the story in both places. Yet  the Republicans come to the floor today and say to us: We are only  concerned about one. We don't care about the NATO alliance and  supporting it further. We don't care about supporting Ukraine further.  We just want to help one of our allies.   I want to be clear. Just 2,000 miles north of Israel, there is  another country fighting for its survival in the face of a brutal  assault, also in need of sustained U.S. security assistance. That  country is Ukraine.   Two months ago, I imagine, my colleagues all joined me and others,  meeting in the Old Senate Chamber in a private, secret, confidential  meeting with the President of Ukraine. President Zelenskyy told us  without equivocation: Without the continued financial support of the  United States and NATO, we will lose this war. He didn't say that once;  he said it twice to make it abundantly clear. And now for the  Republicans to say that we will step aside and let the aid to Ukraine-- if it is ever going to come--come much later is to jeopardize their  future and to really make a mockery of the amazing display of courage  we have seen in Ukraine resisting the Russian aggression.   Just as Secretaries Austin and Blinken argued for emergency aid for  Israel before the Senate Appropriations Committee recently, they also  stressed the need for aid to Ukraine. Ukrainians have fought bravely,  stood up against Russian tyranny, with the United States, the European  Union, and countless other countries around the world standing with  them. We are the frontline of democracy in Ukraine, and to walk away  from Ukraine, as the Republicans are suggesting today, is a travesty.  To pull back now would be unconscionable, a reflection of an America no  longer being the world leader it purports to be, and a boon for  countries like Russia, China, and Iran, eager to fill the ensuing void.   Secretary Blinken said it plainly:         In both Israel and Ukraine, democracies are fighting       ruthless foes who are out to annihilate them.    Secretary Austin went further:         Today's battles against aggression and terrorism will       define global security for years to come.    The Republican suggestion today to walk away from assistance to  Ukraine would unfortunately lead us to that conclusion.         And only firm American leadership can ensure that the       tyrants, thugs and terrorists worldwide are not emboldened to       commit more aggression and more atrocities.    In addition to Israel and Ukraine, we must also remain steadfast in  addressing Chinese aggressions in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.   Let me say a word about humanitarian aid. One cannot look at the  scenes coming out of Gaza without realizing there are many thousands of  innocent victims, people who are not part of the terrorism of the Hamas  leadership, people simply trying to survive. The scenes coming from  hospitals on a daily basis are a reminder to us that there is a  desperate need for humanitarian aid.   Al-Shifa Hospital this morning displayed photographs of a dozen  infants who have been separated from their ventilators because the  electricity is off, and there is no water in the hospital.   To provide humanitarian aid to the helpless, guiltless victims in  this part of the world is consistent with the values of the United  States, and I support it without reservation. Humanitarian assistance  is not only the right thing to do, it will save lives. It will help  prevent the next conflict. It will serve as a downpayment on our own  security in the future.   I urge my colleagues to resist this effort by the Republicans to walk  away from Ukraine and to ignore the obvious consequences. The people of  Ukraine have shown extraordinary courage. I hope a majority in the  Senate will as well.   I yield to Senator Van Hollen.
