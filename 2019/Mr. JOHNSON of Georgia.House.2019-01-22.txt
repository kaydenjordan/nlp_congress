Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 439, a bipartisan bill  to update and modernize the Federal charter of the National FFA  Organization.   The FFA, formally known as the Future Farmers of America, is a  dynamic youth organization that uses agricultural education and  leadership training to promote the personal growth and career successes  of its members. With chapters in every State of the Union, its members  are the country's future chemists, veterinarians, government officials,  entrepreneurs, bankers, international business leaders, teachers, and  other professionals across a wide array of career fields.   The bill simply updates the FFA's charter to make it more consistent  with the modern organization and to provide additional flexibility as  it looks toward the future.   Among other things, the bill recognizes changes to the organization's  name. It modifies the organization's purpose to better reflect trends  in education and leadership training. It allows the FFA to publish  materials in electronic form rather than in printed form and provides  flexibility as to the location of the FFA's headquarters.   These are important changes to the existing charter that will help  the FFA better carry out its mission for years to come. I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 439.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to  acknowledge the leadership and commitment of my colleagues,  Jim  Langevin of Rhode Island and Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, for  working together on a bipartisan bill to fashion this bill.   I support H.R. 439 even more after listening to the comments of my  fellow Georgian about his daughter and the assistance and care that  this organization has rendered to her and probably countless others  even in more need of their support.   So, Mr. Speaker, I support organizations such as FFA. I support this  legislation, I ask my colleagues to support it too, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 498) to eliminate unused sections of the United  States Code, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 498         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Up the Code Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. REPEALS.

(e) Table of Sections for Chapter 93.--The table of       sections for chapter 93 of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by striking the item relating to section 1921.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 498, the Clean Up the Code  Act. I support this measure because it represents a small yet  meaningful step toward addressing the problem of over-criminalization.  H.R. 498 repeals several criminal penalties for violations that do not  involve serious wrongdoing, at least not serious enough to warrant  criminal prosecution or the consequences of a criminal record.   Specifically, the bill decriminalizes the transportation of water  hyacinths, the unauthorized application of theft prevention decals or  devices, and the unauthorized use of the 4-H Club emblem; the Swiss  Confederation coat of arms; the ``Smokey Bear'' character or name; the  ``Woodsy Owl'' character, name, or slogan; or the ``Golden Eagle  Insignia.''   The conduct that these laws are designed to deter or punish simply  does not merit criminal sanctions. This bill repeals a number of these  obscure and unnecessary criminal provisions. Criminal penalties should  be reserved to deter offenses that jeopardize public safety or as  punishment for serious moral transgressions. Such penalties should not  be used to punish minor transgressions or to discourage behavior deemed  unwanted but ultimately harmless to the greater public good. Therefore,  while H.R. 498 is a modest step toward addressing the problem of over- criminalization, I support its adoption by the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the efforts of my colleague,  Representative   Steve Chabot, who is the author of this measure and  who shepherded it to House passage last year with 385 votes in favor. I  was the lead cosponsor of the bill last Congress, and I am pleased  again to serve in that role for this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it today,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how many  additional speakers my friend from Georgia foresees?    Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, I see that my  dear colleague,  Jim Langevin, has arrived. He is the sponsor of H.R.  439 which is the Future Farmers of America charter revision bill. He is  the sponsor of that bill. He was on his way from the airport. His  flight was delayed, but he is here now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, while I do not believe Federal  prosecutors are neglecting the pursuit of  [[Page H970]]  serious criminals by bringing charges under Criminal Code provisions  that H.R. 498 would repeal, this bill serves as an important reminder  that Congress should be careful not to enact new criminal penalties  when they are not warranted.   We must resist overcriminalization, which fosters disrespect for the  seriousness of the law and leads to collateral consequences for  offenders that are often catastrophic to them and their ability to  function in and contribute to their communities.   It is my hope that, in this new Congress, we will be able to work on  a bipartisan basis to expand our efforts to make our criminal justice  system more fair and, thereby, also more effective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
