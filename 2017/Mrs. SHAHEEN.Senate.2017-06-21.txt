 Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues on the floor  this afternoon because I share their concerns about what will happen to  women's healthcare. I am concerned about what will happen to everyone's  healthcare, but particularly this afternoon we are talking about our  concerns with respect to healthcare for women.   If the Senate passes legislation like the House passed recently--the  American Health Care Act--that legislation has been widely described as  cruel and poorly crafted. Just last week, President Trump described it  simply as mean. Republican leaders in the Senate are now writing a  companion bill that reportedly makes mostly cosmetic changes to the  House bill. By some accounts, it would make the House bill even more  extreme.   Obviously, any legislation that, by design, takes health insurance  away from tens of millions of Americans, I believe, is deeply  misguided. I am particularly concerned about the harmful effects this  legislation would have on women's health. Indeed, I received countless  emails and letters from women who are offended that, once again,  powerful men are meeting behind closed doors to make critical decisions  regarding women's health, and we have been excluded from the room.   This Republican bill would take us back to the days before the  Affordable Care Act, when insurers could charge women more just for  being women, with no other reason needed. It would take away the  Federal protections against discrimination based on preexisting  conditions. Bear in mind, some of these conditions apply mostly or  exclusively to women.   In the days before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies  treated pregnancies, sexual assault, domestic violence, and cesarean  sections as preexisting conditions. Insurers routinely charged higher  premiums to women with these ``preexisting conditions'' or they denied  coverage all together. For example, more than 30 percent of mothers  have a cesarean section. Once again, if this House-passed bill passes,  and if we see something out of the Senate that does the same, women  would face discrimination, mothers would face discrimination from  insurance companies.   The American Health Care Act would also harm women by allowing  insurers to opt out of the 10 essential health benefits that all  insurance plans must cover under the Affordable Care Act. These  benefits are called essential because that is exactly what they are.  They are essential, not only to good health but, in some cases, to  actually staying alive. A number of these essential health benefits  apply exclusively to women, including contraception, maternity and  newborn care, mammograms, and cervical cancer screenings.   Several months ago on Facebook, I asked people across New Hampshire  to tell me their stories--stories about how the Affordable Care Act has  made lifesaving difference or otherwise improved their lives. I heard  from many women across New Hampshire who have written about how the  Affordable Care Act has ended discrimination against them by the health  insurance industry because of their gender. In particular, they are  grateful that the Affordable Care Act includes maternity care and  contraception.   This is a picture of Maura Fay, of Exeter, NH. She writes:         My husband and I are self-employed. Before the ACA we were       paying rates that were simply unsustainable for a middle-      class family like ours. When I was pregnant in 2013, we were       forced to pay a maternity rider of an additional $822 a       month.    That is in addition to her premium. She says:         I'm worried about the rollbacks in regulations around       Essential Health Benefits, especially since so many of them       impact women. Maternity coverage shouldn't come with an       additional $800 a month price tag.    Well, I appreciate that letter from Maura, but I am worried she may  actually be underestimating the cost of maternity care coverage if the  Affordable Care Act is repealed. According to one analysis, women who  seek maternity care under the American Health Care Act--the legislation  passed by the House--could pay up to $17,000 in surcharges to their  insurance company.   The American Health Care Act that the House passed also makes  draconian cuts to Medicaid, and this will disproportionately harm  women--nearly 40 million women--who make up the majority of Medicaid  beneficiaries. Medicaid provides healthcare for nearly half of all  pregnant women in the United States, supporting them through their  pregnancies and ensuring that their babies get a healthy start in life.  This coverage is directly threatened by the Republican legislation.   The American Health Care Act the House passed, if we combine that  with the administration's budget proposal, it would cut Medicaid by a  staggering $1.4 trillion by the year 2027--so, in 10 years, a $1.4  trillion cut. This would reduce Medicaid funding by nearly half and  mean that tens of millions of people would lose coverage, including  many women of reproductive age.    Let me also point out that both the American Health Care Act passed  by the House and the President's budget terminate all Federal funding  for Planned Parenthood, and we just heard Senator Blumenthal speak  eloquently about the importance of Planned Parenthood. This would leave  millions of  [[Page S3695]]  women and families with fewer healthcare options. In New Hampshire, it  would mean that between 12,000 and 13,000 women and men would lose  access to basic primary and preventive health services, including  lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.   According to poll after poll, the American people all across the  political spectrum strongly support Planned Parenthood and oppose  efforts to defund it. Despite efforts by Republican leaders in the  House and Senate to misrepresent the facts, Planned Parenthood does not  use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Indeed, Federal law expressly  forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions except under  extremely narrow circumstances that have been agreed to by Congress, so  the real issue here is not abortion. This is about ensuring that  American women have access to the basic healthcare they need where they  want to receive it. Remember that Planned Parenthood plays an  especially important role in delivering essential health services to  low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable individuals, including in rural  areas.   Earlier this year I received a letter from Samantha Fox of Bow, NH,  and she writes:         In 2007, I was a 19-year-old just barely starting out when       I was denied health insurance due to a preexisting condition.       Had I been able to access affordable coverage, my preexisting       condition, a reproductive system disorder, would have been       easily manageable. . . . [A]t that time, I was able to access       care through Planned Parenthood which likely preserved my       ability to conceive in the future. Flash forward 10 years: I       am expecting my first child and I have coverage which, thanks       to the Affordable Care Act, includes prenatal care.    Now, here in Washington, some people think that repealing the  Affordable Care Act is all about politics and notching a win on their  scoreboard. But for ordinary people in New Hampshire and across the  country, including millions of women, repealing the Affordable Care Act  isn't about politics, it is about life and death. We need to listen to  the women and men in each of our States whose lives and finances would  be turned upside down if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.   Furthermore, it is just wrong to exclude women, to exclude their  colleagues, to exclude Democrats, to exclude the public and to pursue a  strictly partisan approach to healthcare--the same approach that  produced a terrible bill in the House. And it is deeply misguided to  bring legislation to the floor that we all know would hurt tens of  millions of Americans and do particular harm to women.   There is a better way forward in the Senate. Let's put ideology and  partisanship aside. Let's work together. Let's strengthen the elements  of the Affordable Care Act that are working in the real world,  including Medicaid expansion, and let's fix what is not working. It  doesn't matter what we call this. It doesn't have to be called  ObamaCare. We can call it whatever we want. The important thing is to  have legislation that would provide access to healthcare for Americans,  healthcare they can afford, that is quality, that is there when people  need it. This is what the great majority of the American people want us  to do. It is time now to respect their wishes. Let's strengthen the  Affordable Care Act so that it works even better for all Americans.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
