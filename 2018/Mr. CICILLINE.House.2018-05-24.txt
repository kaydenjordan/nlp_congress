 Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised to drain the  swamp. In reality, he has made corruption much worse here in  Washington.   Yesterday, we learned that a foreign government paid the President's  personal attorney $400,000 for a meeting with President Trump; the  Secretary of the Treasury requested a government plane for his  honeymoon; the VA Secretary took a $125,000 taxpayer-funded trip to  Europe with his spouse; and the Republicans who control Congress have  done nothing about it. They are putting politics ahead of our country  by turning a blind eye to this administration's corruption, and they  are focusing on getting things done for their wealthy donors instead of  their constituents.   The culture of corruption must end. That is why, early this week,  Democrats introduced A Better Deal for our democracy: a bold,  comprehensive proposal to bolster our Nation's ethics laws, overhaul  our campaign finance system, and create more transparency and  accountability so government works for all of the American people.   That is the Better Deal the American people deserve; that is the  Better Deal Democrats will deliver; and that is why Democrats are  fighting for it.                            ____________________
