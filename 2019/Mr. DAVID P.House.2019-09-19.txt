 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  my friend, Gary Mabrey, for his retirement after 30 years of service as  the CEO and president of the chamber of commerce serving Johnson City-- my hometown--Jonesborough, and Washington County, Tennessee.   After joining the Air Force during the Vietnam war, Gary returned to  northeast Tennessee to continue serving his community. After earning a  master's degree in city management from East Tennessee State  University, he spent 10 years training government officials before  joining the chamber of commerce.   As CEO and president of the chamber, Gary worked tirelessly to  strengthen the economy of northeast  [[Page H7782]]  Tennessee. He attracted new businesses and supported the existing ones.  He promoted education, local colleges, and regional charities. Gary's  leadership was recognized when he was named to the U.S. Chamber  national board.   Mr. Speaker, I am blessed to call Gary Mabrey my friend. I thank Gary  for his service to our community during his tenure with the chamber,  and I wish Gary and his beautiful wife, Jackie, all the best in their  new retired life.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to offer my condolences to the Clyburn family.                            ____________________
