 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3710) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  provide for the remediation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3710         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cybersecurity Vulnerability       Remediation Act''.       SEC. 2. CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES.         Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       659) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (B) by redesignating paragraph (6) as paragraph (7); and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following new       paragraph:        ``(6) the term `cybersecurity vulnerability' has the       meaning given the term `security vulnerability' in section       102 of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (6       U.S.C. 1501); and''.        (2) in subsection (c)--        (A) in paragraph (5)--        (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (ii) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C);        (iii) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new       subparagraph:        ``(B) sharing mitigation protocols to counter cybersecurity       vulnerabilities pursuant to subsection (n); and''; and        (iv) in subparagraph (C), as so redesignated, by inserting       ``and mitigation protocols to counter cybersecurity       vulnerabilities in accordance with subparagraph (B)'' before       ``with Federal'';        (B) in paragraph (7)(C), by striking ``sharing'' and       inserting ``share''; and        (C) in paragraph (9), by inserting ``mitigation protocols       to counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities,'' after       ``measures,'';        (3) in subsection (e)(1)(G), by striking the semicolon       after ``and'' at the end; and        (4) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(n) Protocols To Counter Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities.--      The Director may, as appropriate, identify, develop, and       disseminate actionable protocols to mitigate cybersecurity       vulnerabilities, including in circumstances in which such       vulnerabilities exist because software or hardware is no       longer supported by a vendor.''.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES.         (a) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Cybersecurity and       Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland       Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on       how the Agency carries out subsection (m) of section 2209 of       the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to coordinate vulnerability       disclosures, including disclosures of cybersecurity       vulnerabilities (as such term is defined in such section),       and subsection (n) of such section (as added by section 2) to       disseminate actionable protocols to mitigate cybersecurity       vulnerabilities, that includes the following:        (1) A description of the policies and procedures relating       to the coordination of vulnerability disclosures.

(b) Form.--The report required under subsection (b) shall       be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a       classified annex.       SEC. 4. COMPETITION RELATING TO CYBERSECURITY                     VULNERABILITIES.         The Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the       Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the       Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security       Agency of the Department, may establish an incentive-based       program that allows industry, individuals, academia, and       others to compete in providing remediation solutions for       cybersecurity vulnerabilities (as such term is defined in       section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended       by section 2).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3710, the Cybersecurity  Vulnerability Remediation Act, and I thank Chairman Bennie Thompson for  his work in securing the Nation against terrorist threats, including  cybersecurity vulnerabilities that target critical infrastructure,  civilian agency networks, and private-sector cyber resources.   I also thank subcommittee Chairman Richmond and the Committee on  Homeland Security staff for working with my staff and me on H.R. 3710.   I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Rogers from  Alabama, and the ranking member of the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, we saw technology in the form of  drones be utilized to attack, with explosives, refineries in Saudi  Arabia. I think the basis of my legislation speaks to the point that it  is crucial that this Congress and this Nation prepare itself for new  forms of technology.   We have not had that incident here in the United States, but if we  recall, in 9/11, no one could fathom using loaded airplanes, fully  filled with the material, fuel, that could be utilized as a weapon to  attack the World Trade Center, to kill the brave at the Pentagon and  the brave in Pennsylvania.   H.R. 3710 is to speak to those vulnerabilities, in particular,  cybersecurity vulnerability remediation, which directs the DHS to  prioritize efforts to help network operators address known  vulnerabilities.   It requires DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to  widely share mitigation protocols that counter cybersecurity  vulnerabilities, authorizing the DHS Science and Technology Directorate  to establish an incentive-based program to allow industry, individuals,  agencies, and academia to compete in providing remediation solutions  for the highest priority cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   We must be ever vigilant and diligent as we look to these new levels  and subsets of technology. It requires the CISA to report to Congress  on its efforts to share mitigation protocols and coordinate  vulnerability disclosure with its partners.   H.R. 3710 authorizes, for the first time, the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency to develop and distribute playbooks, in  consultation with private-sector experts, to provide procedures and  mitigation strategies for the most critical known vulnerabilities,  especially those affecting software or hardware that is no longer  supported by a vendor.   One of the statistics that we really know is that 80 percent--maybe  even higher now--to 85 percent of the Nation's vulnerabilities-- technology, infrastructure--is in the private sector. Those are the  sites that our enemies would look eagerly to attack. The World Trade  Center; in Saudi, the refineries; maybe some of our beautiful national  monuments, outstanding sites here in Washington, D.C.; our national  parks, these are the examples and the exhibits of the freedom of this  Nation. Those are some government, some private sector.  [[Page H8014]]    Many know the terror that New York collectively faced, but there are  other sites along the West Coast, in the Midwest, and in the Deep South  that would also exhibit what the freedom of America is all about.   The playbooks that we would make available to Federal agencies,  industry, and other stakeholders would help them prepare a network  defense in the event of a cyberattack based upon vulnerability. I would  like to think that we could prevent that attack.   A zero-day vulnerability is a software bug or exploit that has not  been patched. Hackers can use these bugs and exploits based upon the  vulnerability to steal data or damage networks before a patch can be  developed to prevent a breach.   There are some vulnerabilities that cannot be patched. These require  the resources provided by the playbook that will be provided in my  bill.   H.R. 3710 authorizes the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, in  consultation with CISA, to establish a competition program for  industry, individuals, academia, and others to provide remediation  solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are no longer  supported.   The good news is that it seeks to have the consultation of Americans  who have expertise and to be able to work with them to provide the  remediation but also the playbook for prevention.   The vulnerabilities that will receive an entry in the playbook are  serious and, if used by an adversary, can lead to significant costs and  disruption of vital goods and services to the public. Just think of  your water system, run mostly by local entities, or the electric grid,  run mostly by the private sector.   In the 115th Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act, which addresses the Federal Government's  sharing of cyber vulnerability disclosures to critical infrastructure  owners and operators. H.R. 3710 goes further to address the remediation  of identified cybersecurity threats by incentivizing work to patch or  find solutions for cyber threats inherent in legacy systems.   Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen,  maintain, and secure critical infrastructure, including assets that are  vital to public confidence in the cyber nation's safety.   I hope that we will see our way forward in getting proactive and  preventative as we move toward new levels of technology.   Mr. Speaker I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 3710, the  ``Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act.''   I thank Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for his work in securing the  nation against terrorist threats, including cybersecurity  vulnerabilities that target critical infrastructure, civilian agency  networks, and private sector cyber resources.   I thank Subcommittee Chairman Richmond and the Homeland Security  Committee staff for working with me and my staff on H.R. 3710.   H.R. 3710, the ``Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act''  directs DHS to prioritize efforts to help network operators address  known vulnerabilities by:   1. Requiring DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) to widely share mitigation protocols to counter cybersecurity  vulnerabilities;   2. Authorizing the DHS Science and Technology Directorate to  establish an incentive-based program to allow industry, individuals,  agencies, and academia to compete in providing remediation solutions  for the highest priority cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and   3. Requiring CISA to report to Congress on its efforts to share  mitigation protocols and coordinate vulnerability disclosures with its  partners.   H.R. 3710, authorizes for the first time the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Agency (CISA) to develop and distribute ``playbooks,''  in consultation with private sector experts, to provide procedures and  mitigation strategies for the most critical, known vulnerabilities,  especially those affecting software or hardware that is no longer  supported by a vendor.   The playbooks would be available to Federal agencies, industry, and  other stakeholders to help them prepare network defense in the event of  a cyber-attack based upon a vulnerability.   A zero-day vulnerability is a software bug or exploit that has not  been patched.   Hackers can use these bugs and exploits based upon the vulnerability  to steal data or damage networks before a patch can be developed to  prevent a breach.   There are some vulnerabilities that cannot be patched and these  require the resources provided by the Playbook that will be provided by  this bill.   H.R. 3710 authorizes DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), in  consultation with CISA, to establish a competition program for  industry, individuals, academia, and others to provide remediation  solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are no longer  supported.   The vulnerabilities that will receive entry into the Playbook are  serious and if used by an advisory, can lead to significant cost and  disruption of vital goods and services to the public.   In the 115th Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act, which addresses the federal government's  sharing of cyber vulnerability disclosures to critical infrastructure  owners and operators.   H.R. 3710 goes further to address the remediation of identified  cybersecurity threats by incentivizing work to patch or find solutions  for cyber threats inherent in legacy systems.   Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen and  maintain secure critical infrastructure, including assets that are  vital to public confidence in the cyber nation's safety.   This bill supports the ongoing work of the Department of Homeland  Security in security civilian agency and coordinating with private  sector computing network owners and operators.   Most people do not know how long the federal government has used  computing to carry out vital functions in service of the public.   The Federal government's first use of computing technology occurred  in 1890 when an automated tabulation method was used to organize that  year's census data encoded on punch cards.   Since that modest beginning in 1890, the Federal government has  blazed a path for adoption of computing technology throughout the  federal government, which established an unprecedented pace for  innovation in the private sector that transformed our world from  analogue to digital in 129 years.   One of the consequences of federal government's use of computing  technology over the last 129 years are the challenges of operating  legacy systems that use outdated software, which cannot be quickly  upgraded to eliminate known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   Federal government offices are vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the  number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more  than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.   In 2015, a hacker exploited access provided by a government agency  contractor to break into government databases to gain access to 22  million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel  Management.   In 2017, Federal agencies reported more than 35,000 cyber incidents,  some of which targeted old operating systems that were no longer  supported by a vendor.   According to the National Security Agency, it has not responded to a  zero-day attack on government systems in the last four years, largely  because hackers have found better success through basic attack methods.   H.R. 3710 will provide much needed structure around a federal  government wide effort to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities in  federal civilian agency networks.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3710.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me further explain what this bill does.   This bill supports the ongoing work of the Department of Homeland  Security and security civilian agency and coordinating with private- sector computing network owners and operators.   Most people do not know how long the Federal Government has used  computing to carry out vital functions in service of the public. The  Federal Government's first use of computing technology occurred as long  ago as 1890,  [[Page H8015]]  when an automated tabulation method was used to organize that year's  Census data encoded on punch cards.   Let me remind our colleagues that we are about to venture on to  Census now. Imagine a cyberattack on that process.   Since a modest beginning in 1890, the Federal Government has blazed a  path for adoption of computing technology throughout the Federal  Government, which established an unprecedented pace for innovation in  the private sector that transformed our world from analog to digital in  129 years.   One of the consequences of the Federal Government's use of computing  technology over the last 129 years is the challenges of operating  legacy systems that use outdated software, which cannot be quickly  upgraded to eliminate known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   Federal Government offices are vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the  number of cyber incidents reported by Federal agencies increasing more  than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.   In 2015, a hacker exploited access by a government agency contractor  to break into the government databases to gain access to 22 million  security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.   In 2017, Federal agencies reported more than 35,000 cyber incidents,  some of which targeted old operating systems that were no longer  supported by a vendor.   According to the National Security Agency, it has not responded to a  zero-day attack on government systems in the last 4 years because  hackers have found better success through basic attack methods.   I would hope my colleagues would consider recognizing that we must be  in front of these potential attacks and not behind them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minority for its  support of this legislation and ask my colleagues to support it.   As I do so, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article, ``DHS  Flags Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Philips Patient Monitors: The  Department of Homeland Security has issued an advisory about  cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the wireless local area network  modules of Philips IntelliVue portable patient monitors.''                              [Sept. 13, 2019]    DHS Flags Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Philips Patient Monitors      The Department of Homeland Security has Issued an Advisory About     Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in the Wireless Local Area Network          Modules of Philips IntelliVue Portable Patient Monitors                             (By Fred Donovan)         The Department of Homeland Security has issued (https:// www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsma-19-255-01) an advisory       about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the wireless local       area network (WLAN) modules of certain Philips IntelliVue       portable patient monitors.        DHS's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response       Team (ICS-CERT) warned that an attacker could corrupt the       IntelliVue WLAN firmware and alter the data flow over to the       patient monitor, causing an inoperative condition alert at       the device and central station.        The vulnerable patient monitors are IntelliVue MP monitors       MP20-MP90, MP5/5SC, MP2/X2, and MX800/700/600.        The vulnerabilities include use of hard-coded password and       download of code without integrity check.        The use of a hard-coded password makes it easier for an       attacker to guess the password and login via FTP and upload       malicious firmware. In addition, the ``product downloads       source code or an executable from a remote location and       executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin       and integrity of the code,'' warned the advisory.        Shawn Loveric of Finite State reported the vulnerabilities       to Philips.        In a product security advisory (https:// www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/about/customer-support/ product-security), Philips recommended that users of the       affected IntelliVue patient monitors update to the WLAN       Module Version C wireless module with current firmware.        Philips said it will also issue a software patch for WLAN       Version A that will be available by the end of 2019, while       WLAN Version B is obsolete.        ``Wireless network access should be controlled by       authentication and authorization (e.g. WPA2), which are       supported by Philips. Additional mitigations include       implementing a firewall rule on the customer wireless       network, and further controls on physical access to the       system,'' Philips advised.        Philips said it had received no reports of patient harm.       Its analysis judged that it is unlikely that the       cybersecurity vulnerability would impact clinical use, due to       mitigating controls in place. To date, Philips has received       no complaints involving clinical use that it has been able to       associate with the vulnerability or evidence of patient       identifiers compromised.        DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency       recommended users of the vulnerable Philips devices take       defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of       these vulnerabilities. Users should restrict system access to       authorized personnel and follow a least privilege approach,       apply defense-in-depth strategies, and disable unnecessary       accounts and services.     With that in mind, this is a real-life example of  what can happen if we are not first in front.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting for  H.R. 3710, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2589) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish a homeland intelligence doctrine for the Department of  Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Unifying DHS Intelligence       Enterprise Act''.       SEC. 2. HOMELAND INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE.         (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 210H. HOMELAND INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, acting       through the Chief Intelligence Officer of the Department, in       coordination with intelligence components of the Department,       the Office of the General Counsel, the Privacy Office, and       the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, shall       develop and disseminate written Department-wide guidance for       the processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of       homeland security information (as such term is defined in       section 892) and terrorism information (as such term is       defined in section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and       Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 U.S.C. 485)).        ``(b) Contents.--The guidance required under subsection (a)       shall, at a minimum, include the following:        ``(1) A description of guiding principles and purposes of       the Department's intelligence enterprise.        ``(2) A summary of the roles, responsibilities, and       programs of each intelligence component of the Department in       the processing, analysis, production, or dissemination of       homeland security information and terrorism information,       including relevant authorities and restrictions applicable to       each such intelligence component.        ``(3) Guidance for the processing, analysis, and production       of such information.        ``(4) Guidance for the dissemination of such information,       including within the Department, among and between Federal       departments and agencies, among and between State, local,       Tribal, and territorial governments, including law       enforcement, and with foreign partners and the private       sector, consistent with the protection of privacy, civil       rights, and civil liberties.        ``(5) A description of how the dissemination to the       intelligence community (as such term is defined in section       3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.       3003(4))) and Federal law enforcement of such information       assists such entities in carrying out their respective       missions.        ``(c) Form.--The guidance required under subsection (a)       shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a       classified annex.        ``(d) Annual Review.--For each of the five fiscal years       beginning with the first fiscal year that begins after the       date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall       conduct a review of the guidance required under subsection       (a) and, as appropriate, revise such guidance.''.

SEC. 4. ANALYSTS FOR THE CHIEF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.         Paragraph (1) of section 201(e) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121(e)) is amended by adding at the end       the following new sentence: ``The Secretary shall also       provide the Chief Intelligence Officer with a staff having       appropriate expertise and experience to assist the Chief       Intelligence Officer.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2589, the Unifying DHS  Intelligence Enterprise Act.   H.R. 2589 seeks to improve the Department of Homeland Security's  intelligence enterprise by ensuring intelligence officers across DHS  are sharing information and countering threats in a unified manner.   Since the Department was established, intelligence and information  sharing capabilities have matured, but DHS still lacks a coordinated  intelligence enterprise.   In 2016, the Committee on Homeland Security released a comprehensive  review of the Department of Homeland Security's use of intelligence to  counter terrorist threats and prescribed 30 recommendations.   As a result, this bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security,  through a DHS chief intelligence officer, to develop and disseminate  written DHS-wide guidance for the processing, analysis, production, and  dissemination of Homeland Security and terrorism information, and  ensures this guidance is consistent with the protection of privacy,  civil rights, and civil liberties.   Given the diversity of missions across the Department, it is vital  that component intelligence officers are working together, sharing  information, and vetting that information against the broader U.S.  intelligence community holdings.   H.R. 2589 requires an assessment and description of how the  dissemination of information to the intelligence community and Federal  law enforcement assists such entities in carrying out their respective  missions.   One of the key missions of DHS is to act as a clearinghouse for  threat information, and this bill will ensure that the Department  continues to evolve into a better, more effective asset in responding  to threats to the homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2589, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) for his  service, and I thank him for this legislation.   It is worth noting that the bill that we just passed and the bill  that we are now debating specifically dealing with cybersecurity and  intelligence are crucial elements of our security.   I think that with the combination of recognizing the importance of  the intelligence community that is on the front lines of providing our  safety and then acknowledging the vulnerabilities in the cyber system  as one of the components of new technology, I started out my remarks by  taking note of the drone attack on the refineries in Saudi  [[Page H8017]]  Arabia. Here we are talking about cyber and its impact.   But I think the overall sense of these two initiatives is to ensure  that we in Homeland Security are on the front end of dealing with the  importance of securing this Nation on the new technologies that we are  facing every single day.   I ask my colleagues to support the underlying legislation.   I include in the Record the following articles on this very topic:  ``Thousands of Vulnerabilities in Seattle's IT Network Attributed to  Siloed Approach to Cybersecurity,'' September 17, 2019; ``Leader of New  NSA Cybersecurity Directorate Outlines Threats, Objectives,'' dated  September 5, 2019; and then, August 30, 2019, ``Why Focusing on Threat  Hunting May Leave You Vulnerable.''                            [September 17, 2019]    Thousands of Vulnerabilities in Seattle's IT Network Attributed to                      Siloed Approach to Cybersecurity                             (By David Kroman)         Last May, Seattle's head of information security flagged a       problem within the city's technology department: Because of a       process breakdown, employees were indicating that they had       fixed vulnerabilities in the department's computer network       when, in fact, they had not been fixed.        ``It has been discovered that there are currently over       21,000 known critical and high vulnerabilities on systems       throughout Seattle IT,'' Andrew Whitaker, then the       department's chief information security officer, wrote in a       May 22 email to technology leadership. ``Tickets have been       closed out, claiming to have vulnerabilities remediated, but       upon follow-up review they were, with a few exceptions, not       remediated.''        The result was that the servers, desktops and applications       within the newly consolidated Department of Information       Technology--which now handles the vast majority of the city       of Seattle's technology functions, from utilities to the fire       department--contained open miniportals that could be accessed       by would-be hackers.        When left unremediated, vulnerabilities provide possible       paths for hackers to plant spyware, ransomware, viruses and       other malicious software that can be immensely harmful to an       organization, especially one that provides critical services.       Cities are often particularly open to an attack and the       effect can be devastating, as recent ransom attacks in       Baltimore and Atlanta have shown.        Saad Bashir, Seattle's new head of the Department of       Information Technology, said in an interview that he believes       the vulnerabilities are manageable. He said Seattle is at       risk, as are all organizations, but, in general, not       abnormally so.        However, Bashir acknowledged the process breakdown was       indicative of a broader problem (https://crosscut.com/2017/ 07/at-city-hall-a-massive-department-is-mired-in-chaos) he       has been attempting to address within the organization since       taking his position earlier this year. ``What I observed very       early was that there was a siloed approach in how       cybersecurity was being practiced in the world of IT,'' he       said.        Because of a disconnect between teams, Bashir said, some       part of the security process would get completed, but would       not be properly handed off to the next team. ``If you're not       clear, then you may not know whether that particular       vulnerability management work has been completed the way it's       supposed to be completed,'' Bashir said.        In an effort to improve the processes within the       department, Bashir began a major reorganization of the       relatively new department--including his firing of 14       directors and managers (https://crosscut.com/2019/05/ seattles-new-it-boss-fires-14-directors-part-organizational-  change)--just two days before Whitaker's message. The       reorganization was not motivated solely by security       weaknesses, he said, but was intended to create a smoother       structure that would better catch possible entry points. When       asked if the city was safer from an attack since he took       over, Bashir said, ``Absolutely.''        Every organization contains some number of vulnerabilities.       The trick is to continually identify and address them as they       arise--an e-windshield wiper of sorts, where the       vulnerabilities are the raindrops.        Experts say hackers are increasingly less likely to gain       access through a vulnerability than they are through a       phishing expedition. In such cases, a deceiving email message       persuades employees to provide passwords or a malware-      infected USB drive is left in a parking lot in hopes that       someone finds it and plugs it in to their computer.        But addressing vulnerabilities in the city's systems       continues to be an important function of its IT department.        ``If I were a serious bad guy I'd be looking at the most       vulnerable place,'' said Dr. Barbara Endicott-Popovsky,       executive director of the Center for Information Assurance &       Cybersecurity at the University of Washington. ``I'd be       looking at cities and I'd be looking at universities, because       they're open and they can't afford the latest and greatest.       It's kind of like, `Open sesame.' ''        Mike Hamilton, founder of CI Security and Seattle's chief       information security officer from 2006 to 2013, said there       are a number of reasons cities struggle to stay ahead of       cyberattacks.        For one, the number of qualified security experts is down       across the country, he said. And of those who are on the       market, cities can't match the pay of large companies like       Amazon or Microsoft.        ``The ones that are good are in short supply, which means       that local governments cannot compete for those resources,''       he said.        Additionally, cities are responsible for the security of       all their departments, each of which may require vastly       different things. ``Because government is a federation of       agencies, that makes it a little difficult to have policies       in place that apply to [for example] the regulated industry       of human resources without raising the ire of unions,'' he       said.        Hamilton also said the biennial budgeting of local       government makes keeping up challenging. ``Technology moves a       whole lot freaking faster,'' he said.        All of this, Hamilton said, is in the context of extremely       high stakes. Compared with for-profit companies, ``the       potential impact [of an attack on government] is so much       greater and government can't afford it,'' said Hamilton. ``We       know something needs to be fixed, and we don't fix it until       something blows up.''        Bashir said the new processes he's put into place has made       him ``confident that we no longer have any glaring process       gaps.'' He couldn't say exactly how many vulnerabilities are       still open on city systems, but that it was less than 21,000.       The ideal number, Bashir said, is zero, but that's also       extremely unlikely, which makes it hard to identify what a       ``good'' number is.        ``I worry about all of them,'' said Andrew Cushman, the       city's new chief security officer. ``Whether that number is       21,000 or whether that number is 10 depends on the attacker       and how skilled that attacker is and how motivated that       attacker is. So I don't worry more because that number is       21,000, then I do if that number is 10.''        Going forward, Bashir said he wants ``to create a high       level of security awareness mindset across the       organization.'' The city could have zero vulnerabilities and       it wouldn't matter if one employee plugs in the wrong USB to       a work computer.        Hamilton said there are several easy things cities can do       that, while not offering total protection, would make it so       they are no longer ``the slowest gnu in the herd getting       picked off.'' For one, mandate zero personal use of city       equipment, something Singapore implemented in 2017.        Phishing attacks remain the easiest entry point for hackers       and so that's where the bulk of the city's attention should       focus, Hamilton said. Because no matter how many protections       are put into place, ``There is not now, nor will there ever       be, a firewall for stupid.''                                   ____                       [From CSO Online, Sept. 5, 2019]       Leader of new NSA Cybersecurity Directorate Outlines Threats,                                 Objectives                           (By Cynthia Brumfield)         Ransomware, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are the top       cybersecurity threats that will be the focus of a new       division within the National Security Agency (NSA), the       Cybersecurity Directorate, which is set to be operational on       October 1, according to NSA director of cybersecurity Anne       Neuberger. She was tapped in July by Director General Paul       Nakasone to head the group. The Directorate aims to bring the       agency's foreign intelligence and cyber operations together       and ``operationalize [its] threat intelligence, vulnerability       assessments and cyber defense expertise,'' the agency       announced when launching the new division.        ``NSA really had to up its game,'' Neuberger said in a       fireside chat with Niloofar Razi Howe, cybersecurity venture       investor and executive at the Billington Cybersecurity Summit       in Washington on September 4. ``And that's what drove this       desire to stand up a directorate and frankly to set a pretty       aggressive mission, which is to prevent and eradicate cyber       actors from national security systems and critical       infrastructure with a focus on the defense industrial base.''        In terms of the threats, ``Clearly ransomware is the focus.       We've seen there are roughly 4,000 ransomware attacks a       day,'' Neuberger said. ``When we look at Russia, we see a       country that uses influence operations, uses cyber [that is]       really integrated and below the level of armed conflict. They       also use entities who aren't necessarily tied to the       government, whether the Internet Research Agency for       potential elections influence or China has its own unique       approach to how the country uses cyber threats to achieve its       national security and military objectives, Neuberger said.       China's cyber threats are exemplified by three different and       wholly distinct types of operations: the 2015 theft of 21.5       million records from the Office of Personnel Management, the       hacking campaign known as Cloud Hopper that targeted eight of       the world's biggest technology service providers, and ongoing       theft of intellectual property such as when Chinese       intelligence and business insiders sought to steal       information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial       airliners.        Iran is very volatile and uses destructive attacks in its       own region primarily, Neuberger said. ``North Korea always       fascinates us as essentially a nation-state  [[Page H8018]]       criminal, as a country under sanctions using creative ways of       cyber, whether it's crypto currency, whether it's       cryptomining to gain hard currency and essentially keep the       regime afloat.''        Neuberger previously headed the agency's ``Russia Small       Group,'' a joint NSA-Cyber Command task force to combat       Russian election interference and influence campaigns. The       task force ``was stood up out of a realization that something       had dramatically changed and we had to reboot our approach as       a US government,'' Neuberger said.        ``Now influence operations have been around since the days       of Adam and Eve, but what really changed was the age of       social media,'' she said. Not only could an adversary send       out broad messaging, but it could also target disinformation       to particular ethnic groups, particular elements of a       country, and do it in a ``pretty cheap way ... looking as if       one is an American.''        ``So, we realized that it took a more creative approach to       protect our democracy. In the Russia Small Group, we worked       closely with the DHS and FBI to ensure that from a cyber       perspective they had all the threat information we had in a       way that can be quickly actionable'' Neuberger said. ``We're       tremendously proud of the work we did between NSA, Cyber       Command, DHS and the FBI to defend the integrity of our       elections and ensure that every American know that their vote       counted and their vote matters.,'' referring to the Russia       Small Group's efforts to protect the 2018 midterm elections.        When it comes to warding off 2020 election threats, the       Directorate will take the same approach the Russia Small       Group applied in the 2018 elections. ``Ensure there is threat       intelligence, gain those insights, share that intelligence,       and be prepared to impose costs on an adversary who may       attempt to influence our elections,'' Neuberger said. ``We       will do the same work that we did in 2018 looking to see who       are the actors seeking to shake confidence in the integrity       of our elections, and share that with the FBI.''        Ransomware has emerged as a bigger threat to the election       infrastructure than it has before. The recent shift       ransomware attackers have taken from targeting individuals to       targeting entities is ``certainly something that would make       it be a key concern for the elections. The best protection is       the same security advice we give: ensure one uses principles       of least privilege [and] computers with admin access       shouldn't have access to the Internet at all times.''        Partnering with other government agencies and private       sector companies and organizations will be a major focus of       the Directorate. ``Everything we do, we do in partnership       with other agencies, with allies around the world and       certainly the private sector plays a role,'' Neuberger said,       noting that she wants to unify all the various communities       involved in cybersecurity to enhance collaboration and focus       on the hardest cybersecurity problems.        ``Partners are key; they are the root of everything we can       accomplish,'' she said. Among the partners the Directorate       plans to include in its efforts are the Department of       Defense, Cyber Command, DHS, the acquisition community, U.S.       allies and certainly the private the sector. ``The private       sector is often the first indicator of a significant threat       or a significant compromise.''        The goal is to push out as much unclassified information as       possible and bring together all the elements that are needed       to quickly identify and head off threats. ``Ideally, we are       sharing the threat information to prevent an attack, to       prevent exploitation rather than being part of a team that       helps with incident response,'' Neuberger said.        Although the Directorate doesn't have a ``moonshot''       objective as it begins operations, one goal is to address the       ``rampant abuse of Internet infrastructure,'' Neuberger said,       particularly protecting the Domain Name System (DNS), the       naming system underlying the Internet which has been subject       to increasing attacks and redirections by malicious actors.        ``DNS is a key way that adversaries use for command and       control for exploitation,'' she said. Neuberger would like to       see efforts such as the UK's NCSC's Protective Domain Name       System, which was built to thwart the use of DNS for malware       distribution and operation, more widely used. The Directorate       can help by adding or contributing threat information to make       those services even more effective.        The Directorate can serve to interconnect these efforts so       they could communicate beyond internet transactions. ``If we       could achieve that, it would have even broader impact beyond       cybersecurity.''                                   ____                  [From Infosecurity Magazine] Aug. 30, 2019          Why Focusing on Threat Hunting May Leave You Vulnerable                              (By Bob Shaker)         The cybersecurity threat landscape is becoming increasingly       complex and crowded, and with security teams around the world       largely understaffed and facing burnout, experts are looking       for the most efficient way to combat cybercrime.        One approach that has gained significant momentum of late       is threat hunting--the proactive searching of threat       indicators within an environment to sniff out highly advanced       cyber threats. In threat hunting, security analysts search       their environment for known indicators of compromise (IoCs)       and adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)--if       any of these are found, there's a good chance that an attack       is underway.        While threat hunting is a key element of a robust       cybersecurity strategy, many organizations rely too heavily       on this approach. A narrow focus on specific IoCs and TTPs       paints an incomplete picture of the threat environment and       means that the attacks that don't bear these hallmarks will       get missed.        In this evolving threat landscape, enterprises can't just       rely on threat hunting to keep their environments secure--      they must broaden their cybersecurity approach, assessing       security environments in a more holistic way to better detect       advanced and stealth attacks.                   Why threat hunting has become so popular         Threat hunting has recently become a major buzzword in the       security industry in large part because it connotes a cooler,       more technical and more skilled approach to security. As a       result, security experts are gravitating toward it for       career-building opportunities and advancing their security       approach.        While threat hunting might be overhyped, there are also       genuine benefits to the practice (when done correctly) that       help explain why enterprises are so ready to adopt it. Threat       hunting helps refocus security teams on emerging threats,       since existing security technologies tend to address things       we already know about.        Actively looking for emerging threats can mean identifying       threats that might be lurking in the environment--reducing       dwell time and tackling threats before they escalate and turn       into full-blown security breaches.        In addition, adopting threat hunting tactics often leads to       discovering visibility gaps in your current security       approach--for example, your S3 buckets might not be       configured properly or perhaps some firewall rules got       changed, or maybe you're able to identify an employee or       group within your organization that is violating a security       policy. Uncovering these poorly managed security solutions is       a useful byproduct of threat hunting.                       The downfalls of threat hunting         However, many organizations rely too heavily on threat       hunting as they are unable to invest in the required       infrastructure, resources and expertise to continually       analyze all activity for possible threats. Often, this threat       hunting is provided by third-party security companies, as       many enterprises either lack the skills and resources       entirely or are only able dedicate their in-house teams to a       few days of threat hunting a year.        With the major talent gap facing cybersecurity, most       enterprises simply cannot find or afford to hire       professionals with the required level of expertise. As a       result, many are turning to managed services offered by       security companies to help close the gap. According to       Gartner, by 2024, 25% of organizations will be using MDR       services, up from less than 5% today.        Threat hunting services often focus almost exclusively on       threats posed by splashy, sexy attack groups--whether it is       notable criminal APTs or nation state groups. A strong       security program focuses on risk management, and one of the       most important things security teams can do is accurately       identify the risks that they are susceptible to, which for       many enterprises isn't a nation-state attack.        While threat-hunting addresses attacks that everyone is       talking about, the reality is that many enterprises should be       equally--if not more cognizant--of commodity threats. While       sophisticated threats exist and are important to defend       against through threat hunting, the majority of threats       facing enterprises are better addressed through good security       hygiene.        Over-investing in threat hunting can lead to an incomplete       and irregular picture of the risks enterprises face. In fact,       a singular reliance on threat hunting alone means that many       types of attacks will get missed if you're not specifically       looking for them.                          Taking a holistic approach         By over-rotating on big name threats, security teams leave       open the possibility that they are going to miss the obvious.       In this threat environment, security teams can't afford to       drop the ball on the basics--a recent ESG survey of       enterprise cybersecurity leaders revealed that more than       three-quarters (76%) believe that threat detection and       incident response is more difficult today than it was just       two years ago.        To ensure a strong security posture, enterprises should       take a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that goes beyond       threat hunting. As they build out a holistic approach, they       should be sure to:        Collect data on everything they can. Often when       investigating a breach or incident, security teams find that       they don't have any evidence because they aren't collecting       and retaining the right data--it's usually the exception when       there's sufficient logging for an incident. With living off       the land attacks increasing (many of which fly under the       radar of traditional logging), it's ever more important that       teams don't skimp on data collection, as relying on a mixture       of sources is more likely to help you detect threats early       and prevent bad actors from getting in unnoticed.        Use multiple security tools and strategies. We've recently       seen a trend toward new technologies like AI and machine       learning across security programs. It's important to layer       these tools and strategies as they each have their strengths       and weaknesses. To maximize effectiveness, use a mixture of       tools, methodologies and frameworks that integrate multiple       attack and adversary considerations such as MITRE ATT&CK as       well as  [[Page H8019]]       simple IOCs, rule-based detection, statistical models,       linguistic models, and machine learning models--and then       correlate with global threat intelligence, validating and       augmenting with human expertise.        Don't underestimate the importance of humans. The human       side of the investigation is critical. There is no better       computer for detecting, recognizing and responding to threats       than the human mind. While automated systems have helped       advance the security industry significantly, a true ``eyes on       glass'' approach to threat detection requires years of       experience and the corresponding intuition of knowing when       something is amiss.     Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the leadership  of the chairman, and I appreciate the ranking member on the floor.   I have had the privilege of traveling with Congresswoman Underwood to  the border in some very challenging circumstances, and I appreciated,  as a nurse, as a trained nurse, as she is a trained nurse, I  appreciated the astuteness with which she viewed this matter.   Let me say to my good friend, the doctor, we are always looking  forward to trying to work with our colleagues on the basic humanity of  every person, recognizing that this is not about healthcare for  undocumented immigrants. It is about individuals who are in the custody  of the United States.   Just picture for a moment, having gone to the border now for almost  two decades as a resident of Texas, just imagine that there are moments  when there is an influx of individuals fleeing for their lives. It  happened under President Obama's administration in 2014, and we managed  it. There was no hysteria. There were facilities that were built. There  was medical care that we were able to access.   In this instance, it did not happen. And the glaring reality of  children who died and those who were working hard, the law enforcement  personnel, I saw them trying to do as much as they could, but without a  structure, we lost lives. So the importance of this legislation is  particularly one that I think is important.   Picture for a moment, when we were in the midst of the crisis, Coast  Guard medical personnel, doctors with a table, some medicine on the  corner, their medical paraphernalia out in the open where files were,  no place to deal with the medical needs of anyone. That is not  American.   We are not asking to provide healthcare. This is not Medicare or  Medicaid. It is a basic dignity of protecting the American people by  ensuring that these people are treated for whatever might be necessary.   So the e-record process is powerful because it allows the accessing  of medical care by having a record system and also by having that  system being accessed by all DHS components operating on the border. It  is just a simple case of protecting those of us in the United States,  protecting those who are in our custody.   Why not? Why not be proactive and positive for dealing with fellow  human beings?   Let's get away from this undocumented and realize this is a land of  laws and immigrants. We all, collectively, together, want to abide by  that.   But we also realize that, when 9-month-old Roger is in my hands, and  he crossed the border in the arms of his sister, that 9-month-old  Roger, even though I saw him in one of the HHS centers, probably needed  care.   Or the woman who had given birth 45 days earlier and holding in her  hands a 45-day-old baby who had not seen a doctor, she had not been to  the hospital. This might help give aid to those individuals.   So let me be very clear: This is an important initiative. It is an  initiative that I think most Americans will support.   I rise to support the gentlewoman's legislation and thank her for her  courage and astuteness in bringing this to our attention.
