 Mr. Speaker, I rise today nearly 1 year after Roe  v. Wade was overturned to condemn the continued sanctioned assault on  women.   In the year since this decision, more women have been prosecuted for  their pregnancy outcomes and more laws have been introduced to further  criminalize us than ever before.   Is it okay to arrest a woman for having a stillbirth? Is it a crime  to assist a pregnant child of rape or incest to get an abortion? Is it  reasonable to classify abortion as a homicide? No, but that is where we  are now.   A woman can now be prosecuted for the death of her unborn child. It  is almost a capital offense to be born a woman. Given the likelihood  that your female child may be raped, have a complicated pregnancy, or  just need an abortion, would you want her to be treated like a  criminal? No.   Mr. Speaker, women's bodies have suffered endless surveillance and  control for long enough. It is time that we stand up and talk about  this, and it must end now.                            ____________________
