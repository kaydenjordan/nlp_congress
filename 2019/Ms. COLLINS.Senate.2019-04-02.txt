 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, to reauthorize the  Lifespan Respite Care Program. Respite care provides full-time  caregivers with the much-needed opportunity to take a temporary break  from their responsibilities caring for aging or disabled loved ones.   Every day, an estimated 43 million family caregivers attend to loved  ones who are experiencing chronic, disabling health conditions. While  many of these individuals care for an older adult, almost one-third of  caregivers attend to persons under the age of 50. Caregivers help their  loved ones remain at home, often delaying the need for nursing home or  foster care placements. The value of their efforts is tremendous,  amounting to more than $470 billion in uncompensated care.   This compassionate task, however, can take a toll. Caregivers  experience higher mortality rates and are more likely to acquire acute  and chronic health conditions. Respite care, which provides temporary  relief to caregivers from their ongoing responsibilities, helps to  reduce mental stress and physical health issues they may experience,  keeping caregivers healthy and families intact. Yet, almost 80 percent  of America's caregivers have never received any respite services.   As a senator representing the State with the oldest median age in our  Nation and as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, the well-being of  our seniors and their caregivers is among my top priorities. Since the  Lifespan Respite Care Act was enacted in 2006, 37 States and the  District of Columbia have received grants to increase the availability  and quality of respite services. Still, the need for respite care  continues to increase and outpace available resources.   When I ask family caregivers about their greatest needs, the number  one that I hear is respite. The Maine Department of Health and Human  Services recognized this urgent need in a report released in December  2018 on children's behavioral health services. The report recommended  expanding access to respite care services for families. One Maine  mother shared, ``Respite has helped our family because we have been  able to take other children to doctors appointments without everyone  having to go. My husband and I have been able to have a little time  away. I have been able to attend to my own mental health needs.'' From  families caring for children with disabilities to those caring for  older adults, the need for respite care today continues to grow.   Our legislation will help to close the resource gap experienced by  our nation's caregivers. Specifically, the Lifespan Respite Care Act  will authorize robust funding for this program over the five years,  through 2024, to assist states in establishing or enhancing statewide  Lifespan Respite systems. It would authorize $20 million for fiscal  year 2020, with funding increasing by $10 million annually, in order to  reach $60 million for fiscal year 2024. This bill is widely supported  by leading caregiver and respite organizations, including the ARCH  National Respite Network and Resource Center, the American  Psychological Association, the Arc, and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.  Mr. President, I ask to include letters from these supporting  organizations in the Record.   Mr. President, there is a large gap between caregivers who need  respite services and those who receive it. Our legislation would  provide the necessary resources to state respite agencies to ensure  that more caregivers have access to the respite services they need. I  urge all of my colleagues to join in support of this important  bipartisan legislation, the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act  of 2019.

Tammy Baldwin,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Langevin,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins, Senator Baldwin, Representative       Langevin and Representative McMorris Rodgers: We, the       undersigned national organizations representing all ages and       disabilities, are writing to offer our fervent support for       and endorsement of the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization       Act to reauthorize the Lifespan Respite Care Program at $200       million over five years. We also want to thank you for your       leadership in supporting the nation's family caregivers.        Every day, millions of American families are faced with       unexpected illness, disease, or disability. A soldier is       injured in war, a spouse develops multiple sclerosis or       Alzheimer's disease, or a child is diagnosed with a       developmental or physical disability or chronic illness.       These are but a few examples of events that can forever       change an individual's and family's trajectory.        While each situation is unique, the one thing that they       often have in common is the incredible value of family       caregivers. Forty-three million family caregivers provide a       vast majority of our nation's long-term care, permitting       individuals of all ages to remain in their communities and       avoid or delay nursing home or foster care placements. AARP       has estimated that in 2013, family caregivers provided $470       billion in uncompensated care to adults, a staggering       statistic that exceeds federal and state spending on Medicaid       health services and long-term services and supports that same       year.        While the benefits of family caregiving are plentiful,       caregiving can take its toll--with older spousal family       caregivers experiencing higher mortality rates, rates of       acute and chronic conditions, and depression than       noncaregivers. Respite--short-term care that offers       individuals or family members temporary relief from the daily       routine and stress of providing care--is a critical component       to bolstering family stability and maintaining family       caregiver health and well-being. Respite is a frequently       requested support service among family caregivers, but 85% of       family caregivers of adults receive no respite and the       percentage is similar for parents caring for their children       with special needs. Not surprisingly, high burden family       caregivers (defined as those who assist their loved one with       personal care such as getting dressed or bathing) cite lack       of respite as one of their top three concerns.        To help provide family caregivers the support they need,       the Lifespan Respite Care Program was enacted in 2006 with       strong bipartisan support. The program provides competitive       grants to states to establish or enhance statewide Lifespan       Respite systems that maximize existing resources and help       ensure that quality respite is available and accessible to       all family caregivers. With more than half of care recipients       under age 75 and more than one-third under age 50, Lifespan       Respite rightly recognizes caregiving as a lifespan issue and       serves families regardless of age or disability.        Though the program has been drastically underfunded since       its inception, thirty-seven states and the District of       Columbia have received grants and are engaged in impressive       work such as identifying and coordinating respite services       available through various state agencies, including veterans       caregiver services; helping unserved families pay for respite       through participant-directed voucher programs or mini-grants       to community and faith-based agencies; building respite       capacity by recruiting and training respite workers and       volunteers; and raising awareness about respite through       public education campaigns. Originally authorized through       Fiscal Year 2011, enactment of the Lifespan Respite Care       Reauthorization Act is necessary to continue this excellent       momentum, better coordinate and supply respite care to our       nation's 43 million family caregivers through statewide       Lifespan Respite programs and ensure that states are able to       sustain the great work they have begun and still allow new       states to receive a grant.        We thank you for your commitment to individuals living with       disabilities, older individuals in need of assistance and       support, and the loved ones who care for them and we look       forward to continuing to work with you as the bill moves       forward.
