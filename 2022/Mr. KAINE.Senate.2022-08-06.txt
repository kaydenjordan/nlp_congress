 Madam President, I am so pleased to be on the floor today  to join with Senator Murray, Senator Schumer, and Senator Blumenthal to  talk about the critical importance of childcare.   I will speak in about 40 minutes about a piece of this bill, the  black lung program, which is really important to the State of Virginia,  but, like Senator Murray, I share a sadness that childcare is not  included in this bill because this is what I am hearing from  Virginians: Even before the pandemic, there was an inadequate supply.  People working in this field weren't being paid enough. Parents are  having to pay too much.   It is a market failure, and we have to fix it. This bill doesn't, and  so we will need to continue it.   There has never been anyone in the history of the U.S. Senate who has  been as passionate an advocate for childcare as the senior Senator from  Washington, Senator Murray. She sort of swallowed a lead, because she  is a modest person, when she said: I cared about this from before I got  here.   Her colleagues know and Washingtonians know, but all Americans might  not know, that Senator Murray was an early childhood educator before  she came to the U.S. Senate. So this is a passion that drove her career  before she was here, and she hasn't left it behind, not for one second.  So when she says she is going to stay on this until it gets done, she  will.   I am very, very pleased to be a HELP Committee member under her  leadership and to help her on this, and I have a personal interest in  this too. I have three children. My middle son, Lin, went to Carleton  College, Phi Beta Kappa graduate, and he works as a pre-K classroom  aide in Minneapolis. This is how he has chosen to make a difference in  the world around him, by working as a classroom aide in a  prekindergarten program. And I know from my discussions with my son,  who just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago, how important the work is and  how poorly paid it is, and how parents struggle even to afford sending  kids to a childcare program, where the workers don't get paid very  much.   So this really is a classic market failure, and I think about Lin as  I advocate for this. And I also had a chance to think anew, Senator  Murray, about the importance of a priority.   A good news story the other day was that the American unemployment  rate is the lowest that it has ever been in 50 years at 3.5 percent,  and we all are hearing employers saying: But I can't hire people. I  can't hire people.   There are millions of Americans who could be in the workforce,  filling up these jobs that employers are looking to fill, but are not  in the workforce because of a lack of affordable childcare. So it is  important for kids, it is important for families' pocketbooks, and it  is important for the providers themselves. But our economy does not  work in the way that it should if we don't have affordable childcare  options. So I pledge to work together with my chair on this issue until  we get it done.                            ____________________     Madam President, the last thing I want to say is a thank- you. I have a staffer in the room, Karishma Merchant, who has staffed  me on the HELP Committee since before I was on the HELP Committee, and  she is leaving me to take a wonderful job at Jobs for the Future to  continue her passion for workforce and education.   She has helped me on childcare, on issues battling campus sexual  assault, career and technical education, and teacher training.  Everything I have done in the education and workforce space and on the  committee has been because I had a fantastic staffer pointing me in the  right direction. She is here in the Chamber, and I want to finish by  expressing my thanks to her.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to speak about a very important  provision in the Inflation Reduction Act that combines the three  pillars of the act: healthcare, energy, and tax reform. That provision  is a permanent funding fix for the Black Lung Benefits Program. And I  dedicate this floor speech to all my friends who are Virginia coal  miners, to their retirees, to their families. And I especially dedicate  it to my friends at the United Mine Workers, including a dear friend,  President Cecil Roberts.   I came to Virginia in 1984, never having been in Virginia. I grew up  in Kansas, and I didn't really know too much about the coal industry.  But I married my wife Anne 38 years ago, and part of her family is from  Big Stone Gap, VA, in the heart of Appalachia--those counties in  Southwestern Virginia--Wise, Lee, Dickenson, Russell, Buchanan, Scott-- that have coal mining as the very heart of their economies. And it is  not only coal mines, but it is the miners themselves--many of whom  drive across State lines to work in West Virginia or Kentucky--and  their families. And they have done it for generations.   And long before I got into politics, once I married my wife from  Appalachia, I got to know these miners. It is a tough job. It is a  scary job. It is a dangerous job. But these miners do it every day  because the Nation needs power, because our steel mills need steel to  build aircraft carriers and submarines and skyscrapers. And they do  this, and many of them have done it for generations.   I also, in coming to know these miners--long before I got into  politics--on family visits, realized what a patriotic bunch of people  they are. They have a disproportionately high rate of service in the  military when they are young, before they undertake this dangerous,  dangerous job.   I had been in Virginia for about 5 years, and there was a major  strike of these miners, the Pittston strike, in Southwest Virginia,  1989. It actually was from April of 1989 all the way until February of  1990. And it was a strike that was driven because the Pittston Coal  Company wanted to take health benefits away from retirees and widows  and disabled miners.   And what the mineworkers realized is if they allowed this to happen,  then every other mining company in the country would do exactly the  same thing. And so they went out on a strike, and they struck for 10  months. And their salaries were down to nothing, but they weren't going  to give up until they got these healthcare benefits.   There was a famous moment about 5 months into the strike when the  then-president of the UMW, Rich Trumka, who got to be a great friend of  ours--sadly, he passed in the last year. At that point, he was the  president of the mineworkers. He got asked by the New York Times: Your  people are suffering striking. They are earning some benefits through  the union, but it is a fraction of their salaries. How long can the  mine workers hold out?    And he gave one of the best answers ever: 1 day longer than the  Pittston Coal Company. That is how long we can hold out.   That is what they did. In February of 1990, they reached a deal, and  the healthcare benefits of these folks were saved.   Getting into politics, first at the local level, but especially when  I ran for Lieutenant Governor in 2001, I was kind of the big city  mayor, but people down there gave me a chance because they knew I had  family ties in Appalachia. I had gotten to know them before I was in  politics.   The mine workers were so helpful to me. I tried, over my time in  political life, to be helpful to them. I put a union president in my  cabinet as a Governor, whom they knew very, very well, who had struck  with them in 1989. No Governor had ever done that. I appointed a miner,  a UMW member to run my State mining safety agency. That agency had  always been run by folks from the management side or sometimes by hard- working, you know, kind of professional scientists and bureaucrats. But  there had never been a miner running the mining safety agency until I  became Governor.   I worked with mine workers to build a powerplant in Virginia City, in  Southwest Virginia, to try to show that coal can be done and used much  more cleaner than it had been in the past.   When I came to the Senate in 2013, the economics of mining had  changed a lot. Natural gas, being so much cheaper, had hurt mines.  Mechanization of mining reduced the job numbers. We mine about the same  amount of coal in Virginia today as we did 50 years ago. We just do it  with one-tenth of the miners because of mechanization.   The need to bring down our carbon usage to save the planet has  definitely been a factor. I am proud to say that my miners and their  leaders understand this. They understand the need for an energy  transition, and they embrace it. They just ask that, as we do it, we  don't leave them behind.   That leads me to this bill. We have made promises to our miners that  we will protect their health insurance, that we will protect their  pensions, and that we will have a full-funded Black Lung Benefits  Program to help the many miners--about one in five in Central  Appalachia, whose day in and day out job, inhaling coal dust and silica  dust, exposes them to a horrible pulmonary disease, black lung disease.  We told them we will have a program for them to take care of their  needs should they come down with black lung.   You will remember, Madam President, in 2017, because of bankruptcies  of coal companies, that many were setting up shell corporations to  evade their responsibilities to their retirees--just like in Pittston,  taking health insurance away from retirees, widows, and disabled  miners. Many companies have schemed with the Bankruptcy Code to do  that. In 2017, the miners healthcare program for these retirees was on  death's door. I cosponsored legislation with many colleagues, and we  saved their healthcare program.   I will never forget one of the toughest meetings I had in public life  was going into a mining contact office in Castlewood, VA, and sitting  down in a room of very nervous people who thought their healthcare  benefits were going to expire within a matter of weeks. But we made a  promise to them. And because of Democrats here--and we did get some  Republican votes on this, as well--we saved healthcare for retirees,  widows, and disabled miners.   A couple of years later, in 2019, the same features of these  companies--artificially, in many instances, going bankrupt--was now not  just threatening healthcare but was also threatening pensions. People  who had worked their whole lives in these dangerous jobs at risk to  their health were going to lose their pensions.   But in 2019, the American Miners Act, which was also bipartisan,  passed this body, and we fixed the nationwide pension program for  miners. It helped more than 6,000 Virginians. It helped more than  100,000 miners around the country.   That is two.   Well, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we can go  three for three. We can meet all the promises we made to these miners  and their families by fixing the Black Lung Benefits Program.   The preceding speaker talked about raising taxes on mines, but he  didn't tell the public what this is for. We are raising the excise tax  on coal so that we can have a program that will help miners who get  black lung disease.   And is this just a horribly confiscatory tax? No. Let me tell you  what this tax will be. We will raise the coal excise tax for coal mined  underground to $1.10 a ton. For these hard-working miners who are  underground, exposing themselves to life-risking pulmonary disease, we  will raise the tax to $1.10 a ton. And for coal that is mined on the  surface, we will raise it to 55 cents a ton to meet the promise that we  made to these hard-working people. This will provide permanent  sufficient funding to maintain the solvency of the fund, and our miners  can be assured that the program will be--as they are going underground  every day and doing that tough job, they can be assured that the  program will be there for them should they get black lung disease.  [[Page S4069]]    I have been proud to cosponsor all three of these bills--promise  made, promise kept.   I want to thank Virginia's coal miners for their friendship, for  their patriotism, for their determination, and for never giving up,  including never giving up on us. And when we pass the IRA, we will be  able to say: Your faith was justified. We got it done.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous order be  extended for 15 minutes and the majority leader be recognized at that  time.
