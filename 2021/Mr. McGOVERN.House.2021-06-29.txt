 Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 8 of House  Resolution 504, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bills: H.R.  1500, H.R. 2471, H.R. 3261, H.R. 3283, and H.R. 3385, and agree to H.  Res. 186 and H. Res. 402.   The Clerk read the title of the bills and the resolutions.   The text of the bills and the resolutions are as follows:                 Global Learning Loss Assessment Act of 2021                                 H.R. 1500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Learning Loss       Assessment Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred       to as ``COVID-19'') pandemic began, 258,000,000 children were       out of school globally, including 130,000,000 girls.        (2) Students already at a disadvantage before COVID-19 will       experience greater learning loss, thereby worsening inequity       and inequality.        (3) Approximately 90 percent of the world's student       population--over 1,600,000,000 children and youth--have had       their education disrupted by school closure due to COVID-19.        (4) School closures lead to interrupted learning, poor       nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout rates,       exposure to violence, and social isolation.        (5) Up to 24,000,000 children are at risk of dropping out       of school permanently due to rising levels of child poverty       associated with the pandemic.        (6) School closure and remote learning is especially       burdensome on girls, who are frequently expected to shoulder       more household chores and responsibilities and are more       vulnerable to gender-based violence.        (7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide school closures       in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to increased instances of sexual-       and gender-based violence, teenage pregnancy, school dropout,       and child labor for girls.        (8) More than 60 percent of national distance learning       alternatives rely exclusively on online platforms but two-      thirds of the world's school aged children, or 1,300,000,000       children aged 3 through 17, do not have internet connection       in their homes, and schools and local learning centers also       frequently have inadequate internet connectivity. Eighty       percent of students in sub-Saharan Africa lack such access,       with an even higher rate for girls.        (9) Children and youth with disabilities are particularly       vulnerable to the health, education, and socioeconomic       consequences of the pandemic. As a further challenge,       distance learning tools are not always accessible to learners       with disabilities or those with complex learning needs,       especially in poorer and rural households.        (10) Before the COVID-19 pandemic, refugee children were       twice as likely to be out of school as other youth, and       school closures and a lack of access to distance learning       tools threaten to make the education gap among refugee       children even more severe.        (11) The economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic       could lead to an education financing gap of $77,000,000,000       in low- and middle-income countries over the next 2 years.        (12) The economic cost of school closures could be up to       $1,337 per student, which on a global scale equates to       approximately $10,000,000,000,000 in lost economic output       over the coming generation.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that United States-      funded basic education programs operating in low- and middle-      income countries should seek to--        (1) provide inclusive learning opportunities for students       and teachers, especially for the most marginalized, including       girls, children with disabilities, and previously out of       school children;        (2) build local capacity and help countries strengthen       their education systems, including opportunities for early       childhood development;        (3) improve the availability, delivery, and quality of       education services from early childhood through secondary       education;        (4) improve equity and safety in education services; and        (5) support the return of children to school who have       experienced interruptions in their education due to the       COVID-19 pandemic and work to enroll previously out-of-school       children and youth, particularly the most marginalized.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the United       States Agency for International Development, acting through       the Senior Coordinator for International Basic Education       Assistance and in consultation with the Senior Coordinator       for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, shall submit to       the appropriate congressional committees a report on the       impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on United States Agency for       International Development basic education programs.

(2) An assessment comparing academic outcomes of       beneficiaries of United States Agency for International       Development basic education programs, as practical and       appropriate, between those that attend schools that remain       closed or continue to operate remotely since the start of the       COVID-19 pandemic and schools that have resumed in-person       instruction.        (3) A description of the effectiveness, cost,       accessibility, and reach of the most commonly used forms of       distance learning in low- and middle-income countries and       low-resource contexts.

(5) An identification and description of any gaps in, or       barriers to, reaching and educating marginalized populations,       such as girls, children with disabilities, displaced       children, or other children adversely affected by the COVID-      19 pandemic with distance learning interventions.        (6) A description of the United States Agency for       International Development's plan and needed authorities and       resources to prevent degradation of such basic education       programs and to support, as necessary and appropriate,       continued distance learning interventions, safe school       reopenings, assessments of student learning levels, remedial       and accelerated learning, re-enrollment campaigns for out-of-      school children and youth, and education system strengthening       and resilience-building efforts.        (7) An analysis of the coordination between the United       States Agency for International Development and other actors       in global basic education policy and programming to provide       education during the COVID-19 pandemic, including partner       organizations, faith based-organizations, donors, and       multilateral organizations.        (8) A description of opportunities to partner and support       efforts to expand access to digital infrastructure, internet       connectivity, and learning resources in areas that lack       access to digital and remote learning infrastructure and       resources, including rural and remote communities.        (c) Public Availability.--The report required by subsection       (a) shall be made available to the public.

Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency                               Initiative Act                                 H.R. 2471         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Development,       Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near       the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving at least       220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens,       101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of       Haiti's civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000       homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 Haitians displaced.        (2) The international community, led by the United States       and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian       response to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 2018, more than       $8,000,000,000 has been disbursed by donors. Since the 2010       earthquake, the United States Government has disbursed more       than $4,000,000,000 in recovery and development funding.        (3) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck       southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon Peninsula, causing       widespread damage and flooding and leaving 1.4 million people       in need of immediate assistance. Recovery efforts continue       more than four years later.        (4) Prior to both the 2010 earthquake and 2016 hurricane,       Haiti registered among the  [[Page H3259]]       lowest in socioeconomic indicators and had the second highest       rate of income disparity in the world--conditions that have       further complicated disaster recovery and resilience efforts.       As of November 2020, 4,400,000 people were in need of       humanitarian assistance in Haiti.        (5) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians have       participated in popular demonstrations demanding       accountability over government management of Petrocaribe       resources. In early 2019, the Haitian superior court of       auditors released a series of reports implicating high-level       government officials in the misappropriation of funds.        (6) The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High       Commissioner and the Human Rights Service jointly found a 333       percent increase in human rights violations and abuses       against the rights of life and security in Haiti from July       2018 through December 2019. There were 131 violations in 2018       and 567 violations in 2019, including the shooting of at       least five Haitian journalists covering the protests.        (7) Leading members of civil society have faced attacks,       including Monferrier Dorval, a constitutional law expert and       president of the Port-au-Prince bar who was killed on August       28, 2020.        (8) On November 13, 2018, according to the Haitian National       Human Rights Defense Network, at least 71 people were killed       and 18 people were raped in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood       of La Saline.        (9) On December 10, 2020, the Department of the Treasury's       Office of Foreign Assets Control designated former Haitian       National Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former Director       General of the Ministry of the Interior Fednel Monchery, and       former Departmental Delegate Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan       pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Executive Order for being       foreign persons responsible for or complicit in, or having       directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse       for their connection to the La Saline massacre.        (10) Following the La Saline massacre, similar attacks have       occurred in Port-au-Prince neighborhoods, including the       November 2019 and August 2020 attacks on Bel Air, in which 24       people were killed and hundreds of families were displaced.        (11) Parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2019 did       not take place, and since January 13, 2020, President Jovenel       Moise has ruled by decree. The United States and       international community have urged President Moise to limit       the use of executive decrees during this period and have       expressed concern over several decrees issued, including       those creating the National Intelligence Agency and       appointing three new judges to the Supreme Court outside of       constitutional procedures. Haitian civil society       organizations have denounced the president's use of decrees       as an attempt to consolidate power.        (12) Due to institutional weakness and other challenges       exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Haiti's economy       contracted by an estimated 4 percent in 2020 and inflation       neared 20 percent. Although there has been no parliament in       place since January 2020, the Haitian Government approved a       budget on September 30, 2020. However, the delay prevented       the International Monetary Fund and other multilaterals from       disbursing millions in international assistance.        (13) In September 2020, President Moise bypassed the       Supreme Court to appoint a Provisional Electoral Council       (CEP) by executive decree Several civil society groups that       traditionally participate in Haiti's electoral councils       criticized the decision and have declined to be represented       in the CEP.        (14) The Moise administration lacks the credibility to       oversee a proposed constitutional referendum scheduled for       June 2021, which legal experts consider unconstitutional.        (15) There are concerns that, given the lack of democratic       checks and balances, the dispute over the credibility of the       electoral council, and the deteriorating security situation,       elections scheduled for September 2021 will not be free or       fair. Additionally, the security situation remains volatile       and on February 7, 2021, President Moise alleged that a coup       had been attempted against him leading to 23 arrests and the       forced retirement of three Supreme Court judges.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to support the       sustainable rebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner       that--        (1) recognizes Haitian independence, self-reliance,       sovereignty, democratic governance, and efficiency;        (2) promotes efforts that are led by and support the people       and Government of Haiti at all levels so that Haitians lead       the course of reconstruction and development of Haiti;        (3) builds the long-term capacity of the Government of       Haiti, civil society in Haiti, and the private sector to       foster economic opportunities in Haiti;        (4) fosters collaboration between the Haitian diaspora in       the United States, including dual citizens of Haiti and the       United States, with the Haitian Government and the business       community in Haiti;        (5) supports anti-corruption efforts, promotes press       freedom, and addresses human rights concerns, including       through the enforcement of sanctions imposed in accordance       with the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act on       individuals implicated in human rights violations;        (6) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources,       as well as strengthens community-level resilience to       environmental and weather-related impacts;        (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely       elections in accordance with democratic principles and the       Haitian Constitution;        (8) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on Haiti       and the United States Government's goals and progress, as       well as transparent post program evaluations and contracting       data;        (9) promotes the participation of Haitian women and youth       in governmental and nongovernmental institutions and in       economic development and governance assistance programs       funded by the United States; and        (10) does not provide support to facilitate the proposed       June 2021 constitutional referendum, including through       multilateral organizations.

       Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed       numerous diplomatic notes with the Russian Foreign Ministry       regarding Trevor Reed being denied consular access,       communications, medical treatment, family visitations, and       other violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular       Relations;        Whereas Trevor Reed was not given food or water until       approximately 72 hours after his initial arrest;        Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a medical evaluation of       his injuries until 10 days following his arrest;

       Whereas the two police officers changed their testimonies       in writing, in their interviews, and at least three times       during defense questioning, with final answers to the judge       being ``I don't remember.'', causing court attendees and the       judge to laugh;        Whereas the Investigative Bureau and Golovinsky District       Court Judge Arnout denied Trevor Reed's requests to       investigate how his injuries occurred;        Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky District Court Judge       Arnout read a verdict that dismissed all defense evidence,       witnesses, and government experts and only considered pieces       of the police officers' statements;

and        Whereas the appeal court returned the case to the       Golovinsky District Court to review omissions and incorrect       statements in the trial transcripts, and the official court       audio recordings were reviewed by the defense and the       corrections were certified by a third-party notarization       firm, with the result being Judge Arnout refusing to include       any corrections to the corrupted transcripts: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release Trevor Reed and all other prisoners       arrested for political motivations;

Urging the Administration to Facilitate Assistance in Response to the                  Devastating Impact of Covid-19 in India                                H. Res. 402         Whereas in March 2021, a second wave of Coronavirus Disease       2019 (commonly referred to as ``COVID-19'') infections began       to surge in India, overwhelming health care workers,       hospitals, and crematoriums throughout the country;        Whereas testing results indicate India is seeing more than       340,000 new daily infections and upward of 4,000 deaths a       day, though public health experts believe case rates are       higher;        Whereas cases have surged in neighboring countries such as       Nepal and other countries in the area remain highly       vulnerable to renewed spikes in cases;        Whereas the deadly COVID-19 outbreak in India is a global       problem that requires a coordinated global response;        Whereas in the spring of 2020, when the United States was       in the midst of a devastating spike in COVID-19 cases, India       lifted its export ban on certain therapeutics in response to       a request by the United States Government;        Whereas India's pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of       the global solution to the pandemic, especially for much of       Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is the world's biggest       producer of COVID vaccines having exported 66.36 million       doses to 93 countries, including to United Nations personnel       and, accounting for over half of global vaccine       manufacturing;        Whereas due to India's critical importance in global       vaccine supply chains, an increase in domestic vaccine demand       as a result of the surge of COVID-19 cases within India is of       global concern;        Whereas in response to the crisis in India, the Biden       administration took quick action to deliver urgently needed       supplies to India, including oxygen support, oxygen       concentrators, personal protective equipment (PPE), raw       materials for vaccine, rapid diagnostic tests, and       therapeutics, and is a testament to the historic record of       United States-India health cooperation dating more than seven       decades;        Whereas the United States private sector has worked to       generously support relief efforts in India including by       working to deliver 1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen       concentrators to health care facilities across India;        Whereas many countries around the world have also sent       medical assistance to India to help the country defeat this       devastating wave of the COVID-19 pandemic;        Whereas as the United States vaccine supply for the       American people is secured, it is important for the United       States to continue to ramp up its efforts, working with the       private sector and all possible partners, to expand vaccine       manufacturing and distribution worldwide; and        Whereas United States support for India to help beat back       this latest coronavirus wave is in the United States national       interest as the pandemic will not end anywhere until it ends       everywhere: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the Administration to facilitate private, in-kind       medical supply donations to India and deliver additional,       urgently needed  [[Page H3262]]       medical supplies, including oxygen generator plants and a       cryogenic oxygen tanker and containers;        (2) urges the Administration to facilitate assistance as       needed to neighboring countries, including Nepal, that are       facing the spread of COVID-19 and working with partners       around the world to address the virus; and        (3) calls on the United States private sector and the       Indian-American community to continue their unprecedented and       generous efforts at procuring medical supplies for the Indian       response during this time of need, building upon       contributions to date, standing with the people of India as       they collectively work to stem the spread of COVID-19.
