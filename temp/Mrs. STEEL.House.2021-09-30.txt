 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about an important  figure in the Vietnamese-American community, General Tran Hung Dao.   General Dao was one of the greatest Vietnamese military commanders of  all time. He saved Vietnam from Mongolian invasion three times, which  is considered one of the greatest military feats in history.   General Dao remains a significant figure in the Vietnamese community  today.   I am proud to represent Little Saigon, which is home to almost  200,000 Vietnamese Americans, the largest Vietnamese population outside  of Vietnam.   This week, in honor of the anniversary of his death on October 3, I  introduced a bill that would rename a U.S. post office in Little Saigon  as the General Tran Hung Dao Post Office. This renaming would mean so  much to those in the Vietnamese-American community, which I am so proud  to represent.                            ____________________
