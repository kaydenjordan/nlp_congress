 Mr. Speaker, what in the world is happening in our God  blessed country? A lengthy pandemic decimating our economy and taking  over 121,00 precious American lives, followed by the horrific murder of  Mr. George Floyd by a bad cop, leading to nationwide protests and  demonstrations of people wanting to be heard.   Sadly, all of this has been overshadowed by the violence, looting,  destruction, and lawless mayhem in America's major cities.   We have even seen weak and feckless Democrat government leaders  acquiesce to anti-American warlords setting up their own countries at  the expense of residents and shopkeepers.   This is taking place under the influence of shadowy, anti-American  organizations and individuals. We know who they are, so I will not  distinguish them by saying their names.   America is awake and willing to address major concerns.   Despite the hundreds of heroic police officers who have been injured,  paralyzed, or killed just doing their jobs for us, violent punks  continue hijacking the sad event that began all this foment we grieve  over. Their goal is to literally tear down and destroy our history and  freedoms.    America is under attack. We must wake up before it is too late. These  evil forces of destruction are showing us that we can't stop them. Or  can we?   John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, said  this: ``A republic once equally poised, must either preserve its virtue  or lose its liberty.''   I don't know his position on slavery at that time, though even as a  minister and President of Princeton, I am sure he had his flaws. Yet  this message rings true as we view in live time our Nation's loss of  virtue and liberty.   The key purpose of government is to reward the doer of good and  punish the doer of evil.   Today, the forces of division and anarchy are rejecting this purpose,  calling for the defunding and/or ending of police.  [[Page H2428]]    While Republicans are offering workable and commonsense justice  reform, the Democrat leadership digs in saying ``no'' to any  negotiation. Yet they continue to support or remain silent about the  senseless destruction of our cities and history.   Chances are if you were to list the greatest Americans, you may think  of George Washington, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ulysses Grant, men who have  made tremendous positive impacts on our country, and in doing so, the  entire history of humanity. Yet this week, enlightened leftists have  gone after statues of these men, attempting to rewrite history and  tarnish America's overwhelmingly positive legacy for humanity.   As with other humans, these men are not perfect, but none of these  monuments were erected to honor their shortcomings or faults; they were  erected to honor their extraordinary contributions to society.   These men are responsible for some of the most important  distinctives: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the ending of  slavery, victory over the Confederacy, and conservation of America's  greatest natural treasures.   Ironically, the rights these vandals and anarchists enjoy, like the  right to assemble, would not be possible if not for the very men they  ignorantly tear down.   Even the Lincoln Memorial was vandalized recently, the Great  Emancipator, who was the first President nominated and elected by the  party formed in my district in 1854 Under the Oaks in Jackson,  Michigan, the Emancipation/Republican Party.   Make no mistake: this is an attack on America itself, not an attempt  to make reforms or anything else the defenders of these cowardly acts  may claim.   Few in the Democratic Party have spoken out against these acts, which  leads me to wonder, at what point did pride in America become a  partisan issue?                                time  0945    Is it because these anarchist acts are taking place in Democrat-run  cities?   Is it because these are the same people that they have directed all  of their so-called antipoverty, social welfare, Big-Government-will- take-care-of-you programs toward?   Or is it because Democrat leadership fears crossing the big-moneyed,  sinister individuals and organizations masterminding radical societal  change?   What exactly is the endgame of these attempts to erase and rewrite  history? Could it be the destruction of the American idea or America  itself?   I call for my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, and America-loving  patriots to stand with me as proud Americans in our fight against  anarchy and ignorance. May we be people who, with courage and humility,  echo the words of our Framers in pledging ``our lives, our fortunes,  and our sacred honor'' to defending and perfecting America.                            ____________________
