The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Ms. Rosen) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to  increase funding by $35 million for the Neighborhood Reinvestment  Corporation, better known as NeighborWorks America.   For the past 40 years, NeighborWorks America, a congressionally  chartered nonprofit, has provided financial support, technical  assistance, and training for community-based development right here in  the USA.   NeighborWorks partners with more than 240 organizations focused on  providing access to homeownership and to safe and affordable rental  housing. These organizations are public-private partnerships providing  maximum transparency and accountability in their stewardship of scarce  Federal dollars.   In fiscal year 2016, NeighborWorks America developed nearly 13,000  affordable homes, repaired over 55,000 houses, created more than 21,000  new homeowners, and assisted over 360,000 families with affordable  housing.   NeighborWorks has demonstrated the ability to attract private sector  investments to its affordable housing projects, leveraging 91 private  dollars for every $1 of funding appropriated.   Our country is finally on the pathway to recovering from a crippling  housing crisis. My home State of Nevada was hit the hardest when the  housing bubble burst and we experienced one of the highest rates of  foreclosure. My district, which includes Las Vegas, has some of the  lowest availability of affordable rental homes to households with low- income levels. In fact, there are only 15 affordable and available  rental homes for every 100 rental households.   NeighborWorks has played a critical role in helping develop and  preserve affordable housing, revitalize and sustain neighborhoods, and  create jobs. Last year, Nevada affordable housing organizations like  Neighborhood Housing Services of Southern Nevada, and Nevada HAND,  received over $600,000 in grants, providing homeownership counseling  and education to over 6,500 households, creating over 600 new  homeowners, and preserving homeownership for over 250 individuals.  Congress needs to continue to strengthen programs that allow low-income  families to keep a roof over their heads.   In addition to financial support and technical assistance,  NeighborWorks offers home buyer and foreclosure counseling, and  previously administered the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling  program. Created in 2007 to address the nationwide housing foreclosure  crisis, this program has counseled more than 2 million homeowners  facing foreclosure in response to the housing crisis.   You may hear from my friends across the aisle that there is no longer  a need for foreclosure mitigation counseling because foreclosure rates  are decreasing nationwide. And I am glad to see the rates decrease, but  the reality is that foreclosures continue to plague many parts of this  country, including my district.   Statistics from the Department of Housing and Urban Development show  that a foreclosed home depresses home values, reducing appraisal values  by nearly 9 percent. Clearly, preventing even one foreclosure helps  every household in a neighborhood.   Foreclosure mitigation counseling plays a crucial role in reducing  chances that a homeowner will not fall back into foreclosure. These  programs enable counselors to work with homeowners on their budget and  find the best option for their situation.   According to an Urban Institute study, counseled homeowners were  nearly twice as likely to receive a cure for their serious delinquency  or foreclosure as homeowners not counseled through the NeighborWorks  program.   Additionally, NeighborWorks also offers disaster preparedness and  recovery for communities, including training, resources, and  assistance. In fact, organizations in and around the impact zone of  Hurricane Harvey in Houston are ready to offer disaster recovery right  where it is needed most, and we know Irma is on its way to Florida.   On the heels of one the worst natural disasters of our lifetime, and  in the face of additional severe weather events, now is not the time to  roll back our investment in NeighborWorks and the organization it  supports.   Despite the continued need for affordable housing and NeighborWorks'  success at revitalizing communities, the underlying bill would cripple  NeighborWorks by slashing its funding. We cannot afford to reverse our  progress made on affordable housing. Instead, we should continue  critical investments in programs like NeighborWorks that have proven to  be successful.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, let me first reassure the gentlewoman  that I support the mission of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. As  a matter of fact, this bill that we are on provides $140 million, the  same amount that was provided in 2017. We are not rolling that back at  all.   The reduction from FY16, however, reflects the elimination of the  National Foreclosure and Mitigation Counseling program. Now, this  program was to be a 1-year program when it began in 2007 in response  to, obviously, the foreclosure crisis at the time. Again, this 1-year  program then continued on for 9 years.   Now, recognizing that the economy improved, obviously, significantly,  and foreclosure numbers continued to decline, Congress discontinued the  NFMC program, again, in fiscal year 2017. In fact, the prior  administration proposed elimination of the NFMC in its budget request  for the very same reason.   So in 2016--let's put this in perspective. Foreclosure filings were  at a 10-year low and declined to 14 percent below the 2015 level. The  foreclosure rate has stayed within a historically normal range for 3  years. So, further, the NRC has integrated foreclosure mitigation  counseling into its other counseling programs, eliminating the need for  a separate program. So, again, you know, we scrubbed these accounts.  For those reasons, I respectfully would urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague for  offering this amendment, and I strongly support it. Like many Members,  I have seen the difference that NeighborWorks makes in my own district:  making available hundreds of affordable apartments, often for veterans,  for families.   The administration proposed slashing NeighborWorks by $113 million,  so I commend the committee, our subcommittee, for refusing that  proposal. But we need to bring it back to the fiscal year `16 level,  and that is what my colleague is proposing. That would be $35 million.  It would bring us to that fiscal year `16 level of funding, and it  would let NeighborWorks do even more good work in our communities. I  urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).  [[Page H7052]]    The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Nevada  will be postponed.                                time  2045                   Amendment No. 39 Offered by Mr. Grothman    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
