 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for this opportunity  to continue the discussion. My colleague from Texas really left here a  moment ago with a plea about bringing down the cost of health care in  America. Actually, it was the cost of premiums in America. That is a  plea that I think all 435 of us would echo. It would certainly be our  goal, as representatives of the American people, to find some way to  accomplish that, some way to bring down the cost of premiums.   I would like just to make a point right at the outset. When  discussing health care, there are really two connected, but very  separate, parts to the healthcare system.   One part is the delivery of medical services. These are the doctors,  some of whom are in organizations of doctors of various specialties.  Some are in large practices, such as the Kaiser practice. Some are in  hospitals disconnected from doctors. But there is just a plethora of  different ways in which medical services are delivered. That is the  delivery of medical services. That is one part of it.   The other part of the healthcare system in America, and really  anywhere in the world, is the collection of money to pay for the  services. Now, in the United States, we have many different ways to  collect the money. One of them is through taxes. And this is how we pay  for Medicare and Medicaid, what we call MediCal in California. We pay  for the veterans' medical services through the collection of taxes,  children's health services, and some other programs that are much  smaller. So that is one way in which we collect the money to pay for  services. You might call those single-payer taxpayer services,  taxpayers' money being spent on services delivered by that whole range  of providers, some of which happen to be government providers, for  example, the Veterans Administration and military medical services.   Now, the other way in which we collect money to pay for services are  premiums, health insurance premiums that are charged by health  insurance companies. The largest single part of that is from  corporations, businesses, that buy health insurance and pay the  premiums. And the others are individuals, and this is the individual  insurance market. There are some small group markets out there, also.  But these two systems, we need to understand that they are different.  They are connected, obviously.   Now, if we are going to deal with the cost of premiums, you have to  go over and deal with the cost of health care, because the health care  drives the premiums and also drives the amount of money that we need to  raise to pay for the services that are provided by the various  governmental programs.   Now, in the Affordable Care Act, which is now some 7 years old  Thursday of this week, the seventh anniversary of the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, there are some very powerful mechanisms to reduce  the cost of health care--doctors, hospitals, and the rest. Some of  these are electronic medical records so that there is a continuity of  knowledge as to what happened, what was provided, what services were  provided to the individual.                                time  1730    Another one happens to be a penalty assessed on hospitals for  hospital readmissions on hospital-acquired infections--profound in  driving down the cost; also extremely important for individuals because  hospital infection rates dramatically dropped.   There are also ways in which we pay for the services. It is very  clear that the utilization of fee-for-service drove up the cost.   Anyway, as we go through this discussion today on the Affordable Care  Act, and I see I am being joined by my colleagues here, I just want us  to keep in mind that in order to deal with the cost of premiums, you  have got to deal with the cost of services that are provided.   Now, in the Affordable Care Act, we actually saw, over the last 5  years as the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, went into effect, a  decrease in the rate of increase. We haven't seen a decrease in the  cost of medical services, but what we have seen is that the inflation  rate has significantly reduced, so much so that the financial security  of the Medicare program, which is the single biggest expenditure, has  been extended by some 11 years because the inflation rate has  declined--not decreased, but the rate of inflation has declined almost  50 percent from what it was before the Affordable Care Act.   That is a direct result of the many reforms that went into the way in  which medical services were delivered. That allowed for a lower  inflation rate for premiums and an extension of the financial viability  of Medicare and other medical programs.   Now, unfortunately, we are now faced with a repeal or a partial  repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the promise has been made by my  Republican colleagues that somehow this will reduce the premiums. Well,  that is interesting. Now, exactly how are you going to reduce the  premiums unless you are dealing with the cost of medical care?   In their reforms, there is--as best I can determine and everybody  else--no effective way to reduce the cost of medical services and, in  fact, the high probability that the cost of medical services will  increase, specifically, because, in their proposed reform, men and  women that are 45, 50 to 65 are going to find it virtually impossible  to continue to buy insurance. They will drop their insurance. That is  part of those 14 million Americans that will lose their insurance next  year and part of the 24 million Americans that will not have insurance  9 years from now.   That population, before they get to Medicare, when they begin to get  ill, 40, 50, 60, they will not be able to afford insurance. It is  something like a $12,000 increase in cost to them. It is what is known  as the senior tax.   Now, that will drive up the cost of medical services. Because they  will not be able to have continuity of care, their diabetes, their  heart issues, their high blood pressure, and on and on will not be  treated.   Similarly, in the proposed reform, there is a significant reduction  in the number of men and women across this Nation--and we are talking  probably in the range of 4 to 6 million in the next 2 years that will  not be covered under the Medicaid program. Those people, not having  access to continuous medical services, will not seek treatment for  those illnesses that can be treated effectively or held in abeyance,  such as diabetes, heart disease, and the like. That means that the cost  of medical care for them will rise.   Where will they go to get medical care? Not to worry, say our  Republican colleagues. They can go to the emergency room. We have been  there. We have seen what that means.   The expansion of the Medicaid program is unraveled by the proposed  TrumpCare. I am going to come back to this.   I would like to ask my colleague from Texas to carry on here, if you  would. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas, Sheila  Jackson Lee, for her consistent and constant caring for men and women  in this Nation that are on the outside, that are not among the wealthy,  that are struggling with their families to improve their situation. You  are always there. And here you are once again this evening laying out  the problems that we are going to see with TrumpCare.   Let me just very quickly run through this, and then I would like to  turn back to my colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline.   The proposal that is on the floor, we could just lay out five very  succinct arguments on why it doesn't work.   I was going through a rather complete explanation of how the  healthcare system works because it is kind of a basic understanding,  but clearly, under the legislation that is going to be taken up this  Thursday, Americans are going to pay more for less. And it is not just  a few.   The senior citizens in Medicare are going to see a diminution in  their benefits. We are looking at the 40-to 50-years-olds, which I have  already discussed. We are looking at other individuals.   Pay more for less, we are looking, over the next 9 years, that 24  million Americans will lose their insurance or their opportunity to get  insurance. And just this next year, just 18 months from now--excuse me,  not 18 months from now. Nine months from now, we are going to see 14  million people begin to lose their insurance.   I talked earlier about this age tax, which speaks to those people  that are 50 to 65 years of age. They are, under this legislation, going  to pay up to five times more than someone who is between 20 and 30  years of age.                                time  1745    Present law says they can be charged no more than three times what a  20- to 30-year-old pays, and so this is what is known as an age tax. It  simply shifts the cost to those 40-, 50-, 60-year-old people who happen  to be the most expensive. And I talked about the $12,000 that they will  have to pay in addition to that.   It guts Medicaid. We call it Medi-Cal in California and Medicaid  across the Nation. The expansion of Medicaid was an extraordinarily  important event that provided insurance not only to men and women who  had no income, but to 85 percent of the people on Medicaid across this  Nation who are elderly, in nursing homes, or elderly poor, unable to  provide sufficient income from just their Social Security--those are  called the dual eligible--or children.   Now, in the Affordable Care Act, there was what was known as Medicaid  expansion; and those are the working men and women, families, who have  less than 138 percent of the poverty rate. So those are the low-income  working men and women who are able to get Medicaid, or Medi-Cal  insurance in California. It simply guts it in a variety of ways, which  we will come back and discuss a little later.   You can bet and you can count on there being less support for the  elderly that are in nursing homes. There will be less support for the  young families; the single-mother families who are struggling to get  along, probably going to school, trying to learn skills; and for  [[Page H2282]]  the working families who are at $10 an hour minimum wage.   Finally, this is the one that ought to drive Americans right off the  rails. This is a whopping $270 billion tax reduction for the top 1  percent of Americans. It is for 400 families in America, the richest  400, four of which are in the current Trump administration, including  the President himself. They will see a $7 million a year decrease in  their taxes.   Now, that is great. I am sure the President will enjoy that $7  million tax reduction, along with the $3 million or $4 million he is  getting from the taxpayers every year so he can go to his home in  Florida.   This is obscene. This is obscene because the way in which this thing  works, working men and women and families across America at every  income level are going to get less. They are going to pay for more, and  yet the superwealthy in America are going to get a whopping tax  reduction. This is the income distribution that we should never have,  to take from the poor, to take from the middle class, and give to the  superwealthy. I will come back and discuss this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, there is no better fighter than the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) in the representation that  he gives to the people of Rhode Island and beyond. The gentleman  couldn't be more accurate about all that he said.   I was listening carefully to the story the gentleman from Rhode  Island told of the individual who wrote him an email. I, too, have  received many, many emails.   I was thinking, as he was describing the situation, of a woman who  runs her own small farm near Marysville, California, in my district.  For years, she could not afford insurance. She had a small orchard  farm. She couldn't afford insurance. When she got sick, she went to the  emergency room. She was able to get along.   But she knew that, as she approached 50 years of age, she would be  facing a bad medical situation, and she did. She had cancer. She  couldn't get a policy prior to the Affordable Care Act because she had  a preexisting condition: she had cancer. Emergency rooms are not  treating that. She wasn't able to get on a program, and she was going  to die.   About that time, we established, in California, a covered California  program that is an exchange based upon the Affordable Care Act. She,  because of her income, was able to get a comprehensive insurance policy  and a subsidy for her premium. She then had quality insurance, and she  was able to get the cancer treatment because her insurance had no  preexisting conditions and she was able to afford it. She had to pay a  little bit, but she had a subsidy that made up the difference.    She is now looking at a situation, because she is in that age 50 to  65, where she will not be able to afford a $12,000- or $14,000-a-year  premium because the subsidies were taken out and because of this age  tax, the 1-to-5 ratio rather than the 1-to-3 ratio. It is horrific. She  knows what she is facing. She is facing the loss of her insurance and,  quite possibly, the loss of her life.   This is wrong. This is wrong.   I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for joining us tonight. I  yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I see that my colleague from the great  State of Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) has arrived. Often we have shared time on  the floor. Ms. Kaptur, if you would care to share with us your thoughts  on the Affordable Care Act as it exists. I know in your area it is a  very important attribute in an area that has been known as the Rust  Belt, and the effect of TrumpCare, RyanCare, on your citizens.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    I thank the gentlewoman so very much for joining us.  She asked a little bit about the health care. I am going to do this  very quickly, then I want to turn to my colleague from the State of  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).   Under TrumpCare, or Ryan-TrumpCare, as I would like to call it, these  huge tax cuts for millions of families, let's just focus on that for a  second. It is the largest shift of wealth from the working men and  women of America, poor and up through the middle class, to the  wealthiest that has ever occurred in any tax break. The Reagan taxes,  you name the taxes, including the Bush W. taxes, this is the largest  single shift of wealth. It is well over $300 billion in the next 9  years.   As I have said before, the 400 wealthiest families, as I said, four  of whom are now the President and three in the Trump cabinet, will get  over $7 million a year in reductions in their taxes. In addition to  that, the top one-tenth of 1 percent will receive over--well, nearly a  $200,000 reduction in their taxes. That is the top one-tenth of 1  percent.   Beyond that, $300 billion will go to the wealthy. The top 20 percent  of Americans will get 75 percent of the tax breaks. The remaining 80  percent of Americans will then share the remaining very small  percentage.   So it is part of this enormous shift of wealth, and this does not  take into account the fact that Americans are going to pay a whole lot  more for their insurance. So, in addition to the tax cuts, there is  also this issue of having higher rates, less benefits going forward.   So just to repeat again, the top one-tenth of 1 percent will receive  nearly $200,000 a year in tax breaks. The top 1 percent will get 57  percent. The top 20 percent get 75 percent of the 300-plus billion  dollar tax cut, and everybody else, in this case, the lower 90 percent,  will then share in the remaining 43 percent. Different ways of looking  at these numbers.   The fact of the matter is, it is a tax cut that guts the money  necessary for Medicare expansion and for the tax subsidies that people  count on in order to survive. It is obscene.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    I thank the gentlewoman for bringing us the view from  Ohio. Let's now talk about the view from Arizona. Mr. O'Halleran, this  being your first year in Congress, welcome. I am delighted to have you  join us on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran) so very much. The stories from the gentleman's constituents  echoed across all of our constituencies, all across America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa),  who is from the Central Valley.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. Costa) very much for his excellent presentation. The gentleman  covered many of the issues.   I want to wrap up with just a couple of thoughts.   One of my Republican friends came up to me earlier today. He said: I  don't understand. I don't understand what our team is doing. All we are  doing is changing the name and hurting people.   I thought about that for a few moments, and, yes, it is Ryan or  TrumpCare, but people are going to be hurt all across this Nation.   One more story, and I think we will probably wrap up here, and that  is of my wife's hairstylist. She is a young lady, married, private  businessowner, trying to get along, and not enough money to buy  insurance. The Affordable Care Act goes into place. She looks at the  exchange, and she is able to get comprehensive insurance, maternity  care, and at an affordable price because of the subsidies that are  built into it. She was so happy when she talked to my wife.   She said: I have insurance. For the first time in my life, I am able  to buy insurance, and I am going to get pregnant. I am going to have  the baby that my husband and I have always wanted because now we have  insurance--not just for myself, but for my child and my husband.   The next visit, she is asking: They are not going to take it away,  are they? They are not going to take it away, are they?   Well, yes, for 14 million Americans--next year, 2018, 9 months from  now, 14 million Americans will begin to lose their insurance. I am not  sure if this young lady will be among them or the farm lady that I  talked about earlier, but they are at risk all across America--14  million people in less than 1 year, and then, beyond that, over the  ensuing years, 24 million Americans.   It has been argued that the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral.  I was an insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and that is  not true. It is an alternate fact. The fact of the matter is that the  Affordable Care Act is working--not without some problems here and  there, but it is working. It is not in a death spiral.   That is probably a good place to leave it, except this TrumpCare-- RyanCare--is a problem. You are going to pay more and you are going to  get less--24 million people, an age tax on seniors, and a huge tax  break for the superwealthy in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 27 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 22, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
