 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of clean water and in support of  the Clean Water Act, and in opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over  people act.   Clean water is a basic human right--the health and safety of our  communities and the success of our economy depends on it. House  Democrats stand for clean water.   Last Congress, we passed a historic and bipartisan investment in our  Nation's infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The  BIL included almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure upgrades  and is creating jobs in communities across the country.   The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, is one of the most successful  environmental laws in our Nation's history. It  [[Page H1509]]  has protected rivers, lakes, and streams from pollution and  contamination, ensuring that we have access to clean and safe water.   Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows States to review projects  that could impact their water quality. For 50 years, States have used  this authority to protect their water resources, and it has helped them  ensure that projects move forward only if clean water would not be  compromised as a result.   These proposals that are in H.R. 1, to narrow the scope of section  401, are a misguided effort at permitting reform. By limiting the  ability of States to review projects, we are sacrificing the health of  our communities and our environment for the sake of expedience and  profit.   I recognize the majority's interest in ensuring that permitting  requirements are not insurmountable barriers to investment. I share the  goal of speeding up project delivery.   Last Congress, I supported not only the BIL, but also the CHIPS Act  and the Inflation Reduction Act. These laws showed what Congress is  capable of when it focuses on addressing the real needs of American  families. I want these laws and their investments to be successful.   However, to quickly put these investments to work, we need a robust  partnership between the Federal Government and its State and local  partners and Tribal partners, to address State, local, and Tribal  requirements, and to ensure community buy-in before these investments  are implemented.   To be effective, that process must build on a mutual trust between  the parties because any effort to force that process often results in  opposition, delay, and litigation.   Yet, H.R. 1 misses the mark by stifling local participation and buy- in, which will only result in these projects taking longer to  implement.   In fact, State organizations, such as the Western States Water  Council, believe that placing arbitrary and strict limits on section  401 application review times and processes will require the States ``to  issue an increased number of denials, due to inflexible deadlines that  do not accommodate State public engagement laws or allow sufficient  time to gather adequate information on project impacts.''   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1, and reject the  efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act and our Nation's other bedrock  environmental laws. We must protect our water resources for future  generations and for the health of today's communities and families.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), one more person  who appreciates the most important natural resource we have, and that  is our clean water.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Chairman, we know that this side of the  aisle is not trying to shut down domestic energy production.   In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act made a major investment in clean  energy production in the United States to expand the use of renewable  energies and renewable energy production. That is one reason why I want  people to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1 because this bill removes some of those  incentives.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  State (Ms. Strickland), who is another person who is strongly against  this bill.                                time  1815     Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time. H.R. 1, the bill before us today, is permitting reform in name  only, putting polluters who want to fast-track special projects ahead  of the public's interests. It includes unnecessary and unwarranted  giveaways to fossil fuel and mining industries, and this polluters over  people act also repeals historic investment in clean energy and climate  change investments passed by the previous Congress.   I agree with the administration's statement on this bill, which  called for working in a bipartisan manner to address lowering energy  costs and working in a bipartisan manner to reform the permitting  process and to address our energy challenges.   I know my colleagues want to speed up project delivery, and I share  that goal, but it is not going to be achieved through H.R. 1.   In the last Congress, the House and Senate reached a historic  agreement to restore, upgrade, and advance our Nation's interconnected  infrastructure networks through the bipartisan infrastructure law,  including major investments in improving clean water infrastructure.   A ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1 begins to pull back on our ability to  maintain the promise of those investments. I urge my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to consider what real bipartisan work on  permitting reform would look like.    Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
