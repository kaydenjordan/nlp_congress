 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the plan to  repeal the ACA. A recent analysis of this plan concludes that 10  million people would lose their health insurance. That is mainly due to  the fact that the plan would stop Medicaid expansion and shorten the  Medicare trust fund.   Many people in my district would be affected by this plan. 68,000 of  my constituents are covered by the Medicaid expansion, 23,000  constituents receive assistance to afford health insurance through the  exchange. If the ACA is repealed and the new plan implemented,  thousands of my constituents, my neighbors, and my friends would lose  their coverage.   But don't just take my word for it or my constituents' word for it.  Let's ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to look at the  plan carefully and to give a report as to who and how many people it  will affect. If you are going to take on something that affects so many  Americans, then America deserves to know how our health care and our  lives will be impacted by your plan.
