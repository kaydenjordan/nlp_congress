 Madam Speaker, I am grateful to SC  Health and their President, Alex Szkaradek, and their general counsel,  John Pincelli, for their generous donation of 10,000 protective masks  to defeat the Wuhan virus. I had the opportunity to distribute them at  the West Columbia City Hall, welcomed by Mayor Tem Miles and Columbia  Mayor Steve Benjamin. We were also joined by Lexington Sheriff Jay  Koon, and representatives of Richland Sheriff Leon Lott, Aiken Sheriff  Mike Hunt, and Orangeburg Sheriff Leroy Ravenell.   Masks were provided to chambers of commerce for small businesses  represented by Carl Blackstone of Columbia, Richard Skipper of West  Columbia, Mike Taylor of Batesburg-Leesville, Rebecca Hines of Chapin,  Miriam Atria of Lake Murray, Terra Carroll of North Augusta, and Phil  Frye of Blythewood.   The private sector, not just government, is making a difference.   In conclusion, God Bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
