 Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentlewoman from South  Dakota talk about all the stories that she could tell. Sadly, that is  what our Republican friends have done. They want to tell stories  cherry-picked, but they are afraid to have hearings from the people  whom this affects. We haven't heard from the experts, from the  academics, and from people in business. They were afraid to have  hearings on their tax bill, rushing it through, and they didn't even  know what was in it. Now they are doubling down, adding another  trillion dollars of debt without having a foundation factually to let  the people know what is going on.   Look at their budget. They have declared war on Social Security and  on Medicare. They understand that it is not sustainable. The tax cuts  don't pay for themselves. They are putting at risk things that America  cares about like Social Security and like Medicare--fundamental issues  that matter.   I hope that if the American public entrusts us with the control of  Congress next year that we will go forward, listen to them, make it  transparent, and base it on facts.
