 Madam Speaker, it is great to see the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) come together with the ranking member.   Congressman Doggett and I introduced legislation 3 weeks ago. This  completes what we had. I am sorry that we were unable to move forward,  but I am pleased that the White House now feels comfortable moving  forward with this legislation.   It is important that we are moving in concert with our allies, but I  think we need that sense of urgency, based on what we heard again  yesterday from President Zelenskyy.   What we have done in Congress with the administration has damaged the  Russian economy for decades, watching what has happened in terms of the  collapse of the ruble, the cratering of their stock market, raising the  cost of living for ordinary Russians, not just chasing the yachts of  the oligarchs.   We have a quarter of the WTO that accounts for about 58 percent of  the global domestic product. Moving to suspend this MFN standing means  the Russian economy will face higher tariff rates, export bans,  investment restrictions, export licensing requirements, customs  hurdles, restrictions on cross-border services, and unequal treatment  for intellectual property and rules of origin.   All of these further cripple the Russian economy. This is another  tightening of that noose, sending a signal.   I hope there is more that we can do economically in terms of weapons,  maybe even find a way to get MiGs to the Ukrainians without starting  World War III.   But in the meantime, it is critical to move forward, to finish the  job we started 3 weeks ago. I am pleased to support it.
