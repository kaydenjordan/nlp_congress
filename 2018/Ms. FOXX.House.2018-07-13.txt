 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 50.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, in 1995, Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act, or UMRA, to prevent the imposition of burdensome and costly  Federal unfunded mandates. Over the course of this Congress, the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee has developed a record that  clearly shows UMRA has fallen short of its original goals.   Last year, the committee sought input on UMRA and received several  hundred responses from Governors, State legislators, and county  officials regarding the impact of Federal laws and regulations.   Too often, State and local governments are confronted with the rotten  choice of raising taxes on their residents or cutting services  residents depend on in order to comply with Federal mandates. Unfunded  federal mandates strain State and local budgets, and subvert the  principles of American federalism.   Federal agencies treat States as servants to their regulatory whims,  rather than as partners to consult before imposing new, burdensome  mandates.   In an April 2017 hearing, a Kentucky county executive testified that  Federal agencies treat their responsibilities under UMRA as an exercise  to ``check a box,'' rather than an opportunity to engage in a  meaningful intergovernmental partnership.   H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, is  designed to solve these problems. It will improve the quality of  regulatory and legislative analysis and close the current loophole  which allows an agency to bypass UMRA analysis by not issuing a notice  of proposed rulemaking.   According to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, 35  percent of major rules are issued without a notice of proposed  rulemaking. That means more than one-third of the regulations with the  greatest impact on the economy are excluded from UMRA's cost-benefit  and other analyses.   H.R. 50 also expands the definition of direct costs to ensure  economic analysis considers foregone profits, costs passed on to  consumers, and behavioral changes.   Requiring Federal regulatory agencies and the Congressional Budget  Office to include all anticipated costs in cost estimates will help  ensure that analyses are complete and provide an accurate description  of the full effects of regulations and legislation.   H.R. 50 enhances transparency, accountability, and communication  between the Federal Government and State, local, Tribal, or private  sector partners. It requires Federal agencies to engage in a more  thorough regulatory process by codifying key provisions of President  Clinton's Executive Order 12866. These principles were reaffirmed by  President Obama in Executive Order 13563 and are consistent with  President Trump's executive orders on regulatory reform.   Under UMRA, agencies are required to consult with State, local, and  Tribal governments when developing significant regulatory mandates.  H.R. 50 extends this requirement to the private sector, which is  similarly burdened by unfunded Federal regulatory mandates.   The bill also requires independent agencies like the Consumer Product  Safety Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal  Communications Commission to comply with UMRA.   Finally, H.R. 50 extends judicial review to help ensure agencies  carefully consider the least costly and least burdensome regulatory  alternative, giving courts the authority to stay regulations for  noncompliance with UMRA. These changes are critical to achieving what  Congress set out to do when UMRA was passed in 1995.   Requiring greater transparency and improving analysis prior to  imposing Federal mandates is not a partisan goal. State and local  governments headed by Republicans and Democrats  [[Page H6180]]  alike are affected by unfunded Federal mandates.   Businesses throughout the country have invested time and resources to  comply with Federal mandates. With such a sweeping impact, any decision  to impose a Federal mandate should, at a minimum, be transparent and  based on the most comprehensive and accurate information available.   It is for this reason that our bill is supported by a vast coalition  of nonpartisan, nonprofit organizations made up of United States State  and local government officials.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters from these coalitions,  which includes the United States Conference of Mayors, the National  League of Cities, the International City/County Management Association,  the National Association of Counties, the Council of State Governments,  the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National  Governors Association.                                                           NFIB,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2018.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Foxx: On behalf of the National       Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's       leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing in       support of H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and       Transparency Act of 2017. This legislation makes critical       improvements to the regulatory review process.        In a recent NFIB National Small Business Poll, almost half       of small businesses surveyed viewed regulation as a ``very       serious'' (25 percent) or ``somewhat serious'' (24 percent)       problem. Additionally, 51 percent of small business owners       reported an increase in the number of regulations impacting       their business over the previous three years.        H.R. 50 requires that federal agencies abide by explicit       criteria when assessing potential impacts of regulatory       actions, and further stipulates that the cumulative impacts       of the regulatory burden be considered. The legislation       enhances Congressional authority in regulatory oversight,       requiring agencies to review existing regulations upon the       request of a committee chair or ranking member. In addition,       the legislation transfers authority under the current       unfunded mandates law from the Office of Management and       Budget (OMB) to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory       Affairs (OIRA), whose staff is better equipped to handle such       work.        Thank you for leading on this important legislation. We       look forward to working with you on reforming the regulatory       process as the 115th Congress moves forward.            Sincerely,                                                 Juanita D. Duggan,      President & CEO, NFIB.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports H.R. 50, the ``Unfunded Mandates       Information and Transparency Act of 2017.''        The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires       agencies to undertake a qualitative and quantitative       assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the       federal mandate before promulgating a final rule. For rules       costing over $100 million, UMRA requires the agency to       identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory       alternatives and select the least costly, most cost-      effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the       objectives of the rule. Alternatively, the head of the agency       must publish with the final rule an explanation of why the       least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome method       of achieving the rule's objectives was not chosen.        However, agencies routinely engineer the regulatory process       to avoid UMRA's requirements. The Government Accountability       Office has found that many statutes and final rules       containing significant unfunded mandates were enacted or       published without being identified as federal mandates at or       above UMRA's thresholds. Worst of all, there is no mechanism       to obtain meaningful judicial review for UMRA violations, so       agencies can easily get away with skirting the law's       requirements.        H.R. 50 would fix many of these problems. It would close       loopholes that agencies use to circumvent UMRA and provide       for enhanced stakeholder participation, meaningful UMRA       oversight, and judicial review. The bill would also enhance       the ability of Congress to identify unfunded mandates in       legislation it considers. The Chamber urges you to vote in       favor of this bipartisan legislation, and to report it to the       full House as expeditiously as practicable.            Sincerely,      Neil L. Bradley.                                   ____                                                     March 13, 2018.      Re The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act           (H.R. 50/S. 1523).       Hon. Ron Johnson,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland, Security and           Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.           Washington, DC.      Hon. Claire McCaskill,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and           Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Oversight and Government           Reform, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Johnson and McCaskill and Representatives       Gowdy and Cummings: On behalf of the Big 7, a coalition of       national organizations representing state and local       officials, we applaud your efforts to make improvements to       the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995. Monitoring       federal regulations and planning for unfunded mandates       continues to be one of the most pressing issues for state and       local leaders. In particular, we support strengthening the       required analysis of pending legislation and your call for a       strong regulatory look-back process. This additional       information is critical for improving both the legislative       and regulatory processes.        As you know, UMRA was designed to limit the imposition of       unfunded federal mandates on state, local, and tribal       governments by requiring the Congressional Budget Office and       regulatory agencies to provide a qualitative and quantitative       assessment of the anticipated costs of legislation and       certain regulations, respectively. As UMRA begins its third       decade, the goal of curbing ``the practice of imposing       unfunded Federal mandates on State and local governments'' is       even more important.        A past report by the White House Office of Management and       Budget stated federal regulations and unfunded mandates cost       states, cities and the general public between $44 and $62       billion each year. With many states and local governments       facing revenue restrictions and growing local financial       burdens, the federal government should avoid imposing any new       unfunded mandates. Moreover, federal regulatory agencies       should work more closely with state and local governments and       other stakeholders during the rule-making process to gather       input and identify practical solutions.        We commend you for your leadership in advocating the       enactment of this legislation, and we look forward to working       with you and your staff to ensure its passage.            Sincerely,      David Adkins,        CEO and Executive Director, The Council of State       Governments.      Matthew D. Chase,        Executive Director, National Association of Counites.      Scott Pattison,        Executive Director, National Governors Association.      Clarence Anthony,        CEO and Executive Director, National League of Cities.      Marc Ott,        Executive Director, International City/County Management       Association.      William T. Pound,        Executive Director, National Conference of State       Legislatures.      Tom Cochran,        CEO and Executive Director, The U.S. Conference of Mayors.     Mr. Chairman, H.R. 50 ensures the commonsense goals  Congress intended when enacting UMRA in 1995 are in fact realized and  improved upon. I thank the bipartisan group of Members who cosponsored  and support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 50, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                    Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2018.      Hon. Steve Womack,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 15, 2018, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 50, the       Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2017,       with an amendment, by recorded vote. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, with additional referrals to the Committees on       Budget, Rules, and the Judiciary.  [[Page H6181]]         I ask you allow the Committee on the Budget to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill to expedite       floor consideration. This discharge in no way affects your       jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will       not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition,       should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support       your request to have the Committee on the Budget represented       on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to       include this letter and any response in the bill report filed       by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well       as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,      Trey Gowdy.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency       Act of 2017.        The bill contains provisions that fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to       expedite House consideration of H.R. 50, the Committee on the       Budget will forgo action on the bill. This is being done with       the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the       Committee with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this or similar legislation. I also ask that the Committee on       the Budget be appropriately consulted and involved as this       bill or similar legislation moves forward so that the       Committee may address any remaining issues that fall within       its jurisdiction. The Committee on the Budget also reserves       the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation. I also request that you include this       letter and your response as part of your committee's report       on H.R. 50 and in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration.        Thank you for your attention to these matters. I look       forward to working with you as this bill moves through the       Congress.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Womack,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                     Washington, DC, June 27, 2018.      Hon. Pete Sessions,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 15, 2018, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 50, the       Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2017,       with an amendment, by recorded vote. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, with additional referrals to the Committees on       Budget, Rules, and the Judiciary.        I ask you allow the Committee on Rules to be discharged       from further consideration of the bill to expedite floor       consideration. This discharge in no way affects your       jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will       not serve as precedent for future referrals.

Hon. Trey Gowdy      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for your letter on H.R. 50,       the Unfunded Mandate and Information Technology Act of 2017,       which your Committee ordered reported on March 15, 2018.        Because of your willingness to consult with my committee       regarding this matter, I will waive consideration of the bill       by the Rules Committee. By agreeing to waive its       consideration of the bill, the Rules Committee does not waive       its jurisdiction over H.R. 50. In addition, the Committee on       Rules reserves its authority to seek conferees on any       provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction       during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on       this legislation. I ask your commitment to support any       request by the Committee on Rules for conferees on H.R. 50 or       related legislation.        I also request that you include this letter and your       response as part of your Committee's report on the bill and       in the Congressional Record during consideration of the       legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention       to these matters.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of       2017.

Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: I write with respect to H.R. 50, the       ``Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act.'' As a       result of your having consulted with us on provisions within       H.R. 50 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 50 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 50 and would ask that       a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 50.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, we have often heard that the most dangerous words or  the most dangerous phrase in the English language is, ``We are from the  Federal Government, and we are here to help.'' I agree with that.   Everywhere I go in my district, I hear from people, It isn't the laws  that we pass, it's the regulations that implement those laws that are  the biggest problems.   Unfortunately, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  believe that government bureaucrats are the smartest people in the  world. In fact, they are smarter than the majority of the American  people who make this country great.   We absolutely do not want to do away with all rules and regulations.  We want safe food. We want safe drinking water. We want all those  things that help make this country great, but we want to bring some  common sense and some transparency to the regulatory process. That is  what H.R. 50 does.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that independent agencies  need oversight as much as any other agencies. They already submit  regulatory products to the Office of Management and Budget and the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, including  information collection requests under the Paperwork Reduction Act.   The Administrative Conference of the United States has recommended  greater oversight of independent agencies for decades. The American Bar  Association did the same in 1990 and reaffirmed the need in 2016  saying: ``We strongly urge you to bring the independent regulatory  commissions within the requirements for cost-benefit analysis and  retrospective review of rules currently reflected in Executive Order  12866 and Executive Order 13563.''   I want to point out that both of these executive orders were  promulgated by Democrat Presidents.   In 2011, Sally Katzen, OIRA Administrator under the Clinton  administration, urged expanded oversight of independent agencies. She  wrote: ``Our concern is that independent agencies are not typically  engaged in the analysis that has come to be expected as a form of  governmental best practices for regulatory agencies.''   This bill simply requires independent agencies to undertake the same  cost-benefit analysis and reporting requirements as other regulatory  agencies. There is no threat to their independence.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cuellar).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time and allow  the gentleman from Virginia to close.     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, we have heard time and again of the burdens the Federal  Government imposes on State, local, and Tribal governments. We have  also heard from businesses throughout the country, both large and  small, that have to forego investments in employees and infrastructure  in order to comply with these mandates.   Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in 1995 to require  the Federal Government to think twice before imposing unfunded  mandates. And let me say, that bill passed, I believe, with unanimous  support from both the House and the Senate. If not unanimous, it was  overwhelming, over 400 votes in the House and, I believe, 98 votes in  the Senate.   Of course, in the 23 years since passage, the bureaucrats in the  Federal  [[Page H6185]]  Government have found ways around many of those requirements. As I  pointed out in my opening remarks, the GAO has reported that 35  percent, more than one-third of major rules, are issued without a  notice of proposed rulemaking so that the public has no idea what is  coming out in the rulemaking in advance. It is time to make sure UMRA  works as Congress intended.   Again, I am fascinated sometimes by my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle who don't want to take responsibility for our actions and  want to give over the running of the entire government to the executive  branch. It makes absolutely no sense to me. I am not sure why some run  for office if they don't want to take on their responsibilities.   Legislative and regulatory decisions should be made in consideration  of all of the available information, not just part of it. The  government should consider every option before imposing unnecessary  burdens on the States, localities, and even private enterprise.   H.R. 50 closes UMRA's loopholes and enhances transparency,  accountability, and communication between the Federal Government and  State, local, Tribal, and private sector partners.   We do not do away with all rulemaking. We do not want to make food,  water, housing, all those things that are regulated for the good of the  American people, we don't want to do away with those. We simply want to  have more transparency and understand the cost of the regulations.   H.R. 50 codifies bipartisan regulatory principles, enhances required  analysis, adds independent agencies to the cost-benefit analysis  requirements, extends judicial review to hold agencies accountable, and  improves stakeholder consultation.   I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike a key provision  of H.R. 50, requiring independent agencies to comply with UMRA.   The purpose of H.R. 50 is to require comprehensive analysis before  agencies impose unfunded mandates on State, local, or Tribal  governments and the private sector.   Regulations must be fully analyzed and imposed only after impacted  parties have been consulted. That should be the case whether the  regulations come from a Cabinet department or an independent agency.   From fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 2016, independent agencies  issued 275 major rules. Those rules imposed significant costs on our  economy and often included mandates on State, local, and Tribal  governments and the private sector, just the same as rules that came  from non-independent agencies.   Because independent agencies are excluded from UMRA, excluded from  regulatory process requirements in Executive Order No. 12866, and  excluded from review by the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs, few independent agencies conduct cost-benefit analyses.   In FY 2016, independent agencies issued 18 major regulations, but  only a third of those rules included monetized cost analysis and not  one rule included any analysis of monetized benefits.   The cost-benefit analyses required by UMRA are essential for a  transparent and accountable regulatory system, and eliminating section  5 would be inconsistent with the intent of H.R. 50. This bill seeks to  close loopholes, not preserve them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the real goal of this bill is to require  transparency on the part of independent agencies and not to have a  nefarious impact on those independent agencies.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this amendment.   This amendment requires a record of any consultation with a non- Federal party and requires agencies to post any comments submitted by a  non-Federal party to their website within 5 days.   Transparency is a bipartisan priority and is a key feature of many  regulatory process requirements.   For instance, the Administrative Procedures Act generally requires  Federal agencies to publish their proposed rules in the Federal  Register for all to see and to give the public an opportunity to  comment. Rulemaking dockets and public comments are increasingly  available for public inspection online.   Groups, such as the Administrative Conference of the United States,  have recommended that records of consultations and ex parte  communications be disclosed and made a part of the rulemaking docket.   H.R. 50 seeks to introduce greater transparency in the regulatory  process, and this amendment is consistent with that split.   I thank the gentleman from Maryland for offering the amendment and  for working with me to expand its application and increase  transparency.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP  remains below 5 percent over the first four quarters after enactment.   H.R. 50 is not intended to raise the GDP. It is intended to ensure  the Federal Government does not impose costs on State, local, and  Tribal governments and the private sector without consulting those  entities that are impacted by the regulation. The GDP does not reflect  how a given regulatory mandate affects a particular government or  private sector industry.   However, this amendment would tie the GDP to the future of the entire  bill. H.R. 50 gives the private sector an opportunity to give Federal  agencies information about how to craft reasonable and effective  regulation. After all, State, local, and Tribal governments and private  sector entities are often in the best position to anticipate how a  proposed regulation will affect their operations.   H.R. 50 will help to ensure regulations that impose unfunded mandates  are adequately analyzed in order to make these mandates the most  effective and least burdensome they can be.   I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, we, on our side of the aisle, join our  colleague in stating our absolute abhorrence to domestic violence and  sexual assault in this country. None of us want to see any incidents of  sexual assault, domestic violence, or assault on children, obviously.   What we are concerned about, and what this bill can help do, is to  help our local police and law enforcement have better opportunities to  help to fight these terrible, terrible situations. I thank our  colleague for her leadership in working with us on this side of the  aisle and with all of us who have had a bipartisan effort on sex  trafficking and sexual assault.   But, Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit. We have been  analyzing, debating, and voting on this bill to update the unfunded  mandates reform for years. When UMRA was enacted 23 years ago, it was  an important step to analyze the burdens of Federal legislation and  regulations on State and local governments. But now it needs an update.   H.R. 50 would close loopholes in UMRA, enhance transparency and  accountability, and increase communication with State and local  governments.   Mr. Speaker, if the State and local governments didn't have to spend  so much money on unnecessary things, perhaps they would be able to do  more on the issues my colleague brought up.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill with a bipartisan amendment  from the committee and a bipartisan amendment from the floor. Let's not  let a bipartisan motion stop a fix to decades-old problems in all our  districts, unfunded mandates.   H.R. 50 is good for State and local governments, the Federal  Government, businesses, and, most importantly, it is good for the  public. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit. I  support the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time
