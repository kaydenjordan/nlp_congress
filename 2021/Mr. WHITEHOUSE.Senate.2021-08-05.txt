 Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent  to speak as if in morning business for, let's say, 22 minutes.    Mr. President, these speeches on the scheme by dark  money interests to seize control of the Supreme Court are designed to  describe it in all its repulsive intricacy.   My last speech discussed an operation in this scheme within the  Federalist Society. This speech will take you literally down the hall  from the Federalist Society to something called the Judicial Crisis  Network, or JCN. They share the same purpose, the same hallway, and  likely the same controlling donors.   Remember David Koch's disastrous bid for Vice President on the  Libertarian Party ticket that showed how unappetizing his rightwing  extremism was to normal people. And remember the Lewis Powell playbook,  which advised:         Strength lies in organization . . . and in the political       power available only through united action and national       organizations.   [[Page S5915]]     No one corporation or wealthy individual needs to, as Powell said,  ``get too far out in front and . . . make itself too visible a  target.'' Let intermediaries do that work.   Corporate interests like Big Tobacco and the fossil fuel industry  have, for a long time, used coordinated webs of national front groups  in their plots to fend off accountability for the dangers of tobacco  and carbon emissions.   These front group webs grew and multiplied and specialized, all while  concealing their true interests and funders. They got more numerous,  and they also got smarter and more strategic over time, polishing up  front group names, like the not-too-subtle Tobacco Institute, to names  like the more wholesome-sounding Heartland Institute.   It is quite a web. They created science groups to counter real  scientific research on public health and climate change with fake  science; think tanks to churn out white papers and hire sound bite- friendly fake experts; legal organizations to challenge and delay  government regulation of harmful products; academic hothouses in which  to grow donor-friendly, rightwing judicial philosophies; identity- laundering screens to hide the true donors and controllers and their  interests; and political attack groups to pressure elected officials.  People who study this have reported these groups numbering in multiple  dozens, and their backers play the front groups like keys on a piano.   Apply this method to the scheme to capture the Court, and you see  that the dark money donors needed more than just the nominations  turnstile that they ran out of the Federalist Society. They also needed  a bare-knuckle political brawler.   One night in early 2005, at an upscale Italian dinner, with special  guest Justice Antonin Scalia, major donor and corporate lawyer Ann  Corkery, California real estate tycoon Robin Arkley, and Federalist  Society executive vice president Leonard Leo got together and  celebrated George W. Bush's second term. The political importance of  the Supreme Court would have been on everyone's mind there as it was  the five Republicans on the Supreme Court who gave George W. Bush his  first term.   According to reporting by OpenSecrets and the Daily Beast, this  dinner linked to the creation of a 501(c)(4) dark money group, then  called the Judicial Confirmation Network. By the end of that year, this  group would spend money--lots of money, lots of big donor money--and  they would spend it anonymously, first to boost John Roberts as Chief  Justice and then Samuel Alito as Associate Justice, cementing rightwing  corporate control over the Court and shifting its decisions further in  big donors' favor.   There are a few things to note about the Judicial Confirmation  Network's early days:   One, it began work fast. Just months after starting, JCN ads hit the  air in support of Bush nominees.   Two, it had lots of money. Beginning in 2008, Ann Corkery took  control of something called the Wellspring Committee--a dark money,  identity-laundering group, seeded with funding from Charles and David  Kochs' donor network. Thereafter, Wellspring funneled seven- or eight- figure dark money donations to JCN every year--millions of anonymous  dollars.   Three, they brought on a lawyer with heavy rightwing chops to run the  place. Wendy Long, a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, became  chief counsel and mouthpiece.   Thus, in just a few months, JCN appeared and became a polished,  powerful, anonymized campaigner for the big donor scheme to take over  the Court.   And then came the election of Barack Obama, and JCN had to go from  offense for nominees to defense against nominees. That ``C'' in JCN,  for ``confirmation,'' no longer made much sense, and the scheme now  faced a crisis--the crisis for it of a President nominating judges who  had not been screened by them, judges whose fealty to the corporate  rightwing could not be confirmed, judges who might even rule against  the rightwing donors' agenda. So they quickly rebranded JCN as the  Judicial Crisis Network, but even in the Obama years, the Republican 5- to-4 majority on the captured Court delivered big things for JCN and  its secretive backers.   In the administration's first term, the Roberts Court handed down  Citizens United and other decisions opening donor pipelines to  501(c)(4) groups like JCN. This caused the tsunami of slime we saw in  our politics, and corporations and rightwing donors rushed to the  feast. Anonymous money flooded in. Annual donations laundered through  Wellspring to JCN rose from millions of dollars to many millions of  dollars. JCN even expanded the scheme to seek to influence State  supreme courts and State attorney general seats. The scheme was  flourishing.   Then, on a 2016 all-expenses-paid trip for Justice Scalia to a luxury  hunting ranch in Texas, the Justice died, leaving a Supreme Court  vacancy, with the better part of a year left before the Presidential  election. Now there really was a crisis. The big donors suddenly faced  the prospect of a Democratic President appointing Scalia's replacement,  shifting the balance of the Court 5 to 4 against them, taking away  their precious majority, undoing the scheme.   So the donors swung into action. Within days, Mitch McConnell quickly  pledged to hold the seat open, and within days, Republican Senators  uniformly lined up behind that decision--a decision very possibly  explained by the overlay between dark money donors to the scheme and  dark money donors to Republican Senate political operations. History  will have to judge the extent of that overlay.   In any event, dark money funding of JCN hit escape velocity during  this period. According to tax records obtained by OpenSecrets and  others, JCN received big donations in fiscal year 2015 to 2016. One  single anonymous donation alone totaled $17.9 million. Wellspring  separately channeled $23.5 million in dark money to JCN in 2016, then  another $14.8 million the next year. When Wellspring dissolved in 2018,  big slugs of dark money continued to flow through other conduits. JCN  received four separate, individual, anonymous donations, each of $15  million or more following Justice Scalia's death. We cannot say for  sure because the donors hide behind the dark money screen, but these  donations, over $60 million in all, could well have all come from the  same donor.    And one wonders, what are the odds that someone willing to spend $60  million anonymously to influence the makeup of the Supreme Court is  someone who has business before the Court?   Pretty high, I would say, but dark money scheming keeps this  information secret.   How did JCN spend all this money? Attack. Leonard Leo's Federalist  Society operation had handed Trump a list of approved nominees. JCN  spending poured into TV ads, pressuring Senators, and to media blitzes  to sell the Federalist Society list. The group spent $7 million to  attack Merrick Garland; $10 million to boost Neil Gorsuch; $10 million  or more to prop up Brett Kavanaugh's deeply troubled nomination with  its--now we know--fake FBI tip line; and $10 million in under 2 months  to support Amy Coney Barrett.   On its own, this anonymous $37 million barrage smells terrible, but  it is only part of the Judicial Crisis Network operation. JCN has a  corporate twin, the Judicial Education Project, each group backing up  the actions and finances of the other. Let me walk you through this  setup because it is a capsule summary of how political scheming is  accomplished in our corrupted dark money era.   First, you pair a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4). The Judicial Crisis  Network was chartered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, the Judicial  Education Project as its allied 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Under  a perverse reading of the law, the 501(c)(4) organization is allowed to  operate as a dark money political attack group. We see this arrangement  commonly now in the clandestine world of dark money politics.   In fact, a recent Supreme Court case about dark money was brought by  a group called Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which was the  501(c)(3) associated with Americans for Prosperity, which is the Koch  brothers' 501(c)(4) that spent millions of dollars to help Amy Coney  Barrett get her seat, and yet she didn't recuse herself from the case  involving the 501(c)(3).   So, second, you operate the two as one unit: Judicial Crisis Network  and  [[Page S5916]]  Judicial Education Project are connected by staff, by dollars, and by  location.   According to the most recent tax records, long-serving JCN staffer  Carrie Severino is also the sole and principal officer of--you guessed  it--the Judicial Education Project. Severino is not listed on JCN's tax  forms, but she serves as its public-facing ``chief counsel and policy  director.'' JCN and JEP tax records both list the same address in  Washington, DC, which, by the way, is right down the hall from the  Federalist Society at the same address, and both groups share day-to- day staff. There is a doctrine in the law called piercing the corporate  veil. In this case, the corporate veil between these two is a web of  holes.   What is the next thing you do? You soak up dark money together.   It is hard to know much about these two groups' dark money funding-- that is why they keep it dark--but we know the Wellspring Committee has  funded both groups. Both have also paid money to something called BH  Group, which is a mysterious LLC that Leonard Leo once disclosed as his  employer, that made a $1 million mystery donation to Trump's inaugural.  It seems to do no other business. They used the 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)  status precisely because it lets them hide their donors and  controllers.   And the last thing is that you get to play shell games with your  name. A couple of years ago, those two organizations formally changed  their legal names in Virginia. Now, follow this for a minute. Judicial  Crisis Network changed its name, and it became the Concord Fund.  Judicial Education Project changed its name, and it became the 85 Fund.   The Concord Fund then registered its old name, Judicial Crisis  Network, as what is called a fictitious name, a kind of corporate alias  under Virginia law, and continued to operate as the Judicial Crisis  Network.   Here is the Virginia law that allows them to do that:         A fictitious name is a name that a person (individual or       business entity) uses instead of the person's true name,       usually in the course of transacting or offering to transact       business.    It also registered the name ``Honest Elections Project Action'' as an  additional fictitious name to carry out a new voter suppression  project. The 85 Fund likewise registered its old name, the ``Judicial  Education Project,'' as a fictitious name, and it separately registered  as the ``Honest Elections Project'' as an additional fictitious name.   It gets even better than this because, as I said before, when the  Washington Post exposed the $250 million scheme that Leonard Leo was at  the center of to pack and control the Supreme Court, to capture it like  a captured agency, he wasn't much use any longer. He was like a blown  agent in a covert operation. He had to go someplace. Where did he hop  to? He hopped from the Federalist Society to the Honest Elections  Project so he could get to work on the Presiding Officer's favorite  cause, voter suppression. Same guy, same corporate network, new name,  and new purpose: voter suppression.   As if this weren't enough, both of these groups have now filed new  fictitious names. This is to help them wade into the rightwing fuss  over what the rightwing likes to call critical race theory. So the  Concord Fund has now added the fictitious name ``Free to Learn  Action,'' and the 85 Fund has now added the fictitious name ``Free to  Learn.'' Again, you see the pairing of the 501(c)(3) and the 501(c)(4)  as part of the basic structure for dark money political influence  operations.   By the way, the same person filled out all these forms for both  organizations and is listed with various titles on each.   So now we have one group that calls itself the Concord Fund that  operates simultaneously as the Judicial Crisis Network, the Honest  Elections Project Action, and the Free to Learn Action, and we have a  sister organization, the 85 Fund, that operates simultaneously as the  Judicial Education Project, the Honest Elections Project, and Free to  Learn--all with overlapping staff, locations, and funding.   By the way, when you are the funder of these groups, you are their  controller.   Now, imagine this level of complexity multiplied many times over,  because that is what the Washington Post disclosed. And I borrow a  photograph from their video of their investigation.   That Washington Post expose on the covert court-capture operation  exposed the Judicial Crisis Network as one part, just one part of a  massive--there it is, Judicial Crisis Network--one part of a massive  web of groups, a web of groups that took in over $250 million in dark  money between 2014 and 2017.   This effort to capture the Supreme Court? They are not kidding  around. Spending $250 million in dark money is a serious investment  that demands a serious return. And guess what. Expert testimony before  my Senate Courts Subcommittee has since raised that number to $400  million through 2018.   Through all these allied and coordinated front groups--the keys on  the dark money piano that the big donors can play in chords and singly  as they wish--dark money donors can, from hiding, covertly channel tens  if not hundreds of millions of dollars in anonymized money toward the  scheme's court-capture goals.   Colleagues, this is a scheme akin in complexity and trade craft to an  intelligence agency covert operation--only this one is not being run by  one country against another; this one is being run in and against our  own country by a handful of creepy billionaires and their foundations,  trying to impose their self-serving ideology on the rest of us through  our least democratic branch--the branch that doesn't care if normal  people hate this stuff because they are in robes for life. That is our  Federal courts, and particularly, it is our Supreme Court.   The big dark money donors have pretty well pulled it off, too,  following Lewis Powell's old admonition to use ``strength . . . in  organization'' and ``united action'' of all of this complexity. They  have just made it all clandestine, which is why I am going to keep  digging.   To be continued.   I yield the floor.
