 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise this evening to offer a commonsense  amendment to H.R. 3494.   My amendment simply strikes Section 401, which creates the Climate  Security Advisory Council. And I thank the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan) for his leadership, and also cosponsoring this  particular amendment.   This council is not the most responsible use of the valuable manpower  and funding of the intelligence community, especially since the  Director of National Intelligence did not even request that we create  such an organization. The Federal Government already has vast resources  devoted to the climate issue.   Any climate security intelligence work should be in the context of  larger intelligence matters affecting major regions around the world  and the U.S. national security infrastructure.  [[Page H5893]]    Additionally, many of the existing intelligence organizations already  do much of this work on their own, including the CIA. Section 401 would  just create unneeded redundancy across the intelligence community.   If the goal is to ensure that we allocate our resources efficiently,  we should instead require a report to Congress from the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence outlining the necessity for the  Climate Security Council before Congress establishes the organization  or appropriates any funding.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I want to quote a great American President, Ronald  Reagan.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  be granted 5 minutes in opposition, but I have a little time left.   Madam Chair, I have no objection to the gentleman offering his  opposition to this.    There is 2\1/2\ minutes left. Is that correct?    Madam Chair, I still have 2\1/2\ minutes, is that  correct, because I reserved my time?    Madam Chair, I would like to make a unanimous consent  request that there be an opposition that gets 5 minutes and that I can  close with my 2\1/2\ minutes.   We are trying to be fair here, and we are happy to give our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle 5 minutes to offer their  opposition.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck). I will just take 1 minute to wrap up.    Madam Chair, I have 2\1/2\ minutes. Is that right?    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Madam Chair, 2 minutes in opposition.    Madam Chair, I have 2\1/2\ minutes. I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck). So I have 1 minute  left.    Madam Chair, I think I have 1 minute left.   I thought perhaps the gentleman wanted to support my amendment, but  he called it wrongheaded. I am just shocked.   Madam Chair, in closing, this council is a redundant, unnecessary use  of manpower funding. We need our intelligence community focused on the  most critical threats facing our Nation, specifically,  counterterrorism, Iran, China, Russia, North Korea.   If this council is something that the Director of National  Intelligence believes is critical to our country, he should come to  Congress and make such a request, and to my knowledge, that has not  occurred. Madam Chair, until he does, I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment and remove this provision from the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
