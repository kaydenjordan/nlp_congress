 Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader and  all of those persons in leadership who make it possible for us to have  these opportunities.   I am especially proud to be here tonight because we have two  resolutions that will be presented. These two resolutions have been  presented before. One is H. Res. 154. This resolution is one that  honors and praises the NAACP, the National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People. The second is H. Res. 155. It is a Black  history resolution.   It is interesting to note that the NAACP was founded during Black  History Month. The NAACP was founded February 12, 1909. The NAACP has a  proud history, and I will say more about it in just a moment.   Next, I would like to talk for a brief moment about the resolution  that we have for Black History Month.   Black History Month didn't start out as Black History Month. The  Honorable Carter G. Woodson initiated what was called Negro History  Week. Negro History Week was a time for us to acknowledge the  accomplishments of African Americans, at that time called Negroes. We  have metamorphosed through many titles, many names, from Negroes to  African Americans.   Black History Month was something that Mr. Woodson found to come into  being in 1976. This was done by President Joe Ford. As it has been  designated as Black History Month, we have celebrated it as such across  the length and breadth of this Nation.   Carter G. Woodson was a person with great vision. He obviously knew  that in 1926, when this was initially brought to the attention of the  public, there was not a good likelihood that you would be able to have  a Black History Month. But he knew that, if you can start someplace,  you might finish in a greater place. So he started in 1926 with Black  History Week, and it has metamorphosed into a month.   You and I know that every day is a day that we should celebrate all  history, and Black history is no exception. I am not a person who  believes that we should have Black History Month forever. I think that  Black history, properly incorporated and celebrated within American  history and world history, would be more than enough. But today, we are  honored to celebrate Black History Month and the NAACP as an  organization that was founded during Black History Month.   I would like to say just a few words about this NAACP resolution in  terms of the first time we brought it to the floor of the Congress of  the United States of America.   When we brought it to the floor the very first time, the cosponsor of  the resolution was Mr. Henry Hyde, and the person who controlled the  time was Mr. Jim Sensenbrenner. Mr. Sensenbrenner, at that time, was  the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee. I recall Mr. Sensenbrenner  standing  [[Page H2267]]  over to my right and making his commentary about the NAACP. He spoke  with a degree of fervor that I thought was needed at the time.   Mr. Sensenbrenner, while he brought it to the floor and did direct  the traffic, I would note that it was not an easy resolution to get  past the House of Representatives. It did pass with consent of the  House. It was agreed to, if you will.   Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Hyde had a difficult time getting it  through the House. I am proud that they did, and I am pleased that none  of the Members at that time voiced objections to the resolution being  agreed to. Mr. Sensenbrenner I will always remember as a person who was  a champion for this resolution, and Mr. Hyde was the cosponsor of the  NAACP resolution.    The NAACP is celebrating its 110th anniversary. This is probably the  Nation's oldest and best known civil rights organization, founded on  February 12 of 1909, the date of the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's  birth, the centennial of his birth.   It is interesting to note that Black History Month was considered  because of Abraham Lincoln's birth as well, so the two resolutions have  this in common, Black History Month and the NAACP's being celebrated  and recognized today.   It was founded by a diverse group of persons who were outstanding  citizens. I would also add that it was not founded by a group of  persons all of whom were African American. I will call off the names  for you to give you some indication.   Ida Wells-Barnett, the well-known W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry Moscowitz,  Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William English  Walling--all persons who were founders of the NAACP.   The NAACP, for the early part of its history, had a minority of  minorities, meaning African Americans were not the dominant force  within its leadership. They had persons who were carrying the torch of  freedom such that African Americans could be a part of it. But it is  interesting to note that, early on, the leadership was predominantly  Anglo persons.   The NAACP, as indicated, is the oldest, largest, and most widely  recognized grassroots-based civil rights organization in the United  States. The active membership is in all 50 States, including State  conferences of branches and local branches, as well as branches in  prisons and chapters on college campuses and high schools throughout  the Nation.   The NAACP has its national headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland.   The NAACP is here to ensure the political, educational, social, and  economic rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and  racial discrimination.   The NAACP is committed to achieving its goals through nonviolence,  including negotiation, litigation, and protestation.   The NAACP is well known for its litigation. The Honorable Thurgood  Marshall, an African American to become Supreme Court Justice, was the  chief litigator for the NAACP. Under his leadership, with the  assistance of a good many other people, the NAACP was able to win many  lawsuits before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit Brown v. Board of  Education is one of the most notable lawsuits that the NAACP  championed.   The NAACP has used political pressure, marches, demonstrations, and  effective lobbying to secure the voice for those who are considered  voiceless in the United States of America.   The NAACP has been fighting segregation in public schools under the  leadership of Thurgood Marshall, as I indicated earlier, and its  greatest victories, of course, include, as I indicated, Brown v. Board  of Education.   The NAACP, in 2005, launched the Disaster Relief Fund to help  hurricane survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and  Alabama to rebuild their lives.   So the organization has metamorphosed into one that does more than  champion the causes of civil rights as they relate to persons being  discriminated against. It also champions the causes of those who are  among the least, the last, and the lost in our society: persons who  have been locked out, persons who have been left behind, persons who  but for the NAACP might not have a voice.   I was very honored to be a part of the NAACP's disaster relief help.  I am also honored to have been a branch president of the NAACP in  Houston, Texas.   The NAACP was instrumental in the enactment of the Matthew Shepard  and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which generally and  greatly expanded the legal definition of a hate crime. This was an  important piece of legislation. I was honored to be here at the time we  took up the legislation.   Hate crimes are still crimes that we have to not only acknowledge  exist, but the law ought to have consequences for persons who commit  these dastardly deeds.   Throughout its existence, the NAACP has led the charge to defend the  constitutional right to vote. That is an important piece of commentary,  the right to vote. The NAACP is still a part of the effort to assure  every person the right to vote in this country.   The NAACP has taken on the challenge of dealing with the photo IDs  that are required in an insidious way. It has also taken on the  challenge of making sure that persons are properly registered so that  they can vote, and also making sure that those who would thwart the  efforts to register persons to vote are not successful in doing so.   The NAACP has led the effort to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and  to protect the principle of one person, one vote. The NAACP led the  charge in raising awareness about and challenging voter suppression  laws in Federal courts across the Nation.   The NAACP board of directors unanimously elected Derrick Johnson as  its President and CEO, who is doing an outstanding job. I am proud to  be associated with him and the endeavors.   I am a proud member of the NAACP. I have been such for a good deal of  my life. I am honored to have a life membership, to have a golden  heritage membership, and to have a diamond membership.   I believe those of us who have benefited from the NAACP ought to be  members of the organization that has made it possible for us to have  many of the opportunities that we have. I always acknowledge my  membership in the organization, and I encourage others to do so who  happen to be members as well: the NAACP, a proud organization that we  celebrate during this Black History Month.   The Black history resolution covers more than the NAACP. It talks  about Black migrations. It emphasizes the movement of people of African  descent to new destinations and new social realities. This focuses on,  primarily, the migration of African Americans in this country. It  focuses specifically on the 20th century through today.   It deals with patterns of movement, including the relocation of  persons of African ancestry from Southern farms to Southern cities;  from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West; and from the  Caribbean to the United States. Black people have been in motion in the  20th century and up to this date, and this resolution acknowledges  this.                                time  1630    It also talks about the interactions with law enforcement that often  result in some ugly circumstances, imprisonment and convict leasing.   Convict leasing is something that we should give a little bit more  emphasis to.   In the State of Texas, we recently discovered a grave site containing  95 bodies. These 95 bodies were of persons who were victims of the  State's law that allowed convict leasing.   Many times persons were charged with minor offenses and while they  were incarcerated, they could be leased to private parties for the  purpose of having them work as convicts. And many times--too often, I  might add--the persons who were leased out, were not treated properly.  In fact, they were treated poorly.   Many times they were not given proper food, proper clothing, and  proper shelter; and as a result, many of them died at an early age. In  this grave of 95 persons, there are persons who were thought to have  been teenagers at the time of that death.   We are not absolutely sure they were all African Americans, but the  suspicion is that a good many of them were. Some of them were likely to  have been Anglos as well.   After finding their bodies in Sugar Land, Texas, on the site of a  school,  [[Page H2268]]  school property, the bodies were exhumed, and they were to be relocated  to another place. And in so doing, a good many of the citizens, the  activist community, decided that this was an inappropriate thing to  do--the bodies being exhumed and reinterred at another location.   There was a serious meeting before the school board. And the school  board and the county commissioners, the commissioners court decided  that it would be appropriate to further study the possibility of  inhuming these bodies in the place where they were exhumed.   And my hope is we would follow through on this and give them not only  a burial site with a proper plaque to memorialize their being in this  place, but also to do a little bit more and have some sort of structure  or facility that would allow persons to acquire intelligence about what  actually happened to these people, how they lived, and how they died,  and why.   This country has come a long way, but, of course, we still have much  more to do. But we want to make sure that we do not overlook the  history associated with persons who were leased as convicts to private  persons for the purpose of performing work for them.   This migration that I spoke of earlier, known as the Great Migration,  was caused by a lack of economic opportunities because of harsh  segregation laws in the south and because of the terror that was  perpetrated against African American communities by the KKK.   The KKK, obviously, was active in the south; and the KKK, obviously,  was in the business of terrorizing African American persons. And it is  interesting to note that while this House has condemned a good many  persons for their activities, I have not been able to find a record  showing that the KKK has been condemned for its activities by way of a  resolution that actually focuses on a person who has been associated  with that organization.   The KKK has a horrible history in this country, and it is my hope  that we in the House of Representatives will take up a resolution  condemning this entity for what it has done.   I plan to bring such a resolution to the attention of the House.   This resolution on black history indicates that prior to 1910; more  than 90 percent of African Americans lived in the south. And by the  1970s, 47 percent of all African Americans were living in the north and  in the west.   This is why it is called the Great Migration. When you have this much  of a population moving for opportunities, moving for reasons associated  with concern for their well-being, that is a significant migration.   And during World War I, when slowing immigration from Europe created  a labor shortage in the north, companies began recruiting African  Americans to fill the assembly lines, to work in steel mills and  railroads and factories. It was not unusual to hear persons talk about  ``going up north,'' going up north so that they could have  opportunities in the north that they were unable to acquire in the  south.   African Americans who migrated to the north still faced racial  discrimination in the form of redlining, in the form of racially based  housing ordinances, in the form of higher rent based on race, and for  the resurgence of the KKK, and the rising instances of race riots.   African Americans were not always welcomed with open arms when they  sought to migrate to these new destinations.   African Americans created their own cities and neighborhoods, free of  discrimination, where their culture expanded.   For example, in Harlem, New York City, that housed over 200,000  African Americans, there was a culture that was created there in  Harlem. And we are proud to say that that culture still exists. Harlem  has been a very important part of African American history.   Efforts were made to provide educational opportunities for African  Americans, including the founding of what is now North Carolina Central  University.   Greenwood, Oklahoma, is another part of the history that we ought to  acknowledge. It was a part of Tulsa, and became the home of a thriving  black business--a section also known as Black Wall Street--until the  Tulsa riot of 1921, in which a white mob literally burned down  Greenwood.   U.S. history has some parts of it that we are not proud of, but we do  have to acknowledge.   In Houston, Texas, there is an area known as Freedmen's Town. And  freed slaves were given the opportunity to purchase land and build  their homes along the bayou, known as Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas.  And this was at the end of the Civil War.   And over six decades, the town thrived with churches and schools and  stores and theaters and jazz spots--clubs, if you will. This was a  thriving area dominated by African Americans.    I would also like to mention another personality;   Judge Frank M. Johnson, who was said to be one of the most courageous  judges ever to occupy a Federal bench; he was a part of the effort to  integrate the south. There are many people who have praised him,  including Dr. Martin Luther King.   He is the person who issued the order to require the constabulary to  allow the marches to proceed across the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they  marched from Selma to Montgomery.   He is the person who filed the order--along with the other judges--to  integrate the bus line, that was called the Montgomery bus boycott. He  opened the doors to persons of all hues, especially those of African  ancestry who had been locked out.   Frank M. Johnson will ever be remembered as a champion of human  rights. In fact, he will also be remembered as a person who did it  under adverse circumstances, because he had to have, for many years,  24-hour security. His mother's home was torched at one time.   It was not easy to be on the side of African Americans in the early  part of history.   Frank M. Johnson took such a stand.   We would also recognize Senator Edward Brooke, III, who became the  first African American popularly elected to the United States Senate.   He was from Massachusetts, and he served there for many years. He was  the first attorney general of African ancestry in any state.   In 1962, he cowrote the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited  discrimination in housing. He was the first Republican to call for  President Nixon's resignation in light of the Watergate scandal.   The history of African Americans in the north is one that is rich;  the history in the south is one that is rich; but they all started, to  a greater extent, with a migration that proceeded from the south to  many destinations in the north, as well as in the west.   So today, we have a resolution that encourages the continued spread  of knowledge regarding black history, and that it not be limited to one  month, but that we do this throughout the entire year.   I am so honored that my colleagues have signed on to this resolution.  We have had more than 60 colleagues to sign on to one, and I would hope  that as we continue to present these resolutions, we will have more  persons who will find favor with them.   In closing, simply this: The success that we have had as African  Americans--if we look closely at our history--we will find that it was  not something that was acquired by our own efforts alone.   Of course, we have done our part to extricate ourselves from some  circumstances that were indeed unpleasant and very harmful and hurtful,  but there were other persons who were there to be of assistance and  help.   Many of the stations at the Underground Railroad had persons who were  not of African ancestry that were there for us as we were traversing  our way to freedom.   In many of the battles that were fought in the courtrooms, there were  persons who were funding the litigation that were not of African  ancestry.   The Spingarn brothers are such persons. The NAACP awards its highest  medal annually in the name of the Spingarns.   When we have had few people to stand with us, the Jewish community  has been there. When we have had few people to stand with us, the LGBTQ  community has been there. When we have had few to stand with us, we  have had persons of all stripes; Muslims have been there; persons of  all faiths have been there.  [[Page H2269]]    At the March on Washington, if you take a close look at that march,  you will see persons of many hues, many stripes, persons from many  walks of life.   So we are here today, proud to be here in the well of the Congress of  the United States of America, but we understand that we didn't get here  by ourselves, and we are proud to celebrate black history. But we are  also proud to acknowledge that black history includes the history of a  lot of persons who were associated with our efforts to acquire our  freedom, our liberty, and the opportunities that we enjoy today.   Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for the time, and I proudly  yield back the time such that you may continue with the business of the  House.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 27, 2019, on page H2269, the following appeared: The  SPEAKER pro tempore.
