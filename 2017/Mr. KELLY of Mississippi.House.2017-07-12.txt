 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel with  Chairwoman Hartzler to Guantanamo Bay to see firsthand the important  work our military men and women stationed there are doing for our  national security.   As representatives of the people, we have been given a duty by the  American people to provide for our common defense, and that includes  appropriately detaining suspected terrorists.   According to the March 2017 Director of National Intelligence report,  it estimated 29 percent of former GTMO detainees are confirmed, 17  percent of those, or suspected, 12 percent, of re-engaging in terrorist  or insurgent activities. The ones we hold now are the 41 worst of the  worst, including KSM, and we cannot allow them back onto the  battlefields.   These people do not need to be housed on U.S. soil. GTMO is the most  appropriate and safest place to hold these detainees.   They live better than I lived both of my tours in Iraq in 2005 and  2009 and 2010.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
