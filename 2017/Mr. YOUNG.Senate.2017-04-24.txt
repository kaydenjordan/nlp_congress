 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service of  David Capp, who is retiring from the U.S. Department of Justice after  31 years of service. Let the record reflect how proud I am of Mr.  Capp's service to fellow Hoosiers and our country.   After graduating from Valparaiso University School of Law in 1977,  Mr. Capp served in the private sector for 8 years prior to joining the  U.S. Attorney's Office in 1985. During his tenure, Mr. Capp served as  interim U.S. attorney, as well as first assistant. On April 28, 2010,  Mr. Capp was sworn in by Chief Judge Philip Simon as the U.S. Attorney  for the Northern District of Indiana and has been serving in that  capacity ever since.   Mr. Capp has undoubtedly left this office and community a better  place. Mr. Capp's tireless commitment to his work helped alleviate  gang-related violence and drug-related offenses. In addition, Mr.  Capp's dedication to ending  [[Page S2490]]  public corruption serves as an example for current and future district  attorneys in Indiana.   Mr. Capp, on behalf of all Hoosiers, thank you again, for your  service to our State and country.                            ____________________
