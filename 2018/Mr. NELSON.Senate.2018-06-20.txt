 Madam President, I have just returned from South Florida  where I went to a detention facility in Homestead, FL. There are 1,000  children in this detention facility, and 94 of 1,000 are children who  have been separated from their families.   Despite being the senior Senator of Florida, despite having oversight  responsibility of the Department of HHS, despite the fact that in that  oversight capacity, we have the funding responsibility for the  Department of HHS and one of its components, the Office of Refugee  Resettlement--these children separated from their families are handled  by that office--despite all of that, the Deputy Secretary of the  Department of HHS refused to allow me to enter this facility and said  that it was the Department's policy that you have to fill out a form,  which we had done, but you have to wait 2 weeks before being allowed to  enter the facility.   The question is, Why do they not want the Senator from Florida to get  into this detention facility where there are children who have been  separated from their parents? It must be that not only is this  Department policy, but this is being directed by the President in the  White House. They don't want me to see it because they don't want us to  know what is going on in there.   I have subsequently found out that in addition to those 94 children,  there are 174 children being held in my State of Florida who have been  separated from their families. This is the current debate: Children  have been ripped apart from their moms and dads, and it has always been  an American value to keep families together, even when you are  adjudicating the lawful or unlawful status of the parents. You always  keep those children together on an immigration question, yet President  Trump has now altered that policy.   Despite all the finger-pointing and the deflection, President Trump  and his administration know this is their policy; he doubled down on it  last night. But there is nothing in the law that requires them to tear  parents away from their children. There is nothing in the law that  requires the administration to rip an infant from a parent's arms, some  young enough still to be nursing.   The decision to enact this quite horrendous and shameful policy was a  decision by this administration--and this administration alone. That is  why this Senator went to Miami yesterday. I wanted to see it for  myself. I wanted to see: Is the facility clean? Are the children  sleeping in beds? Are they sleeping on the floor? Do they have adequate  care? If they were, I could report that it was a good news story.   I also wanted to be able to talk to the young children, the ones who  had been separated. I had already gotten word from Senator Van Hollen,  who had been in Texas on Saturday and met a mom who said that her child  had been separated from her and that child was in a detention facility  in Florida. I wanted to see that child.   I am very proud of all of our colleagues who have come together to  support legislation to keep these families together, and 49 of us on  this side of the aisle have signed on as cosponsors. The policy of this  legislation is simply this: Don't separate families in this question of  immigration. It would prohibit the separation of those families. That  has been the policy, and all the President would have to do is to say  it, but in taking the position he has, maybe the only recourse is for  us to pass this law.   I am proud of our colleagues on that side of the aisle who have  rightfully stood up and publicly condemned this practice because every  American knows that taking children from their parents is just not  right. If a family is legitimately fleeing violence, repression, and  conditions that most of us cannot imagine, they have a right under  American law to present themselves at the border and ask for asylum.  Past administrations of both parties have recognized this, which is why  they acted with compassion and refused to do what the Trump  administration is doing now. It is certainly time that we return to our  true American value of keeping families together.   Because the passage of a statute is a long shot, it is really not up  to us. It is up to the President. He could say it, and it would be  done. No matter what we do here in this Chamber, the power to end this  shameful chapter in our Nation's history lies with the President and  his pen. He can sign an Executive order today, just as easily as he can  sign a law that we pass here in Congress. Either way, it is up to him.  He doesn't need Congress to act. He and he alone is allowing this  shameful practice to continue, and he alone can stop it right now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the June 19,  2018, vote on Senate amendment 2914 to Senate amendment 2910 to H.R.  5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. I would have voted yea.
