 Mr. Chairman, the current U.S. sugar program represents an  anti-free market scheme that imposes a massive hidden tax on both  American businesses and consumers for the benefit of a small,  concentrated group of special interests.   People say, well, we have got the safest, cheapest food source in the  world in the United States. It is cheap because we are paying for it  with our taxes. These are Soviet-style policies imposing significant,  unnecessary costs on the domestic food manufacturing industry and the  consumer.   Policies have imposed $2.4 billion to $4 billion worth of losses to  sugar users across the Nation. These industries provide jobs to 600,000  Americans, including 40,000 Pennsylvanians.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage.
