 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of my constituent  Madison Dozier of Alexandria, Kentucky.   Madison is an honor roll student at Reiley Elementary and the  daughter of proud parents Ronnie and Melanie Dozier.   Madison is also the 2019 national winner of the annual National  Missing Children's Day poster competition, sponsored by the Office of  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of  Justice.   Each year, all fifth graders in the United States are invited to  participate in the missing children's day poster competition. The  purpose of this competition is to foster awareness and discussion among  schools and law enforcement regarding the tragedy of missing and  exploited children.   This year, Madison's poster received the national award, following a  unanimous decision from the judging panel.   Congratulations to Madison and her teacher and her proud family as  they visit Washington, D.C., for the awards ceremony this week. Her  poster will be on display in the Great Hall at the Department of  Justice. Check it out.                            ____________________
