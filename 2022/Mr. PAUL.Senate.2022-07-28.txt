 Madam President, on Thursday, May 12, 2021, three  Louisville Metro Police Department Officers bravely saved the lives of  two citizens from their burning vehicles.   After another driver collided with a pulled-over vehicle, Officers  James Ashley, Clayton Kelly, and Connor Maloney quickly responded to  the scene. The circumstances in which these officers arrived were less  than ideal. Both drivers were unresponsive in vehicles moments from  being engulfed in flames on a dangerous and busy interstate. In  addition, these relatively new officers had never been trained to  extract people from burning vehicles. But without hesitation, these  brave officers quickly jumped into action.   Officers Kelly and Maloney used a baton to bust out a window and  pulled one of the drivers to safety. Officer Ashley did the same and  communicated with the other driver allowing him to crawl from his  burning vehicle.   Seventh Division Lieutenant Jeff Lauder stated, ``These people would  not have survived had it not been for the quick decision making and  bravery of these officers.'' The actions of these three officers  directly saved the lives of two citizens in an extremely dangerous  situation.   Officers Ashley, Kelly, and Maloney are brave servants to the city of  Louisville and a true testament to the hard-working Louisville Metro  Police Department. I am proud to salute these officers and have no  doubt they will continue to be an incredible asset to citizens of  Louisville.                            ____________________     Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Bubby's BBQ of Corbin, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   For as long as he can remember, Marcus ``Bubby'' Shepherd loved to  cook. He appreciated how food could bring people together and create a  sense of comfort for everyone at the table. After working as a truck  driver for 15 years, Marcus decided to switch career paths and open a  restaurant that showcased his specialty: cooking and smoking meat.  Hence, Bubby's BBQ of Corbin, KY, was born and very quickly became a  Shepherd family affair, spearheaded by Marcus.   From carefully crafted pulled pork barbecue to exceptionally crisp  fried catfish, Bubby's BBQ has a vast selection of menu items that are  undeniably delectable. Whether customers choose to order from the menu  or opt for the all-you-can-eat buffet, it is certain that the food will  always be excellent. Marcus ensures that all of the food served abides  by his recipes, so that each meal eaten at Bubby's tastes as if Marcus  had whipped it up himself. The barbeque is smoked for 10-12 hours each  night using hickory wood, and everything is homemade, right down to the  BBQ sauce. This attention to detail is what has made Bubby's BBQ widely  recognized for its consistency and high-quality food. A testament to  their success, Bubby's BBQ has won the People's Choice Award for Best  Restaurant several years in a row in various categories.   The delicious food attracts thousands of customers from all over  Kentucky, and the welcoming ambience and high-quality service at  Bubby's makes people never want to leave. The waitstaff goes out of  their way to guarantee the customers are always satisfied and their  drinks are never empty. Everyone that visits Bubby's BBQ feels as if  they  [[Page S3778]]  are part of the restaurant family, and a missing regular never goes  unnoticed by the staff. Some will go to the restaurant as many as four  to five times a week and never get tired of the food. Bubby's care is  not limited to its customers; it extends to its local community. The  restaurant hosts many fundraising events to raise money for the youth  sports teams in the Corbin area. Bubby's BBQ also uses its resources to  support those who do not have stable access to food through its  involvement in the Corbin Community Backpack Program, an initiative  that provides local schoolchildren, who have little or no food  available at their home, backpacks full of food to last them over the  weekends. Additionally, Bubby's BBQ assists with Operation James Scott,  a veteran-led community activity that purchases Christmas presents for  local children.   Bubby's BBQ has cultivated a famed reputation for its authenticity.  There is a strong sense of comfort every guest can feel when they dine  at Bubby's. With food that resembles family cooking, phenomenal service  that prioritizes customer satisfaction, and interior design that  reflects a southern country style, Bubby's makes you feel at home. This  quality of care and intimacy with customers is distinct to small  businesses. Everyone who goes to Bubby's BBQ knows there is just no  place like it, nor could it ever be replicated. Marcus's ability to  transform his passion into a successful business is an embodiment of  the entrepreneurial spirit that uplifts this country. I want to thank  Marcus Shepherd and the Shepherd family for all of the work they have  done to support their community of Corbin and the American people. I  look forward to watching your continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
