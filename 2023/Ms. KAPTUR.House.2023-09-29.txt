 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share my deepest condolences upon  the passing of United Steelworkers' president, Tommy Conway, who passed  away this past weekend at 71 years old.   The steelworkers of the United States, the labor movement, and our  Nation have lost a true hero who helped to revitalize and reinvest in  the U.S. steel industry.   As someone who spent much of my career working to save industrial  America, including in Ohio and across our country, I can say that there  was no greater advocate to save this lodestar, vital U.S. industry than  Tommy Conway.   Tommy understood to his core what America makes and grows makes and  grows America and he was absolutely committed to making things in  America and making sure, as president of the United Steelworkers, that  he fought every single day to protect workers, make sure they had good  pay, retirement security, and safety on the job.   Tommy was dedicated to the idea that all working people should be  able to live a good middle-class way of life. Something we both  understood growing up in union households was what unions truly mean to  workers and families--moving into the middle class.   Conway will be missed by many but never forgotten, and I hope Tommy's  longtime partner, Carol, his three sons, and six grandchildren are  comforted in knowing how much good he has done for so many and what a  great man Tommy Conway was.                            ____________________
