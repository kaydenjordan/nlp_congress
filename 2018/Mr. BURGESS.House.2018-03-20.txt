 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 787 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 787         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4566) to       amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act to provide relief to nonbanks from certain       stress test requirements under such Act. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Financial Services now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-65 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; (2) the       further amendment printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5247) to       authorize the use of eligible investigational drugs by       eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a       disease or condition in which there is reasonable likelihood       that death will occur within a matter of months, or with       another eligible illness, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of March 23, 2018.        Sec. 4.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of March 22, 2018, or March 23, 2018, for the       Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules       as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his       designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her       designee on the designation of any matter for consideration       pursuant to this section.        Sec. 5.  Section 3(a) of House Resolution 5 is amended by       striking ``the first session of''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 787 provides for the  consideration of two important bills whose focus is to empower the  people of this Nation by removing governmental obstacles standing in  the way of life and prosperity in this country.   The first bill, H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to  Help Investors Act, is a bipartisan effort from the Committee on  Financial Services under Chairman Jeb Hensarling, authored by the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).   The second piece of legislation in today's rule, H.R. 5247, the  Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina  Right to Try Act of 2018, authorizes the use of certain drugs to  eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a disease or  a condition for which there is a reasonable likelihood that death will  occur in a matter of months.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for H.R. 4566, the Alleviating  Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, equally divided between the  Chair and the ranking members of the Committee on Financial Services.   The rule makes one amendment in order, authored by the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member. Further, the  rule provides for the consideration of one motion to recommit with or  without instructions.   For H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act of 2018, the rule provides for 1  hour of debate equally divided between the Chair  [[Page H1705]]  and the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Although no amendments to the bill were made in order, the rule does  provide for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, before I speak about the substance of the two bills  under consideration in the rule before us today, I do want to take a  minute to honor our colleague and the Rules Committee's ranking member,  Louise Slaughter, who passed away unexpectedly last week.   I have known Ranking Member Slaughter since I first joined Congress  in 2003. We spent countless hours debating every issue one can imagine  in the Rules Committee upstairs, often long into the night.   When I joined the Rules Committee in 2013, Ranking Member Slaughter  was then the ranking member, but it was under her chairmanship where  she ushered through the Affordable Care Act, where my largest memories  reside. During the debate for the Affordable Care Act, I went up to H- 313, the Rules Committee hearing room, with 18 amendments under my arm,  a small selection of the many ways I felt the law needed to be changed.   Certain that I would only be able to get through a small portion of  those amendments before I was cut off, I began my testimony. To the  chairwoman's credit, she let me go on and on and on, and despite my  being convinced that she was going to gavel me down at any second, she  allowed me to finish speaking on all 18 amendments.   Mr. Speaker, it wasn't until I actually became a member of the Rules  Committee several years later that I discovered there is, in fact, no  time limit for Members and witnesses to speak, much to the chagrin of  many Members when we debate the National Defense Authorization Act.   Ranking Member Slaughter was always proud of her background as a  microbiologist, and it served her well during her tenure in Congress,  because, after all, we deal with, sometimes, almost miniscule,  microscopic issues, so time as a microbiologist would be good  preparation.   One moment where I was glad to be able to work with Ranking Member  Slaughter was in 2007. This was right after the Democrats took control  of the House. Ms. Slaughter had been pushing for years for legislation  that would prohibit the discrimination of employees based on genetic  information.   The legislation was forward leaning, long before companies offered  DNA testing kits in every pharmacy of the country. And, in fact, it was  former Speaker Newt Gingrich himself who brought this bill to my  attention, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which I was  proud to support as it moved through the Energy and Commerce Committee  and was eventually signed into law by President Bush.   I would also like to mention Don Sisson, the staff director for the  minority on the Rules Committee. Don has been with the committee for  years--even at one point working under Chairman Drier--and has been  with the ranking member of the Rules Committee through many events in  the past years, including the death of her own husband, who, in fact,  often sat in the audience of the Rules Committee and joined Ms.  Slaughter during our late-night Rules hearings.   Don is, indeed, a loyal staffer, himself hailing from Rochester, New  York, and is a great example of how Ms. Slaughter's life and passing is  affecting so many people. I do want to thank Don for his written  remarks that were read into the record of the Rules Committee last  night from the staff perspective on the passing of Ranking Member  Slaughter.   Mr. Speaker, at this point, I would like to hold off making further  comments on the legislation before us to allow others to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, it was indeed incredibly disappointing last week when  our Democratic colleagues did not join us in supporting what was very  carefully crafted right-to-try legislation.   The President came and talked to us at the beginning of February, and  right to try was one of the issues that he highlighted there from the  podium. So it should be to no one's great surprise that this House  would indeed take up and work on that issue that the President himself  highlighted. Right to try was the one piece of legislation that  President Trump specifically promised to the American people in the  State of the Union address.    Today, I want it to be known that I stand with the President. I stand  with the thousands of Americans with terminal diseases and their  families and their friends in getting this important bill passed.   Since 2014, 37 States, including my home State of Texas, have passed  a version of a right-to-try law, and through a strong grassroots  movement, they have accomplished that.   Today, the House is considering H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act of  2018, which would improve access to experimental treatments for  terminally ill patients and offer them a chance--a second chance, a  third chance--at life.   Over the course of the last decade, our Nation has achieved  unprecedented innovation and scientific breakthroughs. Thanks to  researchers in our academic institutions and those working in the  pharmaceutical and medical device industries, American patients have  access to innovative treatments.   Regardless of these achievements, I hear from patients with serious  life-threatening conditions, including my constituents from north  Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers  from trying and experimenting with new therapies when every other  avenue has failed.   It does seem we are at a crossroads when lifesaving treatments, while  not yet approved, both exist and remain unavailable to patients.   As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and  therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for  themselves or loved ones with a serious and life-threatening condition.   It is crucial to mention the multistakeholder efforts that have gone  into improving the original right-to-try bill. Chairman Walden of the  Energy and Commerce Committee led negotiations with the Commissioner of  the United States Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and  with other stakeholders to ensure that this legislation opens the door  to innovative experimental drugs for these patients without necessarily  compromising the vital work and the mission of the Food and Drug  Administration. The product of those negotiations is a bill that  strikes the proper balance between ensuring patient safety and granting  access to these treatments.   I also want to mention that the Subcommittee on Health did have a  hearing in this regard October 3. We heard from the Commissioner of the  Food and Drug Administration during that hearing. We heard from a  number of patient groups and stakeholders who felt that it was, in  fact, in their best interest for us to advance legislation.   Currently, the Food and Drug Administration conducts an expanded  access program aimed at helping patients who do not qualify for  clinical trials to gain access to therapies that the agency has yet to  approve. While this program makes a good faith effort to help those  patients, right to try would create an alternative pathway for those  individuals, allowing them to access eligible investigational drugs.   The fact is that individuals may not qualify for a clinical trial if  they do not meet very specific patient inclusion criteria, which may  include factors such as age, gender, type and stage of disease,  previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. There are  also many patients for whom participation in a clinical trial is not  feasible, especially those who live in rural areas far from where those  academic clinical trial sites exist.   Most, if not all, of the patients with a terminal medical condition  fall into one of these categories. This legislation allows those  patients to participate in the alternative pathway so long as they are  certified by a physician who is in good standing and abides by the  rules laid out in the bill.   Again, we worked closely with the Food and Drug Administration to  ensure that the new alternative pathway does not hinder or conflict  with the critically important oversight that that agency conducts.  While some people may have reservations about the safety of a new  pathway, this bill protects patients from manufacturers mislabeling or  misbranding drugs, requires sponsors and manufacturers to report  adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration, and provides  certain liability protections for parties participating in the new  pathway. This alternative pathway would also be limited to individuals  who have exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options.   Additionally, only certain investigational drugs are considered  eligible under this legislation. In order to qualify, the drug must  have completed a  [[Page H1707]]  phase one clinical trial, must have an active application, must be  under active development or production by the manufacturer, and must  not be the subject of a clinical hold.   Eligible patients include those suffering from a stage of a disease  or condition for which there is reasonable likelihood that death will  occur in a matter of months or that would result in significant  irreversible morbidity that is likely to lead to premature death.   This revised right-to-try bill also provides certainty to  manufacturers in the drug approval process. It is essential that we do  not create additional hurdles in that process. The legislation clearly  states that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Services ``may not use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an  eligible investigational drug . . . to delay or adversely affect the  review or approval of such drug.''                                time  1245    Since the Health Subcommittee first considered the right-to-try  legislation, the bill has passed in the Senate, and we have had many  conversations with patients, advocates, the administration, and  stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic. That collaborative  effort was necessary, and I am certainly grateful to all who  participated in those discussions.   Madam Speaker, this represents months of hard work and thoughtful  discussions and decisions. I believe this legislation is a positive  step forward in our shared goal of improving care for American  patients. Again, this was the one aspect of the President's State of  the Union Address where he asked us specifically to act on this  legislation.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), who is a fellow member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Dallas  Morning News from 2010. The title of the article--and I am not going to  read the whole thing--is: ``Pelosi Pulled Strings to Let Dying Dallas  Lawyer Try Experimental Cancer Drug.''                    [From the Dallas Morning News, 2010]  Pelosi Pulled Strings To Let Dying Dallas Lawyer Baron Try Experimental                                Cancer Drug                            (By Todd J. Gilman)         Washington.--Dallas' top Democratic donors will cut big       checks to share dinner later this month with House Speaker       Nancy Pelosi. Most will be motivated by a desire to protect       the party's congressional majority.        Lisa Blue will have an extra reason: to say thanks for       Pelosi's efforts when her husband, Fred Baron, was dying of       bone marrow cancer. His only option was an experimental drug       whose manufacturer refused to give permission to use it for       Baron's condition.        ``He was a big fan of hers, and now I am as well,'' Blue       said.        Baron, the ``King of Toxic Torts,'' built a fortune suing       on behalf of asbestos victims. He died the week before       Election Day 2008 at age 61.        A prolific Democratic fundraiser, he served as finance       chief that year for his friend John Edwards, who also made       his fortune in court. Baron later acknowledged funneling       large sums to Edwards' mistress--a scandal that gave       ammunition to those who already despised trial lawyers.        But to Blue, first and foremost, Baron was a husband.        The tale she tells of his final weeks is not so different       than any widow might tell, except, of course, that the couple       had friends in especially high places--friends like Pelosi,       who will headline the Aug. 24 dinner to raise cash for the       Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.        In 2002, Baron was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By       October 2008, his doctors at the Mayo Clinic were telling him       he had just days to live.        They also offered a glimmer of hope. Over the years, the       couple had donated about $1 million to Mayo. The staff was       especially diligent, Blue said. They tested an arsenal of       drugs and finally discovered that Baron's cancer responded       surprisingly well, in the lab, to a drug called Tysabri.        Mayo had an ample supply, but the drug was--and still is--      approved only for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's       disease. The manufacturer, Biogen Idec, refused to give       permission, even under special ``compassionate use'' rules       that protect a drug-maker from a black mark in case of an       adverse outcome.        Biogen said it didn't want to jeopardize the drug's       availability to other patients. (The company did not respond       to a request for comment last week.)        ``I told Mayo, `I'll sign anything, I'll release anything.       Just give him the drug,' '' Blue said.        Blue, also a top lawyer, began making calls. She started       with Lance Armstrong, the bicyclist and cancer survivor, whom       she had represented.        ``I started going through Fred's Rolodex,'' she said. ``I       called every politician, every celebrity that I knew and just       begged them to help. . . . I must have made 200 calls.''        She called clinics in Canada, trying in vain to find       doctors willing to administer the drug without Biogen's OK.       She hired a lawyer and prepared to sue Mayo to force it to       dispense the drug. She even bought some Tysabri online from       Australia, intending to send stepson Andrew Baron to smuggle       it back, she said.        The younger Baron posted an open plea online to Biogen,       noting that Bill Clinton, Sens. John Kerry and Edward Kennedy       of Massachusetts, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and even the head       of the Food and Drug Administration had urged the company to       reconsider.        ``You talk about mental anguish,'' Blue recounted. ``Fred,       every day, would wake up and he said, `Am I going to get the       drug?' ''        Others were supportive, she said, but Pelosi ``put her       heart and soul'' into the cause, as did Harkin.        Somehow--Blue still isn't sure how--Pelosi cajoled the FDA       to find a legal justification that let Mayo administer the       drug, even without Biogen's consent.        ``Nancy figured out a way,'' she said.        The drug beat back the cancer for a few days, but not       enough.        Blue has no illusion that a typical family could pull such       strings.        ``There are so many cases like Fred's,'' she said. ``One       thing he taught me was politics matters. What a personal       experience for me to understand how politics matters.''        And no, she added, ``It's not fair that other people can't       pick up the phone and make the government give them a drug. .       . . It was just such an awakening about how the drug       companies have so much power.''        That's what she'll tell Pelosi over dinner.     Mr. Speaker, this article references events that  occurred in 2008.   In 2002, this individual was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By  October of 2008, his doctors were telling him that  [[Page H1709]]  he had just days to live. They also offered a glimmer of hope. There  was perhaps one chance of therapy. It was an unproven therapy that  might, in fact, be helpful to him.   The family made inquiries, made entreaties, but they were not  successful until they invoked the then-Speaker of the House, Nancy  Pelosi, who actually helped this lawyer get access to this medication.  Unfortunately, it was not successful. His disease spread to a point  where the therapy was not helpful. But the family observed, ``Nancy  figured out a way.''   How about that. The Speaker of the House figured out a way to get  this medication to an individual who was dying of a disease, who  obviously was very important--a large Democratic donor, and I get that.   But the Speaker of the House intervened because the clinic where he  was being treated felt that they did not have the authority to give him  the medication. The company that was manufacturing the medication did  not feel that it was in anyone's best interest to give him the  medication. But Nancy found a way.   Well, Mr. Speaker, today, we are going to find a way. The President  asked us, and we are going to find a way for those millions of  Americans who are asking for that same chance.   So today's rule provides for consideration of two important consumer- driven pieces of legislation:   H.R. 4566, by Mr. Poliquin, will help alleviate some of the  regulations that were put in place under the Dodd-Frank Act.   H.R. 5247, the right-to-try bill which garnered a majority of  bipartisan support last week, will give patients who have nowhere else  to turn another option to fight the potentially fatal health conditions  with which they have been diagnosed.   I do want to thank President Trump and Vice President Pence for their  leadership on this issue and helping us understand here in this body  how important it is to move forward with this patient-centered  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the two underlying  pieces of legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An amendment to H. Res. 787 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6.

At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4240, H.R. 3464, H.R. 2598, or H.R.       1478.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's  [[Page H1710]]       how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in       their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to       amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the       time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment,       the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous       question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous       question is defeated, control of the time passes to the       Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous       question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may       offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
