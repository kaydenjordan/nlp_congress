 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  epidemic of anti-Jewish hatred taking place in New York City and across  the country.   Since December 23, there have been over a dozen attacks on Jews  across New York City; this, after a terror attack in Jersey City that  claimed three innocent lives and a horrific terrorist attack in Monsey,  New York.   In this city, where Jews have come for 366 years to freely practice  their religion, enough is enough. Tweets and words of support are not  enough at a time of crisis like this. We must have action.   It is for that reason that on January 15, the Homeland Security  subcommittee that I chair will hold a hearing on the rise of anti- Semitism. We have got to explore increased funding for mosques,  synagogues, and churches; increase focus on a domestic terrorism  charge; and increase focus on the rise of the neo-Nazi movement, both  nationally and globally.   Once again, tweets, thoughts, and prayers are not enough right now.  We need action.                            ____________________
