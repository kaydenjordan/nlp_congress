 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here today to talk about the  ongoing partial government shutdown, the crisis along the southern  border, and how we can resolve this in a responsible way.   We are now on day 28 of the government shutdown, and I am more  discouraged now than I have been during this entire impasse. We are  better than this. We are stuck. Eight hundred thousand workers have  missed a paycheck, and there is no end in sight. NASA workers in  Cleveland, TSA employees at our airports across Ohio, Coast Guard  officers on Lake Erie--they have all contacted me, as have others. But  the harm being done to these families and these workers isn't the only  thing that is happening with the shutdown.   I have been through five of these shutdowns since I worked in the  White House for the first President Bush. I remember in 1990 when we  had a weekend shutdown, and everybody thought that was dramatic. Here  we are with the longest shutdown in our history. I don't like  government shutdowns. I don't think they are good for taxpayers. Every  shutdown, we always end up paying more as taxpayers. I don't think  anybody likes them--at least not anybody outside the beltway. Some in  both parties seem to like to use shutdowns, but they are not good for  families who are affected, and they are not good for the economy. They  cost the taxpayers more.   On the economy, we now have a report from the Council of Economic  Advisers, who tell us this week that the shutdown is going to reduce  quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percent for every week it lasts. In  other words, every week the shutdown continues, the economy is hurt  more. We have a great economy right now. Thanks to the tax cuts and the  regulatory relief and other things this Congress has done, we have  record levels of employment. More people are employed than ever in our  history. We have historically low unemployment. We are bringing people  out of the shadows, back into work, off the sidelines.   There is a lot of positive out there, but this is taking us the wrong  way. It is partly the impact on Federal employees, because their  purchasing power is less. We are told that of the $312 billion for  fiscal year 2019 that hasn't been appropriated by this Congress--and  that is what the shutdown is; about 25 percent of government is not  being funded. That is hundreds of millions of dollars each workday that  are not going out to Federal employees. So part of the economic impact  is that people have less spending power, and part of it is that  contractors and a lot of small businesses are not getting paid, so it  has an impact on the economy in that way. Again, what happens in the  end is that everybody gets paid back, but in the meantime, services are  disrupted. It is a very inefficient way to run government, and  taxpayers end up spending more, not less.   I am not big on shutdowns, having lived through five of them, but I  have to say I have never been more frustrated than with this shutdown.  I am frustrated for a very simple reason: The solution is right before  us. The reason we are in this shutdown is that both sides are unwilling  to sit down and talk. That makes this shutdown particularly stupid.   The issue before us is what to do with regard to border security  where, in fact, there is a lot of agreement. Border security is one  where we don't have these fundamental disagreements, as we might on,  let's say, tax cuts or healthcare policy. This is about whether we  should be securing our southern border. I think my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, when pressed, will say: Yes, of course we should.   If you look at the specifics, we are not that far apart. That is what  is most frustrating to me about this one--that we can bring people  together and achieve a result here. I am going to talk about what that  might mean.   I have been working with some colleagues, including the Presiding  Officer, on trying to figure out a way forward. We haven't been  successful yet. There are plenty of folks who want to get to yes in  this Chamber, and we have to figure out a way to provide a forum to do  that, to make it happen.   I am not here today on the floor to assign blame, to point fingers.  There are plenty of people doing that. That is easy to do because there  is lots of blame to go all around. I am here to talk about how to find  that common ground.   Of course, we have to do more to secure our southern border. I  consider it a crisis. Some of my colleagues say it is not a crisis.  Some say it is a crisis. Forget the words. We have a problem on the  southern border.  [[Page S303]]    Here is some of the data. During September and October of last year,  Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended more than 100,000  people trying to enter the country illegally. This has nearly doubled  the number from the same months in 2017. In the most recent data we  have--October and November, just a couple of months ago--there is  double the number of people apprehended between the ports of entry as  we had the year before.   The big increase is families and kids. This is a very tough issue.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, there has been a 50- percent increase in the number of families coming across the border  illegally and a 25-percent increase in the number of unaccompanied  children.   Along with that, there has been a 2,000-percent increase in asylum  claims over the last 5 years--a 2,000 percent increase in asylum claims  over the last 5 years.   The largest growth is coming, as we know, from three Central American  countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. While 9 out of 10 of  these claims are ultimately rejected by the immigration courts, the  applicants have long since been released into the interior of the  United States. That is a problem. We should all be working on that.   How do we address this problem? There are some constructive ideas on  both sides of the aisle on how to deal with that, but it is a real  problem. In fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Protection referred  nearly 50,000 accompanied minors--almost all of whom came across the  southern border to seek asylum--to the Department of Health and Human  Services for care.   I have done a lot of work on this issue in the Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations of the Homeland Security Committee and found out  about some of the care these kids have gotten and some of the trauma  these kids have gone through. HHS is currently housing more than 11,000  of these children. Many have experienced violence--as I say, serious  trauma--on their journey to the United States and need significant  help.   Furthermore, the Drug Enforcement Administration has reported that  the southwest border ``remains the primary entry point for heroin into  the United States.'' There is no disagreement about that. I am told  that 90 percent of the heroin that we are experiencing in our  communities here comes across the southern border.   Fentanyl comes primarily from China. We made some progress there  because it comes primarily through the post office from China. We just  passed legislation to deal with that. Fentanyl is the most powerful  drug out there--50 times more powerful than heroin on average--causes  most of the overdoses in my State of Ohio and around the country.   Guess what. More and more of that fentanyl is coming across the  southern border. Last year, seizures of fentanyl--a synthetic heroin  that is causing all these deaths and overdoses--increased by 135  percent last year compared to 2017.   Part of what is happening is that it comes from China to Mexico and  from Mexico into the United States, we are told by law enforcement.  Then, over the last year, we have seen the scientists in Mexico--evil  scientists in Mexico--cook up in these ``super labs'' crystal meth-- methamphetamines, crystal meth, pure crystal meth--that is coming into  our communities.   In the last couple of weeks, I have been at three meetings where I  bring together the people on the drug abuse task forces of different  parts of our State, and I have talked a lot about the opioid crisis,  where I spent a lot of time and effort. What they tell me is that we  are making progress on opioids, finally--thank God--for the first time  in 7 years.   Guess what the new scourge is--crystal meth. It is more pure than  ever, more powerful than ever.   So that is coming from where? It is coming from Mexico. It is a 135- percent increase, as we talked about, from fentanyl. We have also seen  a 38-percent increase in methamphetamine trafficking across the  southern border just from 2017 to 2018.   This drug issue is a big deal as well, and we need to do more. By the  way, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with that. They  would like to see more funding immediately for better screening at  ports of entry, as an example. Most of these drugs come in through cars  and trucks that cross our border.   While we have been paying attention to this China issue with  fentanyl, what is happening in our southern border continues with very  little interdiction on our part.   I met with the Customs and Border Protection Commissioner last month  in my office. I asked him: How many of these drugs are you  intercepting?   He had to acknowledge: We don't know, of course, but very few.   They need better equipment. They need better technology. They need  more people.   I don't think these numbers are sustainable--the number of families,  the number of children coming in, the number of asylum claims, the  number of drugs coming across our border--for our Border Patrol, for  our judicial system, for our education and health systems, and for our  communities.   Because of all these problems, we need a broad solution at the  border. Experts tell us that our solutions should include more physical  barriers, which the President talks about a lot, but, also, more Border  Patrol agents, more technology, more surveillance, more drones, more  cameras, more screening at our ports of entry, and more technology  there to stop this illegal flow of drugs.    There was a time when all this wasn't all that controversial. In  2006, Congress enacted on a bipartisan basis legislation called the  Secure Fence Act. You have probably heard about it. It authorized 700  miles of additional fencing or physical barriers along the border.  Then-Senator Barack Obama voted for the Secure Fence Act. Then-Senator  Hillary Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act. Senator Chuck Schumer  voted for this bill. It passed by 80 to 19, an overwhelming bipartisan  approval.   As recently as 2013, all of the Senate Democrats and two Independents  voted for a broader immigration reform plan that called for no fewer  than 700 miles of border fencing. That measure ultimately failed in the  House. Let me repeat that. Every single Democrat in the Senate voted  for that bill. Who was the lead sponsor? Senator Chuck Schumer, the  minority leader.   So asking for additional barriers and fencing along the border as  part of a broader strategy to make it more secure shouldn't be that  controversial. Is it the only answer? No, it is not.   Having said all of that, when you remove the partisan politics and  political symbolism, I continue to believe that we are not that far  apart. If you look at the January 6 letter the Trump administration  sent to the Congress, saying, ``Please fund these priorities,'' you  will see that the response to what is happening along our border that  they are proposing is not that far from where we are in the Congress.   Yes, it asks for more barriers. I would think from hearing, frankly,  from both sides--from the administration and from the Democrats in  Congress--that it would be a wall across 2,000 miles of the border. It  is not. That is not the proposal. The proposal is--and I am reading  from it--234 miles of new barriers and fencing--not 2,000 miles but 234  miles of additional barriers of some kind.   As you know, the President has now made clear that he is prepared to  construct these barriers not as a cement wall but as a fence, what he  calls a steel barrier. The White House also made clear in their  submission that these barriers would be constructed in a manner  consistent with the existing language in the Senate committee-passed  bipartisan Homeland Security appropriations bill. That means the  definition of the border barrier that Republicans and Democrats have  long voted for would be the definition used for the construction of  these new barriers.   It is $5.7 billion in funding for the construction of additional  physical barriers along the southern border, consistent with what the  experts say we ought to use--both in terms of the type of barrier and  where the barrier ought to be.   Again, based on the 2006 law, more than 500 miles of fencing have  already been built in California, in Arizona, and in New Mexico. Based  on the data--the actual data--they are making a difference. If you talk  to folks in  [[Page S304]]  those communities and you talk to Customs and Border Protection, they  like having those barriers. At a minimum, it slows people down, and it  keeps vehicles from going across some of that desert landscape. This is  part of a broader strategy that is primarily used now in California,  Arizona, and New Mexico.   The 2006 law resulted in 105 miles of fencing in California, 211  miles in Arizona, and 107 miles in the sector that spans both Arizona  and California. This also includes 166 miles of fencing in a sector  that spans New Mexico and Texas, though most of this is in New Mexico.  In Texas, in total, there is less than 100 miles of fencing. This is  where the priority is now for the Border Patrol, in Texas. Why? Because  Texas has 1,200 miles of the 2,000-mile border. Yet they only have 100  miles of barriers.   The new fencing that the administration has requested, as we  understand it, is particularly necessary in the most populated parts of  the Rio Grande Valley on the Texas-Mexico border. By the way, that is  where 40 percent of the crossings occur. You would think it makes sense  to have more barriers there.   Again, it is not all about barriers. It has to be an all-of-the-above  strategy. The $5.7 billion in barriers, which is about $4 billion more  than the bipartisan Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, is  what they are proposing. It is about $4 billion more--$4.1 billion, I  think, to be exact--than what is in the bill that has already been  agreed to on a bipartisan basis.   In December, Democrats proposed $1.3 billion for the same purpose,  which is actually a reduction in the amount they initially proposed in  November, the month before, of $1.6 billion.   Folks, there is a way to find common ground here, especially if you  include, with this 234 miles of additional barriers to be determined by  the experts as to what kind of barrier and where it goes, other  immigration policies that many on the other side of the aisle strongly  support--and some of us do too--like dealing with DACA. This has been  talked about, and it has become a political football. Let's resolve it.   These are young people who came here as children through no fault of  their own. Their families brought them here as kids. They were minors.  They are not responsible for breaking immigration laws.   Now they are young people. Some of them are working, some of them are  in school, and some of them are in the military. They are looking for  some certainty.   I think the Congress can provide that. As part of an overall package  here, it makes sense to include something on DACA. A lot of Democrats  who talked about this over the years strongly agree with that.   The President has also asked, in addition to looking at DACA, that in  the context of overall immigration reform, we would look at this issue  of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. This is something that many  Democrats feel very strongly about. TPS allows the government to  provide protection for individuals who come from particularly trouble- stricken countries. There are now 10 countries on that list. The  Secretary of Homeland Security has the ability to provide harbor for  those individuals from those 10 countries. Sometimes it is because of a  natural disaster. Sometimes it is because of a war. Sometimes it is  because of violence in those countries. They simply have to present  themselves at ports of entry and begin the application process and go  through a legal process to apply. Some of these temporary visas that  these individuals under TPS currently have are expiring.   Again, there are a lot of Senators, particularly on the other side of  the aisle, who feel strongly about this. Senator Kaine has been a  champion for these individuals. There are tens of thousands of them in  his State of Virginia. Senators would like to see immediate relief  there. I think that could be part of a mix here.   The President has also requested $675 million to help stop drug  smuggling at our ports of entry; $211 million to hire another 750  Border Patrol agents; $800 million for humanitarian needs to fund  enhanced medical support, transportation, and temporary facilities for  those who are detained at our border. The Homeland Security  appropriations bill already includes funding for all of those purposes,  but the President has requested additional funds to help deal with this  influx we talked about--more families, more unaccompanied children, in  particular. He has also requested $563 million for 75 additional  immigration judges and support staff so that we can help reduce the  case backlog of nearly 800,000 pending immigration cases.   Again, a lot of Democrats and Republicans, including me, have talked  about the need for this. This backlog is part of our problem because  people are typically in the communities, and many of them don't show up  for their court cases. Part of the problem is the backlog, the amount  of time it takes--months. That can be reduced.   Finally, the President has requested an additional $631 million for  counternarcotics and weapons technology. Again, this is one I feel  strongly about. I know a lot of my colleagues do. Senator Schumer has  talked eloquently in the past about needing better screening at ports  of entry to try to stop some of these drugs from coming in. I believe  these are reasonable requests.   Where there is disagreement, let's have a debate over it, and let's  come to a compromise. But we have to have a real adult conversation for  that to occur.   The irony for me, for those of us who support a stronger presence on  the southern border, is that this shutdown is hurting our efforts to  secure the border and to make our immigration system work better.   First, U.S. Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection  officers are continuing to work without pay. We want to increase the  morale of those brave officers along the border. It is hard to increase  morale when they are working without pay.   More than 40,000 immigration hearings have been canceled. Think about  that. There are 40,000 immigration hearings that have already been  canceled, contributing to this backlog that already totals 800,000  cases.   E-verify, the government system used to verify the immigration status  of workers to determine whether they are illegal, to allow employers to  reject people who are not legally in this country--that e-verify system  is incredibly important because, ultimately, those jobs are the magnet.  Right? That is what is pulling people across the border more than  anything else. Now that system is shut down because the government is  shut down--that part of government--meaning employers across the United  States are unable to effectively know who is legal or not. That doesn't  help us with regard to the border.   For all of these reasons, we need to come together and negotiate a  solution. We are not that far apart.   Last week, out of frustration that no progress was being made, my  colleague Jerry Moran of Kansas and I introduced legislation that would  establish a $25 billion border trust fund over the next 5 years to  enhance border security across the board--all the things we have talked  about.   The legislation would also codify protections for the DACA population  we talked about. Again, it is very important to so many in this  Chamber, particularly on the other side of the aisle.   In my view, this is a fair and reasonable solution for all sides, and  I believe we could get the necessary votes if it were brought to the  floor.   Others have better ideas, I am sure. Let's hear them. Let's have a  negotiation on all of these issues, but let's get to a resolution.   It has been reported in the media that I have been working with  Senator Graham, Senator Collins, Senator Alexander, Senator Murkowski,  Senator Gardner, along with Senator Coons, Senator Kaine, Senator  Cardin, Senator Manchin, and others. This has been in the press. I am  not reporting anything to you today that is not already known. It has  been said that we are trying to figure out a way forward, and we are.   Democrats have insisted that there can't be a negotiation until the  government shutdown has ended. So a bunch of us have said: Well, what  if we do this? One, let's get a commitment from Democrats that they  will seriously negotiate based on the President's request. I think it  is a reasonable request.   Having received that commitment, then let's have a short-term  cessation here of the shutdown--maybe for a few  [[Page S305]]  weeks, maybe for a couple of weeks--to give us the space and the time  to be able to work out an agreement.   There are a substantial number of Members from our side and the other  side who have agreed to sign a letter along those lines. I am hopeful  that can provide at least one opportunity to move forward. It is the  only one I see right now.   If there is a better idea, I am eager to hear it, and I know my  colleagues are too. More importantly, I know the people I represent  are, both those who are directly impacted and those who are watching  and saying: Why can't Washington get its act together? This makes no  sense.   Yes, we should provide additional security for our southern border.  Why can't we agree to that?   We are not that far apart.   Why can't we end the government shutdown in the process and allow the  normal operations to go back into place so that families, government  workers are not put in this position where, working paycheck to  paycheck, they now don't have a paycheck and where taxpayers can get  the services they have paid for and not end up paying more money after  the fact, which is what typically happens in these shutdowns.   By the way, I do hope we can stop using government shutdowns  altogether. I don't like them, as I said, and last week, I introduced  legislation, along with eight of my Republican colleagues, that is  called the End Government Shutdowns Act. It is pretty straightforward.  I have introduced it every single Congress since I was elected in 2010.   What it says is, if you get to the end of the process and the  appropriations bill is not funded by Congress--and our fiscal yearend  is September 30, so we have been living since then on these continuing  resolutions. But if you end up with not getting an appropriations bill  done or if you get to the end of a continuing resolution and there is  no resolution--you have this impasse--instead of having the government  shut down, what you do is just continue the spending from the previous  year. Then, after 120 days, you reduce it by 1 percent, and then, after  another 90 days, you reduce it by another 1 percent.   Why? To give Congress the incentive to get their act together and to  actually fund the government appropriately, to pass these  appropriations bills, which should provide not just funding but reforms  to government programs. That is the idea. We should every year be  looking at all of the government and saying: What is working? What is  not working? What are we going to fund more? What are we going to fund  less? What are we going to eliminate? What are we going to create?  Something new and good for our country and our constituents. So that is  what we want to incentivize by the End Government Shutdowns Act.   I hope that Members on both sides of the aisle can support this and  that, looking forward, we will not have government shutdowns. We  wouldn't be in this mess today if that legislation were law.   The bottom line is, we have the opportunity before us to reach a fair  agreement. Both sides are going to have to move some. The President is  going to have to negotiate, and he says that he will.   The Speaker of the House is going to have to move some. According to  news reports, Speaker Pelosi flat-out told the press she would not  support $1 dollar for any new barriers, even if the government were  reopened and everything that she asked for was granted. That is not  serious. That is not the way to have a successful negotiation,  especially when Democrats, as I laid out earlier, have long supported  more barriers and fencing along the southern border.   So let's act in good faith. Let's move forward to a responsible  resolution. That means, yes, we reopen government, but we also secure  the southern border. We are not that far apart. We just need to have  the will to get it done.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Saturday, January 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day.
