 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6445, the Small Business  Development Centers Improvement Act of 2022.   Before we begin, I will highlight next week's National Small Business  Week celebration. This will be a time to honor and reflect upon some of  America's hardest working businesses and their employees.   It is with this in mind that I am glad that we are gathering on the  House floor today to discuss a number of bills that improve and enhance  the Small Business Administration.   Importantly, all five bills that we will be discussing today have  been favorably reported out of our committee  [[Page H4465]]  in a bipartisan manner. I thank the chair for working with me to  advance these bills to the floor.   Small Business Development Centers provide valuable resources and  free counseling to entrepreneurs across this great Nation. This  Congress, I have heard from several small businesses who have benefited  from the SBDC's services.   In my home State of Missouri, the Missouri Small Business Development  Center helped a local brewery create a business plan and apply for a  504 loan to grow their business. They also helped a veteran-owned food  shipping business scale up and find new partnerships during the  pandemic.   They supported countless small businesses in accessing SBA's COVID  relief programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic  Injury Disaster loans. I am grateful for their wide range of services  to entrepreneurs.   This important legislation will allow SBDCs to continue their  important services and expand their network of small business  beneficiaries through marketing.   This legislation also ensures SBDC's client information is protected  and that cooperation, communication, and collaboration between SBA and  SBDC networks is improved.   I thank Mr. Golden for working on this legislation with the late Jim  Hagedorn. As we all know, Jim was a champion for small businesses and a  truly invaluable member of our Small Business Committee. He will  certainly be missed. He leaves a huge hole on our side of the aisle  with regard to support of small businesses, and we remember him today.   I also thank the chair for working with me in a bipartisan manner to  advance this bill.   I urge my colleagues to ensure that SBDCs can continue serving our  small business constituents and communities, and to support H.R. 6445,  which was passed favorably out of our committee by a voice vote and  passed the House in a similar form last Congress.   The Small Business Development Center network is critical in  assisting our small business owners during their entrepreneurial  business journey. H.R. 6445 will enhance and improve this journey and  ensure the program remains strong and vibrant on behalf of America's  small businesses.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6445, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 6441, the Women's Business  Centers Improvement Act of 2022.   Women's Business Centers, WBCs, support over 150,000 women  entrepreneurs each year through training, mentoring, business  development, and financing opportunities. This legislation, H.R. 6441,  will bring increased oversight to the WBC program and long overdue  modernizations.   This legislation improves collaboration with the SBA's Office of  Women's Business Ownership and requires the SBA to provide an annual  report to Congress to measure the effectiveness of the WBC program.   We have found that we have got some problems with some of the WBC  offices, and this legislation will help weed out the bad actors by  requiring SBA to develop policies and procedures to reduce the  possibility of awarding grants to a WBC that will likely not remain in  compliance with the program.   This important legislation will not only ensure the integrity of the  WBC program, but also support female entrepreneurs in their business  ventures.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Davids and Ms. Tenney for  working in a bipartisan manner to ensure this bill reached the House  floor. I thank the chair for advancing this bill.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6441, which was  unanimously reported out of our committee and has previously passed the  House floor in a similar form.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), a strong advocate for small  businesses and the ranking member of the Small Business Subcommittee  for Underserved, Agricultural, and Rural Business Development.    Mr. Speaker, the WBC program has delivered for  women-owned small businesses for many years. This legislation  reauthorizes the program, increases accountability and oversight, and  ensures the program continues to serve our entrepreneurs in the future.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6441, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support today of H.R. 6450, the SCORE for Small Business  Act.   SCORE is the largest network of free private-sector volunteer  mentors. They provide entrepreneurs with trainings on starting a  business; succession planning; and management, finance, and marketing  tools.   SCORE mentors have helped small businesses pivot their business model  during the pandemic. They have shared marketing and data analytics  expertise to help entrepreneurs grow their customer base and counseled  numerous startups on the first steps to begin a business.   In addition to reauthorizing the program, H.R. 6450 takes important  strides to add new program safeguards, data standards, and reporting  requirements.   I am confident the provisions of this bill will support small  business, improve SBA's and Congress' oversight of the SCORE program,  and ensure that the integrity of the SCORE Association is restored and  maintained.   Congresswoman Kim is a great advocate for small businesses and their  resource partners, and I appreciate her work on this legislation. I  also thank Ms. Craig and the chair for advancing this legislation.   H.R. 6450 was favorably reported out of the Committee on Small  Business unanimously and passed the House last Congress in a similar  form. I urge my colleagues to similarly pass the bill today on the  House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), the ranking member on the  Small Business Subcommittee of Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and  Workforce Development; a small business owner herself; and a great  advocate for small businesses.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses consistently highlight the importance  of resources to grow their business and serve their communities.   The private sector driven SCORE mentorship program is an important  tool for small businesses seeking assistance and guidance during these  challenging economic times.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6450, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop for  Small Business Compliance Act of 2021.   Federal agencies are required to publish small business compliance  guides for certain regulations. Presently, these guides are housed in  different agency websites making it difficult for small businesses to  find and utilize.   This bipartisan legislation will create a one-stop-shop that will  make it easier for small businesses to comply with Federal regulations.  This bill will also require the centralized website to list contact  information for the appropriate agency staff who could provide  regulatory assistance to small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado) and  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne) for working in tandem to  bring this issue to the forefront.   H.R. 4877 passed out of committee by a voice vote and similar  language passed the House floor in the 116th Congress. I encourage all  Members to support this legislation.  [[Page H4474]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, having the rules of the  road clearly and succinctly in one location for all small business  owners is instrumental. The One Stop Shop for Small Business Compliance  Act of 2021 will ensure this occurs at the SBA.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for advancing this legislation that  better informs the Nation's small businesses, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6454, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act of 2022.   The Nation's regulatory environment directly impacts small businesses  and America's entrepreneurs. With limited resources and staff, small  business owners are often wearing many hats throughout the entire  workday, including ensuring compliance with all Federal regulations.  Now more than ever, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups need  a strong advocate in Washington supporting them when it comes to  regulations.   My bill, which was favorably reported out of committee by a voice  vote, will improve and enhance the Office of Advocacy. H.R. 6454 will  ensure the office is able to speak on international and trade matters.   In addition to passing out of committee earlier this year, this  legislation also passed the House floor by voice vote in the 116th  Congress. Congress has the ability to structurally enhance an executive  branch office that  [[Page H4475]]  operates independently and reinforce it on behalf of small businesses.   I thank my colleague, Representative Troy Carter from Louisiana, for  working with me in a bipartisan manner to improve the SBA's Office of  Advocacy. I also thank the chair for helping bring this legislation  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``yes'' vote on this bill that puts  America's small businesses first.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the Nation is getting ready to  celebrate National Small Business Week. This will be a time to honor  and recognize Main Street USA. Additionally, it will be a time to hear  from them about what is impacting their operations and what Congress  can do to further support them.   The five small business bills before us today take steps to enhance  and support programs at the Small Business Administration, which is the  sole Federal agency that was created to assist the Nation's smallest  firms.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for working in a bipartisan manner to  advance all these bills. I urge a ``yes'' vote on all of them,  including H.R. 6454, and I yield back balance of my time.
