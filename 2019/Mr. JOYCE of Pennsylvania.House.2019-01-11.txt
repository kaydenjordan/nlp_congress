 Madam Speaker, it is with a great sense of  honor that I stand before you to deliver my first address on the floor  of the people's House.   As legislators, one of our fundamental duties is to fully fund the  government and to do it on time. But there are Federal employees, such  as the brave corrections officers working at FCI Loretto, people whom,  as their doctor, I have treated. These people continue to go without  pay.   These hardworking men and women do not deserve this shutdown. No  American does.   We are in this situation because Democrats refuse to compromise and  fund the border wall, even though many of them have voted to do so in  the past.   Today, I offer a question to my colleagues across the aisle: What  changed? Are you really willing to reverse a previous position and keep  government closed just so you can resist the President's agenda?  [[Page H469]]    It is time to fund the wall and send the President an appropriations  package that he will sign. I urge my Democratic friends to negotiate so  we can get back to work for the American people.                            ____________________
