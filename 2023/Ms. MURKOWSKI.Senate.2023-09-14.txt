 Mr. President, in Alaska, we have no shortage  of scenic wilderness to explore. From the unrivaled beauty of a  bluebird day in the Prince William Sound, to the peaks of the Denali  National Park and Preserve, to the winding tributaries of the glacier- fed Tanana river, my bias may be showing, but Alaska is the Nation's  undisputed leader in outdoor recreational opportunities, both in sum  and splendor.   But one of Alaska's most treasured locales is not just an exemplary  jewel case of our outdoors, but a labor of love from the outstanding  volunteers and employees who have put their heart and soul into making  it a world-class nature center. The Eagle River Nature Center is the  crowning centerpiece of the Chugach State Park, located in Southcentral  Alaska within the municipality of Anchorage. And the driving force  behind the Eagle River Nature Center has been its cofounder and  executive director, Asta Spurgis. Sadly, for the many Alaskans and out- of-state visitors who frequent the Eagle River Nature Center, Asta is  leaving her post.   From 1993 through 1995, the park's budget was dropping off, and the  center could no longer afford to operate year-round, forcing them to  have limited hours only in the summer. In stepped the Friends of Eagle  River Nature Center, Inc., a nonprofit formed in 1996 that revived the  park by forging new trails, offering maintenance for public use  facilities, and stepping up in the day-to-day operations of the park  that helped it become a destination for guests across the world. At the  head of that effort was Asta Spurgis, whose passion and dedication for  ensuring  [[Page S4521]]  that the park was accessible and pristine meant finding new and  innovative ways to fund the operations.   From its inception as a bold experiment to where it stands now, as a  shining model of what public-private partnership can look like, Asta  Spurgis has been at the helm. Alaskans will miss her commitment and  leadership, but her legacy can be seen in the students who visit and  get firsthand classes on natural sciences and the tens of thousands of  Alaskans and tourists who get to explore the Chugach State Park. I  commend Asta for her lifetime of work in making Alaska's wilderness a  more beautiful and more accessible space to explore.                            ____________________
