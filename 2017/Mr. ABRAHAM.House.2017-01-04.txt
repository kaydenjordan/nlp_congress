 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a true  servant of the people. Many knew him as a former schoolbus driver, the  chairman of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, or a successful  nursery owner in Forest Hill, Louisiana.   Some of you here today knew him as former Congressman Clyde Holloway.  Mr. Holloway was one of the first Republicans in Louisiana to be  elected to Congress since Reconstruction. Serving from 1986 to 1993,  Mr. Holloway was a trailblazer for other Republican lawmakers in our  great State.   On August 16, 2016, I, along with many Louisianans, were saddened to  hear of the news of Mr. Holloway's passing. Clyde left a legacy among  his constituents of always looking out and representing their best  interests.   I stand before you today to pay tribute to Mr. Holloway and the life  he lived. He fought the good fight. He finished his course. I urge you  today to join me and my constituents in honoring the life of Clyde  Holloway by charting our course to lead and represent the best  interests of the people who entrusted their leadership to us today.                       Honoring the Life of Bobby Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man whose  life was a living definition of courage.   In 1986, working as a Louisiana State trooper, Bobby Smith, from  Buckeye, Louisiana, was shot in the face and blinded in the line of  duty. He not only lost his sight, but also lost the career that he  deeply loved.   Never one to succumb to adversity, Bobby earned a Ph.D., authored  books, and set out on a path of helping others. In 2001, he organized  the Foundation for Officers Recovering from Traumatic Events. This  foundation helped provide training and counseling to law enforcement  individuals, firefighters, emergency services personnel, and their  families going through tough times from various traumatic events.   Bobby's will to help others would carry him through his personal  challenges as he traveled across the United States and throughout the  world literally sharing his story and lifting up others. Before his  death in October of this year, Mr. Smith had addressed and touched the  lives of over 1 million people.   Many who knew Bobby would often hear him say, ``I see. I see.''  Today, as we remember Bobby Smith, let us not be blinded by our own  tragedies, adversities, and obstacles in our lives, but let us also  have the courage that Bobby had to look beyond and see the beauty of  life and see the good in others.                            ____________________
