 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2116) to enhance stabilization of conflict-affected areas  and prevent violence and fragility globally, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2116         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Fragility Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the United Nations, an unprecedented 68.5       million people around the world, the highest level ever       recorded, are currently forcibly displaced from their homes.        (2) According to the World Bank, violence and violent       conflict are now the leading causes of displacement and food       insecurity worldwide, driving 80 percent of humanitarian       needs, with the same conflicts accounting for the majority of       forcibly displaced persons every year since 1991.        (3) According to the Institute for Economics and Peace,       violence containment costs the global economy $14.76 trillion       a year, or 12.4 percent of the world's GDP.        (4) Violence and violent conflict underpin many of the       United States Government's key national security challenges.       Notably, violent conflicts allow for environments in which       terrorist organizations recruit and thrive, while the       combination of violence, corruption, poverty, poor       governance, and underdevelopment often enables transnational       gangs and criminal networks to wreak havoc and commit       atrocities worldwide.        (5) According to research by the University of Maryland and       University of Pittsburgh, exposure to violence increases       support for violence and violent extremism. Research       increasingly finds exposure to violence as a predictor of       future participation in violence, including violent       extremism.        (6) United States foreign policy and assistance efforts in       highly violent and fragile states remain governed by an       outdated patchwork of authorities that prioritize responding       to immediate needs rather than solving the problems that       cause them.        (7) Lessons learned over the past 20 years, documented by       the 2013 Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction       Lessons Learned Study, the 2016 Fragility Study Group report,       and the 2018 Special Inspector General for Afghanistan       Lessons Learned Study on Stabilization, show that effective,       sustained United States efforts to reduce violence and       stabilize fragile and violence-affected states require       clearly defined goals and strategies, adequate long-term       funding, rigorous and iterative conflict analysis,       coordination across the United States Government, including       strong civil-military coordination, attention to the problem       of corruption, and integration with and leadership from       national and sub-national partners, including local civil       society organizations, traditional justice systems, and local       governance structures.        (8) The ``Stabilization Assistance Review'' released in       2018 by the Departments of State and Defense and the United       States Agency for International Development states, ``The       United States has strong national security and economic       interests in reducing levels of violence and promoting       stability in areas affected by armed conflict.''. The Review       further states, ``Stabilization is an inherently political       endeavor that requires aligning U.S. Government efforts--      diplomatic engagement, foreign assistance, and defense--      toward supporting locally legitimate authorities and systems       to peaceably manage conflict and prevent violence.''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) ensure that all relevant Federal departments and       agencies coordinate to achieve coherent, long-term goals for       programs designed to stabilize conflict-affected areas and       prevent violence and fragility globally, including when       implementing the Global Fragility Initiative established       pursuant to section 6;        (2) seek to improve global, regional, and local       coordination of relevant international and multilateral       development and donor organizations regarding efforts to       stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent violence and       fragility globally, and, where practicable and appropriate,       align such efforts with multilateral goals and indicators;        (3) expand and enhance the effectiveness of United States       foreign assistance programs and activities to stabilize       conflict-affected areas and prevent violence and fragility       globally;        (4) support the research and development of effective       approaches to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent       violence and fragility globally, and data collection efforts       relevant to such approaches; and        (5) improve the tools and authorities for assessment,       monitoring, and evaluation needed to enable learning and       adaptation by such relevant Federal departments and agencies       working to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent       violence and fragility globally.

SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ASSISTANCE FOR THE GLOBAL                     FRAGILITY INITIATIVE.         It is the sense of Congress that the President, the       Secretary of State, the Administrator of USAID, the Secretary       of Defense, and the heads of other relevant Federal       departments and agencies should work with the appropriate       congressional committees to provide sufficient types and       levels of funding to--        (1) allow for more adaptive and responsive policy and       program planning, implementation, and scaling under the       Global Fragility Initiative established pursuant to section       6, including through more flexible funding mechanisms and       exemptions from specific and minimum funding levels when such       exemptions would make such programs better able to respond to       local needs, the results of monitoring and evaluation, or       changed circumstances in relevant countries;        (2) better integrate the initiative and other conflict and       violence reduction objectives and activities into other       policy and program areas, where appropriate; and        (3) support transparent and accountable multilateral funds,       initiatives, and strategies to enhance and better coordinate       both private and public efforts to stabilize conflict-      affected areas and prevent violence and fragility globally.

SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services,       and Appropriations of the Senate; and        (B) the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and       Appropriations of the House of Representatives.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2116.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, we focus a great  deal on the importance of diplomacy and development as pillars of  American foreign policy. The reason why we to do this is simple:  diplomacy and development advance our interests and values in a way  that saves lives, that prevents war, that stops crises before they  start, and helps stabilize countries where conflicts have occurred.   These efforts strengthen old friendships and build new bridges of  understanding with people and cultures and governments throughout the  world.   We will always need a strong military, but sending our servicemembers  [[Page H3969]]  into harm's way should, likewise, always be a measure of last resort.  So, on our committee, we look for ways to make our diplomacy and  development more effective. We try to give our diplomats and  development experts the tools and resources they need to carry out  their critical work.   Today, the House is taking up six bills aimed at doing just that. The  first is a bill of mine that I am glad is moving forward.   Let me thank our ranking member, my friend, Mr. McCaul of Texas, for  joining as a cosponsor. This legislation gets at the heart of what we  want to see from our diplomatic and development efforts around the  world: helping places already torn apart by violence to recover and  preventing the start of violence in other places where factors are ripe  for its outbreak.   Over the past two decades, we have learned a great deal about what  drives violence and instability in what are called fragile states. We  know that it takes clearly defined goals and strategies. We know that  it takes strong, sustained investment over the long term. We know that  it takes serious research and analysis. And we know that it takes  agencies across government working together toward the same goals.   This bill takes all that knowledge and establishes an overarching  policy framework for the United States Government. It will help ensure  that our government is working in lockstep to prevent violence and  extremism and that we are working closely with civil society groups to  assess internal and external drivers of instability, to implement these  initiatives on the ground, and to constantly monitor and evaluate the  work.   This bill takes into account the fact that no two countries are  alike. Some will be willing partners in this work; others will require  more rigorous engagement to get them on board. For this reason, the  bill requires the selection of priority countries and regions based on  a number of indicators, such as the challenges at hand and the  commitments of respective governments.   The bill also establishes and authorizes the Stabilization and  Prevention Fund and authorizes the Complex Crises Fund for the next 5  years, important steps in making sure this initiative has the resources  needed for success.   This bill will make a real difference in the lives of some of the  world's most vulnerable people and communities, and it will do so in a  way that serves U.S. interests.   The United States must get ahead of the extremist threat if we want  to ensure our own security. This bill helps us to do just that. I ask  for the support of all Members to pass this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the United States works to prevent and stop violence  when we help to build stronger, more secure communities around the  world; when we try to make the most vulnerable regions more stable and  prosperous, we are improving the lives of large numbers of people. We  are also advancing our own interests by eliminating the root causes  that allow extremism to fester and drive threats to our own security.   That is the aim of my bill. That is the aim of this bill we are  considering today. It is a smart approach to a serious foreign policy  challenge.   The House passed it in the last Congress. I hope the other body will  take it up soon so we can get it to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I again thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul.   Policies like this should always be bipartisan. As I always stress,  as does Mr. McCaul, we try to work in a bipartisan way on the House  Foreign Affairs Committee because, after all, the work we are doing is  work for all Americans. It helps all Americans. It helps our great  Nation.   So I again want to thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul. I ask all  Members to support this effort, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 615) to provide women and girls safe access to sanitation  facilities in refugee camps.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 615         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Refugee Sanitation Facility       Safety Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SECURE ACCESS TO SANITATION FACILITIES FOR WOMEN AND                     GIRLS.         Section 501 of the Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal Years 1994       and 1995 (22 U.S.C. 2601 note) is amended in subsection (a)--        (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (10);        (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (11) and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(12) the provision of safe and secure access to       sanitation facilities, with a special emphasis on women and       girls, and vulnerable populations.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 615, the Refugee Sanitation  Facility Safety Act 2019.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Ms. Meng and Mr. Zeldin  for authoring this important bipartisan measure.   We are facing a devastating refugee crisis around the world right  now. Over 25 million people are currently refugees having fled from  violence, conflict, and crisis. Many of these people are now living in  refugee camps.   And let me be clear, we need a foreign policy that addresses the root  causes of this crisis.   So I am pleased we just considered my Global Fragility bill, which  works to prevent the kind of conflict and instability that leads to  these refugee crises.   The United States also needs to open its doors to more of these  families who have fled violence in search of a better life. America  should be leading the world to help in relocating these displaced  people, so they can find new homes and start anew.   And we need to make sure that when people are living in refugee  camps, they are cared for and treated with dignity.   Sadly, far too many women and girls in these camps face danger right  now. Bathrooms and shower facilities have often become dangerous places  with predators taking advantage of poor lighting to stage attacks.   After facing the trauma of being driven from their homes, women and  girls in refugee camps should not have to worry about being sexually  assaulted, period.   We need to do what we can to make sure that refugee camps have safe,  accessible sanitation facilities for everyone. So I am pleased that we  are considering legislation today that works to do just that.   Madam Speaker, with H.R. 615, the State Department, when providing  overseas assistance for refugees, will seek to ensure safe access to  sanitation facilities, especially for those most vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bipartisan bill. I am proud to support  it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, let me say that we are facing a  refugee crisis around the world. Wars, violence, instability--millions  of people have fled their homes in search of safety.   We need to do what we can to help these people find new homes and  start anew. And while they are living in temporary refugee camps, we  need to make sure they have the tools to stay safe and healthy.   The Refugee Sanitation Facility Safety Act of 2019 provides refugee  women and girls with safe access to sanitation facilities.   This is one clear, straightforward way we can help those most  vulnerable people. It is a good, commonsense bill; I am pleased to  support it. And I thank Mr. McCaul as well for his support.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1359) to promote Internet access in developing countries and  update foreign policy toward the Internet, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Global Access Policy       Act of 2019'' or the ``Digital GAP Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to--        (1) encourage the efforts of developing countries to       improve and secure mobile and fixed access to the Internet in       order to catalyze innovation, spur economic growth and job       creation, improve health, education, and financial services,       reduce poverty and gender inequality, mitigate disasters, and       promote free speech, democracy, and good governance;        (2) promote build-once policies and approaches and the       multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance; and        (3) ensure the effective use of United States foreign       assistance resources toward that end.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:  [[Page H3971]]         (1) Internet access has been a driver of economic activity       around the world. Bringing Internet access to the more than       4,000,000,000 people who do not have it could increase global       economic output by $6,700,000,000,000 and raise 500,000,000       people out of poverty.        (2) The number of Internet users has more than tripled from       1,000,000,000 to over 3,000,000,000 since 2005, including       2,000,000,000 living in the developing world, yet more than       half of the world's population remains offline, living       without the economic and social benefits of the Internet. By       the end of 2016, over 80 percent of households in the       developed world had Internet access, compared with just 40       percent of households in developing countries and just 11       percent in the world's least developed countries. Of the       world's offline population, an estimated 75 percent live in       just 20 countries, and rural, female, elderly, illiterate,       and low-income populations are being left behind.        (3) Studies suggest that women are disproportionately       affected by a digital gap in developing countries, where       there are on average 23 percent fewer women online then men.       Bringing an additional 600,000,000 women online could       contribute $13,000,000,000 to $18,000,000,000 to annual GDP       across 144 developing countries.        (4) The United States has been a leader in promoting access       to an open, secure, interoperable Internet around the world.       Recognizing that support for expanded Internet access       furthers United States economic and foreign policy interests,       including efforts to end extreme global poverty and enabling       resilient, democratic societies, the Department of State       launched a diplomatic effort called ``Global Connect''.        (5) Internet access in developing countries is hampered, in       part, by a lack of infrastructure and a poor regulatory       environment for investment. Build-once policies and       approaches, which seek to coordinate public and private       sector investments in roads and other critical       infrastructure, can reduce the number and scale of excavation       and construction activities when installing       telecommunications infrastructure in rights-of-way, thereby       reducing installation costs for high-speed Internet networks       and serving as a development best practice.

(e) Peace Corps.--Section 3 of the Peace Corps Act (22       U.S.C. 2502) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (e); and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(f) It is the sense of Congress that access to the       Internet can transform agriculture, community economic       development, education, environment, health, and youth       development, which are the sectors in which Peace Corps       develops positions for volunteers.        ``(g) In giving attention to the programs, projects,       training, and other activities referred to in subsection (f),       the Peace Corps should develop positions for volunteers that       include leveraging the Internet, as appropriate, for       development, education, and social and economic mobility.''.        (f) Leveraging International Support.--In pursuing the       policy described in this Act, the President should direct       United States representatives to appropriate international       bodies to use the influence of the United States, consistent       with the broad development goals of the United States, to       advocate that each such body--        (1) commit to increase efforts and coordination to promote       affordable, open, and gender-equitable Internet access, in       partnership with stakeholders and consistent with host       countries' absorptive capacity;        (2) integrate affordable and gender-equitable Internet       access data into existing economic and business assessments,       evaluations, and indexes such as the Millennium Challenge       Corporation constraints analysis, the Doing Business reports,       International Monetary Fund Article IV assessments and       country reports, and the Affordability Drivers Index;        (3) standardize the inclusion of broadband conduit as part       of highway or comparable construction projects in developing       countries, in consultation with telecommunications providers,       unless--        (A) such inclusion would create an undue burden;        (B) such inclusion is not necessary based on the       availability of existing broadband infrastructure;        (C) such inclusion would require the incorporation of the       hardware, software, or maintenance of vendors likely to be       subject to extrajudicial direction from a foreign government;       or        (D) a cost-benefit analysis determines that the cost of       such inclusion outweighs the benefits;        (4) provide technical assistance to the regulatory       authorities in developing countries to remove unnecessary       barriers to investment and develop regulations to support       market growth and development;        (5) utilize clear, accountable, and metric-based targets,       including targets with gender-disaggregated data, to measure       the effectiveness of efforts to promote Internet access; and        (6) promote and protect human rights online, such as the       freedoms of expression, religion, belief, assembly, and       association, through resolutions, public statements,       projects, and initiatives, and advocating that member states       of such bodies are held accountable for violations.        (g) Reporting Requirement on Implementation Efforts.--Not       later than one year after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the President shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report on efforts to implement the       policy described in this Act and, to the extent practicable,       describe efforts by the United States Government to--        (1) provide technical and regulatory assistance to promote       Internet access in developing countries;        (2) strengthen and support development of regulations that       incentivize market growth that contributes to increased       Internet access in developing countries;        (3) encourage public and private investment in Internet       infrastructure, including broadband networks and services, in       developing countries;        (4) increase gender-equitable Internet access and close       gender gaps in Internet and other information and       communications technology adoption and use, especially in       countries in which social norms limit such adoption and use       by women and girls, and otherwise encourage or support       Internet deployment, competition, and adoption; and        (5) conduct outreach and explore partnership opportunities       with the private sector on activities that advance the policy       described in this Act.       SEC. 5. COST LIMITATION.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the provisions of this Act.       SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act may be construed to infringe upon the       related functions of any Executive agency (as defined in       section 105 of title 5, United States Code) vested in such       agency under any other provision of law.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1359.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, when we talk about our development efforts around the  world, we often focus on very big concepts, promoting democracy and  human rights, making governments more open and accountable, expanding  economic opportunity.   Those are, of course, very important ideas, and we need to keep those  big-picture goals in mind. But we also need to be working constantly to  develop the specific day-to-day tools and efforts that will help us  advance towards those goals.   In the 21st century, a lot of those tools have to do with technology.  Think of the way the internet has changed the global economy; the way  technology has improved communication; the sharing of information; the  ability of people to participate in worldwide markets and  conversations.   Now, think of the fact that 4 billion people around the developing  world do not have access to the internet; think of the untapped  potential, the number of people who cannot participate in a constantly  expanding online marketplace of goods and services and ideas.   The number of people with stories to tell, whether they are about  life in remote communities or the corruption of a repressive  government, but who cannot get their hands on the modern-day tools we  use to communicate with one another; the number of people who cannot  get information about a new opportunity or an impending disaster  because they don't have a laptop or a smart phone.   As technology continues to rush forward in so many aspects of modern  life, unfortunately, far too many people are being left behind. This  bill aims to help close that so-called digital gap.   This legislation would push the State Department, USAID, the Peace  Corps, and American representatives in international bodies to  incorporate internet access into development planning.   There are a number of ways we want to do this:   Through diplomacy, advising other governments to prioritize this  issue; through development, by incorporating this priority into our  work on the ground, especially with respect to women, minorities, and  other marginalized groups; and in the international and multilateral  groups conducting assessments and evaluations of development progress,  we want to see access to the internet as an important goal and metric.   This legislation builds on our country's longstanding leadership role  in this area.   Let's not forget, the United States created and advanced the internet  in the first place, and Congress has been working on this for decades,  starting with the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, which is  credited for helping create the first internet browser.   It is an important legacy to build on. And it coincides with an  important foreign policy goal.   So I want to thank Mr. Wright of Texas, this bill's author, along  with  [[Page H3973]]  Ranking Member McCaul and Representatives Lieu and Bera, two able  members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their hard work.   I am glad to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, the internet is an incredible tool that has  shaped the world in the last generation.   It allows entrepreneurs in emerging markets to sell their products in  global markets. It allows citizens and journalists living under  oppressive regimes or in war zones to get information out to the world.   This bill will establish that our foreign policy is to help advance  these positive developments.   I urge its passage. It passed the House in the last Congress, and I  hope the other body will take it up soon.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
