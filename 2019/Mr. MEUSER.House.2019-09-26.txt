 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Captain Jason Jones from Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania.   Captain Jones graduated at the top of his class from the United  States Military Academy at West Point. After graduating, he served as  team leader for the U.S. Army's 1st Battalion, 3rd Group Special  Forces.   While deployed overseas, he was tragically killed in action on June  2, 2014, in Afghanistan.   Jason is survived by his wife, Dr. Amy Jones; parents, Jay and Suzy  Jones; and sister and brother-in-law, Drs. Elizabeth and Alex Gambogi.   I recently attended an event that raised funds to honor Jason's  service and ultimate sacrifice. The fundraiser was attended by hundreds  of family and friends. The event raises money for scholarships,  benefiting those in the community who are interested in following  Jason's patriotic pursuit of military service.   Mr. Speaker, let us never forget and always support those, like  Captain Jason Jones, who made the ultimate sacrifice to safeguard our  freedoms.   Jason is so lovingly remembered by his family and his community. He  has left behind a great legacy and a proud and grateful community and  country.
