(2) Reimbursement of incidental expenses.--The Secretary       may provide for reimbursement of incidental expenses incurred       by a person providing voluntary services under this       subsection.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert in the Record extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is going to ensure that the Federal  Government plays a constructive role in helping to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe and over Japan. In 2020, we  expect a number of events and activities, including a flyover of The  National Mall, to honor the sacrifices made by many to preserve the  freedoms that we continue to enjoy today.   The planning for these efforts is already underway, and having the  Congress recognize the importance of these activities not only will  send a message to the rest of the Federal Government, but, more  importantly, to our veterans who have given everything to maintain our  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  for all his hard work on this. This is an easy bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
