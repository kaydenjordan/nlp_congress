 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the great State of  Illinois for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I support the Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access  Program Inclusion Act, which makes a simple technical fix. It would now  include, as noted, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and  the American Indian consortium as eligible recipients of funding that  would help improve voting access for people with disabilities.   Originally, this bill was to be paired with the Confirmation of  Congressional Observer Access Act on the suspension calendar, and I  must note that I am pretty disappointed we are not also moving forward  with the Congressional Observer Access Act.   I introduced this bill with the support of Ranking Member Davis in  July, and I believe that it is a missed opportunity to increase  Americans' public trust in our elections.   The Congressional Observer Access Act would simply have clarified  that designated congressional election observers--that is, individuals  who have been designated in writing by Congress--would have the access  they need to observe the administration of Federal elections.   This is not a partisan bill. In fact, Congress already has this  authorization under the Constitution. This straightforward bill would  have provided clarity, which our State and local election officials  requested in order to provide observer access more readily.   I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  walked away from doing these bills on suspension, and I encourage them  to work with Ranking Member Davis and myself to get this passed as soon  as possible. We must work together to take commonsense steps that  promote election integrity.
