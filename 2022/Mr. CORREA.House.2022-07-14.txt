 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent from my  hometown, Anaheim, California: Connie Deeken Williams.   Last month, Mrs. Williams celebrated her 110th birthday. Happy  birthday to Connie. She is now the oldest resident in Orange County on  record, and she is one of only 100 Americans alive today to reach that  milestone.   Mrs. Williams was born in 1912 and grew up on a farm in North Dakota  with three siblings. During the 1918 pandemic, she survived the Spanish  flu. After graduating from high school, she moved across the country to  Los Angeles, working as a maid and bookkeeper to help her brother pay  rent.   The United States has come a long way since 1912, and I have no doubt  of our American ability to move forward just like Mrs. Williams has  done every day of her life.   Happy birthday to Connie. Happy birthday from all of us.                            ____________________
