 Mr. President, it is my honor today to recognize  the career and service of Robert J. Halstead, a pillar of the Nevada  environmental community, who retired earlier this month after serving  the great State of Nevada for over three decades.   Bob has been instrumental as a leader in the fight against the failed  and fiscally irresponsible proposal to dump our Nation's nuclear waste  at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Since  [[Page S4939]]  2001, Bob has served as the executive director for the Nevada Agency  for Nuclear Projects, where his watchful eye and his inexhaustible  passion for protecting our State has been an invaluable resource.   On numerous occasions, Bob has stood before the State and the U.S.  Congress to share his expertise on the subjects of nuclear waste,  radioactive materials, and nuclear waste transportation.   We owe Bob Halstead a debt of gratitude for the crucial work he has  done to protect Nevadans and the State itself from becoming the  Nation's nuclear dumping ground.   Bob also has defended the state beyond the Yucca Mountain fight. Two  years ago, when it came to light that the Department of Energy had  secretly shipped a half ton of weapons-grade plutonium to the Nevada  National Security Site, Bob led the charge to right this incredible  wrong committed against our State.   I am deeply grateful for Bob's tireless work to protect the health  and safety of our community and our environment. He has been a source  of great support for me and my staff, offering his unmatched knowledge  of the complex history of Yucca Mountain and our State's fight against  the ill-advised proposal, to which Nevadans have never consented.   Even though Bob is taking a step back from his work and is beginning  a well-deserved retirement, I know that he will remain a continued  source of inspiration, knowledge, and passion as we continue in our  fight to defend Nevada. I thank Bob Halstead for a lifetime of service,  and I wish him and his family all the best in this new chapter of  life.                            ____________________
