The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment is unnecessary  because it would exempt certain discrimination settlements from the  bill's ban on third-party payments. But nothing in the underlying bill  prevents a victim of discrimination from obtaining relief, and that is  the important point.   The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2016 explicitly permits  remedial payments to third-party victims who are directly and  proximately harmed by the defendant's wrongdoing. Nor does the bill  preclude wider conduct remedies used in discrimination cases.   For example, nothing in the bill bars the Department of Justice from  requiring a defendant to implement workplace training and monitoring  programs. The ban on third-party payments merely ensures that the  defendant remains responsible for performing these tasks itself and is  not forced to outsource set sums for the work to third parties who  might be friendly with a given administration.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee  will be postponed.              Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in part B of House Report 115-363.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is unnecessary  because it would exempt settlements that direct funds to remedy  indirect harm resulting from violations of the Clean Air Act and other  violations. But that is precisely the problem.   How best to address indirect harm is a policy question that is  properly decided by the elected representatives of Congress only and  not by agency bureaucrats or prosecutors.   An example that highlights this is the $2.7 billion mitigation fund  that the Department of Justice required in its settlement of claims  against Volkswagen. That fund mitigated direct harm, which is permitted  under this bill.   The problem was that, through a second fund, the Obama Justice  Department required Volkswagen to spend an additional $2 billion on an  administration electric vehicle initiative after Congress twice refused  to appropriate funds for it. It is that subversion of Congress' power  of the purse that this bill is designed to target. Nothing in this bill  lets corporate polluters off the hook, and it is nonsense to say  otherwise.   If direct remediation of the harm is impossible or impractical, the  full penalty is still paid, but it goes to the Treasury. After that,  the decision on how best to use it is left to the people's elected  representatives in Congress rather than the executive branch.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    I have the script right here. Let me tell  you how I define them.   I don't know. Bureaucrats. You tell me.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time about the  brilliant amendment, it is, again, not necessary.   And in response to the question, the court does not always approve  every one of these; and that is the point.   The gist of this amendment and the purpose of the bill is to restore  and strengthen our Article I power under the Constitution. You may not  like the way Congress operates, you may not like all of the decisions  that are made here, but in their infinite wisdom, this is how the  Founders designed our system. It has worked very well, and it will  continue to do so. For that reason, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in part B of House Report 115-363.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 11, insert after ``settlement agreement'' the       following: ``(other than an excepted settlement agreement)''.        Page 4, strike line 4, and insert the following:        (d) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) The term ``excepted settlement agreement'' means a       settlement agreement that pertains to providing restitution       for a State.        (2) The term ``settlement agreement''    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I think, when we come to the floor, we  are obligated to as much educate our colleagues who may be back in  their offices or in meetings as it is to educate the general public.                                time  1630    The name of this bill is distorted and incorrect. I think it is  important to note what happens when the Department of Justice engages  in lawsuits on behalf of the American people, and they are the American  people's lawyer, or they are sued.   In many instances, there is something called a consent decree and a  settlement that generates funds that can be utilized for the betterment  of the American people.   So why don't you view this side of the aisle with the betterment of  the American people because we are questioning legislation that would  eliminate the opportunity for those who are doing good work to be  funded by career professionals in the Justice Department.   So the basis of this bill is to throw this money over into the  Congress, of which I have great respect in terms of its Article I  powers, requiring a congressional appropriation for each beneficiary  fund established as relief in a lawfully negotiated settlement to  victims, such as in the case of predatory lending, employment  discrimination, pollution, environmental hazards, and would greatly  strain Congress' already limited legislative resources and scarce time.   They want us to now, line by line, disseminate these funds that can  be done by career professionals dealing with improving on the issue  upon which the government was sued. It opens the doors to industry  influence and obstruction.   I don't believe we have earmarks anymore. I happen to be a supporter  of getting moneys to the community. We don't have an appropriations  bill now, we don't have a budget now. So it is almost November, and the  Congress has not yet appropriated funds to run the government nor have  they passed a budget. That would be the maze of which you would throw a  very proficient process of allowing these funds to be distributed.   The Jackson Lee amendment would exempt from this confused bill  settlement agreements that would provide restitution to States that are  not parties to the litigation. That means, for example, after Hurricane  Harvey, there was an explosion at the Arkema chemical plant. Nine  trailers exploded and several first responders went to the hospital. I  would want to seek funds to be able to help them.   We also understand that there are many organizations representing the  people. Public Citizen, a nonprofit membership organization, they are  against it. The Urban League is against it. The counties have issued a  resolution, local counties. They are against it.   I think there is no clearer evidence to vote this particular bill  down, but to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment would exempt  settlements providing restitution to a State, the idea presumably being  that the State could then distribute money as it sees fit for  generalized harm to its citizens, but nothing in this bill prevents  Congress from making block grants to States to address generalized  harm. Indeed, Congress regularly appropriates money to States to deal  with challenges, including environmental cleanups. Examples of this  include the EPA Superfund and the Brownfields grants.   This bill merely insists that decisions on when such grants are  appropriate and in what amounts, that those decisions be made by  accountable representatives in Congress and not agency bureaucrats and  prosecutors.   Compensating direct victims is a job for the Justice Department.  Broader projects are a policy question that should be decided by  Congress.  [[Page H8122]]    Mr. Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, this is my very point. My very point  is a transparent and clear system of distribution of funds, and the  career professionals determining what entities need those funds is a  clearer system than what would occur if moneys were dumped onto  Congress outside of the normal budgetary and appropriations process, of  which we are having a very difficult time as we speak.   The process that we have now, my amendment says that these settlement  agreements that provide restitution to States that are not parties to  the litigation, they shouldn't be covered by the elimination of the  right for the career professionals to distribute these funds.   It also acknowledges the respect for the Congress and the work that  it has to do, but it also acknowledges counties like Jefferson County,  Texas, the resolution to the National Association of Counties. They are  against this bill because it would disallow funds derived from court  settlements for injuries to the environment from being distributed to  States, counties, and parishes, borrowers in proximity to the pollution  event. These are real people representing real people right on the  ground asking for us to not pass this legislation.   I would say to my good friend, why don't we use our Article I powers  to begin investigations on the separation of powers relevant to the  administration and its actions. Why don't we begin looking at whether  there are high crimes and misdemeanors.   I mean, there are many things that our Article I powers can do, but,  in this instance, I think that this has not proven to be a failure, and  the only failure in it is the obsession that my friends have with the  past administration.   I want to have something that has worked for the county governments,  people who live in counties and cities and States. If they were harmed  during Hurricane Harvey, for example, by an explosion and 23 first  responders went to the hospital and many houses were evacuated, I  believe it would be appropriate to leave the system in which those  dollars can go directly to those counties and cities and States and to  improve the quality of life.   Mr. Chair, I ask my friends to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, the proposed legislation, as currently drafted, could be  construed to preclude all third-party payments in settlement  agreements, other than restitution to identifiable victims.   Requiring a congressional appropriation for each beneficiary fund  established as relief in a lawfully negotiated settlement to victims,  such as in cases of predatory lending, employment discrimination and  pollution through environmental hazardous, would greatly strain  Congress' already limited legislative resources and scarce time, while  opening the doors to industry influence and obstruction in routine  enforcement matters.   Congress lacks the time, expertise, and resources to properly review  and make enforcement decisions on behalf of Federal agencies.   The cost of delays associated with this scheme would have devastating  consequences for the public health, environment, and local communities.   Accordingly, the Jackson Lee Amendment would excecpt cases where  funds are directed to states to remediate the generalized harm of  unlawful conduct beyond harms to identifiable victims.   Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment would exempt from H.R. 732  settlement agreements that provide restitution to states that are not  parties to litigation.   As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S. Department of  Justice pursued lawsuits against mortgage lenders and banks that  engaged in discriminatory lending practices, such as those targeted by  this legislation.   Research shows that African Americans and Latinos were discriminated  against and steered into subprime loans even when they qualified for  conventional loans.   Moreover, African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more  likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which resulted  in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional loans.   Pursuant to the settlement agreements, available under current law,  the Justice Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a  portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) certified housing counseling intermediaries to  provide consumer relief in the communities that were hit hardest.   HUD has approved 37 housing counseling intermediaries that financial  institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party providers of  consumer relief under the terms of the Justice Department settlement  agreements.   Additionally, these HUD-certified housing counseling providers  deliver financial education and coaching to individuals to inform them  of their home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and  remain homeowners.   In fact, since 2008, 40 affiliates have provided housing counseling  services--to date serving more than 200,000 clients in mostly  underserved areas.   The success of housing counseling programs is undisputed.   Borrowers who have used housing counseling are one-third less likely  to be seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who are in  default are 60 percent more likely to save their homes.   The benefits of these programs are tangible and must continue to be  made available to the public.   This example is particularly pertinent as Houston recovers from  hurricane Harvey, a tragedy that displaced tens of thousands of my  constituents.   There are still over 61 thousand people living in hotels throughout  Texas.   Under current law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may  include Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in settlement  agreements to offset the harms of unlawful conduct by requiring parties  to undertake an environmentally beneficial project or activity that  ``is not required by law,'' but that a defendant agrees to undertake as  part of the settlement of an enforcement action.   In 2012, the EPA and Justice Department resolved the civil liability  of MOEX Offshore through a settlement agreement resulting from the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that included funds to several Gulf  states, including Texas, where Texas was not a party to the complaint,  but received $3.25 million for SEPs and other responsive actions.   H.R. 732, would prohibit these agreements and many of the important  benefits now provided by EPA.   The bill's definition excludes, ``any payment by a party to provide  restitution for or otherwise remedy the actual harm (including to the  environment), directly and proximately caused by the alleged conduct of  the party that is the basis for the settlement agreement.''   This exception is too narrowly drawn to allow for numerous beneficial  uses of settlement monies.   Thus, for example, the bill would appear to ban the following  entirely legitimate, appropriate uses of settlement funds that are  currently permitted by EPA:   (1) Pollution prevention projects that improve plant procedures and  technologies, and/or operation and maintenance practices, that will  prevent additional pollution at its source;   (2) Environmental restoration projects including activities that  protect local ecosystems from actual or potential harm resulting from  the violation;   (3) Facility assessments and audits, including investigations of  local environmental quality, environmental compliance audits, and  investigations into opportunities to reduce the use, production, and  generation of toxic materials;   (4) Programs that promote environmental compliance by promoting  training or technical support to other members of the regulated  community; and   (5) Projects that provide technical assistance or equipment to a  responsible state or local emergency response entity for purposes of  emergency planning or preparedness.   Each of these programs provide important protections of human health  and the environment in communities that have been harmed by  environmental violations.   However, because they are unlikely to be construed as redressing  ``actual (environmental) harm, directly and proximately caused'' by the  alleged violator, the bill before this committee would prohibit every  one of them.   On August 31, 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, dangerous  chemicals at the Arkema chemical facility in Crosby, Texas, exploded  and burned.   Nine trailers at the plant contained organic peroxides that first  exploded and burned, sending 23 first responders to the hospital. In  addition, despite a 1\1/2\ mile radius evacuation from the chemical  releases, dozens of residents were effected for days by the noxious  fumes, including headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and burning eyes.   This recent incident is a prime example of how restitution to a  community under an enforcement settlement should work. EPA should (not  sure if they are) engage in enforcement activities against Arkema,  including civil fines and restitution to the community. There were  [[Page H8123]]  clear health impacts on many in the community and a settlement could,  as an example, fund health care assistance short term, or even long  term monitoring of lung health. However, if H.R. 732 were law, only  first responders would likely have the ability to seek restitution.  This is not okay. It utterly fails to help make a community whole after  such a terrible event.   Background facts:   23 first responders were sent to the hospital due to exposure to  chemical fumes.   Residents within a 1\1/2\ mile radius were asked to evacuate, though  in this low-income neighborhood in the aftermath of the storm, many  were unable to.   Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), and original cosponsor of H.R. 732 and  representative of the district that plant and affected community are  located in, at the time told ABC News as events were unfolding that the  situation was ``very dangerous . . . (and) . . . the worst-case  scenario is that this chemical plant could explode.''   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the  Jackson Lee Amendment.         Proposed Resolution on the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act         A resolution from Jefferson County, Texas to the National       Association of Counties seeking to maintain the status quo       for states, counties, parishes and boroughs being able to       receive damages payments for environmental crimes in       proximity to them (e.g., Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon).        Issue: H.R. 732, a bill that may restrict or disallow       Department of Justice Supplemental Environmental Plans from       benefiting states, counties, parishes and boroughs in       proximity to pollution events that result in court       settlements for environmental damages.        Proposed Policy: The National Association of Counties       (NACo) opposes any provisions within the final version of       H.R. 732 that would disallow funds derived from court       settlements for injuries to the environment from being       distributed to states, counties, parishes and boroughs in       proximity to the pollution event.        Background: On Jan 30, 2017, Representative Goodlatte,       along with 34 other cosponsors, introduced the Stop       Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732) which could ban       or restrict the current practice involving Supplemental       Environmental Projects' distribution of court settlement       proceeds to states, counties, parishes and boroughs.        H.R. 732 has been referred to the U.S. House of       Representatives Judiciary Committee and assigned to the       Regulatory Reform, Commercial & Antitrust Law Subcommittee.        Members of the Committee are unclear about H.R. 732's       provisions relating to payments to remediate direct harm,       including environmental harm, done by defendant's wrongful       activity.        This is particularly important in the environmental       context, in which the injury to the environment may be       diffuse and there may be no identifiable victims.        Currently, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Congress       may both have roles in determining eligibility for states,       counties, parishes and boroughs in proximity to a pollution       event for receiving funds from a settlement agreement.        H.R. 732 is unclear on this issue, prompting dissenting       opinions about whether the bill prevents states, counties,       parishes and boroughs in proximity to pollution events (e.g.,       the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills) from       receiving funds derived from court settlements.        NACo should oppose any provision in H.R. 732 that modifies       or restricts current practice in distributing proceeds from       court settlement agreements for environmental damage events.        Fiscal/Urban/Rural Impact: Congressional concurrence with       this NACo resolution upholds the status quo practice in court       settlement agreements for environmental events.        Sponsor: Jeff R. Branick, Judge, Jefferson County, Texas    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just respond to my  learned colleague by quoting a renowned liberal legal scholar, the late  Abner Mikva, who explained in a law review article back in 1986, that  even if it were less efficient to go through Congress, that would be no  reason to cede the point of principle. This is what he wrote:   ``To ensure that Congress would act as the first branch of  government, the constitutional Framers gave the legislature virtually  exclusive power to control the Nation's purse strings. . . . They knew  that the power of the purse was the most far-reaching and effectual of  all governmental powers. . . . Doubtless they understood that a  collection of diverse individuals representing diverse interests . . .  would less efficiently and less coherently devise fiscal policy than  would a single `treasurer' or `fiscal czar.' Yet they chose, for good  reason, to suffer this cost and bear its risks.''   That is from a liberal legal scholar, and, of course, conservatives  agree.   The system that the Founders set up, the reason and purpose for  Article I, is to allow these major decisions to be made by the elected  Representatives of Congress, and, for that reason, we oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Donovan). The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will  be postponed.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Cicilline    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part B of House Report 115-363.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would exempt  settlements resolving allegations of predatory or fraudulent conduct  involving residential mortgage-backed securities, as we have heard.  Ironically, it creates an exception in the very situation in which the  abuses we highlighted earlier arose.   The key point here is that nothing in the underlying bill prevents  direct victims of mortgage fraud from obtaining relief.   The concern of this amendment is that there may be cases of  generalized harm to communities that cannot be addressed by  restitution, but this misses the fundamental point.   The Department of Justice has authority to obtain redress for  victims. Federal law defines victims to be those ``directly and  proximately harmed'' by the defendant's acts.   Once those victims have been compensated, deciding whether additional  moneys, other than for penalties, should be allocated to address  related problems becomes a policy question properly decided by elected  representatives in Congress and not agency bureaucrats or prosecutors.   Indeed, Congress already funds homeowner assistance programs through  the annual appropriations process, balancing it against competing  priorities.    As we have repeated throughout this debate, the spending power is one  of Congress' most effective tools in reining in the executive branch.  This is true, by the way, no matter which party is in the White House.   This amendment would weaken that essential congressional power, and,  for that reason, we urge Members to oppose it on institutional grounds.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just respond by  saying that those compelling policy arguments should be made  appropriately in this Chamber, and it is the elected representatives of  the people in this Chamber who can make those fateful decisions. There  may be good arguments. There may be things that we need to do, but the  point is that we are the persons who have the constitutional authority  to make those decisions, not bureaucrats, not prosecutors.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment undercuts  Congress' power. It is another attempt to do so, and it should be  opposed for that reason.   It would exempt settlements that direct funds to remedy indirect harm  resulting from lead in drinking water. It is a terrible problem. The  amendment is forced to focus on indirect harm because nothing in the  bill prevents remediation of direct harm.   But settlement provisions addressing indirect harm are precisely why  this bill is needed. The bill's guiding principle is that once direct  victims have been compensated, deciding the best use of additional  funds to address related problems--whether that is addressing indirect  harms or otherwise--is, again, a policy question properly decided by  elected representatives in Congress and not agency bureaucrats or  prosecutors.   We have proven the point. Last year, Congress actually acted on this.  Congress appropriated $120 million to address drinking water problems  in Flint, Michigan. If there is further need, Congress can make  additional appropriations. The Department of Justice should not be  permitted to augment those funding decisions entirely outside of the  congressional appropriations and oversight processes because they are  important to protect and preserve.   Again, the spending power is one of Congress' most effective tools in  reining in the executive branch, and we cannot afford to weaken that  essential congressional power.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I urge all Members to oppose this  amendment on institutional grounds, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just respond by  saying that no tragedy, however sad and however large, justifies us  deviating from our Constitution, from the way the Founders set up this  system and the way that this body operates. There is a reason that  these responsibilities were given to us as Members of Congress. Each of  us has the same challenge. When there is a tragedy or a mishap or a  natural disaster or anything that affects our districts, our job is to  come here and convince a sufficient number of our colleagues to support  those appropriations to handle those measures. The system is designed  with safeguards in place. It is designed so that the interests of the  entire Nation can be represented here in this Chamber. For that reason,  this amendment would bypass that. It would bypass the design. It would  bypass article I, and it would create a whole different way of  governing. We simply can't allow that.   Mr. Chair, this is about preserving the original intent of the  Constitution, preserving the power of this body. For that reason, I  oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
