 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate First Baptist Church  of Cookeville on 150 years of spreading the Gospel throughout middle  Tennessee.   I was raised at First Baptist Church and came to know my Lord and  Savior, Jesus Christ, was baptized, and was a member for many years of  First Baptist. My wife, Chelsea, and I were married in this church.  Needless to say, I have received many blessings from this congregation.   The church was organized in 1873 with a congregation of 34 members.  They agreed on a church covenant, which reads, in part: The purpose of  this body is to advance the church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort,  promoting prosperity and spirituality.   They continue to fulfill that commitment 150 years later.   The folks at Cookeville First Baptist embody what it means to have a  servant's heart, whether it be through their many Bible study groups or  missions, like Operation Christmas Child or their Family Life Center.   Today, the church enjoys a membership of more than 1,300 members.  That is the result of 150 years of persistence and faith.   Madam Speaker, I pray they will continue to be a blessing to our  community for the next 150 years.                            ____________________
