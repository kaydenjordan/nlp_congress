 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the United Autoworkers  on strike at John Deere and to express my heartfelt condolences for a  devastating loss.   We woke up to tragic news this morning that a worker in Milan,  Illinois, was crossing the street by the picket line and was struck and  killed.   This is heartbreaking. He was just described to me as a quiet and  kind person, the type of guy who would make you laugh.   My prayers are with his family and with all of the striking UAW  workers today.   These workers have put their lives on the line in more ways than one.  At the height of the pandemic, Deere employees in the district that I  serve were deemed essential, even making thousands of anti-COVID face  shields that Deere donated to help keep others safe. They were working  10- and 12-hour shifts.   John Deere is an iconic, homegrown American company, part of the  fabric of the community where I live. When a business is as successful  as Deere & Company, they need to make sure that their workers are  rewarded for that, they are key to that success. These workers have  earned a fair deal.   I have faith in John Deere, and I stand with our UAW workers.                            ____________________
