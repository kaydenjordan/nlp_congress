 Mr. Speaker, MAGA Republicans continue to use  political stunts to try to distract the American people with  unnecessary legislation.   This week, House Republicans are advancing the Politics Over Parents  Act. This legislation is part of a harmful and nationwide extreme MAGA  Republican crusade toward censorship and book bans.  [[Page H1333]]    It would deprive our students of an accurate and fact-based  education. Extreme Republicans are bringing culture wars into our  classrooms.   I want to be clear, Mr. Speaker. I support a parent's right to be  involved in their child's education. That is why, together with  President Biden, Democrats are delivering the support and resources our  schools need. House Democrats are working together to provide our  American children with the highest quality level of education  everywhere in America. That is what parents want for their children.   Parents want their children to feel safe in their schools. Moms worry  every day, everywhere, about whether or not they are going to get that  text or that call about a shooter at their child's school.   Recently, Mr. Speaker, I spoke at a seniors' event, and afterwards  visited with the seniors for Q&A. This question came up from a  grandmom. She is worried about her grandbaby. When will we do something  about guns? Will her grandbaby be safe?   Sadly, today, the leading cause of death in children is firearms, but  House Republicans have not held a single hearing on gun safety.  Instead, they have found the time to ban and censor books in school  libraries.   House Republicans continue to waste time on political stunts.   House Democrats, on the other hand, are focused on improving public  education and making our schools safer.   Americans want Congress to work together to solve real problems.  House Republicans need to stop wasting time on circus-style hearings  and divisive legislation that, frankly, will go nowhere.   The real problem in our schools isn't books or critical race theory;  it is keeping guns out of schools, addressing teacher shortages, and  keeping students and staff safe.   House Democrats will always continue to put children over guns, books  over bullets because every child deserves to go to school without fear  of losing their life.                            ____________________
