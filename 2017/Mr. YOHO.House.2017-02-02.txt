 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson for standing up and  defending our Nation's Constitution again, not just in his service to  our country during the Vietnam era, but here in Congress and his many  years here.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. As a tireless  advocate for the protection of our Second Amendment rights, I am  disappointed, but not surprised, in the Obama administration's attempt  to impair Americans' right to own firearms, by fiat, in its last days  of existence. It is unconscionable and unthinkable that a President  would do that to the citizens of this country.   This rule claims to strengthen the National Instant Criminal  Background Check but, in reality, acted as a gun grab on individuals  who receive disability insurance benefits or Supplemental Security  Income payments. Participants in those programs should not be forced to  worry that, in order to receive government assistance, they must  sacrifice their constitutional liberty at the random whim of a  government bureaucrat. The Second Amendment to our Constitution states  very clearly that the right to keep and bear arms ``shall not be  infringed,'' and Congress cannot stand by and allow unaccountable  rulemaking from a previous administration to infringe on that right.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
