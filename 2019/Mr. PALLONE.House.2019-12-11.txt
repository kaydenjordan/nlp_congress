 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower  Drug Costs Now Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this week, we will fulfill a promise we made to the  American people to make prescription drugs more affordable. No American  should be forced into choosing between putting food on the table for  their family and taking a lifesaving drug, but, all too often, that is  exactly what is happening.   The American people are getting ripped off because drug companies  have a monopoly on their drugs until generics come to market. They can  charge Americans whatever they want, and they do.   H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, finally  gives the Federal Government the power to negotiate lower prescription  drug prices for the American people. Other developed countries  negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies, and prices in those  countries are four or five or ten times less for the exact same drugs.  This simply isn't fair, and the American people are rightfully fed up.   It is time that we finally level the playing field and empower the  Federal Government to negotiate a better deal. These negotiations will  not only lead to lower prices for consumers, it will also result in  significant savings to the Federal Government. H.R. 3 takes the  resulting $500 billion in savings and reinvests it in the American  healthcare system and the search for new cures.   We cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors in the Medicare Part D program  for the first time, giving seniors the peace of mind of knowing that  their drug cost will not bankrupt them or empty their retirement  accounts.   We make transformational investments in the Medicare program--adding  for the first time benefits for dental, hearing, and vision coverage.  These new benefits are going to make a huge difference in the lives of  our Nation's seniors.   We invest $12 billion in the search for new cures and treatments by  boosting funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Food and  Drug Administration. NIH, as we know, plays a critical role in the  research and development of new drugs, and this investment will ensure  that these cures and treatments become a reality. We also invest in  combatting the opioid crisis, community health centers, and maternal  healthcare. And finally, beyond the negotiation, we are holding  pharmaceutical companies accountable for when they jack up prices,  bringing much-needed transparency to the process.   Mr. Chairman, the status quo is simply unacceptable and  unsustainable. It is time to negotiate a better deal for the American  people. It is time to pass H.R. 3.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), our majority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), who is the chairwoman of our Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a member of our Energy and Commerce Committee.                                time  1845     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McNerney), a member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), a member of our committee.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on each  side.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Veasey), a member of our committee.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, this is a historic piece of legislation before us this  evening. H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, is  the critical action we need to lower prescription drug prices for  Americans across the United States.   Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues this evening continue to  peddle Big Pharma's talking points and say that this bill will stifle  innovation. Even the Trump administration's Health and Human Services  Secretary Alex Azar, who was a drug company executive himself,  acknowledged that drug companies like to claim that ``if one penny  disappears from pharma's profit margins, American innovation will grind  to a halt.''   Frankly, I am appalled by this argument, Madam Chair. It is the  Federal Government and the American taxpayers who are the largest  investors in innovation.   In fact, the National Institutes of Health, which has long enjoyed  bipartisan, bicameral support, is the largest public funder of  biomedical research in the world. For decades, publicly funded research  has laid the foundation for the treatment and cures that patients use  today.   Research shows that many patented prescription drug products were  first discovered through taxpayer-funded NIH research and grants.   According to a report by the National Academy of Sciences, NIH-funded  research contributed to the development of all 210 new drugs approved  by the FDA between 2010 and 2016.   The impact is clear: Americans are living longer, healthier lives;  heart disease, stroke, and diabetes are less deadly; cancer mortality  rates are also, overall, on the decline.   The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, H.R. 3, will  strengthen innovation--I stress, strengthen innovation--by investing  $10 billion of direct funding to continue this momentum. This money is  delivered to the agency over 10 years to provide sustained, predictable  investments to our Nation's brightest researchers at our world-class  universities and medical research centers.   This bill will advance research in cancer, rare diseases,  regenerative medicine, and antibiotic resistance, among others. It also  provides additional funding for phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials.   History shows us that investments like these will pay dividends for  patients.   Madam Chair, I am just so tired of hearing the Republican claim that  H.R. 3 will kill new drug development and innovation. It is just the  same tired fearmongering that the big pharmaceutical companies have  used in an effort to lower their out-of-control drug prices.   We, as Members of Congress, work for the American people, not Big  Pharma. And now is the time for us to act and deliver our promise to  patients who rely on prescription drugs to live long and meaningful  lives by lowering their drug prices.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, the Republicans keep saying that they want to work with  us. We have suggested to them that the only way to reduce prices, that  I know of--and they haven't suggested anything else--is by having some  kind of negotiation.   We are talking about the drugs for which there is a monopoly. These  are  [[Page H10106]]  the brand-name drugs for which there is no competition, no generic  alternative. Every other country, the six that we have mentioned as  part of this bill that we are looking at, because we subsidize them as  the American people get ripped off, Australia, Canada, Japan, United  Kingdom, and France bring prices down considerably by negotiating.   When you have all these Medicare beneficiaries, if you will, you have  a tremendous amount of power, if you will, to negotiate with the drug  companies because they want to sell their drugs to bring the prices  down. If you don't do that, which is what the Republicans refuse to do,  then you have no effective way of bringing prices down. We know that.   Now, this is why, when Medicare part D was established--I was here  how many years ago--the Republicans insisted that they put in this  clause in part D that said that the government can't negotiate prices.   So that is why we have to pass this bill, because right now the  government has no power to do that.   Why not give the government that ability? So far, they refuse to do  it.   So, I know they keep saying they want to work with us on a bipartisan  basis, but they have refused to do any kind of negotiated prices, to  get rid of that clause that says that the Department of Health and  Human Services can negotiate prices.   The American public is getting ripped off. We are subsidizing drugs  that are being sold in this other country. It is not fair. It is not a  fair playing field.   Why should we let the drug companies continue with this monopoly?  That is why we are moving H.R. 3. That is the basis for H.R. 3.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, with H.R. 3 we are one step closer to fulfilling our  promise of making prescription drugs more affordable for the American  people.   Today, here in the United States, drug companies can charge whatever  they want because there is no competition until a generic comes to  market and because the Federal Government has no ability to negotiate  drug prices.   The American people are getting ripped off. The status quo is  unacceptable and unsustainable.   In other countries negotiations occur, and prices in those countries  are substantially lower than here in the United States. For years the  American people have been subsidizing prescription drugs for the rest  of the world, and we are fed up with paying 3, 4, or 10 times as much  for the exact same drug as someone in a similar developed country.   Under H.R. 3, those days are over. We are finally empowering the  Federal Government to negotiate lower prices with the drug  manufacturers.   Now, what we are doing with the savings that come from this bill is  we are providing additional benefits to seniors.   H.R. 3 adds Medicare part B comprehensive dental coverage for the  first time. It adds a new dental benefit to Medicare part D and will  provide coverage for screening and preventive services. It adds a new  vision coverage. H.R. 3 adds new vision benefits that would cover  routine eye exams, contact lens fitting, and glasses or contact lenses  once every 2 years.                                time  1930    It adds a comprehensive hearing benefit. It adds new hearing benefits  that provide hearing aid coverage for individuals with severe, profound  hearing loss.   The list goes on. We are investing more money to go to NIH. We are  providing more money for community health centers. The bottom line is,  we are also trying to save seniors' out-of-pocket costs by capping out- of-pocket costs at $2,000.   We are doing all this at the same time that we are lowering  prescription drug prices through negotiation by the Secretary of Health  and Human Services, or the Federal Government. Understand that once  that price is set for Medicare, that price is also available in the  rest of the market for those with insurance coverage.   This is a win-win situation for the American people. I don't  understand how the Republicans on the other side could say that there  is any other way to lower prescription drug prices, and they, frankly,  haven't given us any suggestion in that respect.   I ask my colleagues, please, this is a transformational piece of  legislation. Please support us. This should be supported on a  bipartisan basis.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
