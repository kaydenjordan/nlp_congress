 Mr. Speaker, after all the excitement over the  Speaker's race last week, it was good to get down to work this week, or  not.   Let's recap. The new Republican majority protected rich donors from  paying their fair share in taxes, naturally, and in the process delayed  working families from getting their tax refunds. Way to go.   Next up, a select committee on the so-called weaponization of the  Federal Government. Nothing like a Joe McCarthy-style committee to  stoke more fear and distrust of the Federal Government only 2 years  after the attack on our Capitol. And then criminalizing women's  healthcare, because, of course, that is why the American people gave  the Republicans the majority.   The red wave the Republicans dreamed about never materialized because  the American people rejected their far-right agenda up and down the  ballot. Clearly, they didn't get the message.   Yet, they did nothing to tackle inflation, the biggest issue for the  American people in the last election.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't what the American people signed up for. It is  going to be a long 2 years if this is all they are going to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 22, the Protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   Let's get one thing straight: The reason we are here today  considering this bill is because Republicans in Congress voted in 2015  to repeal a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil, including to our  foreign adversaries.   Despite this being a problem of their own making, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have seemed more interested in playing  political games with our country's energy security than offering  concrete, effective solutions for the American people.   When Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine and Big Oil's  unchecked corporate greed caused gas prices to spike last year, the  Biden administration took decisive action to lower prices for working  families by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Not only did this move help protect the wallets of my constituents  and Americans all across the country, reports also indicate that our  government returned a nearly $4 billion profit on these sales.   So if my Republican colleagues would like to get serious about  standing up to our adversaries, I would be happy to consider such  proposals. But I cannot support this piecemeal legislation drafted for  the purpose of scoring cheap political points rather than actually  solving the problem of high energy costs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
