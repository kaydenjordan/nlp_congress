 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be with you this  afternoon. I have a series of other speakers who will be joining me  later in the hour from the Progressive Caucus, as we discuss some of  the key events of the week from our perspective.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be with you this  afternoon. I have a series of other speakers who will be joining me  later in the hour from the Progressive Caucus, as we discuss some of  the key events of the week from our perspective.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all the Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Maryland?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I love magic, and I bet a lot of people out  there watching today love magic, too. Ever since I was a kid, I loved  the cup tricks, the card tricks, and the rabbit coming out of the hat.  When I was in college, I even used to entertain at elementary school  birthday parties, helping to pay my way through college.   The key move in magic, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is the sleight of  hand. I looked up the definition of ``sleight of hand'' in the Merriam- Webster Dictionary, which defines it as a cleverly executed deception.   A sleight of hand is also sometimes called a prestidigitation, quick  fingers, or legerete de la main, which is the French phrase for  ``lightness of hand.'' It is defined as the set of closely related  techniques used by a stage magician to manipulate the perceptions of  the audience.   Sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, careful stage  misdirection, constant blabbering, and strategic confusion to distract  the audience.   Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States has been masterfully  deploying sleight of hand ever since his inauguration. With his nonstop  tweeting and his incessant mad antics, the President distracts us from  the real action, which is what is happening here in Congress. We are  witnessing a magic trick on the world's largest stage, the auditorium  of American democracy. And we, the people, are the captive, bedazzled,  and totally distracted audience of the President. The tweets are a  massive sleight of hand distracting us from the serious destruction of  public policy and law that is taking place right here in Congress.  [[Page H1290]]                                     time  1700    I want to say, at the outset, I prefer to think of this as a magic  trick because the alternative that the President simply can't control  himself is almost too horrific to contemplate.   The Constitution does have a way of dealing with that problem, too,  and you can find it in the 25th Amendment.   Today, we are going to assume that all of this is a magic show. I  used to coach kids' soccer. And when I coached soccer, I would always  tell the kids: Don't bunch. Keep your eye on the ball. Stay in your  lane and pass the ball.   Without fail, the youngest kids who are just starting out, they all  chase the ball. They move around the field in a big clump, a big mob.  And I would say: Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Go to  where the ball is going to be going.   When they are young, they don't know how to do it.   I think that advice applies here as well to America, to the body  politic. Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Let's not be  distracted full time by all the tomfoolery and tweetfoolery.   There are important and dangerous things happening right here in  Congress right now. While the President is tweeting insults and fake  news and inflating his slender college victory and the size of his  inaugural crowd and making fun of Meryl Streep and chatting about  Nordstrom's department store and talking about how he is going to make  Mexico pay for his wall and so on, what is taking place in Congress is  the systematic dismantling of the regulatory apparatus that the  American public depends on for clean air, clean water, safe food, a  decent environment, and control of criminality in the country.   The fundamental political action that we must be paying attention to  now is the dismantling of the regulatory apparatus of the Federal  Government, which is happening every day right here in the Halls of  Congress. This is the apparatus that protects our food, our air, our  water, our health care, our financial system, the ability of people to  invest safely on Wall Street, occupational safety and health for our  workers. All of this is being attacked in terrifying and often  invisible ways.   Behind the scenes, while the wizard of odd convenes a dinner in Mar- a-Lago where he entertains a national security crisis discussion in  full view of other diners who begin to tweet out and Facebook out what  they are seeing happen, while all of that is happening, Congress is  rolling back environmental protections to protect streams, rivers, and  drinking water from pollution. They are savaging the rules that  restrict the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that are leaked into  the atmosphere, destabilizing our climate system. Check out H.J. Res.  38 and 36.   While the distractor in chief whines about leaks, while his whole  campaign was based on leaks of emails that were captured by Russian  agents working to get him elected, in Congress, they are rolling back  financial regulations which ensure that workers have retirement savings  options, H.J. Res. 66, and which protect consumers from excessive  financial risks, H.R. 78.   They have also targeted and rolled back labor regulations that  promote safe and healthy workplaces and fair employment practices, H.J.  Res. 37.   Amazingly, while President Trump's National Security Adviser, General  Flynn, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had been  colluding with Russians to lift the sanctions that the Obama  administration had imposed on Russia, here in Congress, we are passing  joint resolutions to rescind anticorruption regulations that required  oil and gas companies to report monetary payments that they made to  foreign governments, H.J. Res. 41.   So Trump tweets about leaks, while his administration is one vast  leak to the Russians. And here, Members of the GOP are working to throw  an invisibility and secrecy cloak over corporate payments being made to  foreign governments and corporations.   While the world is distracted by all of the sleight of hand, this  Congress is passing bills to give government back to giant corporations  and special interests that care not for the common good but simply for  their own bottom line.   Mr. Speaker, as a freshman, I have been here for only 8 weeks. I have  to tell you that I am disappointed that I have not voted on a single  bill in the House Judiciary Committee that has had so much as a  hearing. Yes, I want to repeat that. We have voted on five bills since  I got here and not one of them has had a hearing.   Now, I come from the Maryland State Senate where I proudly served for  10 years as a State senator. When we had a bill coming up, no bill  could be brought to the floor without a hearing first, and anybody who  wanted to come testify on the bill could come testify on it. Now, that  is not practicable here in the U.S. Congress. However, we could at  least have experts relating to the bill and people who are affected by  the bill come in and testify, but we haven't done that in the House  Judiciary Committee. Instead, we voted on a series of bills which, to  my mind, dramatically curtail the public interest.   Yesterday, we voted on a bill to dismantle, essentially to put into a  stifling straightjacket, the class-action mechanism that has been used  over the decades to vindicate the interest of people who are victims of  sex discrimination, victims of race discrimination, victims of toxic  torts, victims of asbestos poisoning. We voted basically to trash class  action yesterday without even so much as a bill.   Now, on some of the other bills, it was said to me: Well, there were  hearings in prior Congresses. One Member said: We had a hearing on that  back in 2012.   This is 2017, 5 years later. But on this particular bill that I am  talking about, nobody even heard the bill. There was no hearing on it.  It was simply brought up for a vote. That is irresponsible legislation.  That is not real democracy when you don't even have a hearing and  people who are affected by the legislation don't have the opportunity  to come and talk about it.   Now, they are not having hearings because they think--and they are  probably right--we're not paying attention. What are we paying  attention to? We are paying attention to the magician. We are paying  attention to the wizard of odd. We are paying attention to the tweets  instead.    The good news is that the audience is starting to wise up. The whole  country is waking up to the profound dangers of the administration's  financial and political entanglements with Russia, with the Russian  corporate and governmental elite.   Just this week, the National Security Adviser, Mr. Flynn, resigned  after reports came out about his communications with the Russian  Ambassador while President Obama was still in office, communications  dealing with the lifting of sanctions on Russia, communications that  General Flynn lied about and was forced from office because of it. He  misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his  conversations with the diplomat, which was being monitored and recorded  by the intelligence community.   Now, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, let's  think about this for a moment. As a former chief of the Defense  Intelligence Agency, Mr. Flynn was no innocent about the world of spy  versus spy. He must have known that his telephone call with the Russian  Ambassador was being monitored and recorded. If he really wanted to go  rogue and operate on his own without the permission and the license of  President Trump, he never would have allowed that telephone  conversation to be recorded. But he did allow it to be recorded. He  made the call with presumable full knowledge that other people in the  intelligence community would be listening in on it, which leads me to  the inescapable, logical conclusion that Flynn knew that, in making  that call, he enjoyed the full support of the one person above him who  could remove him from his job, the President of the United States.   Now, do I know that? No, I don't know it. I surmise it. How are we  going to know whether or not this is true? How do we get to the bottom  of the Russian connection in the campaign? How do we get to the bottom  of the Russian connection in the Trump administration?   We need to have a full, complete, independent investigation by  experts, like the 9/11 Commission, which gets to the bottom of this  profound danger, this dagger pointed at the throat of American  democracy.  [[Page H1291]]    Mr. Speaker, everybody loves magic, I think. Everybody loves the  enchantment of being fooled, of being distracted, of being diverted.  That is why people go to magic shows. It is diverting. It is amusing.  It is fun.   Everybody loves a great magician, too. None was greater in our  history than the great Houdini, who dazzled the world with his  extraordinary optical illusions and effects, his amazing ability to  simulate telepathy and telekinesis.   Houdini also had a very strong ethical and professional code about  being a magician. He never revealed a trick. More importantly, he never  tried to fool people in order to defraud them. He never tried to fool  people in order to humiliate them. He never tried to fool people in  order to take away their rights. He never tried to fool people in order  to demoralize and crush them or to strip them of their freedom. He  never tried to fool people in order to victimize them.   Indeed, in the 1920s, Mr. Houdini channeled all of his magnificent  energy away from doing his magic shows and instead put it into the  separate but related task of exposing psychics, mediums, con men,  charlatans, and practitioners of the occult and the dark arts who did  take advantage of people's good will, who did take advantage of  people's impressionability to defraud them, to take their money, their  belongings, and to distract them from the real world, and to undermine  the moral and ethical principles that should govern human behavior and  must govern social life.   Although Houdini is no longer with us, he has great heirs today in  socially responsible magicians like the Amazing Randi and Penn &  Teller.   Already millions of Americans themselves--millions of us in the  audience--have woken up to the fact that we have been pulled into an  irrational and dangerous fantasy world, an echo chamber of malignant  narcissism, cruelty, and paranoia.   It is time for all of us to stop being distracted, to stop being  bedazzled, and pay attention to the real game, which is, one, trying to  get America to join with Vladimir Putin, a dictator and an autocrat who  said that the single greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the  dissolution of the Soviet Union, in order to create an international  league of dictators, demagogues, and despots to violate human rights  and crush liberal democracy; and, two, to dismantle at home the public  regulatory infrastructure which protects our land, our air, our water,  our climate, our liberties, our freedoms, our equal rights, and our  capacity to function as the greatest democracy on Earth and to function  as an efficient and effective government meeting the needs of the  people.   The magicians out there--there aren't many--but you have a special  obligation to help us blow the whistle, and you are doing it. But it is  really the American people--it is all of us who must stand up.   The Constitution talks about three branches of government. Article I  is Congress. Article II is the executive. Article III is the judiciary.  Let's call Congress the first branch.   But when you think about it, what is even more important than the  Congress is the trunk, the roots of democracy. Everything grows up from  the people. The branches are out there, but Congress works for the  people. The President works for Congress and the people. The Supreme  Court and the judiciary work for the people.   It is time for the people to dissolve the spells that have been cast  over the country, to say this is a democracy. We operate by the  Constitution and the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), my good friend, the Assistant Democratic Leader.           Honoring Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), my good friend, the Assistant Democratic Leader.           Honoring Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College     Mr. Speaker, we should be joined momentarily by  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. I want to close out, though, my own  thoughts by responding to something I have been hearing over the last  week here in the Halls of Congress.   Now that it is clear from our intelligence agencies, 16 of them,  including the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the  National Security Agency, and so on, that Vladimir Putin had a  deliberate campaign of espionage, cyber sabotage, propaganda, and fake  news to undermine American democracy in the 2016 election, and now that  it is clear that there were high-level contacts between Trump  associates and officials of the Russian Government, it is no longer  being denied by anybody on either side of the aisle. What I have  started to hear is, well, sure, they tried to hack our election, and,  sure, they leaked thousands of emails, and, sure, they changed the  dynamics of the campaign and what people were talking about in the  campaign, but there is no proof that they stuffed any ballot boxes or  they hacked into the computers. And that is true; we don't know that  they stuffed any ballot boxes or hacked into computers, and we will  have to see if anything comes out about that when we finally get to do  a real comprehensive investigation. But, Mr. Speaker, the reality is  that we should be terrified and appalled and outraged that they were  allowed to go as far as they did.   How many people in this body would accept a foreign entity coming  into our congressional districts and spending millions or hundreds of  thousands of dollars against us, hacking into our computers, releasing  our emails, and completely changing the dynamics of the campaign?   So when I hear from colleagues that, well, yes, they distorted the  campaign, they hacked into the campaign, but they didn't steal the  election, I think that they are making a distinction with no difference  at all. If you derail the campaign, you kidnap the campaign, you hijack  the campaign, you have altered the outcome of the election, especially  one in which your opponent gets 2.9 million votes more than you did,  especially in an election where you were able to torture out only the  slenderest of electoral college victories in three States by 70,000  votes.                                time  1730    So I simply reject the constant claim that I am hearing from  colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that we don't need to worry about Russian  subversion of the 2016 election because it only affected the campaign;  it didn't necessarily affect the election outcome. To influence the  campaign is to influence the election outcome.   Mr. Speaker, I am seeing Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is not  here, so I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
