 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on  this issue and for putting this hour together.   Mr. Speaker, I have reviewed the secret memo in a secure setting.  After having reviewed the contents of the classified memo relating to  FISA abuses, I support its full release to the public. Americans  deserve the truth, and Congress should always strive for transparency.   I am stunned at the previous administration's underhanded  surveillance methods and misuse of power at the highest levels of the  FBI and Department of Justice. This should never have been permitted to  happen.   Moreover, all Federal agencies, including the FBI, should be held to  a high standard and always be held accountable for their actions. The  issues that the memo raises must be brought to light and dealt with  responsibly.   I am pleased that the House Intelligence Committee voted tonight to  release the memo, but our work does not end there. We must continually  strive for integrity and openness within all levels of government.
