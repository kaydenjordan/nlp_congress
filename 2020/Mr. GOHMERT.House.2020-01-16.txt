 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Gallagher).                    Protecting Our Waters and Communities     Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to be here in the  House of Representatives and have an opportunity to speak, as so many  places around the world don't have those privileges, those rights.   Sometimes people ask, well, if the rights are truly endowed by our  creator, then why don't people have them all over the world?   And it is an endowment, these rights, like an inheritance; but the  only way you get to keep any inheritance is if you are willing to fight  for it, because, if you are not, in this world, evil people will always  be trying to take what you have and take it for themselves.   So we have been blessed to be in a country where we had men and women  willing to stand up and fight for us.   My 4 years in the Army, we were never in combat. I still think we  should have gone, in 1979, to Iran; and if we had addressed the attack  on our American property, which was the U.S. Embassy, then the  Ayatollah would have been gone, and there would be tens of thousands of  Americans still alive today. It is just very unfortunate.   But at least Soleimani is no longer around to kill Americans and to  dream up new devices, whether improvised or exploding devices to kill  and maim Americans.   It is one of the great ironies that the lead terrorist in the world,  Soleimani, who ordered, directed, got the best architects to design  instruments to inflict casualties on Americans--and there were more  Americans killed or wounded on that road in from the airport in Iraq.   Some may remember, back in the early days of the war in Iraq, that  the most dangerous place we kept hearing was on that road in from the  airport. There were so many IEDs and explosive devices that killed,  maimed our American military, and they were set to kill and maim  American military. That was after Soleimani had taken over the IRGC and  he had his special troops.   But he was a terrorist. He had been allowed to keep finding ways to  kill Americans for far too long, and the world is a better place  without him.   It was amazing that people on both sides of the aisle could agree on  that when President Obama ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden, and  yet so many of those same people with whom we agreed thought it was  atrocious that President Trump would order the taking out of the lead  terrorist killing hundreds of Americans. It is just a strange thing.   Some call it Trump Derangement Syndrome. They just have so much  hatred for our current President that it doesn't matter that it is in  direct conflict with what they have said before.   For example, our chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the minority  leader in the Senate had some pretty strong quotes back when President  Clinton was impeached, and now they both say 180-degree opposite  things, completely contradicting themselves about what impeachment  should be and not be.   So it is clear, though, from the Constitution--this is the last  sentence of Article II. It says: ``The President, Vice President and  all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office  on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason''--that is a crime-- ``bribery''--that is a crime--``or other high crimes''--those are  crimes--``and misdemeanors''--and those are crimes.   So it is very clear, if you are going to impeach and then convict and  remove a President from office, there need to have been crimes. In  every one of the prior impeachments--there have only been a few--the  allegations involved crimes.   Perjury, as President Clinton was guilty of, is a crime. He was not  prosecuted. There still seemed to be a permanent feeling that you  couldn't convict a sitting President of a crime. But he paid a very  heavy price, being disbarred for perjury and other costs that he had to  pay.   But, unfortunately, we now live in a time where right and wrong are  supposed to be so relative. It all depends. The ends justify the means.  That is the way you lose a great civilization. That is the way you lose  moral authority, when right and wrong all become relative.   In fact, John Adams, as President, in 1797, our second President,  made very clear when he said this Constitution is meant for a moral and  religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any  other.   If we are going to continue to allow schools to teach relativity of  right and wrong and that ends justify the means, you can be mean and  evil and hateful so long as your hate and evil conduct is aimed at  somebody that you call hateful.   So we have developed quite a quandary here in the United States where  so many people--and I know some have said: Oh, I don't hate anybody.  But President Trump obviously drives them crazy and spurs them to do  and say things they wouldn't normally do and say, and they certainly  didn't with President Clinton when he was caught actually lying under  oath.   So we have got to get back to teaching right and wrong. There is a  right; there is a wrong.   And I know some people say: Well, I am a Christian and, therefore, I  know God is love, and, therefore, I love everybody, and that is just  the way God is.   But I would direct attention to Psalm 6, beginning with verse 16. It  points out that there are actually some things that God hates, and one  is a lying tongue; one is a heart that devises wicked schemes; one is a  person who stirs up conflict in the community. And, frankly, we had  that among some people who conspired to eliminate a sitting President.   Actually, they started out conspiring to use taxpayer funds to use  the FBI, intelligence community, even some defense funds, State  Department personnel and funds, to prevent Donald Trump from being  elected. And then after he was elected, those guns were turned on him  to try to eliminate him from office.    Obviously, in the current impeachment, there is no treason; there is  no bribery; there is no high crime; there is no misdemeanor. So those  pushing these Articles of Impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction  of Congress, actually ended up being guilty of both of those  allegations.   But they are not crimes; they are not high crimes; they are not  misdemeanors; they are not bribery. But they are guilty of those  themselves.   If you go back, as I am thrilled that so many of my friends across  the aisle are doing now, quoting our Founders, they made clear in those  early debates that you could not, you should not, could not be able to  remove a President or someone because you don't like the way they are  doing things or maladministration; or you think they are not doing  something quickly enough and so you would say they are obstructing  Congress; or you don't like the way they did something so you would  say: Oh, they are abusing their power--even though the Obama  administration did the very same things, just much worse.   I thought it was worse when I met with a big group of weeping  Nigerian mothers whose children were kidnapped and chained to beds,  normally raped multiple times a day, from what we were told. I asked  the pastor who was trying to assist so many of these Nigerian women:  Where are the fathers?   He said: That is part of the tragedy. The fathers know that their  little girls are chained to beds and being raped  [[Page H320]]  every day, and they don't feel like they should stay in a bed when they  were not able to protect their daughters.   And I have got to give it to the Obama administration. They did hold  up a sign and say #bringbackourgirls. But from what Nigerians in  government there were telling me, they were told: If you really want us  to take out Boko Haram for you, we have got the power; we have got the  money; we have got the military might; but you are going to have to  change your laws to allow abortion and to allow same-sex marriage. And  if you are not going to do that, we are not going to help you like we  could with Boko Haram.   I saw a quote from a Catholic bishop in Nigeria who was basically  saying: Our religious beliefs are not for sale, not to President Obama,  to John Kerry, to America. They are not for sale.   So some of us were concerned that we could have helped stop some of  the biggest atrocities going on in the world by radical Islam, but  money was withheld. Help was withheld in order to achieve a political  agenda regarding same-sex marriage and abortion, according to people I  met with there in Nigeria, and seemed to be bolstered by articles that  have been read back at that time.   We also know that this Congress has repeatedly, since I have been  here, made clear we don't want to be giving away money to countries  that are going to use it for improper purposes.   Now, of course, that changed a great deal during the Obama  administration. We are willing to give $150 billion to people that we  knew there is a decent chance they were going to be using it to kill  Americans and to terrorize the world, maybe use it, some of it, to  pursue nuclear weapons. We have been hearing that some of it was used  by Soleimani to help coordinate attacks against Americans around the  Middle East because they want Americans out of the Middle East.   But I have had a bill in most of the Congresses in which I have been  a Member called the United Nations Voting Accountability Act, and it  put requirements on our money.                                time  1145    I almost got it passed as an amendment early on. It just simply  basically says any nation that votes against the United States'  position in the U.N. more than half of the time shall receive no  assistance of any kind from the United States in the subsequent year.  It seems like in March, somewhere around there, we get the voting  results from the prior year from the U.N. and you can go through and  see what percentage of the time each country voted with us and when  they voted against us.   I think it would be a great requirement to put on our financial aid,  and as I have said repeatedly since I have been here in Congress, you  don't have to pay people to hate you, they will do it for free. You  don't have to pay them to hate you, they are perfectly happy to hate  you for free.   And as I found from being very small in elementary school, you don't  win the respect of a bully by giving them your lunch money or giving  them whatever they demand. You have to make them pay a price. Even if  you don't win the war, if you hurt them--of course, they hurt you  worse--they decide they will pick on somebody else because they don't  want to get hurt themselves, and they know you will fight back.   It is nice here in the United States, we are big and strong enough we  can take it to bullies, terrorists like Soleimani, and I thank God that  he is gone and there will be Americans living as a result of him being  gone.   So Trump derangement syndrome has caused the House majority to push  through two Articles of Impeachment. We heard for 3 years all of this  Russia collusion. As most of us know who have had legal training,  collusion is not normally a crime, unless it is with regard to stocks.  Normally the term is used as conspiracy, a criminal conspiracy.  Somebody came up with a brilliant idea of using the word ``collusion,''  and let's accuse Donald Trump of doing exactly what we have done.   Why else would the President of the United States say to the  President of Russia, Tell Vladimir I will have a lot more flexibility  after the next election? So they could give in a lot more than he even  had in the past.   It is called projecting. You engage in improper conduct and then  accuse your opponent of engaging in what you did. That is exactly what  we have seen here, projecting.   So you have somebody that gets paid off by corrupt entities in  Ukraine, and they turn around--and when the President of the United  States does his job and basically says to Ukraine--when they elect a  president who got elected on the basis that he was going to end  corruption--if you have got evidence of corruption, we sure would like  to see it if it involves American people. You know, please, we would  like to see what you got if it involves Americans. There is nothing  wrong with that. It is perfectly legal.   If you listen to the contention of some people we have heard in  Washington, the contention basically is: You may have committed a crime  or engaged in corrupt activity, if you will just run for President then  we will defend you, saying, you can't go after that person, he is  running for President. You are trying to use your office for political  purposes. That way somebody that engages in corruption and keeps  running for President can never be prosecuted because we will defend  you because you shouldn't be prosecuted, you are running for President.  So we can say your position is being used for political purposes, where  actually if somebody is engaged in corruption it ought to be  investigated.   Look what has happened as a result of this Ukraine hoax; it scared a  lot of people to death, including people that have worked with Ukraine  in our National Security Council who were aware of some of the money  passing back and forth with Americans. And what do they do: Oh, my  gosh, what are we going to do? We are going the get caught up in this  investigation. Oh, I know, we will claim that when the President asked  for evidence of corruption by Americans that that is some kind of quid  pro quo. And even though it is perfectly consistent with the President  keeping his oath, we will allow that to just be hammered over and over  again, so maybe we can convince the Ukrainian President if he provides  the evidence of corruption by Americans then that means the President  is guilty of some crime.   They have actually been very successful in backing President Zelensky  and Ukraine off of investigating crimes of corruption by American  individuals.   That is a real victory. No matter what happens on impeachment in the  Senate, it is a real victory for those who were engaged, participated  in potential corruption with Ukraine, because they have been able to  turn the tables, accuse President Trump, and then back the Ukrainian  President off from investigating their corruption, and all of the focus  is on President Trump instead of on those who may be guilty of high  crimes, including bribery. It has been interesting to see the way that  has politically played out.   We are told constantly, there is breaking news, the President should  not have sat on that money to Ukraine. There was nothing illegal about  holding up the money. And if I were President, I would be holding up  any money that was going to any country that engaged in or where there  was rampant corruption, as we knew had gone on in Ukraine, and require  them to produce evidence that they were actually trying to stop  corruption. Since the corruption seemed to involve American  individuals, we have now stopped that investigation by Ukraine into the  corruption by Americans, and that means that Ukraine is not going to be  rid of corruption because they haven't been able to adequately pursue  it. There is no breaking news. There is nothing new if people reporting  it were fair.   Again, one good thing from my standpoint about the Trump derangement  syndrome, we knew there were lots of bad actors among deep staters in  the State Department, in the Intel community, in the FBI at the top, at  the DOJ, some of the top people, but it was hard to identify them.  Well, because of the hatred for Donald Trump that is just in- articulable, it is so deranging to those that have this level of  despising the President they keep raising their heads, so we know who  the people are that are willing to abuse their office and violate their  oath to the Constitution and loyalty to our own government.    I didn't hear the first part of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman--I have  got  [[Page H321]]  family members that are lieutenant colonels, I have known so many  serving in the military, in the Army, but he is the only one that I  ever heard get high, righteous, and mighty and demand to be called  lieutenant colonel, even though most days he doesn't wear a uniform.  But he certainly wore one so people that don't normally respect the  military, as well as some of us that do, they would go on and on about  him being a part of the military.   I asked my staff to get me the transcript of his testimony, and I got  it before he had finished, and I am reading through and I am going, My  word, Vindman has been violating his oath to his own Constitution. And  he certainly is not being loyal to the President when the President is  not committing a crime. He is clearly being more loyal to Ukraine.   Then you find out later, well, actually, he was admonished because a  superior officer heard him bad-mouthing the United States to some  Russians. But that is why it came as no surprise to me. I was thinking  he is more loyal to Ukraine than he is to the United States. It was no  big surprise when I found out that Vindman was offered the position in  Ukraine of defense minister three times, because clearly he had shown  the Ukrainian leaders that he was more loyal to them than he was to his  own U.S. leaders. That might be a good move for him at some point since  he appears to have more loyalty to Ukraine. He may want to take them up  on that at some point. Obviously, he would want to wait until after the  impeachment trial is over.   I know there are some that want to have live witnesses in the Senate  Chamber, just make it a full-blown circus. We should have had live  witnesses in the House. That is what they did during the Clinton  impeachment. You had fact witnesses that testified before the Judiciary  Committee, however, we had a bunch of opinions coming in.   We didn't get the real fact witnesses. And of course, the real fact  witnesses, in my mind, would include Alexandra Chalupa, the actions and  antics she was involved in, along with Eric Ciaramella, Abigail Grace,  and Sean Misko; they had both worked at the National Security Council.  They have a lot of information about work with Ukraine, real facts, not  just made up stuff, but real facts. They would have been important to  get under oath. I still think they would be.   Andrew McCarthy, just a superb former prosecutor, had an article  yesterday or today talking about the Senate should just say we are not  taking up impeachment until you finish. You want us to do the  investigation that you didn't do in the House because you were in such  a hurry to get it to the Senate. We are not going to do your  investigation, you don't have a high crime, you don't have a  misdemeanor, you don't have treason, you don't have bribery. So why  don't you go back, and if you come up with a high crime, misdemeanor,  bribery, or treason then come see us once you have actually got  evidence of something like that.   Unfortunately, the House passed impeachment even though it didn't  rise to the level of impeachable offenses. It is an allegation of  maladministration, which the Founders said should never be a basis for  impeachment, and that is why they didn't include those types of things  as a basis for impeachment. That is what they have alleged, and that is  what is now down at the Senate straight down the hall. The Senate is  going to take them up. I agree with my friend, Andy McCarthy. The  Senate should not do the House's job.   The House had thousands of pages of transcripts. I sure wish they  would release the Inspector General's deposition, but of course, that  is why they did it down in the SCIF. None of the information we were  told was classified. The witnesses were told if you have any answer  that may involve classified information, just don't answer, which is  also a cue, don't answer any questions Republicans ask that you don't  want to answer. And that was the reason that so often Republican  questions were interrupted with instructions to the witness by the  chairman of Intel. That is why Intel did it. They wanted to have them  in secret even though they weren't classified, have them in a place  where most of us could not be there, including people like those of us  on the Judiciary Committee, the true committee of jurisdiction.                                time  1200    Then they could leak out what they thought might be helpful, even if  they were leaks that were not accurate about what was actually  testified to, and certainly out of context, to try to build this  feeling that the President had done something terrible.   Again, this has been going on for 3 years, the investigation. We have  been told since the day after President Trump was elected that they  were going to impeach him. They didn't know what for, but they were  going to find something.   As Senator Schumer said back I believe it was in 1998 or 1999, during  the Clinton impeachment, he pointed out that the Clinton impeachment-- even though, as I say, it involved an actual crime of perjury, the  Clinton impeachment lowered the bar. He said now it will be too easy to  go after a President and impeach him for a minor crime like perjury.   Well, he had no idea how low the bar would be made by the Democrats.  Now, it really is dangerous because they have shown you don't have to  have a crime. All you have to have is a majority in the House and you  can help destroy at least 3-plus years of a President's term by keeping  them under a cloud the whole time.   I didn't initially support Donald Trump as a candidate, but I really  think people believed if we can just go after his family, go after him,  go after business and friends, 6 months in, he will resign. He will  say: ``I am going back to making money. You can forget this. I don't  need this,'' and walk away, but they just didn't know President Trump.  He was not going to walk away. He could see this country was in big  trouble.   As Newt Gingrich has said, if Hillary Clinton had been elected, we  would never have known the extent of the corruption in these  departments.   Now we find out even in Defense, as Adam Lovinger found, they were  paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, I think over a million  dollars, to a guy named Stefan Halper. It didn't look like there was  anything they were getting back, and that was his job. Ultimately, they  don't question Halper's involvement with the Defense Department, making  all this money, getting rich helping the Defense Department as a  professor over in London.   Little did Adam Lovinger know that he was doing work for a number of  departments by trying to set up Carter Page, setting up Papadopoulos,  and just helping out trying to bring down a candidate and then bring  down a President.   Even the Defense Department got into this effort to prevent the  election and then to remove a sitting President. Historically, that is  called a coup d'etat. Sometimes, it is without violence.   In this case, of course, we found out there was violence at Trump  events, and they blamed Trump for that. Then we find out, in a secret  recording, a Democratic operative said: Yeah, we are the ones that hire  people to go in and start fights so that we can accuse Trump supporters  of being violent.   That is also a tactic of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is what they have  done in Egypt. They had the largest peaceful uprising in the history of  the world protesting against a Muslim Brother, Morsi, who was shredding  their Constitution. They arose, demanded he be removed. The Muslim  Brotherhood went out, started violence, burned down some churches and  synagogues. Then CNN and others faithfully reported that it was the  protestors and not the Muslim Brotherhood that did that.   But it was amazing what the people of Egypt did in their peaceful  protests against a man shredding the Constitution, much as our  Department of Justice and FBI top people have done over the last 4  years.   Some have said they only began to investigate the Trump campaign in  July 2016, but we know it was months before that.   It looks like they were probably investigating different campaigns,  trying to figure out ways, if that person won the Republican  nomination, then they would come after them as well. I don't have any  doubt that would have happened.   As former Speaker Gingrich has said, we wouldn't have had any idea  just how  [[Page H322]]  corrupt the intel and these other folks had become.   If you want a real fact witness, it ought to be Brennan and Clapper.  Of course, we saw how comfortable they have been lying under oath when  testifying before Congress. It would be nice if they were held  accountable.   It would be nice if Koskinen had been held accountable, if Loretta  Lynch had been held accountable, because right now, after all these  abuses during the Obama years, people got very arrogant about their  abuses of their positions, and nobody has been made to pay. That needs  to happen.   But we don't need to have people who are comfortable lying under oath  come down to testify at a big circus in the Senate Chamber. They should  adopt exactly what they did under the Clinton rules.   If they have witnesses, depose them, use the testimony from the  depositions. Senators from both parties can submit questions to be  asked, but they ought to follow exactly the rules exactly the way they  did during the Clinton impeachment. They shouldn't be taking new  witnesses.   Like Andy McCarthy says, the Senate should not be asked to do the job  that the House should have done but did not. He is exactly right about  that.   I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, and I hope, the Senate will hold to  those rules. They were rules that were demanded and agreed to under the  Clinton impeachment during the Clinton administration. They seemed to  have been fair rules back then. They ought to enforce them exactly the  same way: no live witnesses in the Chamber. That is not the place to  have an investigation.   There is no high crime; there is no misdemeanor. None of those were  charged.   We heard about bribery. We heard about Russia, Russia, Russia. We  know that the real crimes regarding Russia were committed by  Christopher Steele; potentially the DNC; and the Clinton campaign,  which paid Fusion GPS, which paid Christopher Steele, who worked  possibly with--he said, yeah, it is possible that maybe they worked for  Putin, the people he got his information from. Maybe they were involved  with Ukraine. We are not sure.    Obviously, the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC paid foreign  individuals to interfere in our election.   It amazes me that even some smart reporters have said all this  Ukraine stuff has been disproven. No, it hasn't. They act as if Russia  and Ukraine activity--that you couldn't have misconduct in Russia and  also have misconduct in Ukraine. Absolutely you could. In fact, we know  that countries around the world, including China, have been trying to  affect our elections.   For those who have been students of Russia and their current highest  leader, Putin, Putin didn't care so much who got elected in that  election. We have heard testimony that they provided things to help  Hillary Clinton as well. That doesn't come out in the media a whole lot  because it is not consistent with what the alt-left media would have  you believe.   But they did things to help Hillary Clinton, and they did things to  help Donald Trump. They were not as much interested in who got elected  as they were about dividing America, and they have been extremely  successful with that.   America is divided. It is terribly divided. People get mad at each  other in this Chamber and in committees. It is so frustrating. I hope  it doesn't get as bad in the Senate as it has here.   But Putin succeeded. And they didn't have to spend hardly any money,  not much money, to divide America.   They have tried for so long, yet here, with some unknowing allies,  they have been able to divide America like hadn't happened in the last  150 years. It is tragic.   I am hopeful that Senators will understand that the accounts they  have seen in the media are rarely factual, that they are going to have  to do a little bit of digging, that they are not going to be able to  take summaries at face value, and that they need to do some real  digging, do some real homework to find out exactly what the facts are.  They will be amazed.   I am hoping that people who will be deposed will include Alexandra  Chalupa, Eric Ciaramella, Abigail Grace, and Sean Misko. I have said  that for months.   Some report stories and say: ``Oh, Gohmert named the whistleblower.''  No, I didn't. I named four fact witnesses. Apparently, all these media  folks must know who the whistleblower is to say that I named him.   I have never named a whistleblower. We were told earlier on  apparently it was a male, but I haven't named the whistleblower ever. I  have named people I think are fact witnesses and that I think would be  very good to have in depositions in the Senate. I hope they will be  called.   I don't think they need Vindman again. They certainly don't need law  professors who are so inconsistent and just have a law professor act  like he is really reluctant to talk about impeachment, have people talk  about how serious and how reluctant they are, when, actually, like in  the case of the Harvard professor, he has been talking about it since  right after the election. He has been trying to come up with ways to  impeach President Trump. These were not honest witnesses.   Then you have people like Turley, Professors Turley and Dershowitz,  who were actually trying to be fair and who have been extremely  consistent. I have had profound disagreements with both of those  professors on some issues, but I have always found them to be honest.   Some people are shocked that I have liberal friends who are  Democrats. When people are honest, you understand where they are coming  from. When they haven't lied to you, you can work together. That can  happen, and it does happen here.   I hope that this impeachment stuff ends so that we can get back to  helping the President help America, as he has been doing for 3 years.  He has done an extraordinary job. Until the impeachment is over,  apparently, that is not going to happen.   For those who believe in the power of prayer, we need to be asking  God for mercy. I would implore people who believe in the power of  prayer in the United States: Do not pray for justice because we don't  want God's justice to come down on America or we are over.                                time  1215    We need mercy. We need grace. We need direction, and we need to come  back to the place where we recognize there is an absolute right or  wrong. It comes from a universal source, as C. S. Lewis talked about,  where he came from being an atheist to becoming, ultimately, a  Christian.   But the realization started that he could never know that there was a  fair and unfair, a right and wrong, a just or unjust, unless there was  some ubiquitous universal standard of right and wrong. Otherwise, he  would be like a man born blind. If you have never seen the light, how  can you know that there is light and dark? You have never seen it. You  have never experienced it.   So there has to be something placed in our hearts that gives us an  idea of right and wrong, truth and untruth. And just because, as he  said, some people come closer to hitting it right, doesn't mean there  is no absolute right and wrong, just or unjust.   We need to get back to the point where truth matters, justice  matters. And when we have officials, as we still do--we still have some  in our Justice Department, in our intelligence department or agencies,  in the FBI--and we do need a new FBI Director, he is part of the  problem--but until we get back to having people in the Justice  Department, in intel, who are honest, honorable, just, upright people,  then we will continue our slide toward the dustbin of history.   No Nation lasts forever. The United States won't. But my prayer is  that we will come together and do the things that will allow this  country to succeed as a Republic with people having freedom for at  least 50 more years. Is that too much to ask?   I know people are worried about climate change. We won't make another  dozen years where we are right now unless we have some massive reform  within our government. We need to come together to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
