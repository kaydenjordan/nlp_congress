 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding citizen from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who will be  recognized for excellence in his field next month.   Jayson Stark of Newtown was announced as the winner of the Baseball  Writers' Association of America's J.G. Taylor Spink Award for his work  as a baseball sports writer.   In July, Jayson will travel to Cooperstown, New York, for  ``meritorious contributions to baseball writing'' during the National  Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's induction weekend.   A native of Philadelphia and a graduate of Syracuse University,  Jayson began his career with the Providence Journal before joining the  Philadelphia Inquirer in 1979. He later joined ESPN and now covers  baseball for The Athletic. Jayson credits his love of writing to his  mother, June Stark, who was also a writer.   We congratulate him on this major achievement and his contributions  to sports writing.   I send my best wishes to Jayson, his wife, Lisa, and their three  children as well.                                time  1045                 Recognizing Fatima Community Garden Project     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a project in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is promoting sustainability for  members of our community.   Over the past year, 44 immigrant communities worked tirelessly to  create the Fatima Community Garden Project located behind Our Lady of  Fatima in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.  [[Page H4440]]  The garden serves as a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania  Horticultural Society and Catholic Social Services.   For many immigrants who arrive in our community, the Fatima Community  Garden Project gives newcomers the ability to use horticultural skills  cultivated in their homelands while offering them the opportunity to  converse with local residents. One neighbor referred to the Fatima  Community Garden Project as a sanctuary.   Mr. Speaker, the Fatima Community Garden Project officially opens on  Saturday, and I would like to thank several people who have worked over  the past year to make this unique collaboration successful: J. Mizael  Chavez, a community leader who helped families establish their presence  in Bensalem; Matt Rader, president of the Pennsylvania Horticultural  Society; and Estela Bugg of Catholic Social Services for all of their  work.                            Honoring PDC Machines     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a second- generation, family-owned business in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that  was recognized last month for the outstanding work that they do to  support our local economy.   PDC Machines, Inc., an equipment manufacturer based in Warminster,  Pennsylvania, was honored at the 2019 President's E Award ceremony.  They were presented with an award by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for  their work supporting the expansion of U.S. exports.   Founded in 1977, PDC has been exporting products since the early  1980s. Today, approximately 50 percent of PDC's revenues come from  international business.   PDC Machines takes great pride in the quality of their products and  the services they provide to their customers. I am proud to have such a  dynamic and innovative company in our community in Bucks County.   We congratulate the Afzal family for this well-deserved recognition.                            ____________________
