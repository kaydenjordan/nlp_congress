 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for  [[Page H4335]]  yielding and for his incredible support for our Nation's law  enforcement officers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thin Blue Line Act,  legislation I have introduced to support our Nation's brave police  officers, firefighters, and first responders.   This week, we recognize National Police Week, a time to reflect on  the very professional service of our law enforcement officers and their  families. It is also a time to honor the lives of those brave officers  who were killed in the line of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice.   It is really a sad reality that attacks against law enforcement  officers have skyrocketed in recent years. Their entire community  endured an especially difficult and heartbreaking 2016. In fact, in the  last year alone, police officer deaths from shootings have increased 56  percent, and ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers have  increased a staggering 167 percent, nationally.   We need to send a very clear message: The intentional targeting and  killing of our first responders will not be tolerated.   My bill, the Thin Blue Line Act, would make murder or attempted  murder of a police officer, firefighter, or other first responder an  aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. This bill will  serve as a strong deterrent to anyone planning an attack against our  brave men and women in uniform who protect and serve our communities.   We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to police officers and first  responders across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation to help our American heroes.
