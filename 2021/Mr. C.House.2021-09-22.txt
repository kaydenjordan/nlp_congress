 Scott Franklin), my friend and  colleague, and a great member of the Armed Services Committee.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Alabama for yielding me time to speak on the importance of section  1033 of the military surplus program.   My Democratic colleagues frequently argue the 1033 program exists to  militarize our police by providing lethal equipment. They claim the  program transfers weapons of war to the police. They continue to  perpetuate this misleading narrative to advance their dangerous crusade  against law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I have spoken with law enforcement in my district. The  1033 program has helped them acquire a number of needed pieces of  equipment, including heavy rescue vehicles.   In 2015, a perpetrator in Polk County, Florida, my home district,  wearing a bulletproof vest infiltrated a police line and had a shootout  with our SWAT team. He had a stockpile of weapons, including AR-15s and  AK-47s, and he used them to fire 93 rounds at deputies attempting to  take him into custody. Sadly, John Mikula, a Polk County EMT, was shot  and injured during the shootout.   If not for this armored SWAT military surplus vehicle acquired  through the 1033 program, more deputies might have been injured or  killed.   The 1033 program provides law enforcement agencies with needed heavy- duty equipment at little to no cost.   It is taxpayer friendly and efficient to recycle, reuse, and extend  the life of equipment bought by taxpayers. It would be wasteful to  simply discard this gear.   Many of the types of vehicles are also used during hurricane recovery  to rescue stranded citizens. The 1033 program also provides tents,  generators, and air conditioners that are used for natural disaster  field facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I am a military veteran and familiar with weapons of  war. I have never seen rescue vehicles, tents, generators, or air  conditioners used or referred to as weapons of war.   Our law enforcement agencies use the 1033 program to acquire  equipment that protects our officers and serves our communities.   This amendment is another ridiculous amendment to defund and  undermine the men and women who protect us and put their lives on the  line.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
