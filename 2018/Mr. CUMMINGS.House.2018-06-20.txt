 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gowdy for his leadership and  for working together to craft this legislation. I thank Chairman  Meadows and Ranking Member Connolly for helping us reach the  compromises that made this legislation possible.   In 1988, Mr. Speaker, Congress created the Office of National Drug  Control Policy. This is the office that should be coordinating our  Nation's drug control efforts and leading our response to the drug  crisis, which is now,  [[Page H5323]]  by the way, killing 175 people per day. Let me repeat that: killing 175  people per day.   However, ONDCP is failing, just when we need it the most. In fact, an  article published this week described the office this way: ``empty  desks, squabbles, inexperienced staff.''   The failure is glaring. For example, the office is required to  produce a national drug control strategy by February 1 of each year.  Two February 1sts have now come and two have gone since President Trump  took office, but the Trump administration still has not come up with a  solution to this most glaring and painful problem. This is simply  unacceptable.   Life expectancy in this Nation is falling because we are failing to  respond appropriately to this drug crisis. We urgently need to  revitalize and strengthen ONDCP.   H.R. 5925, the CRISIS Act, would make changes we need and would  improve our drug control efforts if it is fully funded and  implemented--fully funded and implemented.                                time  1215    It would expand the office's authority to direct resources where they  are most needed. It would strengthen data collection and analysis to  help us develop the real-time monitoring we need to understand the  rapidly changing dimensions of the opioid crisis.   The bill incorporates several proposals I have offered to give ONDCP  new authorities to coordinate critical aspects of our response to the  crisis.   I have often said that we must go about the business of being  effective and efficient in what we do. These are examples of things  that will make ONDCP more effective and efficient in addressing this  problem.   For example, for the first time ever, it would create a treatment  coordinator within the office responsible for coordinating efforts to  expand the availability and quality of evidence-based treatment.   It would also require the office to develop and promulgate model  standards for treatment facilities. Right now, too many so-called  treatment facilities are taking advantage of desperate families,  charging them outlandish prices, bilking insurance companies, but  failing to help those in need. As a matter of fact, many people are  going into these places seeking to get treatment and come out worse off  because they are not being properly treated.   Remember what I said: We want to be effective and efficient in what  we do, and we want to make sure that taxpayers' dollars are spent  appropriately.   I believe that if H.R. 5925 is enacted and fully implemented, it will  improve our drug control efforts, and, for that reason, I am supporting  the measure.   However, I want to be real clear about something. Even if this bill  is enacted and fully implemented, the drug crisis we are facing will  likely get worse. That is because this bill does not provide the  resources we need to treat millions of Americans who have the disease  of addiction. According to the President's own commission on opioids,  only 10 percent of individuals who need treatment for substance abuse  disorders are getting it.   No one believes that we can fight cancer, or heart disease, or  Alzheimer's if we don't treat people who have these diseases. The same  is true here.   Imagine someone going into a doctor's office and the doctor says:  Well, you are the 10th person, and you are lucky to get treatment. But  the other nine who came before you won't get any treatment.   We will not stand for that. If we don't treat people who are  addicted, we will not solve the drug crisis.   We may pass this bill today, celebrate the passage, and say we did a  great job. We may work with the Senate to send it to the President. The  President might even sign it. But then, next year's overdose fatality  numbers will come out. They will show that deaths are continuing to  rise. They will show emergency room visits increasing again. They will  show the economic effects of a crisis that is already costing us $500  billion a year continuing to grow.   It doesn't have to be this way. No, it doesn't have to be this way.  We don't have to just nibble at the edges or rearrange the deck chairs  on the Titanic.   I have introduced legislation called the CARE Act with Senator  Elizabeth Warren, modeled directly on the highly successful Ryan White  Act, which Congress passed with bipartisan support in 1990 to address  the AIDS crisis.   The CARE Act would provide $10 billion a year in stable, predictable  Federal funding to States, counties, and other frontline responders.  The CARE Act would provide funds for research to train health  professionals to diagnose and treat addiction. It would also provide  half a billion dollars per year to purchase the lifesaving drug  naloxone at discounted prices and distribute it to first responders,  public health agencies, and the public.   I offered the CARE Act as an amendment to this measure considered  this week. My amendment was paid for by rolling back just a portion of  the tax cuts given by the Republican-controlled Congress to the  Nation's largest corporations, including the drug companies who have  used their tax breaks to buy back billions of dollars' worth of stock  rather than lower drug prices. By the way, there is something wrong  with that picture.   But the Republican leadership did not make my amendment in order. The  House never considered it.   I support H.R. 5925 and our critical efforts to ensure that we have  an office that will effectively and efficiently coordinate our drug  control efforts. However, what our Nation truly needs is for us to show  the political courage to choose to save the lives of our fellow  Americans by adequately funding treatment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment, before I yield to my  distinguished colleague, Mr. Connolly, to echo what my good friend just  said about our staffs.   I, too, thank our staffs for all that they have done. So often they  are unseen, unnoticed, and feel, I am sure, unappreciated and  unapplauded. But our staffs worked very, very hard on this, and I, too,  give the ultimate applause to them. I want to thank you for recognizing  them.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. Meadows for working so hard to bring  all this together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, a man who has just been tireless on this issue and so many  others, but who has done such a phenomenal job.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I must point out that my Republican  colleagues say they want to address the opioid crisis, yet they are  standing silent as the Trump administration actively tries to destroy  the Affordable Care Act protections for people with pre-existing  conditions, which, by the way, includes substance use disorders.   If we aren't going to take available steps to expand access to  addiction treatment, at least we should all agree that we shouldn't  roll back protections that prevent insurance companies from  discriminating against people with substance use disorders. Therefore,  we should all be working to protect the Affordable Care Act from the  Trump administration's effort to destroy the essential protections it  provides.   Again, I remind all of us that ONDCP is a very important entity and  it has a job to do, and it must be properly funded.   A lot of people, when they give statistics about opioids and drugs,  Mr. Speaker, they find themselves speaking about the dead. Well, I am  here to tell you that there are pipelines to death, and those are the  people who are addicted now. Those are the ones who are thinking about  it, about to start using those drugs. So we must address not only the  deaths and the statistics, but we must address treatment that is  effective and efficient.   Mr. Speaker, again, I am urging my colleagues to vote for this bill,  but I want it to be clear that we should not dust our hands off and say  it is done.   It is not done. There is so much more to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
