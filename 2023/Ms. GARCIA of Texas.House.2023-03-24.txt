 Mr. Speaker, this week, we mark the 13th  anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to President Obama,  Americans have been reassured that they can receive the care they need.   Since it was passed into law, the Affordable Care Act has lowered  healthcare costs for families and insured more than 35 million  Americans.   Democrats' passage of the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation  Reduction Act made ACA subsidies more generous, which lowered health  insurance  [[Page H1415]]  costs and helped 29,000 people in my district, Mr. Speaker. Now, they  have access to affordable health insurance.   House Democrats continue to protect the Affordable Care Act today.  While MAGA Republicans support proposals to cut Americans' healthcare,  House Democrats will always stand to protect Americans' healthcare.   I will always put people over politics--today, tomorrow, and every  day.                            ____________________
