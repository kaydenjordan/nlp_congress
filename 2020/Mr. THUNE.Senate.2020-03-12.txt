Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran)  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect  to the Danly nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, last week, Congress provided billions in  funding to address the coronavirus outbreak. These funds will help  support virus research, testing, and medical care. Congress is now  looking at other measures that may be required, including measures to  address the economic impact of the virus. The House may consider an  economic response measure today, but my understanding is that its bill  does not yet reflect an agreement with the White House, which will be  needed to move any stimulus package.   I want to echo the leader's comments from yesterday and say that this  is not a time for partisanship, and it is very important that we work  together on matters related to the coronavirus so that we can get  needed legislation passed in a timely fashion.   More Americans are testing positive for the virus each day--including  eight people in my home State of South Dakota--and it is our  responsibility as Members of Congress to work together to ensure that  our country has the resources it needs to combat and defeat this  disease.   There is no doubt that things are stressful right now. Americans are  understandably worried about their own health and the health of their  loved ones. But we have a lot of dedicated people working to keep  Americans safe, from nurses and doctors to public health officials.  Everyone is focused on making sure we do what we need to do to limit  the spread of this virus. And all of us, of course, can help in that  effort by paying attention to the guidance we are given, whether it is  advice about washing our hands or avoiding large gatherings or a  request to stay home for a while.   It is a challenging time, but America has been through challenging  times before and emerged from them stronger. I am confident that if we  pull together, that is what will happen again.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3479         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
