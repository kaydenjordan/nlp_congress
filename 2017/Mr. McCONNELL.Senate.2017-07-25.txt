 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 175,  H.R. 2810.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.   The bill clerk read as follows:         Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 175, H.R. 2810, a bill to       authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military       activities of the Department of Defense, for military       construction, and for defense activities of the Department of       Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such       fiscal year, and for other purposes.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.                        Welcoming Back Senator McCain     Mr. President, I wish to start this morning with a few  words about our friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, whom  we will have an opportunity to welcome back today.   As I noted last week, we all know Senator McCain is a fighter. That  is evidenced by his remarkable life of public service, just as it is  again evidenced by his quick return to the Senate this afternoon. I  know he is eager to get back to work, and we are all very pleased to  have him back with us today.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, on the vote we will have today in a couple of hours,  Senators will have an important decision to make. Seven years after  ObamaCare was imposed on our country, we will vote on the critical  first step to finally move beyond its failures.   Many of us have made commitments to our constituents to provide  relief from this failed leftwing experiment. Now we have a real  opportunity to keep those commitments by voting to begin debate and  ultimately to send smarter healthcare solutions to the President's desk  for his signature. Just yesterday, the President reiterated his  intention to sign them.   Yesterday, the administration released a statement urging all  Senators to vote in favor of the motion to proceed so that we can  ``move forward on repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with true  reforms that expand choice and lower costs.'' I wish to express my  appreciation to the administration for its continued close work with us  on this issue at every step of the way. From the President and Vice  President to Secretary Price and Administrator Verma, as well as so  many others, the engagement we have seen has been important to our  efforts, and it has sent an unmistakable signal to the country that  this administration not only understands the pain middle-class families  have felt under ObamaCare but is actually committed to doing something  about it.   By now, we are all keenly aware of the pain ObamaCare has caused for  literally millions of families. Premiums have skyrocketed, doubling on  average in the vast majority of States on the Federal exchange.  Insurance options have declined under ObamaCare, leaving many with as  few as one or even zero insurers to choose from. Many Americans now  face the real possibility of having no options at all and could find  themselves trapped, forced by law to purchase ObamaCare insurance but  left by ObamaCare without any means to do so. All the while, markets  continue to collapse under ObamaCare in States across the country.   It is a troubling indication of what is to come unless we act.  Fortunately, the American people have granted us the opportunity to do  so. We finally have an administration that cares about those suffering  under ObamaCare's failures and a President who will sign a law to  actually do something about it. We have a House that recently passed  its own legislation to help address these problems. We have a Senate  with a great chance before us to do our part now.   If other Senators agree and join me in voting yes on the motion to  proceed, we can move one step closer to sending legislation to the  President for his signature. I hope everyone will seize the moment. I  certainly will. Only then can we open up a robust debate process.  [[Page S4166]]  Only then will Senators have the opportunity to offer additional ideas  on healthcare.   Inaction will do nothing to solve ObamaCare's problems or bring  relief to those who need it. In fact, it will make things worse for our  constituents all across the country.   I wish to reiterate what the President said yesterday:         Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling       America that you are [just] fine with the ObamaCare       nightmare. . . .        That's a position that even Democrats have found hard to       defend. Remember President Clinton called ObamaCare ``the       craziest thing in the world'' and a Democratic Governor said       it's ``no longer affordable.''    You won't hear me say this often, but they are right.   I hope colleagues will consider ObamaCare's history of failures--the  unaffordable costs, the scarce choices, the burden on middle-class  families--as they cast their vote this afternoon. I urge them to  remember the families who are hurting under this collapsing law.   Numerous Kentuckians, like so many others across the Nation, have  conveyed their heartbreaking stories with my office through phone  calls, letters, meetings, and dozen of healthcare forums all across  Kentucky. These families are suffering under ObamaCare. They need  relief. I will be thinking about them as I vote to proceed to the bill  today. I know many other colleagues will do the same.   Our constituents are hurting under ObamaCare. They are counting on us  to do the right thing right now. That means voting to allow the Senate  to finally move beyond ObamaCare's failures. That is what I intend to  do. That is what I urge every colleague to do.   We can do better than ObamaCare. We have a responsibility to the  American people to do that. Today's vote to begin debate is the first  step, and we should take it.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  my remarks, the Democratic leader be recognized to use his leader time  for up to 20 minutes; and that following his remarks, the Senator from  Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, be recognized to suggest the absence of a  quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Democratic leader be recognized for 5 minutes for debate only and that  I then be recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. President, 7 years ago, Democrats imposed  ObamaCare on our country. They said that costs would go down. Costs  skyrocketed. They said that choice would go up. Choice plummeted. Now  ObamaCare's years-long lurch toward total collapse is nearing a  seemingly inevitable conclusion, and it will hurt even more Americans  on the way down.   This, my friends, is the ObamaCare status quo. This is the status  quo. We have had to accept it for a long time. We do not have to accept  it any longer.   The American people elected a House with a vision of a better way on  healthcare. Then they elected a Senate. Then they elected a President.  Now, having been given the responsibility to govern, we have a duty to  act. The President is ready with his pen. The House has passed  legislation. Today, it is the Senate's turn. That starts with a vote  that we will take momentarily. The critical first step in that process  is the motion to proceed. It is the vote that determines whether this  debate can proceed at all, whether we will even take it up after four  straight elections in which this was a huge commitment to the American  people. It is the vote that determines whether the Senators of both  parties can offer their amendments and ideas on healthcare.   I told the people of my State, over this period, that I would vote to  move beyond ObamaCare, and that is what I am going to do today by  voting yes. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in doing so. We have  already shown that it is possible to put legislation on the President's  desk that moves us beyond ObamaCare and its years of failure. We did  that 2 years ago. President Obama vetoed what we passed before.  President Trump will sign what Congress passes this time.   I thank the President and the administration for all they have done  on this issue already. They have worked with us every step of the way,  and they, like us, know the consequences of failing to act.   Look, we cannot let this moment slip by. We cannot let it slip by. We  have  [[Page S4168]]  been talking about this for too long. We have wrestled with this issue.  We have watched the consequences of the status quo. The people who sent  us here expect us to begin this debate, to have the courage to tackle  the tough issues. They did not send us here just to do the easy stuff.  They expect us to tackle the big problems. Obviously, we cannot get an  outcome if we do not start the debate, and that is what the motion to  proceed is all about.   Many of us on this side of the aisle have waited for years for this  opportunity and thought that it would probably never come. Some of us  were a little surprised by the election last year, but with a surprise  election comes great opportunities to do things that we thought were  never possible. All we have to do today is to have the courage to begin  the debate with an open amendment process and let the voting take us  where it will.   That is what is before us, colleagues. Will we begin the debate on  one of the most important issues confronting America today? It is my  hope that the answer will be yes.                              Order of Procedure    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following the vote,  Senator McCain be recognized to speak for debate only for up to 15  minutes and that the time not count on H.R. 1628.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 120,  H.R. 1628.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 267.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays with  respect to amendment No. 267.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 270.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.
