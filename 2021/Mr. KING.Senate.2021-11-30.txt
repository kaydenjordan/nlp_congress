 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have the responsibility and the privilege  to be the chair of something called the Strategic Forces Subcommittee  of the Committee on Armed Services.   Strategic forces is a euphemism for nuclear weapons, and it is one of  the most serious threats that we continue to face. We face threats all  over the world from pandemics, from terrorism, from a rising China,  from a belligerent Russia, but one of the most serious that sometimes  gets lost in the discussion is the unthinkable catastrophe that would  be a nuclear exchange.   Throughout the last 70-plus years, our principle strategy for dealing  with that threat has been deterrence, the idea that if you use nuclear  weapons against the United States of America, you will pay the heaviest  of prices, and that deterrence has worked. There hasn't been a use of  nuclear weapon since 1945, and there are now several--I can't say the  exact number for classification reasons--but there are a number of  nuclear countries in the world, nuclear-armed countries, China and  Russia among them. China is expanding its nuclear capability  exponentially. Over the past several years, they have been embarked on  an enormous buildup of their nuclear capability.   But I want to talk about a nuclear threat today in the context of the  nomination that I am going to move in a few moments that, to me, is one  of the most terrifying because it is a nuclear threat that deterrence  doesn't work on--a nuclear threat that deterrence, the fundamental  strategy of our prevention of nuclear conflict for 70 years, doesn't  work.   What is that threat? The threat of nuclear terrorism. If you are not  representing a country and if you don't care about dying, then the idea  of a nuclear response doesn't scare you. It doesn't deter you from  taking that kind of action.   How do we defend against that? What is deterrence 2.0 in the current  world where international terrorism--although it has not been on the  front pages recently--is still there?   ISIS-K, ISIS, al-Qaida, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula are all  still there. Boko Haram in Africa--they are all still there. They are  all plotting. They are all working on ways that they can attack the  West and the United States of America.   If they could get ahold of the nuclear technology and nuclear  building block, which is enriched uranium, they would use it. The  terrorists who killed 3,000 people on September 11 would kill--would  have killed 3 million if they could have.   And so keeping nuclear materials and nuclear technology out of the  hands of terrorists is, to me, one of the most important functions that  our government can perform.   And that brings me to the nomination of Corey Hinderstein for the  position of Deputy Administrator for Nuclear Nonproliferation. She is  immensely qualified and has worked in this field for almost 20 years;  has worked on nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation issues for  most of those years, both in the government and in the private sector.  I would venture to say there is probably no one in the United States  who knows as much about this subject as she does.   Ms. Hinderstein will be responsible for a major part of the budget-- $1.9 billion--but she is responsible for controlling the proliferation  of nuclear materials, and that is so critical in light of the threat of  nuclear terrorism. The only way we can keep them from attacking us is  intelligence, knowing what is coming, and keeping these materials out  of their hands; and that is why this job is so important.   She was approved by the committee and recommended to the Senate 40  days ago. It is time to move this nomination. Nominations can be held  up for a variety of reasons and some policy reasons, and I understand  that, but not in this case. And I am happy to report that it appears  that this nomination will not be held up because I think all of our  colleagues realize how important this function is in the government.   The most--the best nuclear strike is the one that doesn't occur. The  only way to prevent that is to stop the proliferation of nuclear  materials. This problem is only growing. We know that Iran is now  enriching uranium to a much higher extent than they did under the  JCPOA. We know that North Korea is pursuing its own nuclear ambitions.  India, Pakistan both have nuclear programs. So this is a clear and  present danger to the United States of  [[Page S8811]]  America, and that is why this nomination is so important.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination,  Calendar No. 475; that the Senate vote on the nomination; the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume  legislative session, all with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
