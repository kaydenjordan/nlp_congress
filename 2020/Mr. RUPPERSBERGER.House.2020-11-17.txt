 Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill that will reduce the scourge of violence  in America.   The bill is based on a very simple concept: helping the victims of  violent injury before they become repeat victims or even perpetrators  themselves. We can do this by expanding hospital-based violence  intervention programs around the country.   I was inspired to write this bill after learning about the violence  intervention program at the University of Maryland R. Adams Cowley  Shock Trauma Center. Maryland Shock Trauma is considered one of the top  trauma centers in the world. And, by the way, it helped save my life  years ago.   Shock Trauma has a staggering 20 percent of patients who are the  victims of violence, usually stabbings and shootings, that have  occurred on the streets of Baltimore. Many of these patients are repeat  customers, caught in a revolving door of violent reinjury. In fact, one  of the leading risk factors for violent injury is a prior violent  injury.   Shock Trauma is taking advantage of the fact that these patients are  a captive audience, confined to a bed and off the streets, if only for  a few days.  [[Page H5816]]                                     time  1315    Participants in their violence intervention program, one of the 40  that now exist across the country, receive a brief intervention in the  emergency room or at the hospital bedside. They get counseling and  support that could include help with groceries, bus money, substance  abuse treatment, job training or help finding affordable housing.   This intervention is then followed by intensive community-based case  management services in the months following the injury. At Shock  Trauma, program participants have shown an 83 percent decrease in  rehospitalization due to intentional violent injury, and a 75 percent  reduction in criminal activity, and an 82 percent increase in  employment.   This bill that we have before us today, the Bipartisan Solution to  Cyclical Violence Act, provides $10 million in Federal grants to  hospitals that want to create or expand violence prevention programs.  At the end of a 3-year pilot, each hospital will report its findings  back to the Federal Government. Awards will range from $250,000 to  $500,000.   I believe, however, this bill will net cost savings to the American  taxpayers by reducing violent crime, which costs more than $12 billion,  from police, courts, and jails, to the medical expenses of victims, to  the lost wages to both victims and perpetrators.   Further, as we engage in a national conversation about reimagining  public safety, I think we need to do what we can to shift social work  away from police and first responders and back to the experts in mental  health, substance abuse, homelessness, unemployment, and other areas  that often afflict victims of violent crime.   In fact, when I first introduced this bill in 2019, it was endorsed  by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Resource  Officers, and the National District Attorneys Association. We also  received endorsements from the NAACP, American College of Surgeons,  Network of Hospital-Based Violence Intervention Programs, and the  National League of Cities. It has also been endorsed by the National  Hospital Association.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Adam Kinzinger, for coauthoring  this important legislation; and Chairman Frank Pallone and Ranking  Member Walden for helping us work through this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Bipartisan  Solution to Cyclical Violence Act.
