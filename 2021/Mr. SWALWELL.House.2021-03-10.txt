 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for this legislation  because it takes the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the  most dangerous people.   I have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about  rights. Let's talk about some other rights in this country, like the  right to pray in church, the right to dance at a party, the right to  come home from a concert, the right to come back home safely and alive.  Those are rights that matter, too.   And I am for this because I think about a mother who told me a couple  years ago to keep fighting on this issue because every day when she  puts her children in the car and sends them off to school, before they  get out the car, she closes her eyes to remember what they were wearing  because she was afraid that one day she may have to identify them.   This bill says we don't have to live that way anymore. The right to  come home alive is greater than any right that is being put forward by  the other side.
