 Mr. Speaker, on December 6, a Rwandan court will decide  the fate of human rights activist Diane  [[Page H9747]]  Rwigara, who faces up to 22 years in prison for speaking out against  President Paul Kagame's government, and for running against him to be  president.   The politically motivated charges against Diane seek to quash any  criticism of the ruling party, which has gone largely unchallenged for  more than 23 years.   Americans know that freedom of speech is essential to democracy. They  know that we must protect our right to question our leaders and,  importantly, encourage that freedom around the world.   I am sponsoring Diane's case as part of the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission's Defending Freedoms Project, because as Diane faces a  prolonged jail sentence, she is still calling on fellow Rwandans to  resist fear and speak for their country,   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in calling for justice  for Diane.                            ____________________
