 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness, but also to honor a  commissioner, Commissioner Marcus Hardy, who was a highly respected  leader in his community.   Marcus served as a city commissioner in the town of Crescent City,  Florida, which is located in the district which I am proud to  represent. I was fortunate enough to work alongside Mr. Hardy in  efforts to improve Crescent City and the greater community.   Beyond being a devoted public servant, a coach, and a role model,  Marcus was a family man and a friend to many. Anyone who knew him knew  his heart and his passion for serving others. He often spent his free  time serving as a mentor for the Boys II Men organization in Crescent  City or working to revitalize Putnam County for the benefit of the  whole community.   Marcus will be remembered for his compassion, his leadership, his  friendship, his large, firm hand grip and contagious smile.   Thank you for your service, Marcus. You will be missed by many.                            ____________________
