 Mr. Chairman, I want to join my colleagues in support of  this important lands package which is not a messaging bill. It is a  bill that will protect endangered species, improve climate mitigation,  and support our Nation's growing outdoor recreation economy. Every  component of this bill certainly accomplishes those ends.   But, in particular, the Colorado Wilderness Act Title I provides  Federal protections to many of Colorado's most beautiful and treasured  lands, and that I can attest to as a Representative for Colorado's  Second Congressional District.   I am inspired by my colleague, Congresswoman DeGette's dedication and  her championing of this cause, having worked on this bill for the  better part of the last 20 years.   It is important that we protect these beautiful and treasured public  lands for generations to come. We have a strong tradition of protecting  public lands in my home State. As the Chair well knows, earlier this  year we passed the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act out of  the House, which is an important step in that regard.   I think at the end of the day we should be able to agree on the goal  of protecting public lands to ensure that they exist for future  generations, including for the generation of my daughter who is 18  months old now--a year-and-a-half-old, I should say--and I look forward  to being able to enjoy these incredible public lands with her over the  many coming years.   So at the end of the day this bill makes sense. It is worth fighting  for. Let's protect public lands, not just in Colorado but across the  country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting  America's Wilderness Act.
