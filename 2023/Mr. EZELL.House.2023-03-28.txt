 Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 1, the  Lower Energy Costs Act.   For the last 2 years, the Biden administration has implemented  radical energy policies that have caused the price of gas and other  household expenses to skyrocket. At the same time, this administration  has forced us to become more dependent on hostile foreign nations and  has caused us to lose high-paying American energy jobs.   H.R. 1 is commonsense legislation that addresses these problems. It  would increase domestic energy production, reform outdated permitting  processes, and support the production and processing of critical  minerals.   Ultimately, this bill works to support the energy needs of  hardworking American families who are struggling with the high prices  created by this administration's policies.   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  I am proud of the way H.R. 1 improves water quality certification by  streamlining an outdated permitting process. Bureaucrats often  weaponize the process by slowing down certification for projects that  don't fit their radical agenda.
