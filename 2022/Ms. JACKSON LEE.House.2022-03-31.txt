 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak from both the  heart and the Constitution.   The privilege of citizenship in the United States gives Americans the  freedom to exert and to speak about what is in the depths of their  heart while holding the Constitution that indicates: ``We the people of  the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish  justice''--the Constitution goes on to describe a myriad of justice  issues in the Bill of Rights.   In addition to that, we have exhibits, symbols of freedom. I begin  first with the Statue of Liberty standing tall in the New York Harbor.  What you can see is the throng of humanity, fleeing Ukrainians, who now  will probably amount to 6 million internally displaced persons and  refugees in totality.                                time  1015    Amongst these individuals are separated families from their husbands,  brothers, and cousins and others who are on the fight.   But it is important to describe why we are here: one man, Putin. One  man. One man has established this level of intense brutality and  violence, insensitivity, rage, and attack.   Mr. Putin's attack is on the babies of Ukraine. I will not give him  any credence or respect that he is at war. He is in the midst of  destruction and vile actions and attacked a hospital with pregnant  women. He separated pregnant women from their babies who were born dead  or mothers who gave birth and died and the baby died shortly  thereafter.   The new revelation is that babies and women and children have been  stolen by Russian soldiers and carted off to Russian territory. That is  the vileness of this ludicrous Putin war.   Then we come to find out--which is in the public domain--that he may  not be getting the right information, but let us not use that as an  excuse.   It didn't matter what revelations he would get. He is a violent actor  living in a dream world of reimagining the Soviet Union.   And so it is crucial for those of us who believe in peace that our  administration determines the validity of any peace discussions because  we would want to be part of ensuring that they are viable.   But, at the same time, to the dismay of many of us, the weapons  should be given, the drones should be given, the war has to stop, and  there is no end in sight.   And so the murderous attack, the destruction of cities, such as the  ocean-based city, that have been destroyed, brought to their knees,  individuals lost lives under the pile of rubbage, and particularly, the  theater where 300 died where children were written on the outside.   Mr. Speaker, we must prepare now for refugees. And may I suggest that  we must prepare for refugees coming from South and Central America that  will include Haitians and Africans.   We are prepared to take in 125,000. Only 7,000 have been utilized. As  some would say, including my late friend and colleague, Elijah  Cummings, America is better than this. We know how to do this, and we  must find the way to do it.   Standing at podiums and banging on the desk about we don't want these  people, then you must not want those who are fleeing the bloody,  violent actions of this horrific person.   I believe we should stand united as Americans, to capture the words:  ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice''. . . . I want us to stand with the Ukrainian  people, that nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Marcy Kaptur for leading the Ukrainian Caucus  and all of the Members, Republicans and Democrats.   But as I conclude, let me quickly say in 1 minute one issue that we  should not forget in establishing justice: We must have oversight over  the United States Supreme Court, and the texts of a spouse, as well,  must be addressed, and we will address it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6833, and I  acknowledge Ms. Craig and Mrs. McBath. I tell my friends on the other  side of the aisle that we can walk and chew gum at the same time, but  right now people are dying because they are apportioning or putting in  proportion their insulin that they need--not taking the full amount,  but doing it proportionately. That is a death sentence.    Let me indicate: Native Americans, 14.7 percent diabetic; Hispanic,  12.5 percent; Black Americans, 11.7 percent. Many of them are on  Medicare and many of them are on Medicaid. We can do both. I do rise to  support this legislation--$35 in 2023, regardless of whether a  beneficiary has reached the annual out-of-pocket spending; $35  beginning in 2024.   It is well-known that those who had diabetes suffered more with  COVID-19. This is an important step. In the 18th Congressional District  uninsured residents paid 23 times more for the brand of insulin, and we  must begin to work on that. I join with my colleagues in making that  the next step. I rise for this.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support the new response to marijuana,  and to insist that we pass the MORE Act that came out of my  subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee.   Public support for legalization of marijuana has surged in the past  two decades. A total of 47 States have reformed their laws. We must  reform the banking aspect of it. We need to open the door to research,  therapeutic treatment for veterans, better banking and tax laws, and we  need to help fuel the economic growth within the industry.   We need to do this by sending dollars out to help our respective  communities bring down the cost of crime, be able to  [[Page H4029]]  help those who are in business. We must do this and spend Federal  resources to end criminalization, build the economic engine, and to  ensure that we are in step with 47 of our States.   Thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from the Federal  criminalization of marijuana with mandatory minimums, particularly  Black and Brown. All these persons incarcerated need to be able to be  constructive, but they are in there on the false war on drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I support both the insulin bill and the MORE Act, and I  ask my colleagues to support the underlying rule.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Rule governing House  consideration of H.R. 3617, the ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment  and Expungement Act of 2021,'' or the ``MORE Act of 2021.''   The Rule that is being considered is carefully crafted and provides  Members of the House an opportunity to address the existing conflict  between federal and state laws regarding marijuana, or cannabis, and to  provide reasonable solutions to resolve this conflict.   The bill is straightforward and responds to the need to leave the  question of the legality of cannabis to the individual states while  attempting to restore and reinvest in communities that have been  ravaged by the War on Drugs.   Specifically, the bill decriminalizes cannabis on the federal level,  provides a taxation structure for the sale of cannabis that will  support a community reinvestment trust fund, and provides for  expungement of convictions and arrests for federal cannabis offenses.   The Rule provides for debate and full consideration of the solutions  and opportunities for cannabis reform offered by H.R. 3617 by the  Congress.   The subject of the bill is public knowledge and well known by members  of this body.   I have worked to provide sensible reforms to our criminal justice  system.   Our outdated federal laws and policies unwisely require the  expenditure of scarce law enforcement resources on cannabis offenses  while conflicting with many states' laws regarding cannabis.   Cannabis does not fit the definition of a Schedule One drug and  federal law must be updated to reflect this reality--just as most  states have already begun to do.   Thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam  have adopted laws allowing medical use of cannabis.   Eighteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana  Islands have adopted laws for legalizing cannabis for adult  recreational use.   As public support for the legalization of marijuana has surged in the  past two decades, a total of 47 States have reformed their laws in one  form or another pertaining to cannabis, despite its federal  criminalization.   We need to open the door to research, therapeutic treatment for  veterans, better banking and tax laws, and we need to help fuel  economic growth within the industry.   We need to do this without continuing to spend federal resources on  criminalization and unjust incarceration for marijuana offenses.   Thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from the federal  criminalization of marijuana, particularly in black and brown  communities.   These individuals have borne the burden of collateral consequences  that have damaged our society across generations--such as the denial of  affordable housing, educational opportunities, employment, and the  right to vote.   Meanwhile, the laws enacted for the purpose of perpetuating the ``War  on Drugs'' have led America to imprison more people than any other  country.   The Rule allows the House to address these historical wrongs by  voting on H.R. 3617.   I thank the Committee on the Judiciary, on which I serve, for the  work it has done to bring H.R. 3617 to the floor for a vote.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in  support of the Rule and the underlying bill H.R. 3617.   Mr. Speaker, I rise also to speak in strong support of the Rule  governing House consideration of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now  Act.   The Rule that is being considered is well crafted and provides  Members of the House an opportunity to address an urgent need of  constituents who require life saving insulin.   The bill is simple and gets to the urgent need to limit cost-sharing  for insulin under private health insurance and the Medicare  prescription drug benefit.   Specifically, the bill caps cost-sharing under private health  insurance for a month's supply of selected insulin products at $35 or  25 percent of a plan's negotiated price (after any price concessions),  whichever is less, beginning in 2023.   The bill caps cost-sharing under the Medicare prescription drug  benefit for insulin products at: $35 in 2023 regardless of whether a  beneficiary has reached the annual out-of-pocket spending threshold,  and $35 beginning in 2024 for those who have not yet reached this  threshold.   The Rule provides for debate and full consideration of the benefits  offered by H.R. 6833 by the Congress.   The subject of the bill is public knowledge and well known by members  of this body.   I have worked closely with the healthcare community that serve  Houstonians to ensure that programs are receiving the appropriate level  of federal support.   One of the most difficult challenges are the hurdles to healthcare  created by lack of health insurance such as a lack of access to  necessary medications due to the high costs of many prescription drugs.   Diabetes is a life-threatening disease that disproportionately  affects communities of color.   Diabetes is associated with serious health problems, including heart  disease and stroke, kidney failure, and blindness.   There are 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Eighteenth  Congressional District who have been diagnosed with diabetes.   These individuals are my constituents and I know that on average,  each of them pays 4.8 times the cost of similar medication in  Australia, 3.6 times the cost in the United Kingdom, and 2.6 times the  cost in Canada.   Additionally, in the Eighteenth Congressional District, 26.7 percent  of residents are uninsured.   For example, an uninsured resident of this congressional district  pays 23 times more for this brand of insulin than their counterparts in  Australia, 15 times more than they would in the United Kingdom, and 13  times more than they would in Canada.   The consequences of these staggering costs are not benign.   Many patients often speak of having to make heart-wrenching decisions  about what to buy with the commonly fixed incomes attendant to seniors.   Many medical professionals indicate that the high prices for  prescription drugs are a function of a lack of competition, and  authorizing Medicare to create a program to negotiate drug prices may  be an estimable way to lower the cost of prescription drugs.   All told this reflects a disturbing trend: in our country, the cost  of branded drugs tends to go up, whereas in other countries, the costs  tend to go down.   Before insulin the prognosis for diabetics was bleak.   Over the past two decades, manufacturers have systematically and  dramatically raised the prices of their insulin products by more than  tenfold--often in lockstep.   In 2017, diabetes contributed to the death of 277,000 Americans--and  was the primary death for 85,000 of those individuals.   That same year diagnosed diabetes cost the United States an estimated  $327 billion--including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90  billion in productivity losses.   Diabetes drugs, including insulin and oral medications that regulate  blood sugar levels, play a critical role in helping people with  diabetes manage their condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related  health complications.   Although insulin is the most well-known diabetes medication, diabetes  patients are often prescribed other oral drugs to use in place of or  alongside insulin.   Many of these non-insulin products used to regulate blood sugar  levels are brand drugs that lack generic alternatives.   In recent years, the high prices of diabetes drugs have placed a  tremendous strain on diabetes patients as well as the federal  government, which provides diabetes medications to more than 43 million  Medicare beneficiaries.   Because Medicare lacks the authority to negotiate directly with drug  manufacturers, Medicare beneficiaries pay significantly more for their  drugs than patients abroad.   Patients who are uninsured or underinsured and must pay for their  drugs out of pocket bear an even greater cost burden.   The Rule allows the House to address this urgent need by voting on  H.R. 6833.   I thank the committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and  Education and Labor for the work they have done to bring H.R. 6833, the  Affordable Insulin Now Act to the floor for a vote.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in  support of the Rule and the underlying bill H.R. 6833.   Thank you.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act.

I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in  support of H.R. 6833.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan  for her leadership, along with my colleague from Texas, Congresswoman  Johnson, who chairs the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and  the many, many committees that have worked on the COMPETES Act.   As an alum of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and  a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I could not be more  ecstatic for America, for Houstonians, for Texans. To really take the  words of President Biden that were said to us in his comment on the  COMPETES Act: It is transformational investment in our industrial base  as well as research and development. It will help drive not only the  American economy, but the global economy. It will, in fact, bring more  manufacturing jobs back, and, yes, we will use the terminology, it will  reimagine not only the Midwest, but it will reimagine the Southwest,  the East, the West, the North, and the South. It will reimagine  opportunities for young people.   And the chips we have been waiting for, as indicated by the  gentlewoman from Michigan, I know we will have the opportunity to  really join in in a bipartisan way in conference for something that  nobody disagrees with. In addition, this ugly thing called the supply  chain that for a moment clogged the system, raised the prices, which  still have not been stabilized, but we will have the opportunity to  address that question as well by unclogging the seaways, by investing  with the infrastructure bill in ports, and getting products where they  need to go.   Let me also suggest that we will be able to build other companies,  smaller companies. Small businesses will improve or be able to result  in more investment. At the same time, this bipartisan legislation will  create opportunities for the next generation and the next generation.   I hope as well that minority businesses, minority scientists,  historically Black colleges will have the opportunity to be part of the  COMPETES Act, which I know that they will. This idea that we have a  distance between us as Republicans and Democrats has to be closed.   This is an American bill. This is a bill to say to China: We are not  going to take, sitting down, the unfair competition that you exert on  many of the inventions that actually are made right here in the United  States. Take the age-old internet and what China has done in many  instances.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support the COMPETES Act and it going to  conference, and at the same time recognize that any issue dealing with  China and the chips dealing with semiconductors will be addressed in  conference, and, as well, we will get the job done. It is  transformational and we can do no less than to invest in the great  mountain of research and development in this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the COMPETES Act  ultimately, and to work with conference as we go forward on this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the dean of  this House, Congressman Don Young, and to remember him from a  perspective of far-reaching diversity and love of the institution.   I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, his family, his extended  family, and all of the people of Alaska and all of the people of the  Nation.   Everyone who has offered a word of salute to Congressman Young  emphasizes his 49 years, but most of all, his love of getting the job  done--getting something done.   And, of course, when I was having the privilege of being in the  Chair, Mr. Speaker, I could always be reminded of that voice ``regular  order.'' And often you wanted to just do what Don Young said: Regular  order. Gavel it down. But, again, he did so because of a respect for  this institution.   I thank him for all of the introductions to Alaska that he made and,  really, all of the work for the Alaskan people. No matter who they  were, where they lived, in far reaches or inner cities, Don Young  represented the State so ably.   I am grateful to have spent just a small amount of time--two  decades--with Don Young in the House. And he will be remembered, and we  will be reminded of what love of the institution truly means; unselfish  commitment, and the commitment to work and get the job done.   Mr. Speaker, I salute the late Congressman Don Young. I thank him for  teaching us how to get the job done.                            ____________________
