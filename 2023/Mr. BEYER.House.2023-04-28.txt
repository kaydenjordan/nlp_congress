 Mr. Speaker, I believe almost all of us are here to make  America stronger, to serve the people who sent us here. This act will  do exactly the opposite.   It will hurt the 33,000 American solar installers who will lose their  jobs. It will raise energy costs for families everywhere, but  especially in the Sun Belt. It will hurt all Americans who hope to use  the solar tax credit.   It will hurt the energy companies, the businesses that built major  solar installations in the last 8 months that will be subject to a  retroactive tariff of 254 percent.   It will harm our endangered planet. It will handcuff us in our fight  against climate change.   Mr. Speaker, the act will not help our growing domestic solar panel  manufacturers that are already sold out till the end of the pause. It  won't hurt China, which has abundant buyers in the rest of the world.  This is the same China that ships a million packages a day duty-free to  the United States because of our $800 de minimis exception.   Mr. Speaker, this is an act that only creates losers. There are no  winners. I urge my friends to vote ``no.''
