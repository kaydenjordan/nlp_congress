 Mr. President, this continues to be a productive  August here in the Senate. We convened this month because too much of  the American people's business remained outstanding--too many  legislative priorities unfinished, too many noncontroversial,  completely qualified nominees left languishing on the Executive  Calendar due to partisan obstruction and delays.   Coming back to work this August was not a conventional decision, but  of course there is nothing conventional about the historic level of  obstruction Senate Democrats have systematically visited upon this  administration's nominees, even for critical positions. President  Trump's nominees have already been subjected to more than four times-- four times--as many cloture votes as the nominees of his six most  recent predecessors combined--combined--in their first 2 years. There  were 24 cloture votes on nominations in the first 2 years of Presidents  Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama--all put together, 24  times did the majority leader have to file cloture on a nomination in  the first 2 years--and for President Trump, 110 in a year and a half  and counting. So we returned to work to pass more legislation and to  confirm more nominees. That is  [[Page S5872]]  just what we have done, and it is just what we will continue to do.   This week, we will conclude the hugely important appropriations bills  before us. After that, we will turn to the 17 nominees on whom I filed  cloture yesterday. There are a variety of impressive men and women whom  the President has asked to serve both in the judiciary and in the  executive branch. None are particularly controversial. All are  qualified. No more obstruction. No more delays. It is time to confirm  them all, and the Senate will continue to work right through August  until every single one of them is confirmed.   This week, we have been considering appropriations measures to fund  the Department of Defense and the Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education. These bills will make Americans stronger  overseas and right here at home. They attend to national priorities  like providing the resources needed to better prepare our forces for  combat and to deter our enemies. The funds meet many of the  requirements of our military commanders, equipping and training units  to meet and overcome the most dangerous of emerging global threats. As  ever, our obligation to this All-Volunteer Force is to provide adequate  training, weaponry, and skills so that Americans always prevail on the  battlefield.   Here at home, this bill marshals new resources for our national  battle with drug abuse and opioid addiction and gives our National  Institutes of Health the resources to stay on offense against  everything from Alzheimer's to infectious diseases.   With private sector surveys showing that hiring skilled workers is a  top challenge for American business, this legislation continues and  expands our investments in apprenticeship programs, in training and  employment grants to States, and in support for dislocated workers.   These are national efforts, so how do they translate locally? Every  Senator can describe how this legislation will help families and  communities in their home State.   In my home State of Kentucky, we are looking forward to increased  funding for Pell grants and the millions we have secured to support  work colleges, like Berea College and Alice Lloyd College.   Kentuckians will benefit from new funding for community health  centers to support patients struggling with addiction and from a new  CDC initiative that will prioritize funding for counties most at risk  for outbreaks of HIV and hepatitis due to injection drug use.   Of course, the Department of Defense funding touches every single  community that proudly calls itself home to the men and women of our  armed services. Kentuckians in uniform and their families will enjoy  their well-earned pay raise--the highest in nearly a decade--which this  bill provides to all American servicemembers, and the communities that  revolve around Fort Campbell, Fort Knox, the Blue Grass Army Depot, and  the Kentucky National Guard can count on the funding they need to keep  their important operations going. They are national priorities, of  course, but all have local impacts.   I am proud of what these bills contain and how the Senate has crafted  them. I want to particularly thank Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy  once more. I look forward to voting to pass these measures very soon.    Does the Senator yield the floor?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendment be called up: Paul No. 3967. I further ask that at  4:10 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the amendment; that there be  no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to the  vote; and that it be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for  adoption. I further ask unanimous consent that following disposition of  the Paul amendment, the managers' package, which is at the desk, be  agreed to and all postcloture time be yielded back; further, that  Senator Enzi or his designee be recognized to offer a budget point of  order and that Senator Leahy or his designee be recognized to make a  motion to waive; finally, that following disposition of the motion to  waive, amendment No. 3699 be withdrawn and the substitute amendment, as  amended, be agreed to and the cloture motion on H.R. 6157 be withdrawn,  the bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended, with no further intervening action or debate.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker), the Senator from Texas (Mr.  Cornyn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Nebraska  (Mrs. Fischer), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker), the Senator from Texas (Mr.  Cornyn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Nebraska  (Mrs. Fischer), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).  [[Page S5907]]    Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz)  would have voted ``yea.''    I thank my friend from Utah.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
