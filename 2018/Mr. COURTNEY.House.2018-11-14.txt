 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  rule which will pave the way for a vote on a bill that will summarily  delist the gray wolf from protections under the Endangered Species Act  by congressional fiat, in direct contradiction to our Nation's animal  protection policies that have done so much to preserve the diversity of  animal existence over the last 45 years.   In addition, in keeping with the sad track record of this Republican- controlled Congress, this is yet another closed rule, number 102 over  the last 2 years, to be exact, that will prohibit consideration of any  amendments.   Most egregious of all, however, this rule includes a totally non- germane provision that will deny debate of a separate resolution that  will end U.S. participation in the Saudi-led coalition's intervention  in Yemen's civil war.   This separate resolution, the Khanna resolution, which I am an  original cosponsor of, will be effectively blocked from congressional  consideration and debate by passage of this rule, despite the  humanitarian crisis and indiscriminate coalition air strikes, which  American forces have enabled with refueling, and with logistical and  technical support over the last 3 years.   This bipartisan resolution deserves debate and as a coequal branch of  government, Congress should not be shirking its duty once again by  allowing U.S. military force to be used at the whim of the executive  branch.   Sadly, this rule is another example of the complete abdication by the  115th Congress of its duty to act as a check on a coequal branch of  government. This rule is another surrender by a weak-kneed majority on  its way out the door to the executive branch.   To quote ``The Hollow Men'' by T.S. Eliot, this Republican 115th  Congress is ending ``. . . not with a bang but a whimper.''
