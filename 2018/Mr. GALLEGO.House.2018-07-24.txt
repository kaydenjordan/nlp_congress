 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about a brave young woman,  an Arizonan named Vanessa Ramirez.   When she was just 23 years old, Vanessa received a devastating  diagnosis. Doctors told her that she had ovarian cancer, yet Vanessa  refused to put her dreams on hold. She somehow managed to fit in  chemotherapy sessions between her classes at Arizona State.   Eventually, Vanessa pulled through. She beat cancer, and, today, she  has two happy, healthy kids.   Vanessa has overcome a lot in her young life, but thanks to the  Affordable Care Act, there is one challenge she won't be forced to  endure: going without health insurance.   Despite her preexisting condition, Vanessa was able to purchase an  affordable plan through the ObamaCare marketplace. Her children are  also covered under KidsCare, our State's Children's Health Insurance  Program. However, if Donald Trump gets his way, Vanessa's story soon  could take a sad turn.   Having abolished the individual mandate, Republican State attorneys  general, backed by President Trump, are now arguing in court that rules  prohibiting insurers from charging higher rates on the basis of a  preexisting condition or even denying coverage completely should be  ruled unconstitutional.   The mandate is so central to ObamaCare, Republicans claim that,  without it, the courts should simply throw out the whole Affordable  Care Act altogether. Their arguments are clearly baseless. But if  Republicans succeed, millions of Americans like Vanessa could quickly  lose their coverage.   Of course, that is not all the Trump administration is doing to  undermine the Affordable Care Act. President Trump blocked cost-sharing  reduction payments to insurers, sending shock waves of uncertainty  through insurance markets across the Nation and raising costs for  consumers in premiums. Trump also cut open-enrollment periods and  slashed funding to help Americans sign up for insurance.   Trump and the GOP don't care about the people they are hurting. His  only objective is to erase the legacy of his predecessor.   Mr. Speaker, no issue crystalizes the differences between our two  political parties like this one. Democrats don't think your insurance  company should be allowed to drop you because you get sick. Democrats  don't believe you should go bankrupt and lose your home simply because  you get in an accident. Democrats are committed to the belief that  healthcare is a right, not a privilege, for every single American.   On the other hand, Republicans want to turn back the clock to a time  when a minor diagnosis could lead to the loss of coverage, when young  people were kicked off their parents' plan as soon as they turned 18,  when simply being a woman somehow qualified as a preexisting condition.  That is not right.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans couldn't repeal the Affordable Care Act in  Congress. Now they are just trying to sabotage it from the White House,  and millions of Americans, like Vanessa Ramirez, could lose access to  lifesaving care as a result. We can't allow that to happen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6124, the  Tribal Social Security Fairness Act.   I am pleased to support this common sense, bipartisan bill that will  extend a basic right to tribal leaders across the country: the ability  to retire with dignity and security.   Astonishing as it may seem, elected tribal leaders, including those  who have already paid into Social Security, can no longer contribute  to--or access the benefits of--this critical safety net program.   After a lifetime of service to their communities, tribal leaders  shouldn't have to struggle to make ends meet.   They deserve the same access to Social Security as every other  American.   This speaks to a broader problem, Mr. Speaker.   As the first inhabitants of our homeland, the interests of Native  Americans should be a primary consideration when federal policy makers  go to work--not an afterthought.   But, too often, the unique considerations of Indian Country are just  that . . . an afterthought.   Nevertheless, every decision we make in this body--from the Farm Bill  to healthcare to tax policy--every decision we make impacts our Native  American brothers and sisters.   Earlier today, in the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs, we heard from  the tribe whose members helped the Pilgrims survive that first winter  in Plymouth. Their good will is part of the reason you and I are here  today.   Moving forward, it's incumbent upon us to demonstrate the same  generosity of spirit that was shown to our nation's founders.   And we can start here and now.   I urge my colleagues to support this common sense legislation today,  and to fully consider the implications of new policies on Indian  Country in the future.
