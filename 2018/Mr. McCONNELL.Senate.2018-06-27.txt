 Mr. President, it is my privilege today to welcome a  special group of visitors to Washington. Thanks to Honor Flight  Bluegrass, more Kentucky veterans are touching down today in our  Nation's Capital. They are coming to remember fallen comrades and to  visit the memorials dedicated to their own service.   Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to spend time with a flight of  World War II veterans who arrived in time for the 74th anniversary of  D-Day. Today's flight includes veterans of World War II, along with  Korea and Vietnam. On behalf of the Commonwealth and all Americans, I  am proud to thank them for their service.   Next week, we celebrate our Independence Day. So let's not forget  that the freedoms we enjoy come at a cost. Let's take time to thank the  heroes who have paid it and those who continue to pay it today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Senate will continue our work  on the farm bill. The bipartisan collaboration of Chairman Roberts and  Ranking Member Stabenow has given all Senators the opportunity to  review and consider this important legislation.   Now we start the amendment process. Ideas from many of our colleagues  have already been included in the Roberts substitute amendment, but the  bill managers are open to considering additional amendments.   We will start with the Thune amendment regarding the Conservation  Reserve Program and go on from there, but it remains our intention to  finish consideration of the bill this week. This bill is too important  to let it languish. This is our chance to support the farm families,  producers, and rural communities on whom our Nation depends. Make no  mistake about it. They need that support.   American farmers are staring down falling commodity prices and  unstable markets and living under the constant threat of droughts,  floods, or other natural disasters. They are looking for certainty and  predictability. This farm bill delivers.   ``The fact is, without the solid foundation of the farm bill and the  certainty it provides, many farmers and ranchers would not be able to  get operating loans to farm for another year.''   Those are the words of the president of the American Farm Bureau  Federation, which passionately supports this bill. So do the  agricultural equipment manufacturers. So do the National Association of  Counties. So do many other groups dedicated to agriculture, business,  hunger prevention, and the health of rural America.   That is because this legislation provides the immediate assistance  and stability that farmers count on to keep feeding and supporting this  country right now and because it will empower our farmers and ranchers  to invest for the future.   Chairman Roberts described this perfectly yesterday. Here is what he  said: ``It takes the government providing tools and then getting out of  the producers' way.''   On the latter point, I am most excited about a provision in this bill  that will clear the way for the legal farming of industrial hemp by  removing current roadblocks that prevent farmers, in Kentucky and  around the country, from capitalizing on this promising crop.   Since the 1970s, except in a few limited cases, American farmers have  not been able to grow industrial hemp in their fields. That doesn't  mean consumers aren't buying hemp--far from it. Hemp is in everything  from health products to home insulation. The global market for hemp is  estimated to consist of more than 25,000 products. According to one  estimate, back in 2016, U.S. retail sales of hemp products totaled  approximately $688 million. Last year alone, Kentucky hemp recorded  more than $16 million in product sales through the State's pilot  program.  [[Page S4460]]    So American consumers are buying hemp, but thanks to heavy-handed  regulations, the only option at scale is importing hemp from foreign  producers.   Enough is enough. Industrial hemp is a completely different plant  than its illicit cousin. It is time we get Washington out of the way  and let American farmers meet the growing demand of American consumers.   In the last farm bill, I championed a hemp pilot program that opened  the door to some exploration. I recently heard from a fifth-generation  Kentucky farmer from Garrard County who participates in the program.  Here is what he said: ``We had no idea what it would turn into.'' He  said: Growing hemp has been ``career-defining for me, beyond anything  I'd ever imagined.''   At a time when the farm economy is struggling, it is encouraging to  hear such enthusiasm for a new potential cash crop.   Another farmer from Marion County wrote and asked Congress to  ``continue your efforts until we can grow, research, and market this  crop freely without undue restriction. We have barely scratched the  surface of the countless benefits that come from this plant.''   Hemp will be a bright spot for our future. It is full of economic  potential in Kentucky and the Nation. So we should pass the farm bill  without delay. Let's address farmers' immediate needs. Let's give them  new tools to help secure their future. Let's get Washington out of the  way in the cases where outdated policies are holding them back.   The bill before us is a prime example of the good that can come when  we work together. I look forward to the Senate passing it for  Kentucky's farm families. So let's continue our work to get it done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have been discussing how  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is creating breathing room in family budgets.  Yesterday I focused on the tax cuts themselves. Lower rates, a doubled  standard deduction, a bigger child tax credit add up to serious savings  for middle-class families.   Today I want to discuss the permanent pay raises, bonuses, and new  benefits that tax reform has enabled U.S. businesses to provide for  their workers. Remember, this is exactly what our Democratic colleagues  insisted tax reform would not--would not--bring about. To quote my  friend, the Democratic leader, right here on the Senate floor in  December: ``There is nothing about this tax bill that is suited to the  needs of the American worker.''   Well, Republicans knew better. We listened to the economists who  explained in an open letter that ``the question isn't whether workers  will be helped by a corporate tax rate reduction--it's how much'' they  will be helped.   The reason is simple. American workers can only thrive if the  American businesses that employ them are given the tools to compete and  win on the world stage. Here is what they need to compete: a 21st  century tax code.   Most economists agree that the real impact of tax reform on workers'  wages is a long-term proposition. The wage gains will roll in over the  months and years ahead, but it is remarkable how quickly a number of  American businesses made immediate investments in their workers.   At Charter Communications, which employs 95,000 people Nationwide,  the base wage has already risen to $15 per hour because of tax reform.   Beginning in April, CVS implemented a new, fully paid parental leave  program for full-time employees because of tax reform.   Educational opportunities are expanding for nearly 400,000 McDonald's  employees across the country, after tax reform allowed the company to  ramp up tuition assistance.   Tax reform has enabled LHC Group, a major healthcare employer with  more than 50 locations and 3,600 employees in Kentucky alone, to expand  raises for its employees and to grow the 401(k) options the company  sponsors.   Workers at businesses of every shape and size are being helped all  across our country: bonuses at a grain merchandiser in Chester, MT; a  quarter-million-dollar expansion plan that creates 20 new jobs at a  roofing company in Massillon, OH. It appears tax reform is very well- suited to the needs of American workers after all.   It is well-suited to the needs of hard-working parents who pocketed  thousand-dollar bonuses to help with grocery bills and summer camp  costs. It is well-suited to the needs of young Americans on the first  rungs of the economic ladder, whose employer can now offer more help  with continuing education.   This might come as a surprise to our Democratic friends who opposed  tax reform at every turn. It certainly doesn't surprise those of us who  fought for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I call up the Thune amendment No. 3134.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just a few moments ago, Justice Anthony  Kennedy announced that he is retiring as an Associate Justice of the  U.S. Supreme Court and taking senior status, effective July 31.   First and foremost, I want to pause and express our gratitude for the  extraordinary service that Justice Kennedy has offered our Nation. He  has served on the Federal bench for 43 years.   In particular, we owe him a debt of thanks for his ardent defense of  the  [[Page S4483]]  First Amendment right to political speech. As Justice Kennedy concludes  his tenure on the Court, we wish him, his wife, Mary, and their family  every happiness in the years ahead.   The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by  offering advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this  vacancy. We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall.  As in the case of Justice Gorsuch, Senators will have the opportunity  to meet with President Trump's nominee, examine his or her  qualifications, and debate the nomination.   I have every confidence in Chairman Grassley's conduct of the  upcoming confirmation process in the Judiciary Committee. It is  imperative that the President's nominee be considered fairly and not be  subjected to personal attacks.   Thus far, President Trump's judicial nominations have reflected a  keen understanding of the vital role that judges play in our  constitutional order. Judges must interpret the law fairly and apply it  evenhandedly. Judicial decisions must not flow from judges' personal  philosophies or preferences but from the honest assessment of the words  and actual meaning of the law. This bedrock principle has clearly  defined the President's excellent choices to date, and we will look  forward to yet another outstanding selection.   But, today, the Senate and the Nation thank Justice Kennedy for his  years of service on the bench and for his many contributions to  jurisprudence and to our Nation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  Senate amendment No. 3224.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  H.R. 2.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., June  28; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:09 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 28, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.
