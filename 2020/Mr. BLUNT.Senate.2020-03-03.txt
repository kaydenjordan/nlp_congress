 Mr. President, I want to talk for a few moments about  where we are with the coronavirus response and the supplemental. I  think all Senators will have an opportunity to be updated again today.   This is not a new place for us to be. This time last year, the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies held a hearing on emerging threats, and  at that point we were experiencing the second largest outbreak of Ebola  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, antibiotic resistance was a  global danger, and there was a flu outbreak bigger than we had seen in  a long time. So 1 year later, we are still fighting the Ebola outbreak  in the DRC, antibiotic resistance continues to be a global problem,  and, according to Dr. Tony Fauci, the Director of the National  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the flu we are seeing  this year is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades.   Several thousand Americans die every year from the flu--usually, at  least 35,000, sometimes as high as 75,000. I think about 350,000  Americans have died from the flu in the last decade.   We are now facing a new danger--the COVID-19 danger. That is the new  coronavirus that we hadn't seen before. As we learned with Ebola,  patient zero, who doesn't know they even have this yet, can board a  plane or a cruise ship, and they can be in another country or even in  another continent in a matter of hours. This lesson is, once again,  reinforced.   This is like all other diseases. It doesn't know any boundaries. We  are no longer living in a world where our health can be separated from  the health of other countries. Last week, the number of new coronavirus  infections outside of China outpaced those inside China for the first  time. Maybe the good news is that China is beginning to see something  headed in a different direction, but the bad news is the infections in  Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, and other places. This has moved into  Europe now, and in South America a case was just announced in Brazil.   This is kind of that moment where we have some opportunity to do  everything we can to prepare for the worst, but we still have the  option of hoping for the best. That is what happened with SARS. That is  what happened with H1N1. To some extent, it is what happened with Zika.  It turned out to be bad for the people who had it but not as bad as we  anticipated at one point it might be.   It is disturbing to see the first deaths in the State of Washington,  but, certainly, the message to us is to be more vigilant and be better  prepared.   The Congress, in the last 5 years, has increased money--that doesn't  count whatever we do this week and next week--for preparedness by 44  percent. A year ago, we created for the first time an infectious  disease fund--our colleague in the House,   Tom Cole, was one of the  major proponents of this--to let the Health and Human Services people  have access to money immediately. Because of that, they had $105  million that they wouldn't have previously had to be able to spend  immediately to help contain this problem, where it can be contained, to  bring Americans back here, particularly from China, and to keep them in  a known location for the 14-day incubation period to see if anything  happened. All of that was possible because we had given them the  flexibility that they hadn't had before.   The first-line-of-defense funding has been there. We are now moving  toward a conclusion of what we can do to make more money available for  a vaccine. A vaccine takes a while. We are not going to have a vaccine  for a while. We are going to be continuing to talk to Dr. Fauci and his  team about this. We are working with experts at what is called BARDA,  or the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, to move  those vaccines quickly. But even if we had a vaccine in 18 months, that  would be the U.S. world record to develop a vaccine here with the  safety that we would think it would need to have so that anybody could  take a vaccine and, with that vaccine, this particular virus would  likely be dealt with.   So there is no treatment right now. There is no cure right now. The  treatment is to handle these issues in the way that we can in a public  health system that has been built over decades. There are 50 States and  the District of Columbia, and all have local public health providers.  We are going to have new money available to work with them, but, again,  the preparedness money that they have had for the last 5 years should  have been used in a way--and I believe was used in a way--that gets  them all more ready to deal with this than they otherwise would have  been.   We need to continue so that the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention have what they need to improve the surveillance systems, the  testing systems. I think we are going to find quickly that there will  be a test that will be approved by the FDA that allows people to check,  in a number of locations, and have that process in a number of  locations that tests to see if, in fact, you have what you thought was  a worse-than-usual cold--or maybe you thought it was a not-worse-than- usual cold. Sometimes this particular disease doesn't evidence that  much happened at all. Because of that, I think there is  [[Page S1280]]  probably, at this point, a bigger number of people who we think would  be a percentage of people who would have really negative consequences-- even death--from this disease, rather than all the people who had it  and didn't know they had it.   We have learned in the past, through outbreaks of a flu strain that  we didn't have a vaccine for, of Ebola, of Zika, that what we do to  protect people in other countries winds up protecting people here. We  have to be sure that we understand that a lot of our fate in this has  been determined and will continue to be determined by what we do to  first try to contain this virus and, secondly, to provide the money to  be sure that, when we do have an outbreak, which has already begun in  our country, it is an outbreak that is really held at the lowest  possible level of people impacted and, if you are infected by this  disease, that you have the ability to work from home, to do other  things. The hospital is not always the place to go.   We are working with State and local health officials right now to see  that that happens. The money that has been used, I think, has been used  effectively. Clearly, we are trying to agree--between the House and the  Senate and the administration--to exactly the right number. I would say  that, at this point, the administration has been the most agreeable to  whatever money we want to provide but, obviously, would like to have  that money provided quickly.   I feel confident we are going to have the resources to deal with  this. I feel confident that this will be a problem that will not impact  more people than would usually be impacted by something like the flu.  Again, we need to prepare for the very worst and hope for the very  best, but our job right now is to prepare for the worst things that  could happen and have the funding available so that we don't have to go  through a couple of weeks again where an easy determination should have  been reached.   One thing we could have done is to have given the administration  exactly the amount of money they asked for--we could have decided to  spend it differently--2 weeks ago and then get into a discussion of  what we need next. That is not the course we decided to go down.   We are trying to come up with an amount of money, it appears, that  would get us through this entire incident with this virus, but it is  time to get that done. Hopefully, we will see a bill filed later today  and the House able to vote on that bill before they leave this week.  Once that number is done, I think it will be seen as almost certain  that the Senate will be able to deal with that bill and approve that  number.   We are going to move forward. I think, again, we are going to move  forward in a way that minimizes, as much as possible, the impact that  this has on families and on individuals.   Mr. President, I look forward to you and I both having a chance to  learn more about this even today and to learn more as we move forward.  The big thing we need to learn now is the amount of money we need to  have to spend and how we allocate that money for a vaccine and other  things.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess under the previous order.
