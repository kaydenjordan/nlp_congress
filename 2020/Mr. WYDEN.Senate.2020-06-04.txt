 Madam President, before Senator Cardin leaves the floor, I  want to tell my colleague and friend on the Finance Committee that it  has been a pleasure to team up with him to try to deal with these  challenges in terms of getting the help out to small business people.  We know that it has been needlessly challenging, looking back at the  experience. I am just glad my colleague is going to prosecute the case  until there is justice for these small businesses
