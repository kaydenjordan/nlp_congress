 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21.   If the beautiful, wonderful Marvin Gaye were with us today, he would  say, ``What's going on?'' much more beautifully than I could say it.   This is what is going on: This legislation is bad policy that will  severely increase the price of gas at the pump, destroy our  environment, and pollute and poison the air that our children and  grandchildren deserve to breathe. It will only help the rich get  richer.    This bill could require the U.S. to open up over 300 million acres of  Federal lands for new oil and gas drilling. To put that into scale,  that is three times the size of the State of California.   Rather than curbing our dependence on fossil fuels and making America  more energy independent, my Republican colleagues are pushing  legislation that will only increase our resilience on fossil fuels.  This bill is incredibly foolish and does nothing to address the real  problems.   What are they really up to? They want to put money into the pockets  of Big Oil executives while taking it out of the pockets of everyday  Americans.   So, I ask, what is the true intention of this legislation? Who does  this help? Well, I just told you. It helps Big Oil and hurts everyday  Americans because I know for damn sure it doesn't help the working  families across our great country.   I remind my colleagues and all of us that we were elected to come  here to this body to represent all Americans, not just special  interests.   Your bill will only line the pockets of your fossil fuel friends  while making gas more expensive for everyday Americans.   This bill is shameful. It fails our children and grandchildren, and  it fails to protect the American people.
