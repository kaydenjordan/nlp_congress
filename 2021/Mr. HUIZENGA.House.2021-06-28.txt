 Madam Speaker, I rise today with an opportunity for  this body and the United States Congress to save lives.   The Hyde amendment has been an essential safeguard that has defended  the unborn and protected millions of lives for more than 40 years. A  recent estimate credits the Hyde amendment with saving more than 2.4  million precious and innocent lives.   Historically, measures which prevent taxpayer dollars from being used  to perform abortions have garnered strong bipartisan support. In fact,  President Biden was a vocal supporter of the Hyde amendment during his  decades of service in the U.S. Senate.   However, it is clear that Democrats in Washington have changed their  mind, as they have recently made it their mission to eliminate these  longstanding protections and force families in west Michigan and across  the Nation to violate their deeply held beliefs by funding abortions on  demand with their hard-earned tax dollars.   I believe, as millions of Michiganders and those across America  believe, we must embrace a culture that protects the values of life.  Using taxpayer dollars to end the lives of innocent children is wrong.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
