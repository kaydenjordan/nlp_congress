 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate today's passage of the  fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.   In addition to making critical investments in our military, this  legislation takes significant steps to protect the United States from  CCP spying.   For 16 years, a CCP-owned logistics platform called LOGINK has  tracked our commercial and military ships. This NDAA deters CCP  aggression by enacting my plan to ban the DOD's use of LOGINK and  working with our partners to ban it, too.   The CCP is spying on American citizens across every industry, field,  and institution. Congress must act to shore up vulnerabilities to the  CCP, especially when it comes to our military and commercial supply  chains. This NDAA does just that.   That is why I was proud to support it and why I urge all of our  Senate colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
