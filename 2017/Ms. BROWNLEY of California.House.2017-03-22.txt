 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Washington.   Mr. Speaker, after 7 years of demanding repeal and replace, the very  best that the GOP could do was to put forward a bill to eliminate  health care for 24 million Americans. Under TrumpCare, over 44,000  residents in my district will lose health care completely.                                time  1645    I want to talk about a different population that we don't address as  often. Many of these residents are veterans and their families.   Paralyzed Veterans of America today reminded me that today many vets  rely on Medicaid for their health care. TrumpCare undermines the safety  net for our veterans and their dependents and their caregivers.   According to PVA, the total number of veterans without insurance  dropped very sharply in recent years, yet TrumpCare cuts more than $800  billion from the Medicaid program, which many veterans and our military  families turn to for care. Worse, in their rush to rip health insurance  away from tens of millions of Americans, the manager's amendment to  TrumpCare could deny tax credits to millions of military veterans.   Mr. Speaker, veterans are among those that TrumpCare would hurt.  There are thousands of veterans in my district and thousands of  veterans in every district across our great country.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should think long and  hard before they take this critical, lifesaving care away from those  who need it most: our veterans who have served our country so bravely  and so patriotically and whom we have made a solemn promise to.
