 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to honor the life of  Henrico County Police Officer Trey Marshall Sutton.   Officer Sutton was described as kind, confident, and someone who  devoted his life to others.   Originally from Chesterfield County, Officer Sutton graduated from  the police academy earlier this year, and he was training to serve in  the Henrico County PD's patrol bureau. He was also soon to be married.   Last week, Officer Sutton's life was cut tragically short in a car  crash during field training. In an instant, Virginia lost one of our  best, someone who demonstrated both bravery and compassion through his  actions.   We will remember Officer Sutton for his service to our community. We  will remember his commitment to our Commonwealth. And we will remember  his story as one of purpose and inspiration for our country.   In the words of the ``Hero's Welcome'': ``And through your selfless  actions, others will hear the call.''   My prayers are with Officer Sutton's fellow officers in the Henrico  County Police Department, his classmates at the academy, his fiance,  Zoe, and all of his loved ones.   Please join me in honoring the life of Officer Trey Marshall Sutton.                            ____________________
