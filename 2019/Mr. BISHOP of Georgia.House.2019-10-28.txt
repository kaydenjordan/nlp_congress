 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  remove my name as a cosponsor for H.R. 3495.    Mr. Speaker, I am very saddened to hear  Congressman Conyers passed away. He was a champion for racial equality  and changed Congress for the better by co-founding the Congressional  Black Caucus. John was a powerful and effective legislator who never  stopped fighting to improve our nation, which he served longer than any  other black Member of Congress to date. His career helped pave the way  for the thriving Black Caucus we now enjoy.   John lived through many pivotal moments in our nation's history. When  Rosa Parks struggled to find a job after her historic protest, John  rushed to hire her. She worked in his district office for 23 years  until her retirement. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was  assassinated, John began to fight for a holiday to honor him 4 days  after Dr. King's death.   It took him 15 long years, but John kept pushing to honor King's  memory and the battle for civil rights.   Vivian and I send our condolences to his wife, children, and all  loved ones as we keep them in our prayers in this difficult time.
