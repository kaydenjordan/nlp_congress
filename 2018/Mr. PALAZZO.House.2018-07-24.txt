 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   We are 1 week away from July 31--that is 7 days--which means the  deadline to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program is nearing  very fast.   I would like to thank Mr. MacArthur for understanding the importance  of avoiding a lapse in the NFIP  [[Page H7129]]  program and for introducing legislation that will continue coverage for  millions of policyholders.   We know that flooding always has been and will continue to be the  most costly natural phenomenon humanity faces.   I support this amendment to extend the National Flood Insurance  Program through the end of the 2018 hurricane season and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Policyholders who rely on the program to insure their homes from  flooding should not be caught in limbo while Congress works on coming  together in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the program.   While I, along with many of my colleagues, support reform in the  program, the time to enact bipartisan reforms is gone for now. We have  to take immediate action. If the NFIP lapses, policyholders will not  have the opportunity to renew their policies and tens of thousands of  home sale closings would be negatively impacted by a program lapse. We  are in the middle of the 2018 hurricane season, and a major disruption  in the program will be detrimental to homeowners in every corner of the  United States.   It is our duty to ensure that flood insurance remains affordable and  available to our constituents. Since 1968, this program has helped  protect against flooding. Since its inception, the NFIP has saved the  government billions of dollars.   We are providing our constituents with certainty by supporting this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to extend the NFIP  through the end of the 2018 hurricane season.
