 Mr. President, I would like to recognize and  congratulate the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee on their 50th  anniversary. Agriculture is Montana's No. 1 economic driver, and wheat  and barley are the principal grain crops produced in Montana.  Established in 1967, the committee works to promote Montana wheat and  barley producers, help identify and open markets both at home and  abroad, and advance research that helps with crop quality and  production. The severe drought and low commodity prices that Montana  farmers have faced over the course of the past year have highlighted  the importance of these efforts, and I thank all the directors,  members, and staff for their years of dedication.                            ____________________
