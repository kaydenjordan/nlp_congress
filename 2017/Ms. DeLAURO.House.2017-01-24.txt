 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  rule. This is about a woman's fundamental right to make her own family  planning decisions. The courts have spoken: Roe v. Wade is settled law,  and a majority of Americans support it. But the Majority would rather  roll back the clock by decades, forcing women back into a reality when  women could not make their own health care decisions, by restricting  insurance coverage. Enough is enough.   We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family,  every American to make their own family planning decisions, and to have  access to a full range of healthcare services.   What we are facing now is not just an attack on the right to  abortion. It is not just an attack on women's health. It is an assault  on the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans. On Saturday,  millions of people across the country marched in support of an agenda  that puts women's health decisions in the hands of women and their  families--and that ensures safe and affordable access to women's  healthcare. This bill flies in the face of the mandate demonstrated  this weekend, and I oppose it.
