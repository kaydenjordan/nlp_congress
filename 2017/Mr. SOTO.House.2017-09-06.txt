 Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Juan, who obtained a  master's degree from our Florida State University and works in digital  advocacy.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Brownley) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1190, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $48,000,000)''.        Page 1190, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $48,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Soto) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase funding for the  Small Starts program by $48 million. This is the amount that SunRail, a  constituent passenger train system in my district, would need to begin  phase 3 of construction. Phase 3 would connect the commuter rail system  to the Orlando International Airport.   Currently, the Orlando Intermodal Terminal is under construction at  the airport that would connect two transportation systems, both  Brightline and SunRail, which were only really divided by a few miles,  and Federal funding will eventually be key to connect this intermodal  system and SunRail.   Central Florida needs to be more mobile, and I urge in the future  that we look as we go forward with phase 3, and stand ready to help.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and I withdraw my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.                   Amendment No. 37 Offered by Mr. Carbajal    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
