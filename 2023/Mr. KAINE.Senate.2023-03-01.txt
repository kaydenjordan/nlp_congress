 Madam President, today I am introducing the Military  Spouse Hiring Act with my colleagues Senators Boozman, Hassan, Rounds,  and 17 of our colleagues. Enacting this bill would improve financial  stability for Blue Star families across the country.   The families of America's servicemembers make sacrifices that often  go unrecognized. Among them is packing up and moving frequently, with  military spouses regularly having to leave stable employment to move to  a new area and start over. This is compounded by the complex system of  State licensing and certification requirements, which can prevent these  spouses from taking jobs that utilize their expertise and experience.  Because of this, military spouses have unemployment rates substantially  higher than the national average, and they are often underemployed when  they do have jobs. Adding to the financial struggles caused by frequent  periods of unemployment and underemployment, the rising cost of  childcare puts a substantial burden on many military families.   The Military Spouse Hiring Act would help these families by making  military spouses an eligible population for the work opportunity tax  credit. This tax credit has proven effective in improving employment  prospects for other groups. Extending it to military spouses would help  them find employment more easily after moving to new areas.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill to help families who have  made the greatest sacrifice for our Nation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Baldwin, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cassidy, Ms. Cortez          Masto, Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Hassan, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Hickenlooper,          Mr. King, Mr. Markey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Murphy,          Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Smith,          Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 597. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal  the Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to  the Committee on Finance.
