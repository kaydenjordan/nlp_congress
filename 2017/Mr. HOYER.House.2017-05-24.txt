 Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Trump laid out his budget  request for next year. It represents the most draconian disinvestment  in our country by any President in modern history, and it is littered  with broken promises and fundamental errors in simple math.   It is a budget that makes very clear that this President is not  fighting for working Americans and their families, and, in fact, he is  breaking his promises to make their lives better. It is shockingly  devoid of the basic policy details necessary to back up its deficit- cutting bravado. It includes an accounting discrepancy so large--over  $2 trillion--that it can only be characterized as willfully hiding the  ball from the American public, an exercise in extreme incompetence, or  both.   The purpose of a budget is to lay out the most complete description  of a President's governing vision for the country. By that measure and  many others, this budget is an embarrassment. It is no wonder that it  has already been panned by Members on both sides of the aisle in this  House. My Republican friend, Representative Mike Simpson, was  absolutely right when he said of proposals like this one that the House  can't pass this budget. Nor will it. It is dead on arrival in Congress  because Democrats and Republicans both understand that we can't provide  economic security to the American people and keep them safe from  threats if we gut our investments in doing both. That is what the  President's budget would do.   As The Washington Post eloquently pointed out, the Trump budget ``is  fundamentally at odds with what Trump told voters.'' President Trump  promised middle class American workers he would fight for them and  their families. If implemented, his budget would make it harder for  them to send their kids to college, access job training to get ahead,  or even just stay in the middle class, and devastate seniors' long-term  care. The dramatic cuts he makes to nutrition assistance, elimination  of heating assistance during the winter months and Meals on Wheels will  hit low-income Americans and seniors hard, particularly in rural  communities.   And those, Mr. Speaker, are just a selection. He is breaking his  campaign promise not to cut Medicaid and Social Security, taking $1.4  trillion out of Medicaid over the next 10 years, without offering a  policy to achieve those cuts, and slashing funds for the  Social Security disability insurance programs that serve 10 million  Americans. Frankly, the President made fun of those with disabilities  during the course of the campaign, and now he cuts billions of dollars  from the ability of the disabled to maintain some degree of dignity and  health.    President Trump also pledged that the American taxpayer would not  pay--would not pay--for the border wall he wants to build. Of course,  his budget asks the U.S. taxpayer to pay for that wall. When it comes  to keeping Americans safe from threats overseas, President Trump's  budget fails miserably as well, cutting the budgets for diplomacy and  foreign aid that complement the work of our military in combating ISIS  and other terror groups. Additionally, it punishes middle class Federal  employees in every congressional district in our country for choosing  to serve their country by cutting their pay and retirement benefits.   One after another, the budget breaks the President's promises. At  every turn, it undermines our long-term security and prosperity by  ignoring the critical lessons from past Republican administrations when  it comes to basic economics. Like past Republican budgets, the Trump  budget relies on discredited theories of how economic growth would  result from tax policies. Unlike past attempts, however, the Trump  budget double counts its fantasy supply side boost in an accounting  error so large it could pay for the Pentagon 3 years over.   Mr. Speaker, we know this budget will go nowhere in Congress. I  believe there will not be a Republican in the House of Representatives,  Mr. Speaker,  [[Page H4509]]  who will offer this budget on the floor of this House. It does tell us,  however, a lot about this President and his priorities. Former Vice  President Biden has been known to say: ``Don't tell me what you value.  Show me your budget.''   President Trump has now shown us his budget, and none of us should be  surprised. So now it is up to Democrats and Republicans in this House  and in the Senate to work together to agree on a budget resolution and  move appropriations bills through regular order. Let us hope we can do  that. The American public would expect us to do that, and our country  needs us to do that.   We must not disinvest in those things that have made America great  and will enable us to lay the groundwork for another century of  American leadership.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a young man in my district  was killed in what appears to be a vicious crime, probably motivated by  hate.   U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Richard W. Collins, III, was just days  away from graduating from Bowie State University. Richard stood on the  threshold of what promised to be a life of service to his country.   He has been remembered by family and friends as a kind soul, an  angel, and a national treasure.   All of us across Maryland were shocked and devastated when we learned  of the attack that took his life--an unprovoked attack at a bus station  waiting for an Uber to pick him up. An individual came along and asked  him to step left--whatever that meant. He said: ``No, I won't.'' And he  was stabbed in the chest.   We were deeply alarmed to learn that the suspect in Richard's murder  belonged to an alleged online White supremacist group. Richard was  African American. Richard's murderer must be held to account under the  full weight of our laws, and, hopefully, he will be.   His life is a reminder of everything that makes our Nation  extraordinary. His death is a painful reminder that our work in  overcoming hatred in this country is far from over.   I have been keeping Richard's parents and family in my thoughts and  in my prayers this week, and I will continue to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I rise with a very heavy heart to mourn the loss of a  young man in my district who was killed over the weekend in a possible  hate-crime. U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III was just  days away from graduating from Bowie State University College of  Business when he was stabbed by an assailant while waiting at a bus  stop in College Park on the campus of the University of Maryland. He  was there to visit friends and celebrate his having been commissioned  as an officer in the Army just two days earlier.   At age twenty-three, Richard stood on the threshold of what promised  to be an exciting life of service to his country, and the Army was  fortunate to have such a driven and talented young person so eager to  be a part of defending our nation. Richard represented the best of the  Fifth District, the best of Maryland, and the best of America. All of  us across the region were shocked and devastated when we learned of the  attack that took his life. We were deeply dismayed as well to learn  that the suspect in Richard's murder belonged to an alleged online  white supremacist group with references in its name to Nazism and to  the so-called `Alt-Right' movement that espouses xenophobia and racial  hatred. The FBI is now investigating, and Richard's murderer must be  held to account under the full weight of our laws.   In viewing this tragedy, it is easy to get caught up in the details  of who perpetrated the crime and why. But the real story I wish to  share with my colleagues is Richard's story. The story of a young man  who was so proud to put on his Army uniform and had diligently drilled  as a member of the ROTC in college. He has been remembered by family  and friends as a `kind soul,' an `angel,' and `a national treasure.'  The loss of this outstanding young Marylander and young American  diminishes us all.   I have been keeping Richard's parents and extended family in my  thoughts and in my prayers these past few days, and I will surely  continue to be inspired by his memory for a long time to come. His life  is a reminder of everything that makes our nation extraordinary His  death is a painful reminder that the work of banishing hatred from our  midst is far from over and will require each and every one of us to  share in the task. May God bless the memory of Second Lieutenant  Richard W Collins III and watch over his family and his community in  this hour of their grief.                            ____________________
