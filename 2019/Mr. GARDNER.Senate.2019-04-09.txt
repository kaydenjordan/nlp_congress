 Mr. President, I have two unanimous consent requests.   I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived.    And I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to  complete my remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in support  of Dan Domenico, the district judge we will be voting on shortly.   I strongly support Dan Domenico for the district court position in  the District of Colorado. Dan has impeccable academic and legal  credentials. A native Coloradan, he is well known and well respected  throughout the entire Colorado legal community. These characteristics  make him very well suited to be on the bench.   A native of Boulder, CO, Dan received his undergraduate degree from  Georgetown University and his juris doctorate from the University of  Virginia--it has been a good week for the University of Virginia: a new  Federal judge and a national championship--where he graduated order of  the coif and was the editor of the law review.   After law school, Dan joined the respected firm of Hogan & Hartson  and then clerked for Judge Tim Tymkovich, who is now the chief judge on  the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Following his clerkship, Dan continued his public service as a  Special Assistant to the Solicitor in the U.S. Department of the  Interior. There, he advised the Secretary and the Department on matters  related to national parks, fish and wildlife, Bureau of Land Management  issues, and Indian affairs. These are all areas that matter a great  deal to Colorado and the West.   Dan was then appointed to be the solicitor general for the State of  Colorado. While he was the youngest person tapped for the position, he  then became the longest serving solicitor general in our State's  history, holding the position for 9 years. As solicitor general, Dan  represented the State in both State and Federal courts, including the  U.S. Supreme Court. He oversaw all major litigation for the State, and  he provided legal advice to the Governor and State agencies.   Dan is currently the founding and managing partner at the Kittredge  LLC, where he represents clients in high-stakes, complex litigation and  appeals. He is an adjunct professor at the University of Denver's  College of Law, where he teaches courses in natural resources law and  constitutional law.   As impressive as this background is, it is also an insight into the  type of judge Dan would be. I am particularly struck by Dan's service  as the Colorado solicitor general.   While the Democratic leader may object to Dan Domenico, two  Democratic Governors in Colorado did not. In fact, they kept his  service. In fact, Dan served as solicitor general for the State of  Colorado during one Republican Governor and two Democratic Governors.  He served, regardless of party, with competence and zeal. That is what  the Colorado legal community would tell anyone who wishes to listen.  His approach to the legal issues he confronted was the same regardless  of the party in power. He looked to the law. And that is what we expect  in every judge. That is what Colorado wants. That is what our country  needs. We need experienced practitioners who are respected by their  peers and who will faithfully apply the law regardless of politics or  place in life. That is what I believe Dan will do, and that is why I  enthusiastically support his nomination and hope my colleagues will  follow suit as well.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
