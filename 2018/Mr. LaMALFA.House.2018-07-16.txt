 Mr. Speaker, the USA has approximately 121 sites around  the country that are storing nuclear waste in approximately 39 States.  They are in temporary facilities, temporary storage that could be  subject to all sorts of problems, whether it be terrorist attack or  other issues with nature.   I had the chance recently to visit Yucca Mountain, the facility in  Nevada that would be the repository for nuclear waste, if it could be  approved and put in place.   I was impressed with what I saw for many key issues. Seismic activity  is very low in the area, if any. We have an issue where it could be a  very hardened site for attack. It would be very difficult to attack it.  And the issues with groundwater are nil, since groundwater is so deep  in the Nevada desert, well below the areas proposed.   We need to do something about this situation with nuclear waste being  stored temporarily the way it is or with moving forward with a project  like Yucca Mountain, which is the only one approved in the United  States currently under the law.   Mr. Speaker, further delay means further peril for the way this stuff  is being stored currently. We need to move forward on this.                            ____________________
