 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of a member of my  district staff, Kate Irwin, who passed away this morning following a  long and courageous battle with cancer.   While she was taken far too soon, I feel so lucky that she was part  of my team and part of our lives. Kate was the ultimate public servant.   If she was meeting with the Navy about issues of national security,  she had a smile on her face.   If she was serving food to folks who were down on their luck at the  Salvation Army, she had a smile on her face.   If she was visiting a local high school and getting to try out a  flight simulator, Kate had a really big smile on her face.   She looked at every day that she got to serve the people of  Washington's Sixth Congressional District as a blessing because she  knew that every day on this Earth was one as well.   When I interviewed Kate for a job on my team, she memorably said: ``I  will work harder and will care more than anyone you'll ever meet.'' And  every day that she came into work, every time she staffed an event,  every time she followed up with a constituent in need, she showed that  extraordinary commitment, even in the face of impossible circumstances.   Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my condolences to Kate's amazing  family, and I want to thank them for sharing such an extraordinary  young woman with us.   You are in our prayers.                            ____________________
