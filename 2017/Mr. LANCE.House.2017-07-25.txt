 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  sanctions bill. The governments of Iran, North Korea, and Russia do not  share American values or interests and are active threats to our  national security. These regimes will see a united message from the  Congress of the United States with an overwhelming vote in favor of  strong sanctions.   Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea,  the most dangerous and isolated place on Earth, has tested long-range  missiles demonstrating a frightening potential to target our West  Coast. Russia has intolerably involved itself in our Nation's  democratic electoral process. Its invasion of Crimea and actions in  Ukraine are totally unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, let us act decisively today and put these states on  notice: violate international law by threatening the United States and  thereby face the consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
