 Mr. President, Republicans continue to come to the  floor to talk about the urgent need that we have to reform America's  healthcare system. The reason we continue to do this is because the  pain of ObamaCare is getting worse.   We are seeing it all across the country. The healthcare system in  this country has been devastated by a law known as ObamaCare. Every  weekend, at home, I hear, as Republicans all around the country hear,  about the costs that have been spiraling out of control--double on the  ObamaCare exchange, we hear across the country, but in many States even  more than that.   In Wyoming it has gone up 107 percent over the past 4 years. We also  hear from people at home about their specific premiums on the exchange  and how they are worried about them going up even higher next year. Not  only have they doubled, but they are worried about them going up again.  Just this past week, we have heard stories about numbers that have been  requested for increases in New Hampshire, New York, and Maine. We are  hearing it all across the country. I hear it every weekend in Wyoming.   People are very concerned about the impact that ObamaCare has had on  their lives personally. Many will tell you that they believe that the  insurance they bought under ObamaCare has been of less value than they  would have liked, and many people are not buying because they see that  the value is not there.   When we hear about these increasing rates and we hear about the fact  that it is going to only get worse, people are saying: The cost has  gone up; maybe we ought to try to shop around, and maybe we can find  more choices.   The problem is the choices are going down as well. Insurance  companies are continuing to drop out of the ObamaCare plan. So people  around the country are having fewer and fewer choices under ObamaCare.   Last Friday, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ``Another  Area Loses Last ACA Insurer.'' It is not just that they have fewer  choices. Now we are looking at places in the country where there are no  choices.   In Wyoming we had two. One of the companies went out of business. We  are down to one. That company has lost money. The question is, How long  will they stay? How much higher will they have to raise rates under  ObamaCare? Will we be at a point where the counties in our State,  instead of having one, have none?   This article in the Wall Street Journal last week says: ``Washington  state has no insurer willing to offer Affordable Care Act plans next  year,'' in some of its 39 counties.   A few days earlier, we heard the news from people in a similar  situation in Ohio. There are 18 counties in Ohio next year with no  plans offered. So with ObamaCare you are going to get a subsidy, but  there is no place to use the subsidy. You have no choices. But we  warned from the beginning about the ObamaCare death spiral, and we are  seeing it happen here. For those people living in those counties in  Ohio and those counties in Washington, the insurance death spiral is  complete. There is no insurance market. There is no one offering to  sell insurance because of the damage done by ObamaCare to the insurance  market in the United States.   We have millions of people across the country who have been harmed by  the higher costs and the fewer and fewer choices available under  ObamaCare. They have lost the coverage they had. Care is not available  to them in the sense that their insurance is not available to them. The  options are shrinking all across the country and have completely gone  away in certain places.   Now, someone who is living with a preexisting condition is so much of  the debate, and I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  come to the floor, talk about preexisting conditions. If you are  someone in any of these counties and you have a preexisting condition  and the company you buy your insurance from goes out of business and  there is no one to sell you insurance in the county in which you live  and you have a preexisting condition, under ObamaCare, you are out of  luck. You may get a subsidy, but you cannot buy a policy. Under  ObamaCare, preexisting conditions are not covered if there is no one  available to sell a policy, and we are seeing more and more counties  falling into that situation.   There was almost a full-page map in the New York Times earlier this  week of the number of counties across the country in which there are  only two insurance companies selling or one or none at all. That is the  problem we have all across the country.   We predicted this. This disaster of ObamaCare was entirely  predictable. Republicans came to the floor as it was being debated, as  it was being discussed, as Democrats were voting on it, and we  continued to point out that we would be in a situation of free fall,  and we are now in that situation with ObamaCare.  [[Page S3481]]    Republicans know what we need to do. We are trying to stabilize the  market. We want to protect people with preexisting conditions. We want  to lower the cost of premiums. We do not want the rug to be pulled out  from anyone, and we are trying to reform Medicaid in a way that  provides long-term stability to that program.   Finally, after all of these years of talking about the problems with  ObamaCare and with so many Democrats having blinders on, wanting to  just apply a blank check to the problem and say: ``More money. More  ObamaCare,'' finally, now some Democrats are saying, yes, that there  are problems with ObamaCare. The problem is that their solution is the  wrong solution.   What they want to do is make the problem even bigger, and we have  seen it in California this past year. Actually, just a week ago, the  California State Senate--and it is a Democratic-controlled Senate-- after calls from people throughout their political party and at their  political convention a couple of weeks ago, said that we know what to  do--single-payer healthcare. That is what they proposed, and it passed  along party lines.   Who is that single payer? It is the American taxpayer. The  Democratic-controlled Senate in California passed a single-payer  healthcare bill. From cradle to grave, everyone is covered. Anything  you need, you have it, says California.   I served in the Wyoming State Legislature--and I served at the  Presiding Officer's level in the legislature--where we did something  called a fiscal note. What is something like this going to cost? They  did the same thing in California. The fiscal note was $400 billion a  year. Put it in perspective. How does that fit into the State budget?  The general fund for the State of California for a year, when they have  just passed a bill for $400 billion, is only $190 billion. The total  cost of what the State Senate of California passed is twice the entire  general fund for the State of California. In other places, when they  have said that they have needed a single-payer plan, as they have done  in Canada and England, what has happened is that it has led to longer  lines, waiting periods, and the rationing of care. That is not what the  American people want, but it is what the Democratic Party is proposing  and actually voted for in the State of California.   This was a headline in the New York Times just the other day, ``The  Single-Payer Party? Democrats Shift Left on Health Care.''   The article goes on to read in terms of the Democrats:         Cast out of power in Washington and most State capitals,       Democrats and activist leaders seeking political redemption       have embraced an unlikely-seeming cause: an actual government       takeover of health care.    This was from the New York Times about what has passed in California  and what Democrats around the country are proposing.   In the U.S. House of Representatives, which is right down the hall of  this building, a majority of the Democrats has cosponsored legislation  to go to a single-payer healthcare plan--for the majority of the  Democrats in the House, a single-payer healthcare plan.   That is not what hard-working Americans want. That is not what  struggling small business owners want. That is not what the people of  Wyoming want. The people at home already cannot afford to pay for the  insurance that has been mandated that they buy under the Obama  healthcare law. They cannot afford the penalties. They cannot afford  the insurance, and they want healthcare--care they need from doctors  they choose at lower costs.   How in the world is this country going to afford higher taxes to pay  for the Democrats' single-payer fantasy? Yet that is what they are  looking at in California. To double the cost of the State's general  fund, you are talking about raising taxes as well as, probably,  eliminating some services. Would you have to eliminate teachers,  firefighters, public safety workers? Those are the things that you have  to wonder about when they make such an irresponsible decision in the  California State Senate.   Ronald Reagan, I think, said it best when he said that you cannot be  for big government and big taxes and a big bureaucracy and still be for  the little guy. Ronald Reagan had it right. Now Washington Democrats  want to ignore that.   Small business owners know what Democrats in Washington, DC, and in  California refuse to acknowledge right now. The small business owners  know it, and the Democrats will not acknowledge it. People around the  country realize ObamaCare is not working. It is why they elected a  Republican House, a Republican Senate, a Republican President--because  of the pain caused to the American people under the Obama healthcare  law, which mandated that everybody buy a government-approved product.  The costs have gone up, and the choices have gone down. People have  been left in a state in which this is not what works for them.   So here we are. We are on the cusp of coming out with a Republican  plan. We are trying to do it with our legislation. We are writing a  reform plan to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to insurance  without the mandates and the restrictions we have seen under the Obama  healthcare law.   I think Democrats should join us in finding the best solutions for  the American people. The time to act is now because we see that, from  week to week, more of those who sell insurance are pulling out. People  with preexisting conditions who lose their coverage will have nowhere  to turn under ObamaCare. We continue to fight for our patients. As a  doctor, I know what patients need, and it is the care they need from  doctors they choose at lower costs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
