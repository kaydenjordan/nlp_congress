 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition.    Madam Speaker, as terrifying as today was here in the  people's House, it was, thankfully, fairly short in duration. In  contrast, the pain and fear that so many Americans are experiencing  this year has been long and continuous to this very moment.   Rather than pitting Americans against Americans, as we are here, we  should be working to ensure rapid distribution of vaccines and adequate  relief to Americans who are struggling economically because of this  horrific pandemic. But we are not doing that. Instead, we have  witnessed a stunning assault on our democracy itself.   This challenge is not an act of patriotism. The position of the  objectors is completely incompatible with patriotism.   Our country is defined by her great people, and our democracy is  defined above all else by our Constitution, a Constitution that these  individuals want to ignore because they have decided that their  judgment, the judgment of a small minority of partisan elites, should  somehow override that of the more than 155 million Americans who  participated in this election. That, my friends, is not democracy.                                time  0100    We should all remember this country's founding was a rejection of  monarchy, a rejection of the notion that any one person could be all- powerful. Our commitment to self-determination is what gave rise to our  Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. It is why our  Founders made the choice to build a country anchored in respect for the  rule of law rather than one tied to the whims of men. It is why we have  free and fair elections that allow us to vote out those who hold  office.   I am proud to join the vast majority of my colleagues in both  Chambers, Republicans and Democrats alike, in making it clear that our  democracy is bigger than any of us.   Let's be clear: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won a victory of 306  electoral votes in the electoral college, the same margin that  President Trump won by in 2016 when he called it a landslide.   Nearly 7 million of my fellow Pennsylvanians braved this devastating  pandemic and economic crisis to cast their ballots, culminating in a  total turnout of more than 70 percent, the highest in the history of  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And nationwide, we saw record- breaking turnout.   Both in Pennsylvania and nationally, the President's efforts to  overturn the election results in the courts failed resoundingly, with  many of the strongest rebukes coming from judges the President himself  appointed.   In fact, contrary to the assertion of my colleague from Georgia  across the aisle, not a single lawsuit in Pennsylvania alleged fraud.  The gentlewoman may not be aware of this, but allegations of fraud  require specificity and detail, and no lawyer could risk his or her  license to make such false claims.   I am heartened that several of the country's leading Republicans,  including Senate Republican Majority Leader McConnell, Senator Mitt  Romney, and former Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have  spoken out against this political stunt.   Senator Romney said: ``The egregious ploy to reject electors may  enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our  democratic Republic.''   And as former Republican Representative Charlie Dent from my district  said, the claim by the President of voter fraud in our State ``was  simply reprehensible; the truth is that he suppressed his own vote by  discouraging mail-in voting.''   And as Pennsylvania State Senator Gene Yaw, also a Republican, has  said: ``My question is, if the mail-in voting of Act 77 was so bad, why  did The Trump Organization send out a mail-in ballot application to  every registered Republican in the State?''   Today, I am thinking of all of the people who took the time to do  their civic duty and vote, many standing in long lines or painstakingly  researching how to vote by mail correctly.   We reject these disgraceful attacks on the voters of Pennsylvania and  this attempt to throw out their votes.   To those in this Chamber who may cynically believe that stoking the  forces of disinformation and division may be worth a short-term benefit  to their political careers, I would urge serious self-reflection.   Our democracy is one of the most precious resources of the American  people, protected against enormous odds and at great sacrifice by each  generation of servicemembers and everyday citizens who put their lives  on the line to build a freer and more equitable nation. They deserve  better than what is happening in this Chamber today.
