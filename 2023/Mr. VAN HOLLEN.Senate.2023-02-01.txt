 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me begin with a simple statement  which I hope every Senator in this body agrees with: that the United  States of America pays its bills on time.   We have since our Nation was founded. We never default on our debts.  We always pay what we owe. We honor our financial obligations to all  Americans and all those who invest in the American economy. And because  we pay our bills on time, the United States has earned a reputation as  a reliable, credible, and trustworthy partner around  [[Page S190]]  the world, and that helps every single American and our entire economy.   Now, as everybody in this Chamber knows, in order to maintain the  full faith and credit of the United States, we have to raise the debt  ceiling. And this is not about new spending. This is about paying the  bills that are already due and already owing under the laws that we  have already passed in this country and that have already been signed  by Presidents of both parties.   When Donald Trump was President of the United States, Republicans  voted with Democrats to raise the debt limit three times, and the U.S.  Congress has raised the debt limit a total of 78 times since 1960,  under both Democratic and Republican Presidents.   If the Government of the United States had failed to raise the debt  ceiling in the past, we would have faced an economic catastrophe. Think  about it this way: You wouldn't just wake up one day and decide not to  make your mortgage payment or not to make your car payment. You pay  what you owe. It is as simple as that.   And you know that, if you were to wake up one morning and say that  you are not paying your mortgage or you are not paying your car  payment, you will face consequences. If you don't pay your mortgage,  you could have your home foreclosed on. If you don't pay your car  payments, your car can be repossessed.   The same logic applies to the U.S. Government, but the consequences  are not confined to just one individual or one homeowner or one car  owner. If the United States fails to pay its bills on time, every  American--everyone inside this room and everyone outside this room-- will suffer the consequences. We are not talking about risking  foreclosure on one house or losing one car. We are talking about the  economy of our country grinding to a halt. If the United States stops  paying our bills, our economy takes a nose dive. It is as simple as  that.   When I talk to my colleagues here on the Senate floor, both  Republicans and Democrats, they agree that it is a no-brainer. You pay  what you owe. You raise the debt ceiling. You don't default. It is  common sense.   In fact, I was listening just the other day to Republican leader  Senator McConnell, who said:         America must never default on its debt.    He said that a few days ago. I agree.   But across and on the other side of the Capitol, in the House of  Representatives, Speaker McCarthy and the new majority, composed of  some very rightwing and extreme Members, are taking their orders from  former President Donald Trump, the same Donald Trump who as President  signed three debt limit increases into law. Now he wants Republicans to  use the debt limit as a club against President Biden.   House Republicans are stalling our efforts right now to pay our bills  on time, even though they know--just as Senator McConnell knows, just  as every Senator here knows--that failing to do so would result in  chaos and calamity for the country. It is a threat designed to force  the rest of the U.S. Congress into enacting an extreme rightwing  agenda.   So let's be very clear. Here is what House Republicans are saying.  They are saying: You do what we want or else we will tank the American  economy.   I think anybody hearing that proposition would recognize it for what  it is--a form of economic terrorism. But MAGA Republicans are holding  the full faith and credit of the United States hostage to impose their  agenda on the American people. They have decided to politicize what  should be a nonpartisan issue because Democrats and Republicans in the  House and the Senate have voted for programs to require us to raise the  debt ceiling in the past.   In fact, I think it would be important to know that we would not be  here at this time, on the Senate floor, having hit the debt ceiling and  trying to work to make sure we avoid actually going over the cliff--we  would not be here--if it was not for the tax cuts that were passed  during the Trump administration. We would not be here at this  particular moment. And, in fact, 25 percent of the total national debt  was accumulated during the Trump administration--25 percent of the  total debt of the United States, during the Trump administration.   Now, I want to be clear, I am not saying this is all Republican debt,  but it certainly is not all Democratic debt. This is the debt of the  country. This is the debt owed by Uncle Sam.   And what does the Constitution of the United States tell us about how  we treat America's debt?   Well, here is the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution right  here, and what it says is this:         The validity of the public debt of the United States,       authorized by law, including debts incurred for the payment       of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing       insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.    The Fourteenth Amendment passed shortly after the Civil War, and it  is crystal clear that the obligation to pay America's debts is not a  Democratic obligation; it is not a Republican obligation. It is an  American obligation, and beyond being the right thing to do, it is in  the Constitution of the United States. It is a national duty and a  constitutional duty.    So, as I listen to Speaker McCarthy and his Republican House  colleagues, they want us to ignore the Fourteenth Amendment. They want  to impose their reckless policies on the rest of us under threat of our  doing what they want us to do. So I do want to be clear about what the  consequences of this would be.   I talked in general terms about economic catastrophe. Here is what it  would mean. It would mean seniors going without Social Security  benefits. It can mean troops going for weeks or even months without  pay--the men and women in uniform who are out there protecting our  country. Medicare may not be able to cover the costs of a doctor's  visit. Those are just some of the governmental functions that could  come to a grinding halt if we don't pay our debts on time, and we don't  know the full extent of what would happen because, as I said, we have  never been there before. This is uncharted territory.   Economists estimate a very dire toll: 3 million jobs lost; $130,000  added to the cost of your average 30-year mortgage. I want everyone to  hear that. The mortgage costs for homeowners would go up. And, of  course, as the mortgage costs for homeowners go up, the value of  everyone who has already got a House also goes down. Retirement  accounts in free fall, skyrocketing borrowing costs on car loans, and  we would be hit by this catastrophe just as we are recovering from the  economic hit we took during the pandemic. And it would trigger an  increase in costs just as we are beginning to turn the corner on  inflation.   So why would anyone do this? Why would someone threaten to do this?   I have been listening very carefully to Speaker McCarthy and  Republicans in the House, and they say that they want to reduce the  deficit and the national debt. That is what they say, but this is one  of those situations where you always say: Watch what they do, not what  they say.   The reality is that Republicans, through their actions and their  records, don't care about the deficit and the debt. That is not their  priority because, if they really cared about the deficit and the debt,  they would not have passed the 2017 Trump tax cuts without a plan to  pay for them--a tax cut, by the way, which disproportionately benefited  the very, very rich and big multinational corporations--because that  tax cut, that giveaway to the very wealthy and big corporations, it  increased the deficit by $2 trillion over 10 years, added to our  national debt.   As I said, we wouldn't even be here today, at this point in time, but  for the fact that Republicans increased the deficit by $2 trillion. By  the way, that is not my estimate, that $2 trillion. That is from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   And if Republicans really cared about reducing the deficit and debt,  they could have joined us, just last year, when we closed a number of  loopholes for big corporations, a measure that reduces the deficit by  $238 billion over the next 10 years. That is something Democrats did.  We didn't have a single Republican vote here in the Senate or in the  House for that.   And if Republicans really cared about reducing the deficit and debt,  the Republican-controlled House of Representatives would not, as one of  their very first measures, have passed a law  [[Page S191]]  to slash the funding that the IRS desperately needs to enforce the law  against wealthy tax cheats.   Let me say that again. They cut the moneys that the IRS needs to  enforce current tax law against very wealthy Americans and big  corporations that are not paying what they owe today. They are getting  away with cheating on their taxes, and Republicans cut the money that  the IRS needs to go after them. And this is very explicitly, as the  Secretary of Treasury said, talking about Americans who earn more than  $400,000 every year, including lots of multimillionaires and  billionaires in the country.   So when you say the IRS can no longer have the funds to go after  wealthy tax cheats, what happens? You collect less revenue from very  wealthy people. And what happens when you collect less revenue from  very wealthy people? You increase the deficit. In fact, the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office says that the action the House already took  would increase the deficit by over $114 billion. This is from the  Republicans in the House who are now threatening the United States not  pay its bills, claiming that they care about the deficit and debt, when  one of the very first actions that they took was to increase it. So  that is just not the case. Their actions indicate that they don't care  about the deficit.   What is it really about? So what Republicans are really after is  attacking critical investments that support the American people and  that help strengthen our country. As one Republican strategist, Grover  Norquist, once said, it is about shrinking the government down to the  size where you can ``drown it in the bathtub.''   This House Republican majority is desperate to cut and decimate  programs that Americans need and that our future requires. So, for  example, they want to cut some of the new initiatives we undertook to  supercharge American innovation. We passed legislation, the CHIPS and  Science Act, designed to maintain our technological edge over China and  others. They want to cut it. They want to roll back investments that we  made that are already bringing more high-tech manufacturing jobs back  to the United States. We want to ensure those manufacturing jobs. They  want to continue to offshore those good jobs. They want to cut  investments we are making in clean energy that will help us fight the  climate crisis, strengthen the American workforce, and, yes, also help  us better compete around the globe, where China has a huge headstart  when it comes to things like electric batteries. They want to cut Pell  grants, which help millions of Americans pursue a college degree. They  want to cut investments we are finally making to modernize our national  infrastructure--something that was very bipartisan here in the U.S.  Senate. That is important for our roads, our bridges, our transit  systems, our ports, our airports. They want to cut it. Some are talking  about cutting Medicare and Social Security.    That is just a partial list of what the House Republicans are  threatening to do, and they are saying that if we don't all agree to  that, they are not going to allow the United States to pay its bills on  time.   The bottom line here is, when you look at the Republican playbook, it  is cutting investments that are important to the American people and  important to the success of our country while pushing for more tax cuts  for the superwealthy. This is not a new movie; this is a rerun; this is  trickle-down economics. It is the same old playbook, and here they go  again.   But here is the thing: We have been here before. Some of us were here  when this threat was last made. I vividly remember the year 2011. It  was another moment when the Republicans were fresh--fresh--after  winning a majority in the House of Representatives. I was in the House  at the time. Then, as now, the Republicans said they really cared about  the deficit and the debt. Then, as now, they threatened that they  wouldn't pay the bills on time. They wouldn't vote to pay the country's  bills on time.   I remember back then that we sat down with them in good faith.  President Obama tapped Vice President Biden to lead the budget  negotiations, and a small bipartisan and bicameral group of us was  selected to try to hammer out a plan. I was part of those discussions.  They took place just off the floor here, down the hall, less than 15  yards away. We worked week after week after week, and we negotiated to  try to hammer out an agreement.   But here is what became very clear: The Republican objective then, as  now, was not to reduce the deficit and the debt. The Republican  objective was simply to cut investments in important areas. They didn't  want to raise one penny--not one dime--to reduce the deficit or debt by  closing tax breaks for very wealthy people. That was then. This is the  same story today.   If you look at the list of things they did back then--no cutting tax  breaks for the wealthy, cutting important programs, including Medicare,  were very much part of their agenda--we got very close to tripping over  the final cliff of the debt ceiling. Like today, we had already hit the  debt ceiling, and the Treasury Department was taking extraordinary  measures to prevent us from actually defaulting on our debts. In fact,  we got so close to actually not paying our bills on time that the S&P  downgraded America's credit for the first time in our history. They  said: You are getting very close to the place where creditors of the  United States aren't going to anymore support the United States. They  are not going to buy U.S. bonds. In fact, interest rates began to creep  up just because of that when we got so close to the cliff. We came very  close to going over that waterfall and crashing the economy.   So many of us learned a valuable lesson that day. I learned it, and I  know that then-Vice President, now-President Biden learned it, and that  is that you don't negotiate over whether or not the United States pays  its bills on time, because all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike,  have an obligation and a responsibility to do that.   We also learned something I want to be equally clear about. We are  not against negotiating about the budget. We are happy to sit down  anytime with Republican colleagues and the Speaker of the House to  negotiate all aspects of the budget. We can talk about spending levels,  and we can talk about revenue levels. In fact, we have a budget process  here. If Speaker McCarthy and his colleagues want to do this under the  regular process and do it in a bipartisan way, they have to pass a  budget resolution. They outline where they want to make cuts. I don't  expect them to outline any proposed increases in revenue, but that is  the place they would do that. Then we will have a debate. I serve on  the Senate Budget Committee. I would look forward to that. I do look  forward to that. I serve on the Appropriations Committee where we  decide on expenditures. That is the forum for negotiation.   The Democrats are for negotiating on the budget. We welcome that.  Then the American people would see exactly what everyone's budget  priorities are. They would see that the Republicans want to protect tax  breaks for the very wealthy while they want to cut investments that are  very important to middle America. They would see all of that during the  budget process, but they want to short circuit that process. They,  instead, want to say that they are not going to vote to pay our bills  on time unless we all agree to their radical agenda. We are saying we  are happy to negotiate--let's have a budget negotiation--but the  negotiation isn't that you get everything you want in exchange for the  Democrats' joining you to vote to pay our bills on time.   We didn't do that when President Trump was in office. As I said, we  voted three times to raise the debt limit. We didn't say: You have got  to accept all of our proposed efforts to get rid of tax breaks for the  very wealthy. Yet what they are saying is that we have got to accept  their approach to deep cuts to important investments in order for them  to do what all of us have an obligation under the Constitution to do,  which is to pay our bills on time.   So I hope all of us will do the simple thing--mandated in the  Constitution--as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans. As  Americans, let's pay our bills on time, and let's not crash our  economy. Yes, as part of the normal budget process, let's have a  conversation about spending and about revenue, but don't do it while,  at the same time, you are saying you are not going to let the United  States pay our bills on time.  [[Page S192]]    As I said in my opening remarks, we have always paid our bills on  time. If you don't do it, really bad things happen to all Americans. So  let's get that done, and then let's have our conversation about budget  priorities.   I yield the floor.
