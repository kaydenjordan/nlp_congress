 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Emmer for his leadership on  this bill.   As a small businessman, prior to coming to Congress, I have raised  capital for startups, and I can tell you that one option is no option.   I can tell you that the regulatory framework, particularly made worse  by Dodd-Frank, is crippling access to capital for small- and medium- sized businesses. This is a very important thing.   One option is no option, and it is great to have this for small,  early-stage companies that are trying to raise capital in private  placements. Right now, most of this is done for accredited investors.   Effectively, this protects deal flow for people that are already  wealthy. It locks people out of access to capital. Importantly, for the  entrepreneur, sometimes in disadvantaged communities, they don't have  this vast network of accredited investors to go to. They don't know how  to access the SEC. They certainly don't have the time or money to spend  working with the SEC on regulation. They have a business to grow. They  need to have access to their friends and family and this early-stage  capital to come in. $500,000 isn't much, but it is a start.   I hope that we can not just secure this win, but grow the  protections, so that we can raise even more capital in this way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.
