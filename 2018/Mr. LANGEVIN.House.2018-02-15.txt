 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 620,  the ADA Education and Reform Act. This misguided piece of legislation  is being sold to my colleagues and the American public as a measure  that will help people with disabilities, help businesses come into  compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and help reduce  drive-by lawsuits in States that have gone beyond the ADA to allow for  monetary awards. In actuality, H.R. 620 doesn't accomplish any of these  objectives.   What is worse, if passed, this ill-considered bill will not only  decimate the protections that people with disabilities rely on, it will  turn back the clock to a more segregated society, and it will unravel  the core promise of the ADA that a disability, visible or otherwise,  can never be grounds to justify or tolerate discrimination.   Mr. Chairman, I am angry. I am frustrated. I am insulted. But more  than anything, I am disappointed. Further, neither Mr. Peters nor Mr.  Poe ever even approached me to sit down and have a discussion about  this bill, to try to find some common ground to try to actually fix the  problem if it is about drive-by lawsuits.   Has the Congress really become so divorced from the human experience  of the disability community that we are willing to sacrifice their  rights because it is easier than targeting the root of the problem? Are  people with disabilities, people like me, so easily disregarded?   I am here to say enough is enough.   Mr. Chairman, whether someone is born with a disability, develops a  disability, or becomes disabled due to an accident or from having  served in our Armed Forces, the fundamental truth is that it happened  by chance, certainly not by choice.   As the first quadriplegic elected to the United States Congress, I  overcame many obstacles to sit beside you as a Member of this Chamber,  but I would never have had the opportunities that I cherish today  without the tireless efforts of those who came before me to fight for  the rights of people with disabilities.   Mr. Chairman, I was injured in 1980, at just 16 years of age, a full  10 years before the passage of the ADA, and I certainly remember what  life was like before the ADA became law. I remember that I couldn't go  inside a public building that didn't have a ramp, couldn't travel  without accessible transportation, and was excluded from gatherings in  restaurants and libraries, movie theaters and sports venues that  couldn't accommodate a wheelchair.   I struggled to wash my hands at a sink, access a restroom, and enter  a classroom. I even declined matriculation at my first-choice college  because the challenge of getting around the campus would have been too  difficult, if not impossible.   Mr. Chairman, the ADA brought more than just the recognition that  disability rights are civil rights. It brought hope and opportunity to  millions of people, and it brought dignity.                                time  1015    Mr. Chairman, after all, having a disability should not limit  opportunity, and it is with opportunity that people with disabilities  can lead more active, productive, and independent lives.   The ADA was passed nearly 28 years ago, and instead of holding people  accountable to correctly implement the law, especially when free  resources and technical information are readily available, H.R. 620  weakens Federal protections under the ADA, protections that prohibit  discrimination on the basis of a disability.   The ADA does not allow people to sue for compensatory or punitive  damages, only injunctive relief. Yet some States have gone beyond the  Federal law to permit monetary awards.   H.R. 620 seeks to address the issue by including a notice and cure  period.   Well, the idea that places of public accommodation should receive a  free pass for 6 months before correctly implementing a law that has  been a part of our legal framework for nearly three decades creates an  obvious disincentive for ADA compliance.   People with disabilities, Mr. Chairman, still face immeasurable  obstacles, despite the progress of our great Nation since the passage  of the ADA.   This past year, the disability community has had to fight to preserve  access to healthcare, the long-term services and supports that are a  lifeline for so many under Medicaid, and the ability to maintain  certain protections and credits under the Tax Code.   Mr. Chairman, they are tired, and I am tired, of defending against  efforts to weaken our rights. I urge my colleagues to see past the  smoke and mirrors and irresponsible claims that H.R. 620 is anything  but an appalling effort to strip away the civil rights of a protected  class of Americans.   Mr. Chairman, every vote in support of H.R. 620 will be a message to  people with disabilities that we are not worthy of inclusion,  acceptance, or deserve the same civil rights protections as others.   Mr. Chairman, as Members of Congress, Americans with disabilities  look upon us to defend their rights. Let us not vote to eliminate them.  Let us make them proud and reject H.R. 620.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 6,       line 2.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment with my colleague and  fellow Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus co-chair, Representative Gregg  Harper. I want to mention that it is the only bipartisan amendment  being offered to H.R. 620, and I think it is important to stress this  point.   Mr. Chairman, two Members of Congress from different political  parties--who represent a caucus that exists solely to inform, educate,  and highlight issues impacting the disability community--have come  together to say that there is something gravely wrong with this bill.   We are offering an amendment that would make it palatable. The  amendment would strike H.R. 620's notice and cure requirement. As  presently written, the notice and cure section mandates that someone  who claims discrimination on the basis of a disability relating to an  architectural barrier must provide a written notice that allows 60 days  in order to acknowledge receipt of the complaint and 120 days to  demonstrate substantial progress in removing the barrier before further  legal action may be pursued.   That is 6 months of waiting without a guarantee that the  architectural barrier will be removed and access granted. So the idea  that places of public accommodation must first receive a notice before  correctly implementing a law that has been part of our legal framework  for nearly three decades creates an obvious disincentive for ADA  compliance.   The proposal of a notice ignores the tenets of the ADA that support  an indisputable right to inclusion and respect. No other civil rights  law requires protected class members to hand a notice to people  behaving in a discriminatory manner in order to educate them without  any guarantee the situation will improve.   This amendment would keep program funding for the ADA education. It  also maintains language supporting alternative mediation pathways  relating to architectural barriers outside of the existing framework  within the Department of Justice.   If supporters of H.R. 620 truly believe these State-based nuisance  lawsuits are the result of a lack of knowledge of what the Federal ADA  requires, and that businesses need less costly avenues to remedy  violations, then why wouldn't they support an amendment that provides  an answer to both of those claims without the harm of a notice and cure  period that weakens the civil rights protections of the ADA?   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider the consequences of a  bill that delays justice for people with disabilities in a way that no  other class protected by civil rights laws must endure when asserting  their civil rights. I then urge my colleagues to consider whether the  delay of a notice and cure requirement adequately addresses the  underlying issue of ``drive-by'' lawsuits.   I am hopeful that doing so will result in a decision to support this  amendment to remove the harmful notice requirement, while maintaining  provisions that increase access to education and mediation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I proudly yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the ranking  member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 30 seconds remaining.    Mr. Chairman, again, I urge support of my amendment.  The whole point of this amendment is to remove the notice and cure  provision.   Again, the ADA law has been around for nearly three decades now.  People should be proactive about understanding what their  responsibilities are  [[Page H1195]]  to operate businesses or issues of public accommodation, to understand  what their responsibilities are. Not, basically, taking that  responsibility incentivizes people to say: Well, just wait and see if  there is an issue, and only if we get notified will we then fix the  problem.   People need to be proactive and comply with the law, and I believe,  there, everybody wins.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island will be  postponed.                    Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Foster    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in  part A of House Report 115-559.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5  minutes    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise, again, in opposition to this amendment.   While I thank the gentleman from California for stressing the  importance of providing opportunities for places of public  accommodation to learn that they are in violation of the ADA, I  disagree with the premise that the onus of enforcement should be placed  on people with disabilities by requiring them to issue arduous and  detailed notices.   There are free resources available that provide information and  technical assistance to the public on the requirements of the ADA.   I can't stress this enough: when someone owns a business, they have  to balance a variety of regulations and requirements at both the State  and Federal Government level. Why should the requirements that their  business be accessible to people with disabilities, requirements that  have been in existence for decades, be weakened or viewed as less  important?   Why should business owners be given a free pass until someone catches  a violation before they comply?   The suggestion that we can reduce the timeframe of a notice and cure  period misses the point. There is nothing that can be done to improve a  notice requirement that shouldn't exist in the first place.   No other civil rights law requires people who experience  discrimination to wait for justice or provide a written notice before  taking legal action. Why should people with disabilities be treated any  differently?   Further, what are the incentives to comply with the ADA in the first  place if businesses can wait to be told what is wrong and then maybe  fix the issue?   After all, even with a reduction in the notice and cure timeframe,  there is still no clear requirement that a barrier actually be removed.   Again, I appreciate my colleague's desire to find a compromise, but  this is not the answer.   Whether the notice and cure period is 120 days or 180 days, it does  nothing to address the underlying issue of drive-by lawsuits. That is  the crux of the problem happening in States that have gone beyond the  requirements of the ADA and merely delays access and creates a national  policy of apathy on ADA implementation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, while I appreciate my colleague's  attempt to find somewhat of a common ground on this issue, it does not  address the underlying problem. The issue of the ADA being around for  30 years--it is well-known now. People are even proactive about finding  out what their responsibilities are under the ADA, as opposed to just  waiting until they are notified of a problem and then perhaps complying  with.   No, we should not treat people with disabilities any differently than  anyone else who is protected under civil rights laws. That is why we  have them in the first place.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Let's work  together on finding a better common-ground solution. But this amendment  and the underlying bill is not the answer.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
