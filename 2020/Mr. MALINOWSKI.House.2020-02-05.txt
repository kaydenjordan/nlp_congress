Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 4044, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lead this bipartisan reauthorization of  the National Estuary Program, a successful nonregulatory program to  improve the water quality and ecological integrity of our Nation's  estuaries, a program with a long history of support on both sides of  the aisle.  [[Page H781]]    Estuaries are extraordinarily productive ecosystems where fresh water  from rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the ocean.   In my district in my home State of New Jersey, the New York-New  Jersey Harbor & Estuary Program encompasses some 250 square miles of  open water, including parts of the Raritan, Rahway, Elizabeth, and  Hackensack Rivers.   My bill, the Protect and Restore America's Estuaries Act, makes  several important improvements to this program. First, it nearly  doubles funding for the program's 28 estuaries of national  significance, including the New York-New Jersey Harbor & Estuary  Program.   It ensures that management plans governing nationally significant  estuaries consider the effects of recurring extreme weather events and  that they develop and implement appropriate adaptation strategies. It  expands eligibility for grants under the program to organizations  working to address stormwater runoff, coastal resiliency, and  accelerated land loss issues.   It requires the NEP management, the regional conferences that are  part of the NEP, to develop and implement strategies to increase local  awareness about the ecological health and water quality of estuaries.   It is hard to overstate just how important estuaries are to the  broader marine ecology. They are sometimes referred to as the nurseries  of the sea because of the vast and diverse array of marine animals that  spend the early parts of their lives in them, with their calm waters  providing a safe habitat for smaller birds and other animals, as well  as for spawning and nesting.   Further, estuaries act as stopover sites for migratory animals  including ducks, geese, and salmon. They filter out pollutants from  rivers and streams before they flow into the ocean, and they protect  inland areas from flooding, with their broad and shallow waters able to  absorb sudden storm surges.   They are the natural infrastructure that protects human communities  from flooding. And of course, they also help the economies of every  community that relies on fishing and tourism and recreation.   So it is my privilege to play a role in protecting and strengthening  these critical ecosystems and in preserving the natural beauty of my  State of New Jersey.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, Congressman Graves for teaming up with me on  this bill. Congressman Graves is a longtime champion for the estuarine  system in his district, and I am glad to partner with him.   I want to thank Congresswoman Napolitano for her leadership of the  Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee. I want to thank  Congresswoman Fletcher for her support as an original cosponsor, and  Congressman Larsen for making the bill even stronger, as well as more  than two dozen of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, who  have cosponsored this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Larsen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Napolitano.)    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of  support for H.R. 4044 from the New York-New Jersey Harbor and Estuary  Program, Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program, San Francisco  Estuary Partnership, Puget Sound Partnership, Santa Monica Bay National  Estuary Program, and Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership.                                                 New York-New Jersey                                        Harbor & Estuary Program,                                     New York, NY, February 4, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Don Young,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Hon. Grace F. Napolitano,      Chairman, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: Thank you for your leadership in support of       the cooperative conservation and management of our nation's       vital estuaries, and in particular for the unanimous approval       in your committee for HR 4044, a bill to reauthorize the       National Estuary Program.        This legislation invests directly in the stewardship of our       nation's coasts. It empowers local communities in a non-      regulatory, collaborative and science based strategy to       safeguard the places where we live, work and recreate. The 28       National Estuary Programs (NEP) located around the nation's       coastline engage industries, businesses, and other community       members to develop solutions for tough problems. The NEP's       public-private partnerships stretch federal dollars to       provide successful on-the-ground results driven by diverse       stakeholders. NEP partners include wastewater utilities; port       authorities, shippers, and related maritime industry; local       restaurants & tourist businesses; design, engineering and       construction professionals; state and local governments;       colleges and universities, and community and environmental       organizations.        NEPs around the country are extremely efficient at       leveraging funds to increase their ability to restore and       protect their coastal ecosystems. The NEPs have obtained over       $19 for every $1 provided, generating over $4 billion for on-      the-ground efforts since 2003. HR 4044 would amplify and       improve on the reforms signed into law in the 114th Congress       that created a competitive program to address urgent       challenges while streamlining the administrative costs of the       program.                            Progress on the Ground         NEPs have collectively restored and protected more than       2,000,000 acres of vital habitats since 2000 alone.       Consistent Congressional funding of the National Estuary       Programs is essential--resulting in clean water, healthy       estuaries, and strong coastal communities. This investment in       our national estuaries will help strengthen America's economy       and support thousands of jobs, and will secure the future of       our coastal communities.        Here in New York and New Jersey, we can report on how funds       already invested in this program are being put to extremely       good purpose in protecting and restoring estuaries and       coastal communities:        Working with communities in the Bronx, Harlem, Passaic, and       Hackensack River watersheds to track down sources of       floatable trash before they enter the water;        Helping local governments in New Jersey and New York       identify and right-size culverts and bridges to improve       habitat and reduce street flooding;        Working with wastewater utilities in Elizabeth and       Ridgefield Park to prioritize and make critical investments       in outfalls needed to address rising sea levels;        Restoring shoreline ecology and improving fisheries in the       Hudson and East River by creating oyster reefs and other       restoration efforts        The value of our oceans, estuaries and coasts to our nation       is immense, and has never been more important. Over half the       US population lives in coastal watershed counties, many of       these in estuaries of national significance. Roughly half the       nation's gross domestic product is generated in those       counties and adjacent ocean waters. According to NOAA's 2019       report on the ocean economy, ocean industries contributed       $320 billion to U.S. economy, while employment in the ocean       economy increased by 14.5 percent by 2016, compared to 4.8       percent in the U.S. economy as a whole.        Thank you again for your efforts to advance this visionary       legislation and look forward to working with you to       reauthorize this successful program.            Sincerely,                                                     Robert Pirani,      Director, NYNJHEP.                                   ____                                               Barataria-Terrebonne,                                        National Estuary Program,                                    Thibodaux, LA, February 4, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Don Young,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace F. Napolitano,      Chairman, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: Thank you for your leadership in support of       the National Estuary Program, and in particular for your       unanimous approval in your committee for HR 4044, a bill to       reauthorize this highly successful program. I understand this       bill may be considered by the full House of Representatives,       and applaud your efforts to advance this legislation. We at       the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program strongly       applaud the leadership of Representative Graves to advance       this legislation to address Louisiana's land loss crisis.       Funding from this program empowers local people and their       ongoing love of the land, water, culture, and each other to       use the best science available to address the estuary's       perils.        This legislation invests directly in the stewardship of our       nation's coasts. It empowers local communities in a non-      regulatory, collaborative and science-based strategy to       safeguard the places where we live, work, and recreate. Of       all federally funded coastal programs, only NEPs organize       local stakeholders as partners in a unique decision-making       framework to address local priorities. NEPs provide       technical, management, and communication assistance to       develop priorities and implement comprehensive actions: storm       water and infrastructure projects, seagrass and shellfish       restoration  [[Page H783]]       which support fishing and tourist industries, science and       monitoring to guide decision-making, and innovative education       programs designed for the next generation of Americans.                        NEPs: Public-Private Partners         The NEP consists of 28 unique, voluntary programs       established by the Clean Water Act to protect and improve       estuaries of national significance. Each NEP engages its       local community in a non-regulatory, consensus-driven, and       science-based process. For every federal dollar, NEPs       collectively leverage $19 in local funds to protect and       improve coastal environments, communities, and economies.       This investment in our national estuaries strengthens       America's economy and supports thousands of jobs, and will       secure the future of our coastal communities.        NEPs engage industries, businesses, and other community       members to develop solutions for tough problems. NEP's       public-private partnerships stretch federal dollars to       provide on-the ground results driven by diverse stakeholders.       NEP partners include commercial agriculture and fisheries,       energy and water utilities, local businesses, construction       and landscaping professionals, state and local governments,       academic institutions, and community groups.        The value of our oceans, estuaries and coasts to our nation       is immense. Over half the U.S. population lives in coastal       watershed counties. Roughly half the nation's gross domestic       product is generated in those counties and adjacent ocean       waters. In 2019 alone, ocean industries contributed $320       billion to U.S. economy.                            Results on the Ground         NEPs have had great success in protecting and restoring       estuaries and coastal communities:        The Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program (BTNEP)       is restoring maritime forest ridges along coastal Louisiana       with public and private partnerships. These ridges are vital       habitat for wildlife and provide storm surge protection for       business, industry, and homeowners.        Morro Bay National Estuary Program is restoring underwater       eelgrass meadows after precipitous decline in the last       decade. Promising restoration results show that collaborative       research, community outreach, and adaptive management make a       difference for healthy estuary habitats on the California's       Central Coast.        All three California National Estuary Programs are       partnering to improve the status and use of resources for       boaters to pump out waste from their boats. These stations       are critical to keeping bacteria and other pollution from       entering sensitive coastal waters.        The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is working with the       Bronx River Alliance and other community groups to track down       sources of floatable trash in the River.        The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware is bringing the       oyster back, using living shorelines to stop erosion, protect       property and restore habitat.        NEPs have collectively restored and protected more than       2,000,000 acres of vital habitats since 2000 alone.        Important reforms were made to the National Estuary Program       in the reauthorization during the 114th Congress, including       the creation of a competitive program to address urgent       challenges and the streamlining of administrative costs. HR       4044 amplifies and improves on these reforms. We thank you       again for your efforts to advance this visionary legislation       and look forward to working with you to reauthorize this       successful program.            Sincerely,                                                    Dean Blanchard,      BTNEP Acting Director.                                   ____                                San Francisco Estuary Partnership,                                San Francisco, CA, February 4, 2020.

Dear Chairmen DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: I am writing to thank you for your leadership       in support of the National Estuary Program (NEP). For over 30       years, NEPs have advanced national priorities through a       place-based, non-regulatory, collaborative approach. NEP's       promote efficient partnerships to achieve on-the-ground       success, engaging industries, businesses, local communities,       scientists, regulatory agencies and other stakeholders.        Communities and businesses depend on our nation's       estuaries. Loss of coastal habitats, pollutants entering our       waters, and increased coastal flooding are challenging our       coasts and affecting the critical economies we rely on. Over       82% of the nation's population live in the coastal areas that       NEPs directly support. The 28 NEPs are leading the way in       using a non-regulatory approach to working with industry and       communities on innovations to protect life, business, and       property from loss, damage, flooding, and drought.        NEPs leverage federal funds to build the capacity of local       partners to implement innovative and beneficial projects. For       every dollar EPA provides, NEPs leverage $19 in local funds       to protect and improve coastal environments, communities and       economies. Recent examples of NEP successes include:        The San Francisco Estuary Partnership is collaborating with       wastewater treatment facilities to advance innovative nature-      based solutions along the shoreline to remove contaminants,       secure potable water resources, increase flood protection,       and restore habitat        All three California National Estuary Programs are       partnering to reduce raw sewage disposal into the water from       recreational boats, keeping bacteria and other pollution from       entering coastal waters and threatening public health        The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware is bringing the       oyster back, with all its ecological and economic benefits,       after it nearly disappeared in the last century.

Napolitano,      Chairman, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: Thank you for your leadership in support of       the National Estuary Program, and in particular for your       unanimous approval in your committee for HR 4044, a bill to       reauthorize this highly successful program. I understand this       bill may be considered by the full House of Representatives,       and applaud your efforts to advance this legislation.        In particular I would like to recognize and applaud the       leadership of Representative Larson on this issue. He has       been a stalwart supporter of this program nationally, and in       particular a champion of Puget Sound. I appreciate his       efforts as a senior member of your committee to advance this       legislation that is so important to Washington.        Puget Sound is a complex ecosystem encompassing mountains,       farmlands, cities, rivers, forests, and wetlands. Sixteen       major rivers flow to Puget Sound and 20 treaty tribes call       the region home. Currently, 4.5 million people live in the       Puget Sound area, with another 1.3 million expected to live       here by 2040. Seattle was the second fastest growing city in       the nation in 2018, and the fastest in 2017. We are a region       of innovators and entrepreneurs: 11 Fortune 500 companies are       are headquartered in the Puget Sound area, many of which have       shaped 21st century life. Our economy is roaring, and the       region's natural beauty and recreational opportunities help       businesses and companies attract top talent.        On the surface, Puget Sound looks healthy and inviting,       but, in fact, Puget Sound is in grave trouble. Southern       Resident orcas, Chinook salmon, and steelhead are all listed       under the Endangered Species Act. Toxic chemicals and       pharmaceuticals continue to pollute our waterways, and       shellfish beds are routinely closed to commercial and       recreational harvest due to fecal contamination. Habitat       degradation continues to outpace restoration. While this       situation at times seems impossibly gloomy, the hundreds of       passionate people who are devoted to seeing the return of a       healthy and resilient Puget Sound give us hope.        Scientists say that we can still recover Puget Sound, but       only if we act boldly now. We know what we need to do. The       primary barriers between us and more food for orcas, clean       and sufficient water for people and fish, sustainable working       lands, and harvestable shellfish are funding and political       fortitude.        The single greatest step we could take to ensure a durable,       systematic, and science-based effort for Puget Sound recovery       is to fully fund the implementation of habitat protection and       restoration, water quality protection, and salmon recovery       programs. The National Estuary Program (NEP) is a vital piece       of this funding puzzle.        Of all federally funded coastal programs, only NEPs       organize local stakeholders as  [[Page H784]]       partners in a unique decision-making framework to address       local priorities. NEPs provide technical, management, and       communication assistance to develop priorities and implement       comprehensive actions: stormwater and infrastructure       projects, seagrass and shellfish restoration which support       fishing and tourist industries, science and monitoring to       guide decision-making, and innovative education programs       designed for the next generation of Americans.        The NEP consists of 28 unique, voluntary programs       established by the Clean Water Act to protect and improve       estuaries of national significance. Each NEP engages its       local community in a non-regulatory, consensus-driven, and       science-based process. For every dollar EPA provides, NEPs       leverage $19 in local funds to protect and improve coastal       environments, communities and economies.        NEPs have collectively restored and protected more than       2,000,000 acres of vital habitats since 2000 alone.       Consistent Congressional funding of the National Estuary       Programs is essential resulting in clean water, healthy       estuaries, and strong coastal communities. This investment in       our national estuaries will help strengthen America's economy       and support thousands of jobs, and will secure the future of       our coastal communities.        Thank you for your strong support of this program over the       years. Funds already invested in this program are being put       to extremely good purpose in protecting and restoring       estuaries and coastal communities.        Recent examples include the following:        Our partners are restoring forage fish spawning, which is       critically important in the Puget Sound food web--back to       large areas of shoreline, and reducing the flow of stormwater       containing toxic pollutants into Puget Sound.        The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is working with the       Bronx River Alliance and other community groups to track down       sources of floatable trash in the River, including locations       in upstream Westchester County.        The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership in Maine, along with       partners, is monitoring nutrients around Casco Bay to provide       real-time data on nutrient processes. CBEP's nutrient       analyzer has been automatically collecting nitrate, nitrite       and ammonium samples and working collaboratively to assure       safe levels in the bay.        The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware is bringing the       oyster back, with all its ecological and economic benefits,       after it nearly disappeared in the last century. The Center       is using living shorelines to stop erosion, protect property       and restore habitat.        As you know, important reforms were made to the National       Estuary Program (NEP) in the reauthorization that was signed       into law in the 114th Congress. These reforms created a       competitive program to address urgent challenges and maximize       funds received by our national estuaries, while streamlining       the administrative costs of the program.        HR 4044 would amplify and improve on these reforms, and       continue the cost-effective streamlining begun in the 114th       Congress.        We are running out of time: the Center for Whale Research       reported this weekend that another Southern Resident orca,       L41, has gone missing. With its loss, the population will       drop to 72 animals, the lowest in 40 years. Your action now       to pass HR 4044 can help.            Sincerely,                                                Laura L. Blackmore,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                    Santa Monica Bay                                        National Estuary Program,                                                   February 3, 2020.

Napolitano,      Chairman, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Don Young,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: I am writing to thank you for your leadership       in support of the National Estuary Program, and in particular       for your unanimous approval in your committee for HR 4044, a       bill to reauthorize this highly successful program. I also       like to recognize the efforts of California Representatives       Salud Carbajal, Harley Rouda, and Eric Swalwell for their co-      sponsorship of this bill. We understand this bill may be       considered by the full House of Representatives and applaud       your efforts to advance this legislation.        The National Estuary Program consists of 28, voluntary and       geographically specific partnerships to promote the vitality       of the United States Estuaries of National Significance. Each       NEP engages its local community in a non-regulatory,       consensus-driven, and science-based process. For every dollar       EPA provides, NEPs leverage $19 in local funds to protect and       improve coastal environments, communities, and economies.        NEPs provide a suite of skills to advance the technical,       management, and communication needs of their consensus driven       Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans. These plans       seek to implement coordinated actions such as: storm water       and infrastructure projects, seagrass, dune, wetland, and       shellfish restoration, and the conservation of open spaces.       NEPs also support and conduct scientific monitoring to       identify and address sources of environmental harm that are       detrimental to public health and coastal economies.        NEPs engage industries, businesses, and other community       members to develop solutions for tough problems. The NEPs'       public-private partnerships stretch federal dollars to       provide successful on-the-ground results driven by diverse       stakeholders. NEP partners include commercial agriculture and       fisheries, energy and water utilities, local restaurants &       tourist businesses, construction and landscaping       professionals, engineering and mining companies, state and       local governments, colleges and universities, and other       community organizations.        The value of our oceans, estuaries and coasts to our nation       is immense. According to NOAA's 2019 report on the ocean       economy, ocean industries contributed $320 billion to U.S.       economy, while employment in the ocean economy increased by       14.5 percent by 2016, compared to 4.8 percent in the U.S.       economy as a whole. NEPs work to protect and enhance these       nationally significant economic engines.        Thank you for your strong support of this program over the       years. Funds already invested in this program are being put       to extremely good purpose in protecting and restoring       estuaries and coastal communities.        Recent examples include:        The Santa Monica Bay National Estuary Program has restored       51.9 acres of kelp forest, off the Palos Verdes Peninsula in       the past six years. This restoration effort has helped       reverse an 80% decline in this vital ecosystem which supports       several of California's most lucrative fisheries and allows       for the recovery of endangered abalone.        The Puget Sound Partnership is restoring forage fish       spawning--which are critically important in the Puget Sound       foodweb--back to large areas of shoreline and reducing the       flow of stormwater containing toxic pollutants into Puget       Sound.        The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is working with the       Bronx River Alliance and other community groups to track down       sources of floatable trash in the River, including locations       in upstream Westchester County.

HR 4044 would       amplify and improve on these reforms, and continue the cost-      effective streamlining begun in the 114th Congress.        Thank you again for your visionary leadership, and that of       the three California Representatives Salud Carbajal, Harley       Rouda, and Eric Swalwell who have cosponsored this bill to       reauthorize this successful program.

Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee,           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairs DeFazio and Napolitano, Ranking Members Young       and Westerman: Thank you for your leadership and strong       support of the National Estuary Program (NEP), and for your       unanimous approval in your committee for HR 4044, a bill to       reauthorize this highly successful program. I understand this       bill may be considered by the full House of Representatives       and appreciate your efforts to support this legislation.        The NEP stands out as one of the most effective federal       programs. The National Program creates a framework--and       accountability--for local partners, representing diverse       interests to address the physical, chemical, social,       biological, economic and cultural challenges that threaten       our nation's estuaries. It is this collaborative framework       that allows NEPs to tackle issues that no agency or state can       tackle alone.  [[Page H785]]         Of all federally funded coastal programs, only NEPs       implement a community-based decision framework to address       local and national priorities. NEPs and their partners       address:        Stormwater and infrastructure projects;        Eelgrass and shellfish restoration, supporting aquaculture,       fishing, and tourist industries;        Land and wildlife conservation;        Science and monitoring to guide decision-making; and        Innovative education programs designed for the next       generation of Americans.        The NEP consists of 28 unique, voluntary programs       established by the Clean Water Act to protect and improve       estuaries of national significance. Each NEP engages its       local community in a non-regulatory, consensus-driven, and       science-based process. For every federal dollar, NEPs       collectively leverage $19 in local funds to protect and       improve coastal environments, communities, and economies.       This investment in our national estuaries strengthens       America's economy and supports thousands of jobs and secures       the future of our coastal communities.        NEPs engage local industries, businesses, and other       community members to develop--and implement--solutions for       tough problems. NEP's public-private partnerships stretch       federal dollars to provide on-the-ground results driven by       diverse stakeholders. NEP partners include commercial       agriculture and fisheries, energy and water utilities, local       businesses, construction and landscaping professionals, state       and local governments, academic institutions, teachers,       students, and community groups.        The value of our oceans, estuaries and coasts to our nation       is immense. Over half the U.S. population lives in coastal       watershed counties. Roughly half the nation's gross domestic       product is generated in those counties and adjacent ocean       waters. In 2019 alone, ocean industries contributed $320       billion to U.S. economy.                            Results on the Ground         NEPs are focused on results on the ground and have had       great success in protecting and restoring estuaries and       coastal communities:        In the lower Columbia River since 2000, we have:        Restored 28,387 acres of habitat with 100 partners to help       recover threatened and endangered fish.        Provided 81,485 students with over 407,704 hours of outdoor       science learning, helping teachers meet benchmarks, and fill       in gaps in science education.        Planted 144,721 native trees along riparian corridors with       students and volunteers of all ages.        Raised more than $76 million--100% of those funds stay in       Oregon and Washington addressing local priorities. These are       monies local entities cannot access on their own and we can't       raise without the NEP funds.        Leverage $11.5 million in federal NEP funds to bring a       total of $76 million to our region, 100% spent in Oregon and       Washington.        Generated 1,524 family wage jobs, mostly in construction,       restoring habitat, that cannot be exported.        These results are repeated around the nation in each of the       28 national estuary programs:        Morro Bay National Estuary Program is restoring underwater       eelgrass meadows after a precipitous decline in the last       decade. Promising restoration results show that collaborative       research, community outreach, and adaptive management make a       difference for healthy estuary habitats on the California's       Central Coast.        All three California National Estuary Programs are       partnering to improve the status and use of resources for       boaters to pump out waste from their boats. These stations       are critical to keeping bacteria and other pollution from       entering sensitive coastal waters.        The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is working with the       Bronx River Alliance and other community groups to track down       sources of floatable trash in the River.        The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware is bringing the       oyster back, using living shorelines to stop erosion, protect       property and restore habitat.        NEPs have collectively restored and protected more than       2,000,000 acres of vital habitats since 2000 alone.        Important reforms were made to the National Estuary Program       in the reauthorization during the 114th Congress, including       the creation of a competitive program to address urgent       challenges and the streamlining of administrative costs. HR       4044 amplifies and improves on these reforms.        Despite these great outcomes, threats to our waters and our       communities remain. Toxics from stormwater contaminate clean       water and habitat and cause cancer and neurological damage to       humans and river species. Changes in precipitation,       temperature, and storminess increase sea levels, increase       erosion, and intensify flood events, leaving many of our       rural communities and much our local infrastructure       vulnerable to these variabilities. Micro plastics are       pervasive in our rivers and streams; they are filling the       bellies of ocean species and impair human immune systems,       disrupt hormones, and cause cancer. Disparities in education       and lack of opportunities for hands-on outdoor learning exist       for too many in our communities.        We thank you again for your efforts to advance this       legislation and look forward to working with you to       reauthorize this successful program.            Sincerely yours,                                                   Debrah Marriott,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
