 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate Mr.  Tommy Williams of Baton Rouge, LA, on his retirement from the Louisiana  Community and Technical College System, LCTCS.   Serving as the executive director for governmental affairs of LCTCS  for 13 years, Mr. Williams made monumental  [[Page S49]]  strides for the system, including one of his major legislative  accomplishments: ACT 360, which appropriated $500 million in capital  improvements to all 12 LCTCS campuses throughout the great State of  Louisiana.   Prior to his service at LCTCS, Mr. Williams wore many hats during his  tenure at BellSouth, which spanned almost four decades. Serving as the  company's executive director for legislative affairs in Louisiana, he  represented the interests of BellSouth before the Louisiana State  Legislature in numerous regular and special sessions. He served as  BellSouth's Houma and Baton Rouge district manager, as well as vice  president for regulatory and external affairs from 2003-2006.   In addition to the lengthy list of professional accomplishments, Mr.  Williams and his wife of 56 years, Ms. Bonnie Williams, devoted  countless hours of their time volunteering for community-based  nonprofit organizations. Mr. and Mrs. Williams are the proud parents of  four, grandparents of eight, and great-grandparents of three.   The State of Louisiana and all who have benefited from Mr. Williams's  impressive efforts thank him for his diligent work. There is no doubt  that his legacy will live on in the years to come and will serve as an  inspiration to the next generation of community builders and  leaders.                            ____________________
