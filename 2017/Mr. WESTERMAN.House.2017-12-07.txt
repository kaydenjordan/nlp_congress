 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to plead on behalf of our  country for immediate Senate action on the Resilient Federal Forests  Act of 2017. The House passed this bipartisan bill on November 1,  following a record wildfire season with millions of acres going up in  smoke and ash.   Just this week, fires have flared up again in southern California  with more than 110,000 acres currently burning  [[Page H9747]]  and more than 200,000 individuals forced from their homes. Many schools  are closed, residents hundreds of miles away are advised to stay  indoors to avoid the smoke, and, more urgently, lives and property are  at risk across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties.   The time for the Senate to act was 2 years ago when they failed to  act on similar legislation. We can't afford for the Senate to continue  to do nothing. Pass the Resilient Federal Forests Act. Give the Forest  Service the tools it needs to prevent and combat catastrophic  wildfires. Fires are raging, lives are in danger, and the situation  will get worse in the future if the Senate continues to fail to act.                            ____________________
