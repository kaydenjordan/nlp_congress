 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of longtime  Brewton, Alabama, resident and my cousin, G.S. ``Scotty'' Byrne Jr.,  who passed away on November 18 at the age of 92.   Scotty was a veteran of World War II having served in the 351st  Infantry Division under General Mark Clark and later went on to serve  as sheriff of Escambia County for 24 years.   In college at the University of Southern Mississippi, Scotty was a  premier two-sport athlete excelling in both baseball and golf. He was  the first athlete to be inducted into the USM Sports Hall of Fame for  two sports. Throughout his life, he was one of the most able golfers in  our part of the State.   During his tenure as sheriff, he was a vocal supporter of the Alabama  Sheriff's Boys Ranch, providing resources for children in need  throughout our State. Without a doubt, Scotty was one of the most  memorable citizens in Escambia County's long history.   So on behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I want to  share our condolences with Scotty's family. He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
