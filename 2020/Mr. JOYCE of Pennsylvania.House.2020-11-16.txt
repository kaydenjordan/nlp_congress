 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to showcase the  promise of American innovation. Just this morning, Moderna announced  that its COVID-19 vaccine is nearly 95 percent effective. Last week,  Pfizer reported that its coronavirus vaccine is more than 90 percent  effective.   Today, less than a year after the coronavirus reached our shores,  this is an incredible achievement. It is a testament to the excellence  of American scientists and researchers.   Thanks to these heroes and to the historic private-public partnership  spurred by Operation Warp Speed, our Nation is positioned to distribute  a safe and effective vaccine more efficiently than any other country in  the world.   Now more than ever, as cases of COVID-19 rise across our Nation, we  must stand firm against this invisible enemy. And thanks to American  innovation, there is hope on the horizon.                            ____________________
