 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional Air  Force leader for his outstanding service. Colonel Brian Laidlaw is the  commander of the 325th Fighter Wing at Tyndall Air Force Base.   In 2018, as Hurricane Michael descended on us, Colonel Laidlaw  accomplished the evacuation of Tyndall Air Force Base in just 22 hours.  His decisive leadership saved over 11,000 airmen, their families, and  over $21 billion in Air Force assets.   After the storm, Colonel Laidlaw personally forged the ``base of the  future'' vision for rebuilding Tyndall to the President of the United  States. For his outstanding leadership, the Air Force Association  awarded him the Waterman Award for the single most significant  contribution to the Air Force during the past year.   Colonel Laidlaw reflects the highest standards of leadership and  conduct and is a credit to the United States military. I wish him and  his family the best of luck as they proceed to their next assignment.                            ____________________
