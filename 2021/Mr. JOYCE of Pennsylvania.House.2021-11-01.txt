 Madam Speaker, attempting to push through  yet another socialist spending spree this year might be what liberals  think will help their polling numbers, but it is not what the American  people need.   In reality, this bill would exacerbate our energy crisis and make our  country less safe.   The reckless spending in this legislation can best be defined as  build back bankruptcy.   Right now, in my hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania, gas costs over  $3.50 a gallon. That is money coming directly out of Americans'  pockets. If this spending spree is passed, that cost will only go up.   So far, the Biden administration has placed a moratorium on new  American drilling, canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, and allowed the  Russians to produce oil for our allies in Europe. This legislation,  unfortunately, doubles down on the Biden administration's war on  American energy.   This lengthy piece of legislation overregulates and overtaxes the  natural gas, coal, and Marcellus shale industries that provide good  wages and low-cost power to American families.   Instead of supporting American energy, this bill hands out green  energy tax credits to wind and solar manufacturers that are unable to  meet the energy needs of our country. Wind turbines and solar panels  are not going to heat our homes this winter.   We need to focus on regaining America's energy independence. We need  to focus on lowering energy costs before winter sets in.   This inflation is not transitory. We cannot wish this problem away.   Passing the Green New Deal dressed up as infrastructure legislation  is not the answer to the problem that we are currently facing.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members of this body to work together  to pass an infrastructure bill that would actually rebuild our roads  and rebuild our bridges.   In Congress, we must be responsible stewards of the taxpayers'  dollars. We need to find a fiscally responsible way to build roads and  to repair bridges.   We need to complete the Appalachian regional highway system, and we  need to expand internet access to all citizens across the  Commonwealths, across the States, and across America. We need to do  this without mortgaging our children's future. We need to do this  without ballooning our deficit in a way that would hamstring the  American people for decades to come.                            ____________________
