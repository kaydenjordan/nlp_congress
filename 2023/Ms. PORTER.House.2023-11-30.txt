 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the Iranian regime is a danger to  international security and democratic order everywhere.   The regime has funded terrorism across the Middle East for years,  enabling groups like Hamas to attack Israel and commit other  atrocities. The Iranian regime doesn't stop with supporting regional  terrorism. It commits its own atrocities, consistently and brutally  cracking down on its own citizens fighting for basic freedoms.                                time  1430    If all that weren't enough, the Iran regime further refuses to  abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, putting the world at risk.   Challenges like these require Congress to make policy that meets the  moment, but we can only do that if Members of Congress and the people  we represent can do oversight and fully understand our administration's  policy toward Iran.   Americans will benefit from more information on how our Nation is  approaching preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and ending  Iran's support for terrorist networks. Congress will also benefit from  this information so that we can better legislate on Iran, consistent  with the security interests and values of the United States.   Under President Obama's administration, the United States Government  issued periodic reports on its evolving policy in Syria. This set a  model for the executive branch sharing information with lawmakers and  the public regarding United States foreign policy toward countries of  concern.   In Congress, we know that the details of our Nation's Iran policy are  complex and fluid, but precedent exists for our administration to  provide a more complete window into its foreign policy objectives in  specific countries.   This bipartisan amendment would commission a detailed report on  United States policy with regard to Iran with regard to human rights,  nuclear proliferation, the ballistic missile program, and regional  terrorism.   We don't need talking heads force-feeding us conclusions about this  administration's Iran policy. Let's get an oversight report about what  that policy is and let everyone draw their own conclusions. Then,  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle can better make policy that  addresses the challenges we face operating from a shared platform of  information.   Mr. Chair, let's trust the American people and each other with  information. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, in Iran, we see a familiar pattern. Iranians  are standing up, demanding change for themselves, their families, and  their country. Then, the Iranian regime cracks down, arresting  protesters and journalists and unleashing violence against its own  people. Instead of giving its people the freedoms they seek, the regime  limits freedoms, including restricting internet access.   For authoritarian governments like the Iranian regime, restricting  internet access couldn't be more crucial as a tool in repressing their  own citizens. The internet is a portal to information about human  rights, democratic order, economic prosperity, and thriving civil  society. These things support freedom, and freedom is exactly the  opposite of what the Iranian regime wants.   To give Iranians a better future, we need to support them in having  real access to the internet, and that means the internet without  censorship, without digital surveillance, and without online  repression. My amendment will help us do that.   First, the amendment will require an assessment of the ways the  Iranian Government shuts down, censors, and weaponizes the internet.  Then, it will commission an assessment of whether United States policy  is currently best supporting the flow of communication tools to the  Iranian people.   Finally, it will require the United States to develop strategies to  counter Iran's online repression and prevent the Iranian regime from  using tools of digital repression.   Iranians have struggled for decades against threats to their basic  freedoms. The more the Iranian people have tools like real internet  access, the better position they will be in to fight the repression of  the Iranian regime. That is why Members on both sides of the aisle who  care deeply about creating a better future for the Iranian people have  supported and collaborated with me on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
