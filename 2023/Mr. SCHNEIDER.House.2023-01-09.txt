 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  oppose this bill. It not only increases our national deficit by $114  billion, but it does so by helping the wealthiest avoid paying taxes  and transfers that burden onto the backs of hardworking Americans and  small businesses that follow the law and pay their taxes on time.   Here is my question: Why, on their very first day legislating with  their new majority, with their very first bill, is the top Republican  priority rewarding tax cheats with what is estimated  [[Page H90]]  to be nearly $200 billion in uncollected taxes over the next 10 years,  $200 billion in taxes not paid by the wealthiest, meaning additional  debt for everyone else?   The Inflation Reduction Act dedicated $46 billion to enforcement to  make sure corporations and wealthy individuals pay the taxes they owe,  not new taxes, not higher rates, simply ensuring everyone pays what  they owe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  oppose this outrageous tax scam.
