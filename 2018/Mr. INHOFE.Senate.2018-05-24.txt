 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my good  friend Mr. Vaughn Graham as he nears the end of his term as the 113th  chairman of the Nation's largest insurance association, the Independent  Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, also known as the Big ``I.''  He was installed as chairman of the Big ``I'' in September 2017 in  Chicago, IL, and over the past year, he has done an amazing job of  piloting the association as a strong and thoughtful leader for  independent insurance agents across the country.   Vaughn graduated from the University of Oklahoma and is currently the  president of Rich & Cartmill, Inc., headquartered in Tulsa, OK, and  with offices in Oklahoma City; Ozark, MO; Olathe, KS; and Greeley, CO.  He is a past chairman of the Independent Insurance Agents of Oklahoma,  IIAO, and has served as the Oklahoma director to the Big ``I'' national  board of directors. He was recognized in 2012 with IIAO's highest  honor, the Eagle of Excellence Award.   On the national association level, Graham has chaired the Membership  Services, Inc., board and has served on several Big ``I'' committees  and boards including the Big ``I'' advantage board, InsurPac board of  trustees, and the Large Agents and Brokers Council. In addition, he has  been engaged as a member of several insurance companies' agent advisory  councils.   I would also like to recognize Candace Graham, Vaughn's esteemed  [[Page S2921]]  wife. Vaughn has been married to his wife, Candace, for more than 40  years. Together, they reside in Tulsa, OK, and they have two adult  children, Hayden and Vaughn, Jr., and five grandchildren. Graham is  also active in his community with charitable and civic organizations.  He is a member of Leadership Tulsa, the Rotary Club of Tulsa, and is a  volunteer mentor to students of Celia Clinton Elementary School.   The State of Oklahoma is proud of Vaughn Graham and wishes him and  Candace well following his successful year as chairman of the Big  ``I.''                            ____________________
