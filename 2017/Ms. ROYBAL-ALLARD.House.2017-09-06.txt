 Mr. Speaker, there is no question that this  supplemental funding is needed, and needed quickly. When the response  to Harvey began in late August, the major disaster account of the  disaster relief fund had approximately $2 billion available. The  response to this catastrophe, however, is costing close to $200 million  per day. This means that despite the recent $1 billion increase into  this account, FEMA could run out of money at any time.   Therefore, the enactment of the additional $7.4 billion for the  disaster relief fund in this supplemental is critical to help meet  FEMA's immediate operational needs for Hurricane Harvey, and to allow  for the resumption of recovery payments for prior disasters such as  Sandy.   The supplemental would also provide a small reserve to ensure that  FEMA can begin responding to Hurricane Irma, or any other new disaster  that occurs between now and September 30, 2017.   It is important to note, however, that if there is significant damage  from Irma, FEMA will quickly need either an additional reprogramming of  money, a second supplemental appropriation, or both.   I applaud the majority for quickly bringing the supplemental package  to the floor with the emergency designations.    Mr. Speaker, the President's decision to rescind  DACA brings heartbreak and fear to hundreds of thousands of young  DREAMers who, regardless of their immigration status, are American in  every way.   The President's senseless and cruel action is upending their lives  and the lives of their families, and it is sending a chilling message  to our immigrant communities.   It is unbelievable that we first introduced legislation to help  DREAMers in 2001. That is 16 years ago. The fight to protect DREAMers  has gone on for far too long. Defeating the previous question will  enable us, today, to vote on the DREAM Act of 2017, which is a  bipartisan, bicameral bill that will protect our Nation's DREAMers once  and for all.   The fact is this is our chance, as Members of Congress, to fulfill  our responsibility on this serious issue. For those of my colleagues  who say they support the DREAMers but that they believe that DACA is  unconstitutional, this is your opportunity to help the DREAMers through  the legislative process.   The DREAMers did not choose to circumvent American immigration laws,  and they should not be punished for something they are not responsible  for. Today, my Republican colleagues can provide relief to these young  people by voting to bring the DREAM Act for a vote.   Protecting DREAMers is not only a moral issue, it is also an economic  issue. The President's decision to end DACA strikes a vicious blow to  our economy. Forcing hundreds of thousands of young people out of the  workforce will disrupt businesses across our Nation. California, alone,  stands to lose $11.6 billion annually, and the U.S. stands to lose a  cumulative $460 billion in GDP over the next decade if DREAMers are  removed from our economy.   As Members of Congress, we represent the American people, and the  vast majority of Americans, regardless of their political affiliation,  support our Nation's DREAMers.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we  can pass the bipartisan, bicameral DREAM Act today to enable our  DREAMers to continue contributing to our Nation without fear of  deportation from the only country they know as home.    Mr. Chairman, the FY 2018 Department of Homeland  Security funding bill addresses many bipartisan priorities, including  maintaining funding for first responder and antiterrorism grants and  the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. It provides increases above the  request for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Nonprofit  Security grants, new Coast Guard assets, and ICE child exploitation  investigations. It also restores funding for Science and Technology  Centers of Excellence.   The bill restores funding for flood mapping grants, which the  administration proposed to eliminate, and funding for pre-disaster  mitigation grants, for which the administration proposed a 60 percent  cut. These grants support precisely the kinds of programs that help  communities mitigate and prepare for the impacts of natural disasters  like Hurricane Harvey, and we should be investing in them even more.   The bill also provides the President's request for the Disaster  Relief Fund. We will, however, need to appropriate more money beyond  that approved by the House earlier today in order to address the damage  caused by Harvey and, potentially, Irma.   While there is much in this bill Democrats can support,  unfortunately, for several reasons, we cannot support this bill. For  example, we cannot support the bill's $705 million increase for  [[Page H6843]]  Interior immigration enforcement. This includes an increase of 4,676  detention beds, which is 10,000 above fiscal year 2016, and the hiring  of 1,000 additional ICE officers and agents.   The administration says its more aggressive enforcement approach is  critical to national security and public safety. In fact, ICE is now  arresting people with no criminal infractions who have lived, worked,  and paid taxes in this country for years--and even decades.   These arrests are not required for national security or public  safety. They have tragic consequences for families and communities all  over this country. The trauma being inflicted on them cannot be  overstated.   Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with a moral question as much as a legal  one. ICE has the discretion to enforce our immigration laws fairly and  justly, and Congress has the discretion to prioritize how we spend  taxpayer dollars.   Instead of overly aggressive immigration enforcement, we should be  investing more in real security vulnerabilities. These include  cybersecurity, human trafficking investigations, Coast Guard vessels  and aircraft, flood mapping, and pre-disaster mitigation.   We should invest in more Customs officers. We should restore funding  for research and laboratory facilities at the Science and Technology  Directorate and for TSA's Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement  Program. Unfortunately, we are not doing any of this.   However, before concluding, I want to take a moment to talk about the  Trump administration's announcement yesterday on ending the DACA  program.   An amendment I offered in committee to clarify the basic authority of  DHS to continue the program failed on a party-line vote. It would have  given Congress time to enact a more formal authorization and given  DREAMers the peace of mind of knowing they would not have to go back  into the shadows. With the administration's announcement yesterday,  that peace of mind has been cruelly snatched away.   We shouldn't wait 6 months to fix this problem. The majority should  bring my bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM Act, to the floor as  soon as possible so that DREAMers can continue to contribute to this  country free of the fear of being deported from the only home they  know.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to extend my appreciation for the  efforts of the subcommittee chairman, Chairman Carter, and his staff,  who worked with the minority throughout the development of this bill.  Consistent with prior years, Chairman Carter has carried out his  responsibilities honorably, fairly, and collaboratively.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to express my strong support  for the gentlewoman's amendment. As I said during general debate, the  increases of the bill for ICE's enforcement, detention, and removal  operations are excessive. They support an overly aggressive immigration  enforcement approach that is tearing apart families and communities,  and it is unnecessary for national security or public safety.   The cut to ICE operations in support by this amendment would leave  sufficient funding for ICE to carry out its responsibilities humanely  and fairly, and the increases the amendment proposes for the Office of  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Inspector  General are clearly needed to ensure appropriate oversight of the  Department's activities. I urge my colleagues to support the Jayapal  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase  [[Page H7078]]  funding for the Coast Guard's polar icebreaker program by $850 million.  The amendment is offset by a reduction to the funding for ICE's  interior immigration enforcement.   The increases for ICE hiring and detention beds are not well  justified and do not have a security focus. In contrast, the need for  heavy icebreakers is very well documented.   A recent report from the National Academy of Sciences warned that  ``the United States has insufficient assets to protect its interests,  implement U.S. policy, execute its laws, and meet its obligations in  the Arctic and Antarctica because it lacks adequate icebreaking  capability.''   Mr. Chairman, this vulnerability exists because, currently, the Coast  Guard has only one functioning heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star. Built  in 1976, it is well past its 30-year expected operational life. It no  longer has the reliability we need, and the cost to maintain it will  continue to rise.   Currently, its primary mission is to clear a path through the ice to  our research facilities in Antarctica. This means the only icebreaking  asset we have in the Arctic is the Coast Guard's only medium class  icebreaker, the Healy.   The Polar Star is expected to continue functioning for just 3 to 7  years. This will leave the United States with no heavy icebreaking  capability.   We are dangerously falling behind. Russia has 41 icebreakers focused  on the Arctic that are active or under construction, four of which are  heavy icebreakers. This puts the United States at a tremendous  disadvantage, since we are unable to operate in parts of the Arctic  Ocean for months at a time.                                time  0010    The National Academy of Sciences report goes on to recommend that:  ``The United States Congress should fund the construction of four polar  icebreakers of common design that would be owned and operated by the  United States Coast Guard.''   Mr. Chair, the fiscal year 2017 defense funding bill included $150  million for a Coast Guard heavy icebreaker as a downpayment on what is  expected to be a nearly $1 billion price tag for the first ship.  However, the National Defense Authorization Act the House passed  earlier this year includes a provision prohibiting the Pentagon from  using any fiscal year 2018 funds to acquire an icebreaker for the Coast  Guard. An amendment to strike that provision failed on a recorded vote.  The solution is to fund the next installment of funds directly through  the Coast Guard.   While the Coast Guard plans to sign an icebreaker acquisition  contract in fiscal year 2019, it will release a request for proposal in  mid-fiscal year 2018.   By providing $850 billion in this bill, enough to cover the cost of  one icebreaker, we could help the Coast Guard get the shipbuilding  started. Just think what we could accomplish here today. With this one  amendment, we can put the United States on a path to securing our  sovereign interests in the Arctic region.   We cannot afford to delay any further. I urge my colleagues to vote  for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to emphasize the fact  that my amendment still leaves ICE with enough money for 30,000  detention beds. They still have the capability to address the needs in  their duties.   I also want to emphasize the fact that although the money is not  going to go out in fiscal year 2019, the request for proposal will be  in mid-fiscal year 2018; therefore, it is critical that those who will  be bidding on these contracts know that, in fact, there is money  available.   Finally, I just need to emphasize one more time the fact that we are  extremely vulnerable in the Arctic at this time. There are times, as I  said, where we have absolutely no presence whatsoever, while at the  same time, Russia has a continuous presence in that area.   Mr. Chair, it is critical that we support this amendment and get the  Coast Guard the icebreaker that they need.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and so does the  Coast Guard. This is not a new issue. It has to do with a particular,  underutilized commercial anchor handling tug supply vessel, the Aiviq,  which is owned by Edison Chouest Offshore, based in Louisiana.   Over the last few years, the Coast Guard has been repeatedly pushed  to lease this vessel. The Coast Guard has repeatedly made it clear that  this vessel does not have the capability to adequately fulfill its  multimission needs in the Arctic.   The question before us is whether leasing this particular vessel for  icebreaking would be a wise use of taxpayers' dollars, and whether it  would benefit the Coast Guard more than investments in other  priorities.   The Coast Guard needs a heavy icebreaker as soon as possible, but  this is not a heavy icebreaker, or even a medium icebreaker. According  to the Coast Guard, the Aiviq is underpowered for icebreaking, making  it unsuitable for ice rescue operations.   It has an inadequate fuel storage capacity and transit speed, vastly  limiting its deployment time. The Aiviq has no helicopter hangar,  making it unsuitable for patrol activities, search and rescue  operations, and self-rescue. It also has a propulsion system that lacks  redundancy and reliability, and it does not have thrusters rated for  ice operations.   Beyond the inadequacy of the vessel's base icebreaking capabilities,  the current configuration of the vessel is not suited to Coast Guard  missions. It would need to be significantly reconfigured at significant  costs. The fact that it is a commercial vessel also limits its ability  to perform all 11 Coast Guard statutory missions.   For instance, it could not conduct right-of-visit boardings, or  engage in freedom of navigation exercises that are critical to  protecting U.S. sovereignty. And it would be vulnerable to right-of- visit boarding by foreign warships under international law.   The owner of the Aiviq has proposed a 7-year lease of the vessel,  costing $35 million to $40 million per year. The cost, however, would  be much higher considering the cost of reconfiguration.   While this amendment would not force the Coast Guard to sign a lease  for the Aiviq, it seems intended to push the Coast Guard down that  path. Taking $5 million from the operating expenses account for sea  trials would detract from the Coast Guard's operational needs.   If the owner of the Aiviq or any other private interests want the  Coast Guard to seriously consider the use of their vessels for  icebreaking, they should be the ones paying for any ice trials. We  should not be making the Coast Guard pay for it, and we should not be  pushing the Coast Guard to enter into a lease arrangement that it does  not want and that is not a good investment in helping the Coast Guard  carry out its critical missions.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Earlier this evening, the same amendment was  soundly defeated twice on this floor, so I am not sure why there is a  need to go over the same worn ground again.   The Davis-Bacon Act is a longstanding law that ensures workers on  federally funded construction projects are reasonably paid, no less  than the wages paid for similar work in the local community. It is  simply a matter of fairness that we ensure that the Federal Government  pays fair wages for an honest day's work.   Mr. Chairman, I have heard the gentleman from Iowa suggest that  Davis-Bacon's history is linked to discrimination. But I believe he may  be misinformed in thinking that it was the cause and not the solution.   In 1927, a contractor who was employing African-American workers was  building a Veterans Bureau hospital. Congressman Bacon found that there  were very serious issues related to the pay of low wages and the  discrimination against the wages of migrant workers. He introduced  Davis-Bacon initially to help make sure that these construction workers  would be paid the prevailing wages in their community. As I said, these  workers happened to be African American.   I urge all of my Members to, once again, vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the House has already voted twice  against this amendment today, and I hope it will do so again.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    This is not an appropriate amendment for inclusion  in an annual spending bill. The  [[Page H7086]]  Coast Guard opposes the amendment because their mission to protect  natural resources is not specific to individual regulations.  Enforcement limitations on specific regulations would place a  significant burden on the Coast Guard.   In addition, Congress should not be in the business of micromanaging  fish conservation. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is  an interstate commission which allows Atlantic Coast States to  collectively manage the conservation of their shared coastal fishery  resources. We should allow the Commission to do its job in managing  fish stocks.   Congress shouldn't second-guess them and micromanage fish regulations  in particular locations. There is a process in place for addressing  these issues at the regional level, and we should allow that process to  work.   Currently, the consensus position of the Commission is that the  fishing restrictions should remain in place and the stock assessment  for striped bass is planned for next year. This ban was put in place  after going through the Federal rulemaking process. If a change is  needed, it should follow the same process.   I believe this amendment places an undue burden on the Coast Guard,  and it is bad precedent for Congress to interfere with a State-driven  process. For these reasons, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we should allow the Atlantic States  Marine Fisheries Commission to do its job, and I continue to oppose  this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, under the OMB directive from 2007,  all Federal agencies are already required to use the E-Verify system to  confirm the employment eligibility of new hires. Beyond Federal  employees, a 2008 executive order and a Federal acquisition regulation  already require that employees of Federal contractors also be verified  as eligible to work through E-Verify, so my opposition to this  amendment is primarily on the basis that it is unnecessary.   Given that the current administration has proposed making the use of  E-Verify mandatory for private sector hiring, it just doesn't seem  likely that it would somehow weaken the current requirement for the  Federal Government to use the system. This funding limitation simply is  not needed.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
