 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, millions and millions of people will  breathe a bit easier on January 20. That relief will be especially  sweet for those who suffered under Donald Trump's coldhearted approach  to immigration and asylum.   The President has built a wall to immigrants, but it is not made of  fencing or brick and mortar. The President has rebuilt the infamous  paper wall, like that of the 1930s, which kept too many Jews out of the  United States, trapping them within the murderous regime of Nazi  Germany.   The paper wall was built on anti-migrant regulations, including one  targeting anybody who might become a so-called public charge. It was  reinforced by racism, anti-Semitism, and nativism. It created  bureaucratic roadblocks that had no purpose other than to frustrate  applicants, block visas and refugees, and slow immigration to a  trickle. That is awfully familiar to those who watched Donald Trump  succeed horribly at repeating some of America's worst immigration  mistakes.   In the last 4 years, I have often thought about my late mom and dad  who were refugees to America. My parents were German Jews who fled the  Nazis.   Not all of our family got out. My great-uncle, Max, was one of the  last to be gassed at Auschwitz.   When my father arrived here at 13, he barely spoke any English. He  studied hard. When the war came, my dad, who wasn't exactly built like  Captain America, wanted more than anything to wear the uniform of the  U.S. Army. My dad essentially talked his way into the service. He  joined the Army's psychological warfare division because, with his  fluent German, my dad wrote propaganda pamphlets that our planes  dropped on the enemy soldiers that were retreating further and further  back toward Berlin.   I have seen those pamphlets, and--with a little son pride--they were  smoking. They just told the Nazis they didn't have a chance. In  contrast, the materials their military dropped on our soldiers was  written in mangled English--comical stuff. My dad has really been  singled out. He is in the Holocaust Museum for his contributions for  helping our Army beat the Nazis, and after the war, he became a  journalist and an author.   My mom came in 1939, a few years after my dad. During the war, she  served in the Women's Army Corps. She was in England, France, and  Germany, and on the wall at home is a picture of my mom in her WAC  uniform. You can look at that picture, and you can see pride in serving  our country from every single pore.   After the war, my mom had a long career as a research librarian, and  she worked even harder raising her oldest son, who mostly wanted to  play NBA basketball instead of hitting the books.   Both my parents felt so blessed that they could get out of Germany.  They made it over the paper wall. They had a chance to become  Americans.   Most Jewish families in the United States have stories just like  these. Some were able to get out; others were left behind, and some  were lost.  [[Page S7479]]    Many remember the MS St. Louis, a ship with nearly 1,000 refugees-- mostly Jewish--fleeing Germany in 1930. Originally, they sailed for  Cuba, but they were turned away when they reached Havana. Then they  tried to come to America. They got so close. They could see the lights  shining in Miami, but again they were turned away and sailed back to  Europe. Hundreds of them died in death camps. Many more lives like  those aboard the St. Louis could and should have been saved, but the  paper wall--that paper wall--kept too many people out.   In 2020, caring people looked back and recognized that paper wall and  our failure to save more people from execution at the hands of the  Nazis. It was a staggering humanitarian disaster, a real stain on  American history.   Donald Trump and his advisers, on the other hand, must look back and  see the paper wall as a big success, a playbook for  their administration. Under Donald Trump, the policy of the United  States on immigration, asylum, and refugees--sum it up in one word:  cruelty. Trump's worst legacy on asylum and refugee policy, without a  doubt, is the kidnapping and abuse of youngsters--children--locking  them in cages, losing track of them, and losing track of their parents.  It is the forced sterilization of women in the custody of the U.S.  Government. It is violating U.S. law and international treaties to turn  asylum seekers into criminals.    I went to the border to see for myself what Trump's family separation  policies looked like in practice. When you see it, you never forget.   I met a migrant woman who was almost 9 months pregnant and suffering  complications. A pediatrician from Oregon who came with me was  concerned that this woman's life was in danger, as well as her unborn  child. She had been stopped at the border, along with her husband and  their 3-year-old son, even though she had a legal right--a legal  right--to make an asylum claim.   Our pediatrician, who worried that the woman was going to go into  labor right there, had to make a judgment call about what we ought to  do. So, fortunately, we got her case before the right border  authorities. She was able to make her asylum claim, get medical care,  and keep her family together.   At the time, I saw a little boy who had been detained for several  nights in a cold, cramped cell--they call them iceboxes--and then sent  back to Mexico. This youngster was so traumatized at the border that he  became entirely nonverbal and afraid of adults. His father held my hand  and cried, and he told us how helpless he felt as a parent. I will  never forget that experience.   Children and parents on the southern border are experiencing the  worst of Donald Trump's hostility, but it doesn't end there. His  administration has relentlessly attacked and squeezed the traditional  systems of immigration and humanitarian assistance and refugee  resettlement as well. A lot has gone into this paper wall. Anti- immigration policies have bookended the Trump 4 years. One of their  first new policies out of the gate was the Muslim ban, which was a  nightmare for many immigrants and immigrant families.   Now, in Donald Trump's final days, his administration has made the  citizenship exam twice as hard and twice as long. Reportedly, questions  were rewritten with Trump-friendly political bias and tricky language  designed to trip people up. There wasn't any discussion about any exams  here in Congress. When you read the old version of the test that  existed before the Trump meddling, it was pretty darn challenging.  There is no good-faith explanation for the changes. It was only about  making it harder--making it harder to become an American.   Through his years in office, Donald Trump steadily lowered the cap on  refugees allowed in the country. For 2021, he set it at the lowest  number ever.   Then there is the DACA Program, Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrival. We talked here in the Senate about the Dreamers, and when the  program was created, there was a promise made that it would be OK for  the Dreamers to come out of the shadows. You could apply without fear  and have your application renewed in 2 years. I think the government  has a moral obligation to keep the promise. Not on Donald Trump's  watch--if not for court orders, DACA would be dismantled by now.   There are more than 11,000 hard-working young people in my home State  that are DACA recipients. I have talked with a lot of them. They come  to my townhall meetings. We meet on campus and meet in coffee shops.   Not long after the pandemic hit, one young Oregon DACA recipient  started working with COVID patients. She just wanted to help during the  pandemic--coordinating tests, working on followup, contact tracing.  What a wonderful person doing essential work during the pandemic, but  her temporary DACA status ran out just when the Trump administration  blocked renewals. Fortunately, my staff and I were able to help her  reapply and retain her status so she could keep working in the only  place she ever called home.    The harsh reality is there are thousands and thousands of young  Dreamers who have been faced with the same panic of losing their  status, being ripped from their homes and deported. The fact is, Donald  Trump has used these Dreamers like pawns.   Recently, he dusted off the public charge rule, using the past to  discriminate against Jewish refugees. I consider it a wealth test for  immigrants--a cruel system that pushes vulnerable immigrant families  into destitution.   In Oregon, right now, it means that there are families who are just  afraid to seek assistance they are entitled to receive, afraid to seek  emergency medical assistance during a pandemic, and afraid to seek  disaster relief after huge wildfires. These families--we talk to them-- they desperately need help. They are members of Oregon's collective  community, but they can't get it because they are fearful they will be  labeled a ``public charge.''   Donald Trump revoked protected immigration status from hundreds of  thousands of U.S. residents originally from countries ravaged by war,  famines, and epidemics. Many of those people who have lived here for  decades had planted deep roots. Nothing is accomplished by revoking  their status and deporting them, other than shattering their lives and  weakening their communities.   Then, the Trump administration adopted a ``no blanks'' policy so they  could reject applications for visa and asylum if there were just simple  paperwork errors. For example, let's say an only child filling out a  visa application leaves a blank where it asks for details on siblings-- they could be rejected. Even simple errors that mean nothing--writing  in a dash instead of an ``N/A'' for an inapplicable question--leads to  rejection. The policy, here again, has resulted in huge cuts to  immigration and asylum.   During the pandemic, the Trump administration denied COVID relief to  tax-paying, law-abiding American immigrants who secure America's food  supply or save lives as frontline healthcare workers.   Next, there is a sabotage of the system of printing documents for  immigrants, including green cards that allow residents to work and go  to school. This affected tens of thousands, again, who did nothing  wrong. Some of them were newly approved applicants, many others were  longtime U.S. residents replacing green cards that were expired or  lost. If an immigrant's green card expires, and they don't have the  replacement, they are out of luck and technically in a kind of legal  never-never land. It is all because Donald Trump wanted to break the  system just to cause harm.   Now let's talk about those who work alongside our military overseas.  You would think that if there were any group--any group--whose  immigration status got a special level of care from our government, it  would be those whose lives are in danger in their home country because  they served courageously alongside our forces. That has not been the  case under Donald Trump.   For example, there have been reports on an Afghan pilot on the run  from the Taliban because his clearance to relocate in the United States  was reversed. The U.S. Army pilot who trained him said:         He's marked as a dead man. He's done all he can there. . .       . If anyone needs to be a U.S. citizen, it's him.    But the Trump administration, which initially approved his  relocation, went back on its word. This pilot is now reportedly in  hiding with his wife and their 4-year-old daughter. They are among tens  of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis whose lives are in danger  [[Page S7480]]  waiting for the U.S. Government to decide on their immigration status.   The number of these courageous individuals brought to the United  States has plummeted under Donald Trump, again, because of this anti- immigrant bias.   I remember the late-Senator John McCain speaking often about why our  country needed to protect those who helped our men and women in battle.  John McCain said it wasn't just a moral issue but also a national  security issue. He said: Won't it be harder to get people to help our  soldiers in the future if America abandons those who have helped us in  the past? For Donald Trump, it seems hostility toward immigrants  overrides even America's national security.   Donald Trump has often claimed he supports immigration. He once  hijacked a naturalization ceremony, which is supposed to be a solemn  event, no politics. He stole that moment from the group of people  becoming citizens so he could go on and on about false claims about his  position on immigration. He said he wanted ``tremendous numbers of  people to go in.''   Over the last, I guess, 8 or so minutes, I have proved that sure is  not true. The reality is, Donald Trump cut legal immigration in half.  If I were to walk through every cruel and inhumane thing this  administration has done to immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, we  would be standing here until the beginning of January.   It is going to be hard work dismantling Donald Trump's paper wall,  but it is a must-do for the President and Vice President-elect. I know  they agree.   I want to close my remarks by talking a little bit about why  immigration matters. As an Oregonian, I can tell that you that Oregon  is clearly stronger today because of our openness to immigrants and  refugees and asylum seekers. We call it, at home--people hear me talk  about it here--the Oregon Way. It is about fundamental decency. There  is no other way to describe the Oregon Way than those two words,  ``fundamental decency.''   Here is an example of how the Oregon Way collides with the Trump  policies pertaining to visas. Twelve years ago, an Iraqi boy named  Mustafa came to Oregon to receive badly needed medical care. He was  very injured. He lost a leg during the U.S. bomb strike. He needed  complicated surgeries that couldn't get done in Iraq, so a group of  Oregonians worked with a nonprofit to bring him to my hometown of  Portland.    Mustafa got good care and was able to go home. The plan was for him  to come back to Oregon, periodically, for ongoing treatment. Back home  in Iraq, however, communication was difficult, and his family was  displaced by Islamic State militants.   Miraculously, in 2016, Oregonians recognized Mustafa on the TV news  from a refugee camp outside Fallujah. It was clear he still dealt with  serious health problems. Again, Oregon citizens and nonprofits went to  bat for him. Again, they worked to bring him to the United States for  care, except this time--this time, the Trump administration closed the  door to Iraqis. They were out of luck.   My staff and I got involved, and together with all of these dedicated  Oregonians, we were able to work with the Embassy and get key officials  to get a temporary visa for Mustafa and his mom. He got the lifesaving  care he needed. The Oregon Way actually beat back Trump's hostility to  immigration.   Now, supporting immigration is not just the decent thing to do, it is  also the smart thing to do for our economy. My State is a perfect  example. From the high-tech economy in the ``Silicon Forest'' to our  wonderful family farms all across the State, immigrants contribute  every day to our economy.   Nationwide, on average, communities with more immigrants have  stronger and more dynamic economies. Immigrants are more likely than  those born in the United States to participate in the labor force.  Immigrants are more likely to own a small business. Immigrants are more  likely to move for employment and take jobs that otherwise go unfilled.  Those immigrants, plug gaps in our economy. They plug gaps in our job  market. Immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs. Their kids are  more likely to want to just work and work and work, and they have shown  that they are more likely to climb the economic ladder.   Immigration has also proven to be a big economic and population boost  for our rural communities, which too often, in too many parts of the  country, somehow look like people just are willing to turn them into  economic sacrifice zones, compared to the focus on the cities and  suburbs.   Our colleges and universities desperately need more foreign-born  students. Most foreign-born students pay full sticker price and  subsidize the students born in the United States. Due to COVID and  anti-migrant policies, fewer and fewer international students come to  study in American schools. They are choosing to study in other  countries instead. And you can bet those other countries are happy to  welcome the bright minds at our expense and let them find a way to help  their economies.   Our schools struggle to keep the doors open under these conditions.  They have managed to block some Trump policies that are particularly  harmful to students. I am very proud that my alma mater, the University  of Oregon, led one of those lawsuits.   But still, many schools are likely to close. And if there are fewer  international students coming here who are subsidizing Americans, the  price that American-born students pay for a college education goes up.  It is legislative malpractice for the lawmakers to allow that to happen  when it is a crisis you know is headed this way. It is, obviously, in  our interest to be a magnet for the best and the brightest.   Immigrants also protect vital safety net programs that Americans care  so deeply about. With 10,000 people reaching retirement age every day,  our country needs more workers, more people paying into Social  Security, more people paying into Medicare, welcoming into the country  more working-age people who can help shore up those trust funds. It can  help to protect the Medicare guarantee and help ensure that Social  Security pays full benefits. It is a big mistake to pass up that  opportunity.   Finally, the economic boost isn't the biggest reason to support  immigration. The biggest reason is immigration is about our national  character; it is about our common history. Our country was founded by  people with courage and audacity, people who picked up their lives and  crossed oceans to start something new. Who are we to turn away all  those who would follow in their footsteps? Welcoming immigrants from  around the world makes us more youthful and resilient. It honors our  founding.   America has always been a land of opportunity. It is why my parents  loved the United States so deeply after they arrived here as frightened  youngsters fleeing the worst of humanity. Decades later, because of the  opportunity this country handed my parents, their son--a first- generation Jewish kid--has the honor of standing on the floor of the  U.S. Senate, the honor of representing Oregon in the U.S. Senate. And  what an honor it is to be able to be here this morning to talk about  why the Wyden family is so grateful to the United States of America. If  someday people around the world no longer see the United States as a  land of opportunity, we will have strayed from America's character and  purpose.    For now, the good news is that Donald Trump's Presidency ends next  month. The attacks on our immigration system and on people who dream of  becoming Americans will be nothing more than the angry tweets from a  man voted out of office.   With the end of the Trump era, the United States can tear down the  Trump paper wall and rebuild the coalition of Americans from all across  the political spectrum who value the contributions of immigrants and  who care for asylum seekers and refugees. It is an important part of  what makes America so special.   I yield the floor, and I believe we have another speaker.
