 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the achievement of  Detroit's Foreign Language Immersion and Cultural Studies School's  Middle School Robotics Team's outstanding performance in competition  this year.   The team is Detroit public schools' first team in more than 30 years  to travel to the For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and  Technology International Championship. Later this month, the FLICS  Robotics Team will be taking on the best teams from all over the world  in this high-stakes,  4-day competition.   Team Techno Phoenix has worked hard and persevered in competition  throughout the season, including an outstanding performance at our  State championship.   I am so incredibly proud of this group of young people who have  invested time and energy into this challenging pursuit.   Congratulations, FLICS' Team Techno Phoenix. We will cheer Team  Techno Phoenix on as they enter the first international competition on  our behalf.           Celebrating Renaissance High School's Chess Championship     Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a heartfelt congratulations  to the members of the Detroit Renaissance High School's Chess Team on  their first-place victory in the Under 800 category at the U.S. Chess  Federation's K-12 National Championship.   For 4 grueling days, the team competed in high-stakes chess matches  with teams from all across the country. Their victory is a testament to  long hours of practice, focus, and determination. The team displayed  critical thinking and strategic skill, beating more than 60 other  teams.   This victory is Renaissance High School's first-ever chess national  championship.   Please join me in recognizing the Renaissance High School Chess Team  for their accomplishment.   Congratulations.                         Yemen's Humanitarian Crisis     Mr. Speaker, I welcome the recent progress made towards  peace in Yemen.   Now we must focus aggressively on addressing the humanitarian crisis  to support the Yemeni people; 14.8 million are starving right now.   The recent progress and statements from those involved offer new hope  that peace in Yemen is possible, but obstacles still remain that  require engagement from this Congress and from President Biden.   We cannot allow our hope for the current peace talks to distract us  from the massive ongoing humanitarian crisis. We can do both.   Mr. Speaker, a month ago, I led two dozen of our colleagues here in  requesting at least $1.2 billion in U.S. humanitarian aid to Yemen in  the upcoming budget. Over half a million children right now may die  from malnutrition and starvation this year if we do not act. It is that  simple. And when we act, the world is listening and watching.   A significant increase in U.S. assistance to Yemen would cause  countries to follow our lead, meaning our investment will have far  greater impact. We must make sure that our message is clear, that we as  a country cannot stand on the sidelines and allow Yemen to starve.   If this diplomatic process breaks down, I am prepared to work with my  colleagues to introduce new legislation to end this awful war.   Mr. Speaker, I again recognize all those that have lost their lives  during this war, and I recognize those on whom it has had a long- lasting impact.                             Celebrating Ramadan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one of the first Muslim women  ever elected to the United States Congress. I am here always making  sure that we have a voice here in Congress.   Tomorrow is the holy month of Ramadan. I offer a wonderful greeting  to all of my neighbors across the country that are observing Ramadan  and wish them Ramadan Mubarak. I hope that they find joy with their  family as they celebrate this holy month and celebrate Eid tomorrow  with their children.  [[Page H1850]]    This is something that we are going to see celebrated all over the  world. It is a beautiful end-of-month celebration to reflect and to  find peace and connection with a higher God.   I thank all my Muslim neighbors who are celebrating Ramadan for  allowing me to be here and be a voice for them in Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am up here celebrating the end of the holy  month of Ramadan. Ramadan is a time for Muslims around the world to  renew our faith and reflect our shared values of unity, generosity, and  compassion.   As we finish this holy month of fasting, I recognize the beautiful  Muslim community, my beautiful Muslim neighbors, and Michigan's 12th  District Strong, and around the world as we celebrate Eid al-Fitr. Eid  al-Fitr is known as the Festival Breaking the Fast, Mr. Speaker, and it  marks the end, again, of the holy month.   It is a time when Muslims, again, around the world come together to  celebrate the end of the month-long fasting and their spiritual  reflection.   Mr. Speaker, from my heart to yours, I hope this Eid brings everyone  that is celebrating joy, closer to community, and prosperity.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today and applaud the President. The  President's recent announcement of a plan that would allow more than  800,000 Dreamers across our county to have access to healthcare is to  be applauded.   I also thank Congresswoman Ramirez for her dedication and leadership  and for hosting this important Special Order on this critical issue.   I stand here before you as a child of immigrants but also the  daughter of southwest Detroit, where I lived with 20 different  ethnicities and backgrounds. Yes, many of my friends, many of my  classmates, were Dreamers.   We know that many of the issues we work on in this Chamber are  connected. Immigration is connected to healthcare. Right now, in our  country, we have a great need for comprehensive immigration reform and  to ensure that every person has access to adequate healthcare in terms  of coverage and care delivery.   As somebody who worked on immigration issues and immigration justice,  I know that our system is broken. Too many of our families are living  in fear. Too many Dreamers, our neighbors who only know the United  States as their home, continue to live a life where their rights could  be stripped at any moment.   I know how important it is to fix our broken immigration system  instead of tearing families apart. Dreamers right here in our country  deserve permanent protections and a dignified pathway for citizenship.   No human being, Mr. Speaker, is illegal. We must protect our  neighbors. We must protect those who are here simply because they want  to have a better quality of life.   We have immigrant communities, again, across our country who simply  want a pathway to citizenship, a pathway that many of our parents,  grandparents, and ancestors were afforded, a pathway that we enjoy and  are proud of.                                time  1745    Why do many of my colleagues want to block this pathway in the land  of opportunity?   I am not sure. However, I know I applaud the administration's action  to ensure that many Dreamers have access to healthcare. I implore  President Biden and many of my colleagues in this Chamber and in the  Senate to reject divisive and xenophobic immigration policies that,  again, do not move our country forward in a way that we can be proud  of.   We cannot and should not embrace rhetoric and policies that only seek  to pit communities against each other, tear families apart, and put  immigrants in harm's way here in the United States and in their country  of origin.   We must choose to be a welcoming country. We must work to create a  robust pathway to citizenship. We must enact comprehensive immigration  reform. We must ensure that every person in our country has  comprehensive adequate healthcare. We must also pass Medicare for All.   Mr. Speaker, I am ready to get to work, and I cannot thank my amazing  Progressive Caucus members enough, especially Congresswoman Ramirez,  for this important Special Order.
