 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate and thank  Lisa Elijah, who has been serving as a HillVets fellow in my office  this year. Lisa, an Air Force veteran, has been an asset to the people  of Arizona, to the U.S. Congress, and to my staff.   Arizona is home to nearly half a million veterans, making up almost 9  percent of the State. We pride ourselves on our strong connection with  the military and take seriously the responsibility to care for our  troops after they retire. Serving Arizona veterans is paramount in our  office, and handling veterans' affairs issues is one of the most  challenging and demanding portfolios for my team.   In the year she has worked in my office, Lisa has become an essential  member of the staff and a valued liaison with the Arizona veteran  community. As part of my policy team, Lisa has participated in dozens  of meetings and was the primary point of contact for organizations and  government Agencies on veterans' policy. She has assisted in making  informed recommendations on veterans' legislation, cosponsorships, and  meeting preparation. She has helped us draft thoughtful and influential  policy that I know will help the servicemembers and families of  Arizona, including legislation designed to improve the VA Family  Caregivers Program.   Moreover, Lisa has gone above and beyond, taking the helm of our  veterans' affairs team for several months, including coordinating with  a legislative correspondent, policy adviser, and our State-based  veterans outreach team across three geographically distinct offices. In  this role, she has engaged with key stakeholders in the veteran's  community, including grassroot organizations, government Agencies, and  other interested parties. She also took the lead on preparing me for  hearings in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, preparing talking  points, background material, and working with committee staff on  legislation.   I know that Lisa's work for veterans is not yet concluded. Her future  position that will allow her to continue her work for veterans in  Arizona and throughout the Nation. I am excited to see her continued  success.   I am incredibly proud of the work Lisa Elijah accomplished throughout  this challenging year. She has set an outstanding example for others,  and my team and I will miss her.                            ____________________
