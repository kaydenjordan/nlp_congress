 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank his wife,  Lisa McGovern, for being a great support to my wife.   I rise today in opposition to this rule. It is not just because I am  opposed to our policy of refueling planes into Yemen, refueling Saudi- led planes. It is because of our view, a bipartisan view, of the place  of Congress, Congress' Article I of the Constitution. It is Congress'  responsibility and duty to have a public debate about our foreign  policy, about who we ought to be arming, who we ought to be intervening  in overseas. We are abdicating that responsibility.   My amendments would have been very simple. They would have said that  this body should debate whether we should be refueling Saudi-led  airplanes that are leading to civilian deaths in Yemen, that are  causing civil war in Yemen, a Saudi coalition that is aligned with al- Qaida in Yemen, and al-Qaida has hurt the United States.   Why wouldn't we debate this on the floor of the United States  Congress? Why wouldn't we have transparency and let the American public  weigh in on whether this policy is making us more safe and is upholding  human rights?   It is with great disappointment that we are not having this debate in  the United States Congress. I believe it is an abdication of our  responsibility to the oath we take to uphold the Constitution.
