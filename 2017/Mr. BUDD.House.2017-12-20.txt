 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4015. I thank  Chairman Duffy for his leadership on this bipartisan piece of  legislation, which will improve our country's shareholder proxy system.   Since the early 2000s, we have seen market share and the shareholder  proxy system consolidate, essentially, into a duopoly, as two firms  control 97 percent of the market, so, under the current system,  potential conflicts of interest abound.   For example, proxy advisory firms that provide voting recommendations  to advisers often provide consulting services to those same public  companies. So wouldn't it make sense that they at least notify their  shareholders of this potential conflict of interest?   Well, right now, while the SEC has offered guidance on this problem,  the proxy firm wouldn't be required to do so. We need to get this bill  on the books just to address this problem.                                time  1345    This bill is also timely because we have seen proxy firms align  themselves with political causes, unions, and interest groups that do  not always represent their shareholders' best interests. Shareholders  oftentimes aren't even aware of these conflicts. Again, reform is  needed.   So it should go without saying, Mr. Speaker, that the two problems  outlined above pose problems for the shareholder and for the average  investor. We cannot continue to allow the security laws and processes  to be wrapped in a service of political agenda.   Mr. Speaker, we have dealt with this issue in the Financial Services  Committee on a number of fronts with regard to disclosure of  information that is being weaponized against public companies, from  mining to conflict minerals. It is time to deal with the proxy issue  today.   The number of public companies has fallen in recent years. It was  never easy to be public, to be subject to the financial markets and the  pressures that come from being accountable to your shareholders. This  issue, the proxy issue, is part of a larger tapestry of challenges that  public companies face. They are increasingly choosing not to play the  game. They are getting capital from dark pools; they are getting  capital from hedge funds; and they are just staying private. That puts  investment opportunities in the hands of the 1 percent, and that leaves  retail investors out in the cold.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents and North Carolina shareholders are from  the part-time trader to the full-time trader. They deserve better than  this. Luckily, this body can do something to address these problems,  and that is where Chairman Duffy's bipartisanship legislation comes  into play. His bill will bring about much-needed accountability,  competition, and, most importantly, transparency in the proxy advisory  firm industry.   This bill also protects clients and their financial future from being  influenced by activists and outside interest groups. His legislation  accomplishes this by mandating that proxy advisory firms register with  the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest to the shareholders,  and make their methods for coming up with proxy recommendations  available to the public.   Two proxy advisory firms should not have this much control of the  marketplace and the power to disproportionately affect fundamental  corporate transactions. This bill is a win for the consumer, a win for  the free market, and should be a bipartisan priority for this body.   A number of outside commentators have been clear that the proxy  industry has gained a worrisome degree of authority over companies. In  fact, Columbia Law Professor Jeffrey Gordon said that the burden of  annual voting would lead investors, particularly institutional  investors, to farm out evaluation of most pay plans to a handful of  proxy advisory firms who, themselves, will seek to economize on those  very proxy review costs. There are a host of others who are saying  these same things about the way things are today in proxy voting.   Ultimately, the shareholder is the one who suffers. We should put a  stop to it.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank Chairman Duffy for leading  the fight on this issue, and I urge adoption of his legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), an invaluable member of  the Financial Services Committee.
