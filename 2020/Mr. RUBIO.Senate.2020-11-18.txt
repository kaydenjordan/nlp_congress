 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a veteran-owned  small business known for excellence and outstanding craftsmanship. This  week, it is my pleasure to recognize Boyd Industries, Inc., of  Clearwater, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2012, Adrian LaTrace purchased Boyd Industries, a dental and  medical equipment manufacturing company that was established in 1957 as  a custom residential furniture manufacturer. Founder William Boyd  pioneered the lounge-style dentistry chair, now a standard feature in  dental offices nationwide. As ``sit-down'' dentistry became more  common, Boyd Industries reinvented itself as a cabinet, medical chair,  and exam equipment manufacturer.   More than 60 years later, owner and CEO Adrian LaTrace has continued  Boyd Industries' tradition of innovation and growth. A native of the  Fort Walton Beach-Destin area, Adrian graduated from The Citadel before  serving 8 years in the U.S. Air Force. Under his leadership, Boyd has  remained committed to its core values of integrity, respect,  innovation, loyalty, and dependability. Veterans are the heart of Boyd  Industries' workforce, with servicemembers from four branches of the  military currently represented at the company.   Attention to detail and high-quality craftsmanship have earned Boyd  Industries a reputation for excellence. They are widely regarded as the  top oral and implant surgery equipment provider in the nation. Notably,  Boyd Industries manufactures the majority of its product components at  its Clearwater facility. Additional components are sourced from U.S.- based companies, and Boyd assembles all products in-house.   Under Adrian's leadership, Boyd Industries has earned industry awards  and invested in its community. High-quality products have earned Boyd  Industries the Townie Choice Award for 8 consecutive years. Laird  Plastics recognized Boyd Industries with the Environmental Excellence  Award from 2015-2018, citing its increased recycling and  sustainability. Collaborating with the American Association of Oral and  Maxillofacial Surgeons and the American Association of Orthodontists,  Boyd Industries has contributed to developing orthodontist training and  best practices, and furnished dental residency training facilities.  Additionally, Boyd Industries regularly donates surplus cabinetry to  Habitat for Humanity and has supported the Clearwater Free Clinic for  decades.   As an essential business, Boyd Industries managed to stay open, keep  their employees safe, and adapt to the challenges caused by the  coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the SBA launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, a small business relief program I was proud to  author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses  and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the coronavirus  pandemic. Despite experiencing a drop in revenue, a PPP loan enabled  Boyd Industries to retain 77 jobs.   Boyd Industries exemplifies the critical importance of small  businesses in the medical manufacturing industrial base. Their  outstanding craftsmanship and continual innovation are commendable.  Congratulations to Adrian and the entire team at Boyd Industries, Inc.  I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
