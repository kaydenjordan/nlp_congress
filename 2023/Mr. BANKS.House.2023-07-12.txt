 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his  incredible leadership in doing everything he can to support our troops  and to keep America safe and secure.   That is why I stand here, Mr. Chairman, before you today in strong  support of this bipartisan defense bill that was voted out of committee  less than 3 weeks ago.   This bill includes Member priorities focused on taking care of our  servicemembers and their families to ensure that they are prepared to  carry out, without distraction, any mission that they are called upon  to execute.   The NDAA continues to support and improve the lives of those who  sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by supporting a military  basic pay raise of 5.2 percent, authorizing a budgetary change to  reduce the 5 percent out-of-pocket housing costs for our  servicemembers, and excluding the housing allowance from household  income for the purposes of eligibility for the basic needs allowance.   This bill authorizes the establishment of the Space National Guard  and sets a new personnel management benchmark with the creation of an  innovative personnel management system for the Space Force.   The NDAA also formalizes policy that all military accessions,  assignments, selections, or promotions must adhere to merit-based  principles and that none may be based on favoritism, nepotism, or  quotas, and definitely not politics.    Mr. Chairman, this is an outstanding bipartisan bill dedicated to our  servicemembers, their families, and retirees, and gives them the tools  and support they need and deserve and have earned to execute our  Nation's security strategy.
