 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My submitted amendment, No. 91 to division G, the State and Foreign  Ops Appropriations bill, transfers $30 million to the International  Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account, or INCLE. The proposed  $30 million transfer would allow INCLE funding to remain consistent  with 2017 levels.   One notable program that INCLE assists is the Merida Initiative. As  we all here know, our Nation is reeling from an out-of-control opioid  epidemic. My district in western Pennsylvania, like so many throughout  the United States, has been particularly hard hit. According to the  DEA, overdoses in Pennsylvania rose by 37 percent last year. Attorney  General Sessions recently said that drug overdoses are the top lethal  issue in the country today.   Across the border in Mexico, our neighbor is suffering from massive  levels of violence and murder, mostly fueled by drug trafficking  organizations, and the violence levels are increasing. Mexico's monthly  murder rate has now reached a 20-year high.   Mr. Chairman, the Merida Initiative is a partnership between the  United States and the Mexican Government that combats drug cartels and  organized crime in Mexico. It also helps to strengthen the Mexican  justice system by fostering the rule of law and respect for human  rights.   Mr. Chairman, the majority of heroin and other narcotics, including  fentanyl, smuggled into the U.S. come through Mexico or pass through  it. Preventing drugs from ever crossing the border is a crucial step to  healing our Nation.   In order to reduce the flow of narcotics coming over the border, we  need to do everything we can to help our international law enforcement  partners fight drug traffickers in their own country. The United States  had previous successes with these types of drug interdiction programs,  particularly in Colombia in the 1990s. We can replicate that success in  Mexico if we invest in the INCLE and in our foreign law enforcement  allies.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should not be viewed as any  criticism of the merits of the Fulbright Program. I don't have any. But  we are talking about prioritization. The INCLE program has been cut by  $36 million.                                time  1530    We are in the throes of a catastrophic opioid epidemic in this  country, and Mexico is suffering from untold violence. The headlines  tell the story:   ``Mexico's bloody drug war is killing more people than ever.'' LA  Times, July 22, 2017.   ``26 people killed in northern Mexico gunfight as drug cartel  violence continues to rise.'' LA Times, July 5, 2017.   ``Mexico City has mostly been spared from grisly drug violence. Now  that may be changing.'' The Washington Post, July 26, 2017.   ``U.S. warns of rise in drug cartel violence in Chihuahua.'' El Paso  Times, July 7, 2017.   ``Acapulco is now Mexico's Murder Capital.'' The Washington Post,  August 24, 2017.   ``The Deadliest Assignment: Reporting in Mexico.'' CBS News, August  21, 2017.   ``Gunmen Kill Prominent Mexican Journalist Who Covered Drug Cartel.''  The New York Times, May 15, 2017.   ``Another journalist has been gunned down in Mexico--the eighth  killed this year.'' LA Times, July 31, 2017.   ``A Mexican reporter was in a program to protect journalists. He was  still killed.'' LA Times, August 23, 2017. He was the 10th journalist  killed this year.   Then, there are the headlines in my district:   ``Cambria County coroner again `sounding the alarm' as OD deaths  accelerate.'' Johnstown Tribune Democrat, February 14, 2017.   ``A young couple died of overdose, police say. Their baby died of  starvation days later.'' The Washington Post, December 25, 2016.   ``Beaver County overdose deaths still on the rise in 2017.'' Beaver  County Times, May 25, 2017.   ``Allegheny County drug overdose deaths surge to 613 in 2016,  breaking record.'' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 6, 2017.   ``Heroin overdose of 11-year-old Pittsburgh girl not a sign of  childhood epidemic, experts says.'' TribLive, May 5, 2017.   ``Mother grieves for son, asks God to `damn heroin.''' Johnstown  Tribune Democrat, March 5, 2016.   Mr. Chairman, we have budget constraints. We need to be putting the  resources where the problem is. We have an opioid epidemic in this  country. We have violence in Latin America. The funds that I seek to  move into INCLE will help to stem these crises.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, this amendment is not meant to  bring a detraction to the Fulbright Program. Even with the amendment,  the Fulbright Program will be funded at more than $200 million to  support the initiatives that the opponents to the amendment would cite.   Again, I talk about priorities. I talk about the grips of the crisis  that we are seeing in this country and our neighbor to the south,  Mexico. We need to be working together to address this problem.  Programs like the Merida Initiative are key to solving both the crisis  in Mexico and the crisis here in the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
