 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  individual fellows in my office be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the 115th Congress: Casey Dreher, Cathleen Carlson, Nick  St. Laurent, Gabe Kaptchuk, Shaanan Cohney, Roberta Kienast Daghir, and  Derek Southern.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for  eloquent remarks. I particularly want to thank my colleague from Oregon  for putting together this time to speak on issues so important to our  State, as Senator Warren has noted, and issues important to our  country. In the context of talking about Ryan Bounds, I am going to  talk about how, unfortunately, the handling of the Bounds nomination  moves the Senate even further away from what I think the Senate has  always been about, which I would describe as principled bipartisanship.  [[Page S5016]]    As I indicated, Ryan Bounds, an important judicial nominee, is being  considered as a candidate from my home State of Oregon, and we will  vote on him before the end of the week.   As I have indicated, I believe the debate about Ryan Bounds is not a  typical debate on a typical nomination for reasons I am going to  outline tonight.   In my view, it is vital that the Senate look at this nomination in a  broader context, particularly as it relates to what I call the decline  of principled bipartisanship in the Senate. I want to be clear about  what I mean when I mention the words ``principled bipartisanship'' and  the reason I describe it that way--bipartisanship born of principle.   Bipartisanship is not about taking each other's bad ideas. I see my  friend from South Dakota in the chair of the Presiding Officer of the  Senate. I wouldn't come up to him in the name of bipartisanship and ask  him to take a flawed idea, and I am quite sure he wouldn't ask that of  me because I know the Presiding Officer well enough to know he has had  an interest over the years in bipartisanship built around principle.   So bipartisanship is not about taking each other's lousy ideas; it is  about taking each other's good ideas.   The fact is, the Senate has certainly been very polarized, very  divided this session, and yet we have been able to do it when we kept  that lodestar of principled bipartisanship in mind.   If you had said in January of 2017 that the U.S. Senate would enact a  10-year Children's Health Insurance Program, an improved, expanded  Children's Health Insurance Program, I think people would have said:  You are hallucinating. It can't happen. Because my colleague, who sits  right over there, Chairman Hatch, and I talked about this was a chance  to help children and save money, we are able to do something nobody  thought was possible because both of us shared an interest in the well- being of children and cost-effective approaches in healthcare.   I know my colleague knows about this. Senator Crapo, who sits a few  seats from Chairman Hatch, and I lined up more than 270 forestry groups  because the whole system of fighting fire was broken, and we said we  have to do something very different. We have to end the incentive,  basically, for raiding the fire prevention fund to put the fire out,  and then the problem got worse. It didn't make any sense in South  Dakota; it didn't make any sense in Oregon; it didn't make any sense  anywhere, but because Chairman Crapo and I found common ground around  principles that this wasn't a cost-effective approach to discriminate  against fire prevention, and we saw how important it was to take a  balanced approach on natural resources so we could have forest health  and get fiber in the mills and protect our land, air, and water, it was  an agreement based on principled bipartisanship.   So two big issues, not immigration or trade that are in the  headlines, but an awful lot of people in America and in our part of the  world are going to benefit from the principled bipartisanship that led  to an unexpected breakthrough in terms of meeting the healthcare needs  of our children and a transformative approach--not my words, the words  of the Forest Service--in terms of fighting fire.   The fact is, the handling of these judicial nominations, and Ryan  Bounds in particular, is a break, a dramatic, sharp break from this  tradition of principled bipartisanship.   I would like to say, by the way, that in Oregon, we have followed the  idea of principled bipartisanship as it related to judicial nominations  as well. I have had the pleasure of working with two Republicans very  closely on these judicial nominations: the late Mark Hatfield, a  revered figure in Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, and my former colleague Gordon Smith, two Republicans.  Nobody ever thought Gordon Smith and I would work together.   We had a race in 1996. I won by a little bit. He won the next one.  Nobody ever thought we would work together, but we worked together on  those judicial nominations, literally, hand in glove, a Democrat and a  Republican.   Senator Merkley, who defeated Senator Smith, brought exactly the same  approach to this, and he said: Well, how did it work in the past? I  said: Well, we had a judicial selection process that was bipartisan,  and we would have all our offices represented.   I remember, when I was the junior Senator and Mark Hatfield was the  senior Senator and Bill Clinton had been elected, I said: Senator, I  can't imagine that you and I aren't going to find common ground through  our selection process and the effort to come together around judges  that make sense for our State and our country--and we did.   Year after year, that has been the case for almost 20 years. I have  been the senior Democrat in our congressional delegation. It has been  an extraordinary privilege that the people of Oregon have afforded me.  Year after year after year, we would come together not because we  always agreed on someone's philosophy or their view on a particular  issue but because we felt, in the name of fairness and principled  bipartisanship, we ought to strive to find common ground and make it  possible to generally send three nominations to the White House that a  President would pick from.   The nomination of Ryan Bounds is a total rejection of the idea of  principled bipartisanship. I am going to talk a little bit more about  how the selection process works, but I want to begin by making clear  that I am troubled by the incendiary, intolerant writings by Mr. Bounds  that came to light only after he was nominated.   I am, in fact, more troubled by the fact that he concealed those  writings from the independent and bipartisan Oregon committee that  reviews potential candidates for nomination. In my view, moving forward  with this nomination, in the face of those revelations, is going to  have regrettable and irreversible consequences. It not only tramples on  Oregon's bipartisan judicial selection process, as I am going to  outline--and my colleague from Oregon already has touched on this--it  tramples on a century-old tradition of what is just collegiality, good  relations among Senators, courtesy, allowing home State Senators to  review judicial nominations.   My view is, this approach cheapens the constitutional responsibility  of the Senate to provide or withhold advice and consent on nominees. It  has the potential to forever lower the basic standards of honesty and  decency to which the Senate holds the nominee. It will be a signal that  a nominee can conceal information the public has a right to know-- histories of prejudice and scorn that the potential nominees could find  embarrassing and disqualifying should that information come to light.   It signals that the Republican majority believes the end justifies  the means in the course of seating judges, a prospect that certainly  speaks to the larger debate the Senate is going to have on the Supreme  Court in the months ahead.   I am going to begin by walking through a number of the issues,  beginning with excerpts from the writings Mr. Bounds failed to disclose  to our bipartisan judicial selection committee.   I want to make it clear again that I find much of what was written to  be disgusting and baffling, and I am again especially concerned that it  was concealed from the committee.   First is a passage in which Mr. Bounds targeted ethnic minorities and  expressed a dripping disdain for multicultural values.   Mr. Bounds wrote:         During my years in our Multicultural Garden of Eden, I have       often marveled at the odd strategies that some of the more       strident racial factions of the student body employ in their       attempt to ``heighten consciousness,'' ``build tolerance,''       ``promote diversity,'' and otherwise convince us to partake       of that fruit which promises to open our eyes to a PC version       of the knowledge of good and evil.    Mr. Bounds said:         I am mystified because these tactics seem always to       contribute more to restricting consciousness, aggravating       intolerance, and pigeonholing cultural identities than many a       Nazi [talking about book burning.]    Now, my colleagues who are following this, I am the child of Jewish  refugees who fled Nazi terror in Germany. Not all of our family got  out. We lost family at Theresienstadt. One of our very dear family  members was gassed at Auschwitz.   To compare, as Mr. Bounds did, the work of organizations that promote  multiculturalism and tolerance here in the United States to Nazi  bookburning rallies is beyond extreme. Our diversity  [[Page S5017]]  is a core strength of America. The Constitution protects the right of  minority Americans to celebrate their diversity. Mr. Bounds clearly  doesn't see it that way.   In an even more sarcastic passage, he wrote:         The opponent is the white male and his coterie of       meanspirited lackeys: ``oreos,'' ``twinkies,'' ``coconuts''       and the like. He enjoys making money and buying material       things just to make sure that people with darker skin don't       have access to them. He enjoys killing children and revels in       the deaths of minorities. If you are white male and pro-      choice, for instance, it is often ascribed to your desire for       poor black and Hispanic women to abort their children as       frequently as possible.    These are his words--words that invent an absurd sense of victimhood  based on a fictional reading of how ethnic minorities view others.   I would just ask my colleagues, how can somebody who wrote and  published statements like those--statements that were printed in  Stanford's newspaper for anybody to read--be capable of hearing a case  involving matters of race in an impartial fashion?   After intoxicated athletes vandalized a gay pride monument at  Stanford, Mr. Bounds wrote:         We hear of sensations of personal violation and outrage and       of suspicion that male athletes and fraternity members are       bigots whose socialization patterns induce this sort of       terrorism. Perhaps all of this is true, but the castigation       of athletes and frat boys for flagrantly anti-homosexual       prejudices is predicated on a motivation for this vandalism       that has not been articulated.    He continued:         The vandals might face hate-crime charges, fraternity       members--regardless of their individually demonstrated       prejudices (or, for that matter, sexual orientation)--face       mandatory sensitivity training . . . and sensitivity       insinuates itself a little further into the fissures of our       community.    So in that passage, Mr. Bounds somehow managed to make victims out of  homophobic vandals and attack the concept of sensitivity. It is a sort  of division in American society. It is as if he believed being  sensitive to minorities who are the targets of hate and prejudice on a  daily basis was an unreasonable prospect.   Next I will turn to Mr. Bounds' views on sexual assault on campus. He  wrote:         There is nothing really inherently wrong with the       University failing to punish an alleged rapist--regardless       his guilt--in the absence of adequate certainty; there is       nothing that the University can do to objectively ensure that       the rapist does not strike again.    He continued:         Expelling students is probably not going to contribute a       great deal toward a rape victim's recovery; there is no moral       imperative to risk egregious error in doing so.    Now, I would be the first to say that a disciplinary proceeding in a  university is not a courtroom. They don't operate under the same legal  standards. However, universities that receive Federal dollars do have a  legal obligation to protect the young women on their campuses. Once  again, this is something that the nominee, Ryan Bounds, seems not to  comprehend.   So when you take these writings together--the merit of diversity, the  advancement of ethnic minorities, the protection of survivors from  sexual assault--these are issues at the heart of some of the most  significant cases that come before Federal judges. Mr. Bounds' writings  reflect that he held shocking views on these matters as a young adult-- views that he hid by concealing the writings I have touched on.   There are plenty of inflammatory examples beyond those I quoted here  today that touch on additional topics.   I hope Senators and those following this would find my judgment not  something you can debate. This is indisputably appalling stuff. I  believe, having talked to some colleagues, they might want to dismiss  the writings because they came when Mr. Bounds was a young man, and one  would certainly hope that people mature as they age. I would agree with  that if Mr. Bounds had done two things: first, if he had disclosed the  writings to our independent and bipartisan Oregon committee--in other  words, been candid with the bipartisan and independent committee like  the Oregonians who came before him for close to two decades. I don't  think that is asking too much--to be candid, to be straightforward, as  those other Oregonians who went on to distinguished service on the  Federal bench did for almost two decades. In addition to disclosing  these writings to the independent and bipartisan committee, if he had  recanted and apologized for these horrendous remarks. In my view, he  failed to take either action.   When you think about this, nobody would ask Mr. Bounds to recant  every utterance, every writing, every belief he held as a young adult.  I think we would all widely think that is unreasonable. I understand  that when there is a Republican in the White House and a Republican in  charge of the Judiciary Committee, I am not going to see eye-to-eye  with every judicial nominee who comes up for a vote. That is why I have  gone to some lengths tonight to mention that I have been the senior  Democrat for essentially two decades. Whether it be Mark Hatfield or  Gordon Smith, two very thoughtful Republicans, and now our colleague  Jeff Merkley, we have always, always tried to be deferential, tried to  find common ground in recognizing what party was in the White House and  what party controlled the Senate.   I am not asking Mr. Bounds to transform himself into Thurgood  Marshall. It is completely reasonable to expect an admission that  comparing the promotion of diversity to Nazi rallies was wrong.    I can only imagine what my late parents, both of whom fled the Nazis  at a very young age--and all they wanted to do was to serve in our  military, wear the uniform of the United States. My dad wrote  propaganda pamphlets that we dropped on the Nazis. I can only imagine  what my parents would say to Mr. Bounds' idea of comparing diversity to  Nazi rallies.   Dismissing the value of diversity is wrong, and insisting that it is  not worth protecting the victims of sexual assault because it is  impossible to guarantee safety from rape is wrong. Instead, Mr. Bounds  hid these writings rather than recant, take back their content.   The comments he has made since they came to light, in my view,  suggest that Mr. Bounds sees this as a matter of clumsy word choice and  youthful indiscretion. He only acknowledged it after it became a threat  to his nomination. I don't think it was a true apology. It is as if he  believed he could wave the writings off as a messy, isolated little  episode from the past.   In my view--and something I am going to talk about going forward-- nominees for the Federal bench must be held to a higher standard. If  you are up for a lifetime appointment on a powerful Federal court, you  have to be truthful and forthcoming in your nomination process. Ryan  Bounds has not, and that ought to be a reasonable judgment from what I  have outlined thus far.   Now I want to touch on the second important issue, and that is the  way this nomination has literally trampled on our bipartisan selection  process for judicial nominees.   As I have said, I am proud that for the better part of two decades,  prospective judicial nominees have been identified and vetted by our  bipartisan committee made up of Oregonians from across the State and  from all over the legal community.   As I indicated, it was especially important to me to partner with my  Republican colleagues to ensure that all sides had a voice in this  issue--in fact, even before I came to the Senate because I was the  senior Democrat in our delegation then as a Member of the House. I  always wanted to hear Senator Hatfield's views and what he thought was  in Oregon's interest.   When there is a vacancy on the bench, our selection committee  performs a thorough statewide search for candidates. It conducts very  rigorous interviews. It provides a list of recommended potential  nominees to Oregon Senators.   Senator Merkley and I review these recommendations closely, and we  respect that not everyone on the list is going to be somebody we would  have chosen ourselves. They are not all people we would agree with 100  percent. After our review, the two of us submit a short list to the  President for his consideration. For us, this is the beginning of how  we put advice and consent into practice.   When the Trump administration came to office, Senator Merkley and I  wrote to the White House Counsel to guarantee that he was aware of our  longstanding bipartisan selection process.  [[Page S5018]]    As part of the independent committee work, candidates are asked to  disclose anything from their past that could have a negative impact on  their potential nomination. It ought to be obvious to any lawyer--even  to anybody with a casual interest in American law and history--that the  incendiary writings, particularly about minorities, would qualify as  potentially threatening to a nomination. This was the exact point at  which Mr. Bounds withheld any and all information about his writings.   It is not as if Mr. Bounds simply declined to look back far enough  into his past when he was interviewed. In fact, Mr. Bounds cited  certain activities from his precollege days going back to high school  in an effort to paint a picture of diversity and tolerance. So the  reality is, he misled the committee by omitting the writings that I  have described tonight.   When his writings came to light in February, five of the selection  committee's seven members, including the chair, said they would have  changed their decision to include Mr. Bounds among their recommended  candidates. I think that is a very important statement.   It is not widely known that it will always say in the newspaper that  the distinguished President of the Senate recommended so-and-so and the  President chose his recommendation. We all know that is generally not  the case. We forward a list of individuals--usually three--that our  bipartisan committee feels would be qualified to serve on the bench.    In the case of Mr. Bounds, when his writings--the ones he neglected  to tell the committee about--came to light, five of the selection  committee's seven members, including the chairman, said that they would  have changed their decision to include Mr. Bounds among the recommended  candidates.   Our local bar association wrote that Mr. Bounds' writings ``express  insensitive, intolerant, and disdaining views toward racial and ethnic  minorities, campus sexual assault victims, and the LGBTQ community.''   The association's statement went on to say that it ``strongly  disavows the views expressed in those articles''--the ones I have read  tonight--``as racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and disparaging of  survivors of sexual assault and abuse.'' I will repeat that last part:  ``racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and disparaging of survivors of  sexual assault and abuse.''   Those are not my words. Those are the words of Mr. Bounds' local bar  association based in Portland. The association, in addition, requested  that Mr. Bounds resign from the chairmanship of its equity, diversity,  and inclusion committee, which he complied with.   Other member groups of the Oregon legal community added their voices  and urged the leaders of the Judiciary Committee to turn to other  potential nominees. The leaders of the Oregon Women Lawyers and the  Oregon Asian Pacific American Bar Association wrote the following:         These were not comments from the Twittersphere or errant       social media posts. These were well thought-out, carefully       constructed, published articles in which [Bounds] repeatedly       diminished, mocked, and advocated wholeheartedly against the       principles of inclusion for which our organizations have       fought.    That is really an important point. Mr. Bounds wasn't sitting down at  his laptop, his iPad, pounding out a couple hundred characters. He was  thinking carefully; these were published articles that he clearly had  spent a lot of time trying to get the words to reflect what was on his  mind. And people have recognized it--no 280 characters for those  articles.   The Oregon Hispanic Bar Association and the LGBT Bar Association of  Oregon wrote the following:         We believe Mr. Bounds' failure to disclose these writings--      and his conduct related to their disclosure--demonstrates Mr.       Bounds does not show the appropriate judgment and discernment       to faithfully uphold and apply the laws of the United States       of America.    These are the voices of Oregon's legal community. The nominations  process is supposed to be responsive to those voices. Apparently, none  of what I have gotten into tonight has been of any interest whatsoever  to the chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee, the majority leader, or  the White House, because they simply moved forward with the Bounds  nomination anyway. Really, there were no substantive discussions with  them at all. It appears now that the White House simply had no interest  in respecting the bipartisan, 20-year history of tackling these  nominations in a way that reflects principled bipartisanship. Mr.  Bounds was their choice from the beginning, and no revelation, no red  flag--no matter how big--was going to change him.   Our independent group of experts--people with bipartisan roots that  go back decades--had no interest in delay. But if blowing up a decades- old bipartisan tradition is bad, then blowing up a tradition that dates  back more than a century is even worse.   For 101 years, going back to Chairman Charles A. Culberson of Texas,  the Judiciary Committee has sought input from Senators on judicial  nominees from their home States. It is done by returning what are known  as blue slips. It is the definition of senatorial collegiality-- courtesy, if you will, in an effort to make sure that all felt they  were going to be heard.   The committee sends blue slips to home State Senators when a  nomination comes up. At that point, the home State Senators have a few  options. Once they review the nomination, they can return the blue slip  with a positive or negative recommendation, and the committee moves  forward. Or the home State Senators can withhold the blue slip.   Senator Merkley and I withheld our blue slips. We have not consented  to a hearing, a markup, or a debate on the floor. We have done that  because Mr. Bounds purposefully misled the independent Oregon committee  that reviewed his candidacy by concealing the disturbing writings from  his young adulthood. In my view, that is exactly the way the blue-slip  process is supposed to work.   History shows that this tradition has benefited both sides. It is a  check on the power of the President and a moderating, democratic force  on the Judiciary. It helps to ensure that administrations are not  seating flawed nominees or extremist judges whose views are simply far  from the mainstream of the lives that they have considerable power to  change, if confirmed.   In fact, let me quote a letter from the entire Senate Republican  conference sent to the last President at the very beginning of his term  in 2009. What that means is every member of the Senate Republican  caucus sent to President Obama, at the beginning of his term in 2009, a  letter with one of the very first lines saying:         Unfortunately, the judicial appointments process has become       needlessly acrimonious. We would very much like to improve       this process, and we know you would as well.    So at a time when that side of the Chamber--everybody over there--was  out of power and they had no choice but to appeal to the other party's  good will, they went ahead and struck a bipartisan chord. Their letter  described the ``shared constitutional responsibility'' in the  nominations process. They wrote that dating back to the Nation's  founding, the Senate has had ``a unique constitutional responsibility  to provide or withhold its Advice and Consent on nominations.''   They continued:         The principle of senatorial consultation (or senatorial       courtesy) is rooted in this special responsibility, and its       application dates back to the Administration of George       Washington. Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged the       importance of maintaining this principle, which allows       individual Senators to provide valuable insights into their       constituents' qualifications for federal service.    Here is the heart of the letter that came from that side of this  body:         We hope your administration will consult with us as it       considers possible nominations to the federal courts from our       states. Regretfully, if we are not consulted on, and approve       of, a nominee from our states, the Republican Conference will       be unable to support moving forward on that nominee.    So there you have the heart of the fury that we represent tonight.  When a new Democratic administration came into office, my Republican  colleagues sprang into action to defend the blue-slip process. That  letter was sent on March 2, 2009, to President Obama, and our colleague  Senator Leahy was then the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The  letter clearly indicates that Leader McConnell and his Republican  colleagues believed that nominations should not go forward without blue  slips having been returned.   That was when there was a Democrat in the Oval Office. A Democrat  held the  [[Page S5019]]  gavel in the Judiciary Committee. They had the power to tell the  Republicans in the minority to get lost; take a hike. Democrats did no  such thing.   We upheld the blue-slip tradition on this side of the Chamber, where  my good friend Senator Merkley and I sit. We went along with the  unanimous request from that side of the Chamber in honoring blue slips.   There were no hearings of judicial nominations when a Democrat held  the gavel in the Judiciary Committee, when neither home State Senator  had consented. In fact, the Judiciary chairman, Senator Leahy, has  emphasized that he went above and beyond what several committee leaders  before him had done to respect the rights of the Republican minority.   Someone watching in the Gallery or on TV, someone who is hoping to  see the Congress pick up again on what I have described as principled  bipartisanship, probably hoping to hear Republicans are operating with  the same bipartisan comity now that they are in power--those people are  in for some serious disappointment. If the Senate approves the Bounds  nomination, it will be the first time in more than a century that a  judge has been confirmed without a blue slip from either home State  Senator.   The fact that Mr. Bounds wrote the appalling things I have described  ought to have at least slowed this nomination down. For him to have  hidden the writings is disqualifying. I don't think the matter can be  ignored or wished away.   The fact that these writings are embarrassing and reflect poorly on  him in retrospect does not in any way give him a license to conceal  them. In my view, my colleagues in the majority ought to look at this  issue the same way.   The Republican majority, working hand in hand with the Trump  administration, is now on the verge of breaking a century of bipartisan  tradition to seat a nominee with very serious red flags. In fact,  Chairman Grassley has now held hearings on four circuit court nominees  who didn't have blue slips from one or both of their home State  Senators.   Recently, Leader McConnell changed his tune on what the blue slip was  about. He was quoted as saying that the blue slip ``ought to simply be  a notification of how you're going to vote, not the opportunity to  blackball.''   I have two reactions to that. Senator Merkley and I have been called  a variety of things over the years, but I don't believe anybody has  ever said that we are interested in blackballing people. We are  interested in doing our jobs. We are interested in carrying out our  constitutional responsibilities, our constitutional responsibilities to  our constituents.   Second, blue slips have never been simply an indication of how  Senators will vote. Leader McConnell knows it. The letter he and his  colleagues sent in 2009 is proof. To invent this new interpretation of  how the process should work demonstrates, as I have indicated, that the  Republican majority has changed the rules of the game.   My colleagues on the other side ought to be aware of this new  responsibility because of how the administration, the majority leader,  and the Judiciary Committee have handled the Bounds nomination. This,  colleagues, is going to be the end of the blue-slip process. This is  lights-out for a process that ensured fairness for each Senator. I  would wager that when the next Democratic administration comes in and  the Democrats hold the gavel in the Senate, a Republican letter that  demands a say in judicial nominations will find it hard not to be  treated like a takeout menu that is shoved unsolicited under the  doorway--straight to the dustbin.    I have outlined the letter my Republican colleagues sent to President  Obama in 2009. It talked about a shared constitutional responsibility,  but the administration seems to define ``advise and consent'' as  Senators rubberstamping whatever nominations are sent their way. This  is a historic moment and, I think, a sad one. As I indicated, it is  part of a larger context--part of a pattern of the majority violating  norms, misleading the public, and bending rules to their absolute  limits in order to reshape the judiciary and seat judges who are far  from the mainstream.   Justice Scalia passed away unexpectedly with 237 days left in  President Obama's second term. During the process of deciding on a  nominee to fill the open seat, President Obama did something he didn't  have to do--something that upset many progressive Democrats. He  specifically chose a moderate nominee as a show of good faith. After  all, in 2010, when another seat opened up, my friend who chairs the  Finance Committee called Justice Garland a fine man, a consensus  nominee.   What a difference a few years makes. Judge Garland didn't even get a  hearing in 2016. The Republican majority in the Senate ran out the  clock on his nomination. Now that Republicans control the White House  and the Senate, they changed the rules in the Senate so they could  confirm Supreme Court Justices without needing a single Democratic  vote--a clear double standard.   The Trump administration has outsourced the selection of judicial  nominees to a right-wing group called the Federalist Society, which is  funded by powerful corporate interests and individuals with deep  pockets. They are answerable to no one but their well-monied backers,  certainly not the public at large.   Ryan Bounds is a Federalist Society hand-picked nominee. So was Neil  Gorsuch, who now sits in the Supreme Court seat that Leader McConnell  and Chairman Grassley held open for months and months. So is Brett  Kavanaugh, whose nomination the Senate will debate at great length in  the months to come.   These are nominees who adhere to a backward-looking, corporatist,  rightwing judicial philosophy that is packaged in the branding of so- called ``originalism.''   The guiding principle of originalism is ostensibly that our rights as  a people are contained within our founding document, but in practice,  originalism provides cover for rightwing jurists to empower  corporations over downtrodden workers and the wealthy over the  vulnerable. It is a political agenda masquerading as a judicial  philosophy.   For example, you would find it impossible to locate in the  Constitution where it says that unscrupulous healthcare providers can  lie to pregnant women about the services they do and do not provide,  but a right-leaning Supreme Court just said they are allowed to deceive  women in that way.   Originalist judges regularly trample on the Fourth Amendment, giving  the government the power to peer deep into the lives of citizens.   And in an example that is particularly relevant to my home State,  which has had a ``death with dignity'' law on the books for decades,  originalist jurists, including Justice Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh,  deny that Americans suffering with terrible illness have a right to  make their own decisions about their own lives and bodies without  interference from the State.   Twice, Oregonians have passed ballot measures approving death with  dignity. Oregon's Death with Dignity Act has been in place for two  decades, and it was upheld by the Supreme Court in Gonzalez v. Oregon.   And as I have said on this floor in previous debates, there is  nothing in the Constitution that gives the State the power to deny  suffering Oregonians the right to make basic choices about the end of  their lives.   Justice Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh disagree. They would put the  State between patients and their doctors, and their view that our  rights are only those enumerated in the Constitution conveniently  ignores key precedent and the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says:         The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,       shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained       by the people.    . . . shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by  the people.   So there is a clear implication written into our founding documents  that there are rights held by the people that are not overtly laid out  in the text of the Constitution.   Furthermore, the originalist viewpoint ignores what Justice Douglas  referred to in Griswold v. Connecticut as the ``zone of privacy created  by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.''   It was that zone of privacy that formed the basis of his opinion that  [[Page S5020]]  guaranteed the right of married couples to use contraceptives. That  right was later extended to unmarried individuals.   A similar legal theory guaranteed the right of all American women to  make their own choices about their reproductive health.   And it is that case, Roe v. Wade, that is now in the crosshairs of  the right wing as the Kavanaugh nomination moves forward.   Colleagues, Roe is settled law--it has been that way for 45 years-- but it is the right-wing agenda, wrapped in the cloak of originalism,  that seeks to overturn it.   Overturning Roe would turn the clock back to the dark days when  women's healthcare choices were made by the State--nevermind the flimsy  legal argument for it. That prospect is overwhelmingly opposed by the  American people. The imagery of back alley abortions and risky  procedures performed in secret is well understood, in part because  those horrors are not all that far back in our history as a Nation.   And the fact is, the women who have the most to lose if Roe is  overturned are the vulnerable and the poor. It is the women who will  lose access to the doctors of their choosing in small town clinics. It  is the women who cannot afford to a fly to another State where the  reproductive healthcare services they need are legal, safe, and  available. It is another step that cleaves our laws and our healthcare  system in two, going back to another era when healthcare in America  worked only for the healthy and the wealthy.   These questions are all part of the broader context I felt the need  to address here today as the Senate debates the Bounds nomination.   As somebody who has done my best to operate in a bipartisan manner  throughout my career, it saddens me to see the majority party change  the rules of the road in this way pushing through nominees that are far  outside the mainstream, destroying bipartisan traditions that have  stood for decades, even more than a century, reshaping the judiciary at  the behest of extremist, right-wing outside groups that put the  interests of the wealthy and powerful over the vulnerable.   These actions by the majority collectively pull bricks from the  democratic foundations of our government. They will bring to the  judiciary same vitriolic discourse that Americans find so disgusting in  the Congress. They undermine the public trust.   In the long run, it will be an open question whether the current  structure of the courts will survive.   As for today, I want my colleagues to understand what is at stake as  the Senate prepares to vote on the Bounds nomination. This nominee  concealed disturbing, intolerant writings from his past, misleading the  bipartisan committee that reviewed his candidacy.   The White House and Republican leaders here in the Senate have  apparently decided that does not matter, and now, a century-old  bipartisan tradition that protects our power as Senators and acts as a  moderating force on the courts is on the ropes. In my view, this will  forever change how judicial nominations are handled. It will further  divide the Congress, and it will further divide the courts along  partisan lines.   And this will only be a preview of the tense debate on the judiciary  that is sure to come in the months ahead.   I will close with one last point.   There are values on the line now that are important to the people of  my State and to Americans, particularly the right of all American women  to make their own choices about their reproductive health and their  healthcare. The Roe case is settled law, and it has been that way for  45 years, but now there is really a prospect of its being turned back.  The poor and the vulnerable have the most to lose. These are all issues  that are part of the broader context I wanted to address here tonight.  I am not sure if Senator Merkley was here at the particular moment.   I see my colleagues who have been very patient because my time has  expired.   We had a bipartisan selection committee for judges in our State, with  the late Mark Hatfield and Gordon Smith, who was Senator Merkley's  predecessor--Democrats, Republicans--all of whom said we don't want to  bring the same vitriolic discourse to judicial selection that  constitutes so much of the public debate today.   What we sought to do in the Oregon congressional delegation--Senator  Merkley, Senator Hatfield, Gordon Smith--was to buttress the public  trust. What we are seeing now in Oregon and with the judges who are  being given, in my view, such short shrift--such unfair treatment-- raises the question of whether the current structure of America's  courts can survive. That is what is at stake in these votes.   I think what we are discussing tonight is going to only be a preview  of the tense debate on the judiciary that is sure to come. I think we  are capable of better. Oregon has shown it for two full decades as it  relates to judicial selection.   I urge the Senate to return to that kind of collegial process,  exemplified by the blue slip, exemplified by the Oregon bipartisan  selection committee. Until that happens, I will have to urge a ``no''  vote on the Bounds nomination.   I thank my colleagues for their patience.   I yield the floor.
