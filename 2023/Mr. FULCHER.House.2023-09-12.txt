 Mr. Speaker, for years, States could enter into  cooperative agreements with Federal land management agencies to aid in  reducing the excess fuel load that makes fires in the West so damaging  to people, property, and wildlife.   H.R. 1450 fully extends the same authority and access to revenue that  States have to counties and Tribes.   Some States, primarily in the Western U.S., have large percentages of  their land controlled by the Federal Government. In my home State of  Idaho, for example, it is 62 percent. As a result, citizens in my State  must generate enough economic growth to sustain our needs from just the  resources contained within the available land remaining.   One can argue that Idahoans and citizens from other States with a  similar dynamic are merely tenants of their Federal landlord.                                time  1700    Counties and Tribes face a microcosm of that challenge within the  States they reside. There are counties in my district, like Idaho  around Owyhee, for example, where the Federal Government controls more  than 83 percent of the land within their borders. Without ready access  to the natural resources and related tax revenue in these areas, it is  difficult for residents and local municipalities to create wealth and  provide the ingredients necessary to raise families and grow  businesses.   This bill would enable access to resources. As a result, the  livelihoods of people in rural America would be enhanced through job  creation, new sources of income, and the economic activity that comes  with it.   Federal land management agencies are often unable, due to lack of  resources, or unwilling, due to bad policy or litigation, to adequately  maintain the density of tree growth, brush, and other vegetation that  creates the fuel load for wildfires. Yet local residents, as tenants of  the land under their own feet, can only wait and hope for their Federal  landlord to come up with the resources needed to responsibly manage  land in and around their communities. H.R. 1450 empowers local counties  and Tribes so they can engage, and at least have a chance to put some  wisdom into how these lands are managed.   We, in the West, care about our environment. God has blessed us with  an abundance of natural resources, and that comes with the  responsibility of wise stewardship. H.R. 1450 recognizes and  incentivizes just that, allowing a portion of receipts from timber  sales, for example, to be shared with counties and Tribes. That is a  win-win situation. Tribes and counties are local, and as such, they are  on the front lines of the land management battle.   I thank Chairman Westerman, my co-lead, Representative Marie  Gluesenkamp Perez, and all of my other colleagues on the Natural  Resources Committee and the Agriculture Committee for their support of  this legislation.
