 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I stand in support of my good friend  and Governor, Nikki Haley, who has been nominated for the position of  Ambassador to the United Nations. Simply put, Governor Haley is the  right choice, and I could not be prouder to support her nomination. She  has shown amazing leadership during very trying times in South  Carolina, and I know that she will bring the same strength and resolve  in reinforcing and  [[Page S427]]  strengthening our relationships with our allies.   As she showed through her confirmation hearing, Nikki is a strong,  principled leader. During a time with so much international  instability, we need a decisive and compassionate leader like Governor  Haley representing our Nation. She is the type of visionary leader who  will help turn the diplomatic tide of the past few years and reassure  our allies that the United States stands in strong support of them.   Nikki has served the people of South Carolina very well, and she will  be missed. But now, I look forward to addressing her by her new title-- Ambassador.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
