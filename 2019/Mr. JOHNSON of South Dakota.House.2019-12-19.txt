 Madam Speaker, so often in this  political environment, victories bring with them a winner, but many  more losers. Today is different. Today is a celebration. Today brings  with it a bounty of benefits to a multitude of winners.   If you are a dairy family, today you are a winner.   If you are a middle-class family, today you are a winner.   If you grow wheat, if you write code, if you process cheese, you are  a winner today.   So often in this Chamber we lament deals that could have been, but  today is a deal we are celebrating, with $2 billion of new agriculture  exports, with 176,000 new jobs, with $68 billion of real growth in this  economy.   Madam Speaker, today, 300 million Americans are winners.
