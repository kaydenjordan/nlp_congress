 Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend Representative  Jamie Raskin for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I was ranking member of the subcommittee that had  jurisdiction over the FAST Act when we received the request from the  region--the Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia region--to  transfer the authority to appoint directors to the Washington  Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board from the GSA to the  Department of Transportation.   For the life of me, I can't remember why this authority was given to  the GSA in the first place. But it may have been because WMATA was  considered simply an agency of interest to the Federal Government.   On consideration, under the FAST Act, we agreed that the Department  of Transportation was, by far, the more appropriate agency to appoint  Federal directors--understand there are local directors--but Federal  directors to WMATA. There are also Federal directors to the WMATA  board.   This is of great interest to the region. I recognize it is not  monumental for the Congress, but the region very much needs this joint  resolution. All three jurisdictions--the District of Columbia,  Maryland, and Virginia--have made their administrative changes, but  these changes need to be confirmed by this body.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Comstock for her leadership with this joint  resolution, and I ask that the entire body approve it    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that my friend, Mr. Raskin from  the State of Maryland, has yielded this time to me.   First, I want to thank the senior member of our delegation. I thank  the acknowledged leader of this entire bipartisan delegation, Mr.  Hoyer, for being the chief sponsor of this resolution that is  bipartisan because it concerns the seamless Metro system, seamless  because you can't get from one part of this region to the other part of  this region without Metro and because this subway is the only subway  which encompasses more than one State. It encompasses three  jurisdictions. Therefore, we are bipartisan because there is no other  way for us to exist. The transportation network requires it, and this  resolution does, in fact, shows our bipartisanship.                                time  1730    This resolution is quintessentially important, because it creates a  safety commission for Metro.   Now, along with other Members, we see Metro in at least two different  ways. We see it, of course, in light of our own constituents. Metro  makes it possible for entire neighborhoods to be created, entire parts  of the region to be connected. Metro has promoted economic growth, but  far more important than any of our individual jurisdictions is the  importance of Metro to the Federal Government. You may have heard the  figure 40 percent today; almost half of the Federal employees get to  work through Metro.   When Metro has a snow day, the whole region shuts down. We are in  this Congress by ourselves. If Metro has a snow day, nobody can get to  the Congress of the United States or to the Federal Government.   Metro is absolutely critical, and therefore, a safe Metro is  essential to all that happens in the Congress of the United States,  quite apart from the tourist economy that the District, Maryland, and  Virginia are a part of, quite apart from our own local economies.   More important to us all is the safety commission embodied in this  joint resolution. Metro is useless if it is not safe. And we know what  happens when it is not safe. In 2009, there was a tragic accident in  this region. Nine residents lost their lives, seven of them from the  District of Columbia. Anybody could have been on that train. In 2015,  there was a smoke accident. One woman was killed, another D.C.  resident. So an interstate safety commission is necessary if there is  to be a Metro at all.   I applaud the local lawmakers from the District of Columbia,  Maryland, and Virginia for doing their part to support this  jurisdiction safely kneading together the three parts of the region,  and I urge my own colleagues to give them permission to move forward
