 Mr. Chairman, this legislation is going to help make  healthcare more affordable and more accessible.   There are two things:   One, we finally are attacking the explosion in the cost of  prescription drugs, and I thank my Republican colleagues for  participating in that effort.   In Vermont, we just had a 16 percent rate increase for requests from  Blue Cross Blue Shield, and 9 percent of that is attributable to the  increase in pharma costs. This is happening because pharma has been  ripping us off for far too long.   This bill does two things: One, it ends their abusive, outrageous  practice of paying generic companies to delay bringing their lower cost  drug to the market. There is no excuse for that. This bill ends it. The  second thing it does is deny pharma the opportunity to withhold samples  so that generic companies can come up with a competitive product. That  is tremendous, it is overdue, and it is just the beginning.   Second, this makes healthcare more accessible by funding navigators.  My colleagues disregard that, but, in fact, navigators help people make  the complicated decision about what is the best healthcare plan for  them.   It also provides money for outreach. We want folks to know what is  available for them, make the best choice, and have the security of  healthcare.   Finally, there will be protection for the auto enrollment program.  Everybody is busy. If the default position is you are back in the plan  you had, that is good. There is security in that. People can make  options to get out or to change their plan. We want them to shop. This  makes healthcare affordable and more accessible.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which I will describe in a moment, is  about improving and preserving the Affordable Care Act. The word  ``sabotage'' has been used here. We don't need that word. We have a  very straightforward, very transparent difference of view.   The Democrats supported and passed the Affordable Care Act. We have  been defending it for years. The Republicans opposed it. President  Trump made it a campaign pledge to get rid of it, and they came within  a vote in the Senate, except for John McCain, of repealing the law  altogether.   We don't have to use words that are pejorative. We think we should  have the Affordable Care Act. We think we should make it stronger, and  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to vote against it  and now want to repeal it.                                time  1500    One of the ways to make the Affordable Care Act effective is to have  automatic reenrollment. If a family is in the Affordable Care Act and  the time for reenrollment comes up, if they take no action, then they  are automatically reenrolled in the plan that they are already in.   If you take away the automatic reenrollment, folks fall off,  oftentimes for no particular reason. They were doing other things; they  didn't notice it; they didn't have the time; or they didn't get to a  navigator. There are lots of things that come between automatic  reenrollment and picking your own plan.   By the way, studies have shown that automatic reenrollment, like  automatic withdrawal to go into your retirement account, is very, very  effective.   The President has indicated a desire to get rid of the automatic  reenrollment program. He hasn't done that yet. This amendment would  prohibit him from doing so.   There is a reason why the administration would like to get rid of  automatic reenrollment. The evidence suggests that that would mean  about 2 million Americans would then lose access to their healthcare  because they hadn't reenrolled.   We don't want that to happen. We want those American families who  depend on the healthcare that they have to continue receiving that  healthcare next year just like they received it this year.   This amendment makes it very clear that that automatic reenrollment  program would continue to be part of the Affordable Care Act.   Keep in mind, it in no way limits the ability of a family or an  individual to decide to get into a different plan or to affirmatively  say they don't want to be in any plan. That can still happen. There is  total and complete freedom of choice, but it gives security. It is  going to be very beneficial to about 2 million American families.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, so I reserve the  balance of my time.    How much time is remaining, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned earlier, we just have a  difference of opinion. We think the Affordable Care Act is important to  preserve and important to improve. My colleagues, when they have had an  opportunity, have voted to repeal it.   Failing to repeal it, what the Trump administration has done is chip  away at it. We don't want the administration to be able to get rid of  automatic reenrollment, which would likely result in the loss of 2  million families having access to healthcare.   There has been a number of other things that have happened: slashing  funding, slashing funding for consumer outreach and enrollment  education by 90 percent, cutting back the uninsured rate for 4 years,  and 1.1 million Americans losing coverage last year.   In the latest ACA marketplace final rule, the administration openly  contemplated getting rid of this automatic reenrollment. This amendment  protects the automatic reenrollment. It is going to protect continued  access to care under the Affordable Care Act for 2 million Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
