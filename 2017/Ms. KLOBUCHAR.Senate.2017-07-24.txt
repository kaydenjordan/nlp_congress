 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts  for her good words and her advocacy.   I rise to join her and my colleagues on the floor in sharing the  concerns I continue to hear every single day in my State, whether it is  just simply walking the parades, as I did in Stillwater, MN, where  people would come up off the sides, or, on the Fourth of July, when a  family with a child with Down syndrome just came off the side of the  parade and grabbed me and said we need healthcare for our son, that we  cannot cut him off, that we cannot make these drastic, draconian  reductions to Medicaid--because he is the face for Medicaid.   Right now, as far as I know, we have many versions of this healthcare  bill. I think I heard this version referred to as option C. I was  thinking that is not really correct because we have had options A and  B. Those were the two House healthcare bills. We had options C and D,  which were the two Senate healthcare bills. Then we went to option E,  which was back to the idea of repealing without having a replacement.  Now, as far as I know, after doing A, B, C, D, and E, we are at plan F.  My mom was a teacher her entire life, and I learned from her that you  cannot get much lower than F, right? I think it is time to set a new  course, and that is to work together for a better grade for the  American people and for a better healthcare plan, which means working  across the aisle to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.   The Minnesotans whom I have heard from do not like A, B, C, D, E, or  F. On Friday, in fact, I received a letter that was signed by 121  different Minnesota healthcare organizations, and it talked about these  past proposals.   They wrote this:         Minor changes or amendments will not change the ultimate       impact of these bills and their deep and devastating impact       on Minnesota and its citizens.    What were these groups?   They were pretty mainstream groups, those being the AARP Minnesota,  our children's hospitals, the Autism Society of Minnesota, our nursing  homes, the Minnesota Hospital Association, the Minnesota Nurses  Association, Mental Health Minnesota, our Catholic Health Association,  our addiction treatment professionals, and many more.   As different as these groups may be in their missions and in the work  they do and who belongs to them and where they live, what they have in  common is that they are dedicated to taking care of the health and  well-being of Minnesotans. They are scared about what would happen if  any of these proposals--A, B, C, D, E, or F--were to pass.   They have seen that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  estimates that with a number of these bills, it would mean that over 20  million people, if not all of them, would lose their health insurance,  that Medicaid would get cut by more than $700 billion, and that out-of- pocket costs would skyrocket. Deductibles for a benchmark plan could  reach $13,000 by 2026. They have seen that the Congressional Budget  Office has found that a repeal bill without a replacement would be even  worse, as 32 million people would lose their coverage, and premiums  would double.   I understand why these Minnesota healthcare organizations are scared  about these bills, but the people who are even more scared are the  citizens of my State who depend on the Affordable Care Act for their  healthcare.   As I said, we all knew, on the day it passed, that the Affordable  Care Act was a beginning and not an end. You cannot pass a major piece  of legislation like that without making changes over time.  Unfortunately, with the exception of a few minor things, we have been,  basically, blocked from making changes because we are always having  thrown at us this idea of simply repealing everything and causing  chaos. After the sentiment of the American people has been made quite  clear--and you do not have to look at a poll to know that; all you have  to do is walk down the Main Street during any parade in our State--now  is the time for us to work across the aisle and make some positive  changes.   What are those changes? For one, we know we must bring some certainty  to the exchanges and stabilize the market.  [[Page S4148]]    I see the Senator from New Hampshire here who is the former Governor  of New Hampshire. She knows, along with her colleague Senator Shaheen,  we need to have more certainty in the marketplace. That is why we  support the bill that would do that. We should vote on that bill.   I also support Senators Kaine and Carper's legislation--the  Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act--to reestablish  a Federal reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by  providing support for high-cost patients.   Now, the Republican legislature in my State--both houses are  Republican--joined with the Democratic Governor in our State and passed  a similar State-based reinsurance program.    I know Alaska, which, by all accounts, is a red State, has passed a  reinsurance program that recently got approval from this  administration. Just last week, as Senator Hassan knows, New Hampshire  announced its plans to pursue one as well.   So we can and we should come together to pursue this as one change we  can make positively for the Nation.   Another is, it is long past time to do something about the rising  cost of prescription drugs. I have a bill--and I see my colleague from  Minnesota here as well, Senator Franken. We have worked on this issue  together on both bills, which is similar to this issue of harnessing  the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare in  order to bring drug prices down. Right now, Medicare is literally  banned from negotiating on behalf of 41 million seniors. The last time  I checked, the senior citizens in my State had a lot of power, and 41  million people, especially seniors, is a lot of negotiating power.  Let's harness that because it will not just help to bring drug prices  down in the Medicare Program, but it will help down the line for all  citizens.   There is the bringing in of more competition. One way you do that is  by dangling the prospect of competition from other countries. You can  do it with a trigger that is based on the number of competitors you  have in a certain market. You can do it based on an increase in price  or you can just do it.   I and Senator McCain, who is certainly in our thoughts and prayers  this week, have long had a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe,  less expensive drugs from Canada. That is very similar to that of the  U.S. market. As I have often noted when I talk about this bill, we can  see Canada from our porch in Minnesota. We can see those lower prices  right across the border.   When we have developed so many lifesaving drugs, when we have done  the research, when we have put government money--taxpayer money--into  the research, why in this country do we have the most expensive drugs  in the world?   I can tell you why. It is that we have not done anything about it  here because, for too long, the pharmaceutical companies have been able  to have their way when it comes to legislation. This is the end of  that. Finally, the American people are starting to see this as not just  campaign rhetoric but as a real problem when 4 out of the top 10 best  selling drugs have gone up over 100 percent in just the last 10 years.   Here are some more ideas.   Senator Lee and I have a bill--bipartisan, across the aisle--that  would again allow the temporary importation of safe drugs that have  been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there  is not healthy competition for that drug in this country.   Generics. I and Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, have a bill  to stop something called pay for delay, which is when big  pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep  less expensive products off the market. That is an outrage. I would  challenge any Senator to vote against that. I do not think one will.  That is why we need a vote, and that is a perfect example of a  bipartisan bill that could be included in a package of measures that  could be improvements on the Affordable Care Act.   How about this one? It is the CREATES Act, which is another  bipartisan bill with me, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, Senator  Feinstein, Senator Lee, and many others that would put a stop to  tactics in which pharmaceutical companies refuse to provide samples  that the generic companies need to develop new drugs. According to the  Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save taxpayers $3.5  billion, and the one I just mentioned on pay for delay would save  taxpayers $2.9 billion.   Why would we say to the taxpayers of this country that we will not do  that, that we will not even allow it to come up for a vote?   These are votes the Senate should and must take. Bringing up a bill  that devastates the Medicaid Program or that repeals big parts of the  Affordable Care Act, without having a replacement, does the opposite.  It does nothing. These bills--A, B, C, D, E, or F--do nothing in terms  of bringing down pharmaceutical prices.   What is this really about? It is about the identical twins whom I met  yesterday from Cambridge, MN, which is a small town--a town similar, I  am sure, to the towns the Presiding Officer would find in his State or  to the towns in New Hampshire or to the towns Senator Whitehouse would  see in Rhode Island.   This is about identical twins. One of the twins is a pitcher, and one  of the twins is a catcher on their softball team. One of the twins  found out, just in the last year, that she has juvenile diabetes. It is  a very dangerous, dangerous thing to have at that young age. The other  twin is perfectly healthy. Of course, the family had to go immediately  to the doctor. They bought insulin, and the insulin had gone up three  times what it should have in just the last few years. It is very  difficult for them to afford now. They got the strips. They had to do  all of this, and the price kept escalating. To add to everything else,  now this mom is worried that one of her daughters, not two, will have a  preexisting condition and be kicked off of the insurance.   Think about that. They are identical twins. It could be either one.  You do not know which one. Is it the catcher? Is it the pitcher? It is  a lottery. If you do not have healthcare like the Affordable Care Act  in place, it is like a lottery. You do not know which one of them is  going to be kicked off the insurance, not have insurance, and get very  sick and possibly die. That is what we are talking about here.   That is not what this country is about. It could happen to anyone--to  anyone in this Chamber, to anyone up in the Gallery, to anyone at home.  You do not know when it is going to happen to you or your sister or  your brother or your neighbor or your dad or your mom or your grandma  or your grandpa. That is why we have affordable healthcare insurance.   This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. As  Senator Franken knows, we have heard time and time again from our rural  hospitals--from Aurora to Gilbert, to Tower. I was up there recently,  and that is what I heard about--the rural hospitals and how difficult  it is going to be for them if any of these bills pass.   I know it is something our Republican colleagues, all of whom are  from rural States--Senators Collins, Capito, and Murkowski--have  expressed real concerns about with regard to the impact of some of the  proposed Medicaid cuts and what they would do in their States.   Opioids. Both the Senator from New Hampshire who is here with me  today, Senator Hassan, and certainly Senator Whitehouse have been  leaders in this area. That is why we passed the Cures Act. That is why  we put a bunch of funding from the Cures Act into opioid addiction  treatment. That is why we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act on a bipartisan basis--one of the few bills that made it  through last year.   You cannot just run TV ads on it, and you cannot just put it on  campaign brochures and then go out 6 months later and cut Medicaid,  which provides the treatment for 32 percent of opioid medication- assisted treatments we have in our State. You cannot do that. You  cannot give beautiful speeches and go to press conferences and then  make those kinds of cuts. I know my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle understand this.   This is a time when we can chart a different path forward, when we  can end up where we should have begun but still standing, and that is  by working together to find some positive changes to the Affordable  Care Act for the  [[Page S4149]]  American people. Again, I said it on the day it passed--it is a  beginning and not an end. Let's seize this moment, open the door, and  work together for the American people.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
