 Madam President, I just want to start off with this. This  is Valentine's Day, and there are different days of the year that are  more special to us than others--other than Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I even like Halloween. But I think Valentine's Day is very special.   For our loved ones, our spouses or significant others, and our  children, we love them, and I hope they know that. But to the people  who work here day in and day out, the folks who are here when it is a  weekend, when other folks are maybe heading out for the holidays to  visit their families across the country, we don't say thanks enough. So  to all of them, from my heart and from my staff, and, I think, from all  of us--Democrats and Republicans in the Senate--we want to say thank  you and happy Valentine's Day.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about John  Dingell this evening, but before I do that, I just want to comment on  the fact that we passed spending bills to fund our government for the  balance of this fiscal year. That is a good thing--a good, good thing.  I wish we had done it last year. In fact, we did--months ago. Democrats  and Republicans joined together here almost unanimously to pass a  spending plan for the balance of the fiscal year--all 13 appropriations  bills, and they looked a whole lot like what we passed here today. Yet  we went through a shutdown which created a lot of havoc and turmoil,  not just for Federal employees but for the people whom they serve and  we serve.   I have apologized for that, and I know other colleagues have as well.  Hopefully, in the months ahead, we can make it up to the people who  were inconvenienced. In many cases they were not just disadvantaged but  treated very badly.   The President apparently is going to sign the spending bills we  passed with broad bipartisan support, and I understand he is going to  declare a state of emergency to be able to do additional things down at  the border with Mexico.   Tomorrow morning at 6 a.m., I will lead a bipartisan delegation, with  House and Senate Members, and we will not be going to the border. I  have been there any number of times as chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee. We are not going to go to the border this time.   The President was down there a couple of weeks ago, and standing at  the border he said: There is a human catastrophe or tragedy going on at  the border.   I thought to myself: Well, what is going on at the border is very  unfortunate, but the real human tragedy is what is going on in three  countries: Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The illegal  immigration, to my surprise a couple of years ago, is not just coming  from Mexico. In fact, today there are more Mexicans going back into  Mexico from the United States than there are going the other way. I was  surprised to learn that, but that is the case today.   Illegal immigration in our country is down about 80 percent from the  year 2000, and the folks coming across the border illegally are coming  from three countries--Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Each year  in the last decade or so, they have vied for the title ``Murder Capital  of the World.''   Their lives are made miserable because of our addiction to drugs. So  having been complicit in their misery, the thought occurred to a number  of us, including the last administration's President and Vice President  and some of us in the House and the Senate, that maybe we should see  why all of those people are coming out of Honduras, Guatemala, and El  Salvador and trying to come into the United States.   I will tell a true story. Some of them come to Delaware. We have  three counties in my State. The southernmost county, Sussex County, is  a big county that raises a lot of corn, soybeans, and raise a lot of  chickens. We process a lot of chickens. Over the years, a lot of folks  come up from Guatemala to work in the agriculture and poultry industry.   About 2 or 3 years ago, we had an increase--a blip in migration-- especially from Guatemala. I was in Sussex County, in Georgetown, the  county seat, right in the middle of all of this poultry business. There  are three chickens for every person in Delaware, to give you some idea  of the extent of it.   I met with the folks at La Esperanza. That is Spanish for hope. It is  a non-profit. Their job is to try to help people who do make it across  the border into our country and who have families, and they try to do  some reconnection with their families.   But, anyway, I heard this story. There was a young man in Guatemala,  a teenager, who was recruited by a gang there. He said he had to talk  to his parents. He went to talk to his parents, and they said: We don't  want you to join any gangs.   He went back, and the gang found him and approached him a couple of  days later and said: Well, what do you think? Do you want to join our  gang? He said: I talked to my parents, and they don't think it is the  right thing for me to do now.   They said: Well, think about it some more.   A week or so later, they found him again and said: Well, what do you  think? Are you ready to join our gang?   He said: No, I don't think I am going to do that now.   They said: If you don't join our gang, somebody in your family is  going to die. Somebody in your family is going to die.   He went home, and he told his parents. They talked it over, and he  joined the gang.   One of the things they do in these gangs--they have to go through an  initiation. Part of his initiation was a requirement that he rape his  13-year-old sister. The son was like 15 years old, and one of the rites  of passage is he had to rape his 13-year-old sister. He went home and  told his parents what was expected of him. Within a week or two, the  sister and the brother were on their way out of their country to try to  be reunited with other relatives in the United States, and they ended  up in Delaware. That is a human tragedy. I think if they had stayed  there, it would have been probably an even greater human tragedy.   I am a big believer in root causes. Don't just address the symptoms  of the problem. The symptom of the problem is people trying to get into  our country and cross our borders illegally. That is a problem. That is  a challenge. We need secure borders, but the root cause is what is  going on in the countries that they are fleeing from--lack of rule of  law, impunity, police who don't police, prosecutors who don't  prosecute, judges who don't really administer the law, prisons that  don't--correctional institutions that don't really correct behavior.  Instead of turning out better people, they turn out better criminals.  That has been a problem, and it has been a problem for some time.   Whenever we face a situation like this where an issue is really hard  to deal with, what I like to say is, let's find out what works.   I am an old Governor. I used to be chairman of the National Governors  Association. My last year as Governor, I chaired something in the NGA.  In addition to being the Governor of Delaware, I chaired something  called the Center for Best Practices. The idea was, how do we share  solutions among Governors and among States for all the problems we  face--some of the problems we face?   In trying to figure out how we help Guatemala and El Salvador sort of  become less violent places, places with hope and opportunity--how can  we help in that? So we looked around the world. We don't have to look  too far, but if we look south of Central America, we find Colombia.   Colombia is a place where about 20 years ago, there were leftist  guerillas trying to bring down the government, and there were drug  lords trying to bring down the government. One day 20 years or so ago,  a bunch of thugs rounded up the supreme court of the country--rounded  them up, took them into a room, shot them all to death, killed them  all.   Colombia was teetering, and it was not clear whether it was going to  really make it as a nation. Some very brave people stood up and some of  the leaders of Columbia stood up and said: We are not going to let  these guys--whether it is the FARC, the leftist guerillas, or the drug  lords--take over our country and take it down. We are going to fight  back.  [[Page S1396]]    The United States, led by then-President Bill Clinton and by a guy  who was serving as the chairman, I think, of the Foreign Relations  Committee, Joe Biden, sort of made common calls with the President of  Colombia, who was a very brave person, and said to the Colombians: You  can do this. Stabilize your country. Make it a more livable, decent  place to live. We can help because we are complicit in their misery,  too, given our addiction to drugs.   Well, guess what. They started something called Plan Colombia, and  for 20 years it has worked slowly. Slowly. An example of what we did is  we provided Apache helicopters. Why did we do that? So that the  Colombian police and the Colombian military would have the mobility  they need to go across the country and go after the bad guys and take  them on. That was just one of the many things that was happening in  Plan Colombia.   But again, it is like Home Depot. You have Home Depot, Madam  President, in your State, and we have them in mine. What is their  saying? ``You can do it, and we can help.'' So we said: Colombia, you  can do it, and we can help. We are complicit in your misery, and we can  help. And we have.   About a year or so ago, the President of Colombia won a Nobel Peace  Prize. The leftist guerillas are--it is not perfect, but they are part  of the government. Are drugs still a problem there? Yes, they are, but  not like before. It is a country with a relatively bright future and  one that we can be proud to call our friend and ally.   When we looked for a way to help in Central America--the Honduras,  Guatemala, and El Salvador--we went to Colombia, and we said: Maybe it  is possible to have a Central American version of Plan Colombia. And  now we have that.   What we have done over the last 3, maybe 4 years, we funded those  three countries in efforts to address some of the deficiencies that I  just described--police who don't police, prosecutors who don't  prosecute, judges who don't administer justice, and correctional  institutions that don't really correct behavior. We have been doing  this now for about 3 years, and our congressional delegation is going  to go down there tomorrow and do a little bit of oversight and find out  what is working in those three countries and what is not, whether they  are meeting their responsibilities, and whether we are meeting our  responsibilities.   You know, we can build a wall from sea to shining sea and from the  Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. It can be 30 feet tall. But unless  somehow the root causes of that migration--and it ain't coming from  Mexico--some but not much. Again, more Mexicans are going back into  Mexico than are coming the other way.   We really want to help the people of the Honduras, Guatemala, and El  Salvador address those root causes. You know, they are going to keep  coming up here, and if we lived there, we would want to come too.   You know, for what it is worth, we have had about 80 Presidential  declarations of emergencies, I guess, in maybe the last century, and  they were for Pearl Harbor, Katrina, 9/11, other disasters, some of  them natural disasters, others. Since 2000, there has been an 80  percent reduction in illegal migration at the borders. Most of it is  coming from these three countries, not Mexico. So we will see what  happens with the declaration of emergency that the President is going  to declare.   I think you have to be careful. To my Republican friends, I say this  lovingly to you on Valentine's Day: The idea of a President invoking  his powers, using his powers in this way, I am frankly not convinced  that--while there certainly are challenges at the border, I have  explained where I think the real challenges are, the real causes.   Someday, we will have a Democratic President, and he or she will be  considering a range of options of what to do, and somebody is going to  suggest: Well, in the earlier administration, the Trump administration,  they declared it. So they will say: Well, I will just declare a  national emergency and do what I want to do. That is a slippery slope,  and I think that is one we need to be very careful about going on.                            ____________________     The last thing I would like to do, if I could, is I want  to talk a little bit about John Dingell. I don't know if our Presiding  Officer ever had a chance to meet him or know him. She says no--nods  no.   I had the pleasure of knowing him I guess since 1982, 1983, when I  was elected to the House. I was a Representative, and he was already  there. I was the new guy, and I had been a treasurer of Delaware and a  naval flight officer before that, and I finally retired from the Navy  as a captain a few years ago.   He was so nice to me. He was a big guy, a giant of a man and kind of  gruff. He was kind of gruff, and I can't imagine how the pages would  have reacted to him if he yelled at them or frowned at them or growled  at them. But for reasons that aren't all clear, he was really kind to  me. I think in his heart that is what he was.   I like to work out. I like to run. I like to work out in gyms. They  have a gym over at the House in the basement of the Rayburn Building.  It is a pretty nice gym. We have one here. It is small by comparison.  It is modest. I usually go home at night, but occasionally I would  spend the night in DC when I was in the House, and the next morning I  would go to the gym, and I would either go run out on the Mall, or I  would lift weights or ride the bike or something in the gym. When I  finished up, before I took a shower and got dressed, I would go in the  steam room--the gym had a steam room in it--and a lot of times, John  Dingell was in there.   I remember sitting there with him repeatedly over the years--not  hundreds of times but many times. Sometimes there were several people  there. We talked. Sometimes it was just the two of us. He gave me  really good advice. He was like a mentor.   The day I was sworn in as a Congressman from Delaware, I was the dean  of our delegation because we only had one, so I didn't really have like  a big brother or a big sister in my delegation to look up to in the  House. There was nobody else but me. I was brand new. John Dingell was  nice, along with a bunch of other folks too. They kind of stepped up  and gave me some of the guidance that I needed.   He was an interesting fellow because he chaired the Energy and  Commerce Committee the whole time I was in the House and a long time  after that, and he always looked out for his bread and butter. In  Michigan, that is automobiles. This was a big deal. It was then, and it  still is. So he always wanted to make sure that they had the  predictability that they wanted and needed and that they could be  successful. If I were the Senator or Representative from Michigan, I  would want that too. But he also was really good on clean air issues,  clean water issues, natural resource issues, open space issues, and  agricultural issues.   I remember once on one of those mornings, we were talking about  whether it is possible to be a good steward of the environment, mindful  of air, water, open space, public health--is it possible to do all  those things and also look out for job creation and job preservation,  whether it is in Michigan or some other place?   My staff has heard me say this, I am tempted to say, a million times.  Folks on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where I am a  senior Democrat now, have heard me say this more often than they want  to. I have always said it is possible to have clean air, clean water,  better public health, do good things for our planet, and create jobs.  They go hand-in-glove.   One of the first people who reminded me of that a long time ago was  John Dingell. He supported the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.  He supported the Clean Air Amendments in 1990, on which he was nice  enough to let me offer a provision that was incorporated into the law.  He did a lot to help preserve the auto industry not just in his State  but in this country. He was an amazing guy.   Either the day he passed away or before he passed away, with his wife  Debbie by his side--she is now a Congresswoman in his old seat--he  shared with her some thoughts that he wanted to leave as part of his  legacy at 92, and those words--I am not going to read them here today.  I think they probably have already been read on the floor or introduced  into the Record.   I ask unanimous consent that those words be printed in the Record.  [[Page S1397]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2019]                  John Dingell: My Last Words for America                            (By John D. Dingell)         John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who served in the U.S.       House from 1955 to 2015, was the longest-serving member of       Congress in American history. He dictated these reflections       to his wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), at their home in       Dearborn, on Feb. 7, the day he died.        One of the advantages to knowing that your demise is       imminent, and that reports of it will not be greatly       exaggerated, is that you have a few moments to compose some       parting thoughts.        In our modern political age, the presidential bully pulpit       seems dedicated to sowing division and denigrating, often in       the most irrelevant and infantile personal terms, the       political opposition.        And much as I have found Twitter to be a useful means of       expression, some occasions merit more than 280 characters.        My personal and political character was formed in a       different era that was kinder, if not necessarily gentler. We       observed modicums of respect even as we fought, often       bitterly and savagely, over issues that were literally life       and death to a degree that--fortunately--we see much less of       today.        Think about it:        Impoverishment of the elderly because of medical expenses       was a common and often accepted occurrence. Opponents of the       Medicare program that saved the elderly from that cruel fate       called it ``socialized medicine.'' Remember that slander if       there's a sustained revival of silly red-baiting today.        Not five decades ago, much of the largest group of       freshwater lakes on Earth--our own Great Lakes--were closed       to swimming and fishing and other recreational pursuits       because of chemical and bacteriological contamination from       untreated industrial and wastewater disposal. Today, the       Great Lakes are so hospitable to marine life that one of our       biggest challenges is controlling the invasive species that       have made them their new home.        We regularly used and consumed foods, drugs, chemicals and       other things (cigarettes) that were legal, promoted and       actively harmful. Hazardous wastes were dumped on empty plots       in the dead of night. There were few if any restrictions on       industrial emissions. We had only the barest scientific       knowledge of the long-term consequences of any of this.        And there was a great stain on America, in the form of our       legacy of racial discrimination. There were good people of       all colors who banded together, risking and even losing their       lives to erase the legal and other barriers that held       Americans down. In their time, they were often demonized and       targeted, much like other vulnerable men and women today.        Please note: All of these challenges were addressed by       Congress. Maybe not as fast as we wanted, or as perfectly as       hoped. The work is certainly not finished. But we've made       progress--and in every case, from the passage of Medicare       through the passage of civil rights, we did it with the       support of Democrats and Republicans who considered       themselves first and foremost to be Americans.        I'm immensely proud, and eternally grateful, for having had       the opportunity to play a part in all of these efforts during       my service in Congress. And it's simply not possible for me       to adequately repay the love that my friends, neighbors and       family have given me and shown me during my public service       and retirement.        But I would be remiss in not acknowledging the forgiveness       and sweetness of the woman who has essentially supported me       for almost 40 years: my wife, Deborah. And it is a source of       great satisfaction to know that she is among the largest       group of women to have ever served in the Congress (as she       busily recruits more).        In my life and career, I have often heard it said that so-      and-so has real power--as in, ``the powerful Wile E. Coyote,       chairman of the Capture the Road Runner Committee.''        It's an expression that has always grated on me. In       democratic government, elected officials do not have power.       They hold power--in trust for the people who elected them. If       they misuse or abuse that public trust, it is quite properly       revoked (the quicker the better).        I never forgot the people who gave me the privilege of       representing them. It was a lesson learned at home from my       father and mother, and one I have tried to impart to the       people I've served with and employed over the years.        As I prepare to leave this all behind, I now leave you in       control of the greatest nation of mankind and pray God gives       you the wisdom to understand the responsibility you hold in       your hands.        May God bless you all, and may God bless America.     I will close with this. I went to the funeral. I couldn't  stay the whole time. It was here in DC. I missed Steny Hoyer, the  Democratic majority leader, and his comments. I was told he was  terrific, as were others, as well. But I did get to hear just about  everything Bill Clinton said. I was inspired and amused by that. He was  funny. He really caught the character of John and his foibles, his  strengths, and brilliance.   Before I went to the funeral, I went to a breakfast. A friend at the  breakfast was kind enough to share his words with the rest of us. He  actually worked for John Dingell at one time. In an off-the-cuff riff  about John Dingell, he shared some of the things he worked on. Later  on, I said: Would you share that with me? He was kind enough to do  that.   I wish I could say these are my words, but that would be plagiarism.  I give him the credit, at least in a left-handed sort of way. This is  what my friend gave to me. I just want to close with these words from  my friend about John Dingell:         This morning as I was reading the obituaries detailing       Congressman Dingell's life and accomplishments, I started       thinking of all the aspects of daily life that he had a       direct and meaningful impact on for almost 60 years.    He went on to say what some of them were.         The air we breathe, the water we drink. The health of       rivers and lakes. The wildlife that exists and depends upon       those spaces. The food we eat. The pills we take. The       products we use. The electricity that powers our economy. The       efficiency of almost every product that uses electricity. The       phones we use. The health insurance we count on in a medical       crisis. The regulation and cleanup of hazardous waste. The       cars we drive, of course! And a host of other things.    On this Valentine's Day--when we give thanks for our loved ones, our  families, and those who are special in our lives--I also give thanks  for John and the many blessings that he has left us and this country.   With that, I will say I appreciate the opportunity to share these  words.   God bless.   Thank you.                            ____________________
