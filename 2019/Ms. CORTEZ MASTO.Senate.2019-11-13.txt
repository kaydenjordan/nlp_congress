 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the executive director of the Regional Transportation  Commission of Washoe County, Lee Gibson, who after over 10 years of  dedicated service, announced his retirement this year.   Since his appointment to chief director of the RTC in 2009, Mr.  Gibson has worked tirelessly to improve customer service and promote  collaboration with the local community. During his tenure at the RTC,  he has reduced agency operating costs by over 30 percent while  delivering the largest multimodal construction program in the agency's  history. His dedication and pragmatism has helped guide the RTC of  Washoe County through tumultuous economic times as well as the  exponential growth of the Reno-Sparks area.   The RTC, under the management of Mr. Gibson, adopted a sustainability  policy that has led to a multitude of successful projects, including  earning national recognition for the SouthEast Connector. The RTC has  also been recognized for achieving LEED certification for two recently  opened transit centers and obtained recognition for the development of  Complete Streets and sustainable highway design throughout the Truckee  Meadows. The region was even designated as a bicycle-friendly community  by the American League of Bicyclists.   Mr. Gibson did not just focus on restructuring the transit system  during his time as the Director of the RTC; his emphasis on customer  service and time performance led to improved customer satisfaction with  the transportation services. This is due to the RTC's implementation of  innovative services, such as the RTC RAPID bus rapid transit project.  Mr. Gibson also succeeded in delivering a broader community outreach  program and successfully collaborated with other agencies to plan and  deliver efficient and effective transportation services.   Mr. Gibson made sure to give back to his community beyond his  impressive service in the RTC. He is a founding member of Northern  Nevada Transportation Collaborative, NNTC, a coalition of business and  government leaders, academic researchers, transportation professionals,  and citizens committed to promoting transportation as a key tool for  economic revitalization, quality of life, and sustainability. In 2012  he became the chairman of the Nevada Executive Committee for  Transportation Safety. There, he works with State and local agencies to  promote safety policies for all modes of transportation. He is also a  member of the TRB Planning Applications Committee and the APTA Planning  and Policy Committee.   Today, I celebrate the many contributions of Lee Gibson to the Reno- Sparks metropolitan area and Washoe County as well as to the Northern  Nevada community. We owe Mr. Gibson a debt of gratitude for his service  and his leadership will be missed.  [[Page S6564]]                                ____________________
