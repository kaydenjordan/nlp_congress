 Mr. Speaker, it is never too late to do the right thing.  Thanks to bipartisan work in the Senate, the Respect for Marriage Act  comes back to the House with added language that should allay anyone's  fears or misunderstandings, yet still ensure we can legally recognize  marriage as it is currently recognized in this country.   It would be wrong to say that my husband, Phil, and I have a marriage  that is any different from anyone else's marriage here in this body. My  workplace health insurance should extend to my husband just like yours  extends to your spouse. I should be able to visit my husband in the  hospital, if need be, just like you can visit your spouse. My earned  benefits for retirement, Social Security, our property rights, our  benefits through our taxes, and so much more should be no different,  regardless of if your spouse is named Samuel or Samantha.   That is what we will do today. With the revised Respect for Marriage  Act, denying legal recognition to any legally married couple would be  so far out of the mainstream that it would actually be discrimination.  I am sure no one here would intend to discriminate against me and my  spouse, as I would never against you and yours.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone's support for this bill.
