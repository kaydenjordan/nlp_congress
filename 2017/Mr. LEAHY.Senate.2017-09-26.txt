 Mr. President, it was 6 years ago that Tropical Storm  Irene tore through my home State of Vermont, and I remember it like it  was yesterday. I remember going around the State the next day in a  helicopter with the head of our National Guard and reviewing the  damage. We are still trying to recover.   In the days after the storm, I came to this Chamber, and I asked for  the support that Vermont needed to recover and rebuild. I remember with  gratitude that Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate, from  across the country, stood with the people of Vermont. I remember how  much the calls of support from Republican and Democratic colleagues  meant to me.   Today, we have to do the same for the people of Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands. More than 3\1/2\ million Americans--remember,  these are Americans--have seen their homes and communities destroyed by  the double blow of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The destruction is  catastrophic. The details are still coming in.   The vast majority of Puerto Rico is without power and remains in the  dark. At least 44 percent--almost half of its people--are without  potable water, and some estimates put it even higher. The vast majority  of hospitals in Puerto Rico are without power. The food supply is  dwindling. Cell phone sites are down, crippling communication on the  island. People can't find out what has happened to their families. We  are on the verge of a humanitarian crisis right here on U.S. soil.   President Trump, leaders of FEMA, the Department of Homeland  Security, and the Department of Defense have all got to act quickly. We  have to put the full force of the United States behind these efforts,  as we would in any State where this might happen.   Earlier this month, Congress approved $15 billion in emergency  funding for disaster relief following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. As  vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I was happy to support  that. These resources should be put to work in Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands as well. But it is not going to last for long. This  money will run out within a couple of weeks. We have to sustain our  commitments to rebuilding and recovering from all of these hurricanes  for the long haul--not just in the continental United States but in all  parts of the  [[Page S6110]]  United States, which include Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.   I would ask the administration to prepare an emergency aid request as  soon as possible. The Appropriations Committee is ready to move on it,  but the Congress--the House and Senate--should act very quickly. We  have to stand by each other in times of disaster. When there is a  storm, one of us braces for it, and the others have to help pick up the  pieces. That is who we are. That is why we act. That is why we are  Americans. We are the United States of America--all of us. Now we must  make sure that we respond not just in Texas, as we should, not just in  Florida, as we should, but in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  They are part of our country.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, the Senate finds itself today in a familiar situation:  Deeply partisan efforts to repeal and replace the landmark Affordable  Care Act have hit a wall. By their own admission, the Senate majority  has, with their backs against a wall and a looming deadline to advance  legislation by a simple majority vote, put forward one last-gasp effort  to roll back access to healthcare for millions of Americans--not  because it is sound policy, but in an effort to meet a campaign  promise, regardless of its harm to millions of Americans. It is as  irresponsible as it is dangerous. These efforts put lives at risk. This  zombie project should be abandoned, and we should get back to the  constructive and promising bipartisan work toward strengthening  troubled insurance markets.   Instead of working on a responsible budget, or disaster relief for  Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, or on any of the many pressing issues  facing our country, we began this week in a situation virtually  identical to where we were in July. In fact, it reflects the state of  the Senate for much of this year, where policymaking has been replaced  by partisanship and politics.   When we considered a healthcare reconciliation bill in July, in spite  of multiple drafts and a go-it-alone, hyperpartisan philosophy, the  majority leader was still unable to garner enough support within his  own Caucus to pass a sweeping healthcare bill. I joined with many  Democrats to offer motions to get the Senate back to regular order and  have the appropriate committees study the effects of these policies on  Medicaid beneficiaries and those with disabilities, on women and  children, on seniors, and the most vulnerable, but Republicans voted  down those efforts and plowed ahead, seemingly unaware or willingly  blind to the real-life impacts of what they were trying to do. During  July's debate, the Senate also considered multiple amendments to  rewrite the Affordable Care Act. Each of these amendments would have  caused tens of millions of Americans to lose insurance and would have  made it harder for those with preexisting conditions to obtain  coverage. When those amendments failed, the Republican leadership  attempted to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act. That did not work  either.   Instead of learning from that painful process, the Republican  leadership emerged from the August recess with a new plan. Released  just last week and revised several times since, the proposal of  Senators Graham, Cassidy, Heller, and Johnson was intended to revive  the healthcare reconciliation bill the Senate already defeated.  Unfortunately, their bill contains all of the problems of previous  versions and includes new, troubling provisions that would  fundamentally change healthcare in this country for the worse.   This Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill--just the latest version of  TrumpCare--would make dangerous changes to our healthcare system  resulting in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage,  including Vermonters. In fact, based on previous estimates, a provision  in this bill would cause 15 million Americans to lose insurance and  premiums to increase by an average of 20 percent on day 1.   This hasty proposal would allow insurance companies to charge  seniors, those with disabilities, those with preexisting conditions,  and women more for coverage. These are all discriminatory policies that  the Affordable Care Act changed.   Like previous versions of TrumpCare, this bill would end Medicaid as  we know it by capping spending in the program and forcing States to cut  eligibility, benefits, or both. What is worse, this new version of the  bill would fully repeal the tax credits and subsidies created under the  ACA and instead give States inadequately funded block grants with no  requirement that the funding goes to those in need.   States like Vermont have done the right thing. Because of Vermont's  Medicaid expansion, thousands of Vermonters now have access to  lifesaving health insurance and care. That is never been more critical  than now as we continue to grapple with the opioid crisis.   This latest Republican proposal would hurt States like Vermont,  simply for doing the right thing and expanding coverage. In the latest  version of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal, there seems to  be no consistency to how block grant funds are divvied between States,  leaving some to conclude the formula is merely a ham-fisted attempt to  appease some reluctant Republican Senators to support this measure. By  2027, all States lose under this proposal as the block grant funding  created under this proposal runs out. You cannot consider legislation  of this magnitude, with such far-reaching truly life-and-death  consequences, with no debate and no meaningful consideration. This is  not the way the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world,  should conduct such expansive and impactful policies. This is not the  Senate that I know and respect.   Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee held the only hearing in the  Senate on TrumpCare. We heard how devastating this bill would be for  millions of Americans who depend on subsidies to purchase health  insurance. We heard how reduced funding would force States to choose  what services to cover for children, pregnant women, and those with  disabilities who depend on Medicaid. Benefits like maternity coverage  or homecare will be at risk as States choose to relax the insurance  requirements under the ACA. Remarkably, experts disagreed with the  authors as to what this amendment would mean for those with preexisting  conditions.   One thing the hearing made abundantly clear is that this sweeping  policy needs further examination. The Congressional Budget Office says  it needs at least a couple of weeks to fully examine this proposal. How  many will lose insurance? How much will premiums increase? How many  will lose access to health care? These are fundamental questions to  which we do not and will not have answers before the majority's  arbitrary timeline is up. The preliminary estimate released late Monday  by the CBO says that ``millions'' of Americans would be uninsured as a  result of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal. What is more, I  have not heard from a single health-related group that supports this  measure.   So why does the majority insist on pushing forward? It seems they are  so intent on voting on anything that they would have us consider an  unexamined, hastily cobbled together bill solely to repeal the ACA--for  the express purposes of fulfilling a crassly partisan campaign promise.  This would be nothing more than legislative malpractice. Their desire  to undo any of the success of the Obama administration, at any cost,  would have them push forward a proposal that would devastate our health  insurance markets, cause millions to lose insurance, and fundamentally  change the Medicaid Program, and the best reason the Republicans can  come up with for supporting this new attempt is ``because we said we  would.''    In Vermont, the effects of TrumpCare would be disastrous. Since the  passage of the Affordable Care Act, Vermont has made exceptional  progress to cut the rate of uninsured Vermonters by half. The number of  uninsured Vermonters is now below 4 percent. Because of the Medicaid  Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as Dr.  Dynasaur in Vermont, 99 percent of children have health insurance in  our State. TrumpCare, in any version, places Vermont's progress at  risk.   Vermont has also worked on new and innovative ways of delivering  healthcare, which has brought down  [[Page S6111]]  costs and increased coordination of care. One of the most significant  ways Vermont has done this is through existing flexibility in Medicaid.  It is through the Medicaid Program that Vermont has offered  comprehensive treatment and counseling services for those suffering  with opioid addition. In Vermont, 68 percent of those receiving  medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction are Medicaid  recipients. If hundreds of billions of dollars are cut from the  Medicaid Program, States will be forced to limit coverage, jeopardizing  Vermont's ability to overcome this crisis. Provisions that cap Medicaid  spending do not create ``flexibility'' in Medicaid. This policy would  instead force States to ration care.   Let's talk about what that means to Vermonters. This week I heard  from Deborah in Waterbury, VT, who wrote to me urging me to vote to  protect Medicaid funding:         For a while Medicaid paid for medical care my son and I       needed. Later Medicaid funding, and the cancer care it paid       for, literally saved my life. It turns out many Americans       find out that they or someone they love needs medical care or       disability services that only Medicaid covers. Medicaid not       only helps individuals and families who need medical care or       disability services in the community; it also pays for       approximately 64 percent of the people in nursing homes--      financial help that is necessary because so many people spend       down their life savings in the first few years of care. I am       glad that over the years some of my tax dollars have paid for       needed services for others. I believe we must and can improve       the quality, affordability and effectiveness of health care       in this country; but we won't do it by denying so many       Americans basic health and disability services.    Consider this deeply personal story from Allyson in Brattleboro:         About a year ago, I got a migraine. it never went away.       Instead, it got worse and worse, and turned into what is       called a hemiplegic migraine. These migraines look and feel       like strokes, but are `just' migraines. I started having       seizures soon after that; they would later be diagnosed as       psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. I have also had rheumatoid       arthritis for five years.        The saving grace in all of this has been Medicaid, made       available to me through the Obamacare Medicaid Expansion. I       have not had to worry about affording the care I've needed       (probably close to $100,000, plus $80,000 in prescriptions),       which has taken one huge worry off my plate. I could go to       the seizure monitoring unit at DHMC for a week without       stopping to wonder how I was going to pay for it. I could       fill my--prescription ($4,000 a month) without worry, and       continue to walk around and look after my kids. I could try       several medications for migraine to try to get better. And I       could get good, solid therapy for mental health treatment.        Without these things, and the Medicaid that pays for them,       I would be far sicker than I am now. I would not be able to       care for my children, or work even a little bit. I would       likely die young. Instead, I am making it through, spending       time with my children, and healing.        Please continue fighting for my healthcare, for my life.    Vermonters came to Washington Monday in their efforts to attend the  sole hearing on the hapless Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal.  They waited in line for hours, and they were not granted access to the  hearing, held in a smaller room despite the known public interest in  this hearing.   Waiting in line for a hearing he was not allowed to attend, Drew from  Readesboro said:         ``[T]his is my second time down here. I'm here to finally       kill this bill as it will result in the deaths of millions of       Americans and significant loses to Vermont's funding.''    Todd from Bennington said:         The reason I oppose the bill is being I'm a walking pre-      existing condition. Diabetes, high blood pressure. It's       getting under control, but it wouldn't without healthcare.    Mari from Lincoln said:         I'm here because I have to. Like Marcelle [Leahy], I've       been a nurse for almost 30 years and if it weren't for the       Affordable Care Act many of the patients that I'm caring for       now in the inpatient cardiology unit at the University of       Vermont Medical Center would either not be alive or would be       in a much more devastating situation. Many of the young       adults that I care for in the cardiology unit have opiate       addiction and are there with serious infections because of       that. And if it weren't for the part of the Affordable Care       Act that allowed young adults up to 26 to still be covered by       their parents insurance, many of these young adults would not       be alive. So I've been fighting for health reform in Vermont       for decades now . . . This is THE most immoral bill I've seen       in my 58 years of life . . . I'm appalled and I'm angry, and       I'm very motivated. I wish we didn't have to be here but I'm       so proud to be here.    These are real stories, real lives. This matters.   These TrumpCare proposals are not healthcare bills. A true healthcare  bill would not kick millions of Americans off health insurance. A true  healthcare bill would not allow insurance companies to charge people  more for less coverage. A true healthcare bill would not move us  backwards to a time when healthcare was unaffordable.   Where there are deficiencies, let's fix them. Where we can find  common ground, let's act. One of the first things we should do is  stabilize the insurance market by making cost-sharing payments  permanent. Earlier this month, the Senate was doing just that. The  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held bipartisan  hearings aimed at stabilizing our insurance market. This week, the  Finance Committee reached an agreement on a 5-year extension of the  Children's Health Insurance Program. This is important progress that  should not be cast aside.   We should also be working to shore up funding for our health centers,  which will see a 70 percent cut at the end of the month if we fail to  act. One of the issues I hear most about is the cost of prescription  drugs, which is why I have introduced a bill along with Senator  Grassley that would help reduce drug costs by helping generic  alternatives come to market faster. The American people expect us to  work on real solutions. We should not be pushing a plan that hasn't  been vetted where the primary goal seems to be to get to 50 votes,  rather than actually improving our health insurance system.   Was the Affordable Care Act absolutely perfect when it was passed?  No, and we acknowledged the need for continual improvement as the ACA  would be implemented, but unlike with other important social programs  that have been created over the years--such as Social Security and  Medicare--Republicans have not allowed us the opportunity to improve,  strengthen and perfect it over time. Those programs were also not  perfect, but instead of playing partisan games, Republicans and  Democrats came together to get something done, time and time again. We  did not vote to repeal the Social Security Act. No, we came together,  and we discussed what needed to be done to better help the American  people, not unravel their safety net.   We must end this dangerous exercise of considering sweeping policy  solely for the purposes of fulfilling a nearly decade-long partisan  campaign promise. We should move forward in a responsible way. We  should act in the best interests of our constituents and not resort to  cynical, bumper-sticker politicking. At its best, the Senate has been  able to act as the conscience of the Nation. I hope now is such a time  and that the Senate will rise to the occasion and abandon these harmful  efforts.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.
