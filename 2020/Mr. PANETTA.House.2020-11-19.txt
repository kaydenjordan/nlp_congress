 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an amazing  constituent and patriot from the Central Coast of California, Lester  Shoff.   Raised in Pennsylvania, Lester was drafted into the Army in 1941. In  fact, his draft number in the lottery was lucky number 1. Making the  rank of staff sergeant, Lester was sent to the South Pacific and faced  many of the challenges of serving in World War II.   He fought for 4 years on close to 10 islands in the Pacific, during  which time he turned down a battlefield commission to become an  officer. He was shot in the back by a sniper, and he was even stung by  a scorpion.   Although Lester was the recipient of the Purple Heart and Bronze  Star, his daughter, Kay, told us that he never liked discussing the war  because, when he did, the unemotional Lester would be brought to tears  by the memory of two men who died on a mission that he led.   After serving, Lester moved to Silicon Valley, where he worked for  Lockheed and developed glue for the Space Shuttle. He then retired to  the Central Coast with his family.   Madam Speaker, some say Lester was lucky; I say that we are all lucky  to call Lester an American.                            ____________________
