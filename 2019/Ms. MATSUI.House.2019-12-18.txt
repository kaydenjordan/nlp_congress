 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. I came to  Congress to serve the great people of Sacramento and to build a better  future for our children and grandchildren, including my grandkids, Anna  and Robby.   The facts before us are crystal clear. We heard testimony from 17  brave patriots who value our democracy and the Constitution. They  testified that President Trump threatened to withhold congressionally  approved money in exchange for dirt on a political rival and, worse,  that he continues to invite foreign powers to violate our sovereignty  even today.   On its face, these are impeachable offenses that represent a clear  and present danger to our country. That is why the only answer is to  act now. We need to stand together and stop President Trump immediately  so that he cannot violate the next election.   Madam Speaker, for the sake of our country and our democracy, I will  vote ``yes'' to impeach the President.
