 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak before  the vote.    Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage with regard  to President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeast  Syria. This decision is dangerous, premature, and wholly inconsistent  with what the facts on the ground in Syria and the advice from  everyone--from our diplomats to our military advisers.   In just 1 week, President Trump has managed to undo 5 years of hard- fought stability in northeast Syria. Just 1 week ago, over 10,000 ISIS  fighters, including high-value prisoners who targeted American victims,  were secured in prisons throughout northeast Syria. We face, today, a  very different picture. Several ISIS prisons are already unmanned as a  result of Turkey's incursion, and it is estimated that over 100 ISIS  prisoners have been released already. We don't know what will happen in  those other detention centers that have housed ISIS prisoners.   One week ago, a limited U.S. troop presence of 1,000 Special Forces  stabilized a population that was once terrorized by the Syrian regime  and later by ISIS. These forces secured a region of Syria that controls  over two-thirds of Syria's natural resources. American troops have,  today, either left or are preparing to leave this area, and the Syrian  regime is moving in.   Russian troops have moved into U.S. military bases, and over 160,000  Syrian civilians have already fled their homes as a result of the spike  in violence that has been instigated by Turkey. It is so hard to watch  the videos on television that show Turkey-affiliated fighters  assassinating Kurdish forces--Kurds with their hands tied behind their  backs.   I traveled to Syria a year ago last summer. Lindsey Graham and I saw  firsthand the work of the combined joint task force, Operation Inherent  Resolve. We saw the work its partner forces, the Syrian Democratic  Forces, were doing, and it was truly remarkable. The United States owes  a huge debt of gratitude to the men and women of the SDF who sacrificed  over 11,000 of their own lives in fighting ISIS so we didn't have to  sacrifice our own.   Because of this sacrifice, when we were in northeast Syria last  summer, we witnessed communities like Manbij steadily recover and  rebuild after 3 years under ISIS's brutal occupation, and the  widespread appreciation of the U.S. presence among local, multiethnic  residents was a testament to the importance of our partnerships and our  willingness to lead in times of crisis. As we drove down the roads, we  saw kids flashing victory signs at our troops. When we were in the  marketplace, we had people come out and tell us how relieved they were  that the United States was there to help ensure that peace was being  kept. We saw local governance taking place on the ground.   So it is incredibly difficult now to see images coming out of Manbij  and the other places we visited in northeastern Syria. The Syrian  regime has already moved troops back into this region, and Turkey's  proxies, who are seemingly undeterred by the Syrian presence, continue  to move into the city of Manbij with heavily armed vehicles. Meanwhile,  Russia has spent the last few days touring and posting videos of  abandoned, taxpayer-funded U.S. bases.   What is taking place in Manbij and in so many cities across northeast  Syria is an insult to the thousands of American servicemembers who have  risked their lives to help stabilize that region and support the fight  against ISIS, and it could have all been avoided.   This really began in December of 2018 when the President said he  planned to withdraw troops from Syria. That was after holding up for  months the stabilization dollars that could have been used to make it  very clear that we were committed to the region--to ensuring that ISIS  wouldn't rebuild there and that there would be stability in  northeastern Syria. We were committed to making sure the United States  was at the table when Russia and Iran and Assad moved in and carved up  Syria.   I ask unanimous to have printed in the Record the recommendations on  the best way forward in Syria that were issued last month by the  bipartisan Syria Study Group, which I helped to create.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Executive Summary         The United States cannot avoid or ignore the conflict in       Syria. From the outset of hostilities, minimizing American       involvement in the war and safeguarding U.S. national       security interests have proven to be incompatible goals. This       will remain the case for the foreseeable future. The       essential question before American policymakers is not       whether the United States should keep or withdraw its forces       in Syria, but what strategy and mix of tools will best       protect the United States from the conflict's reverberations       and advance American interests. This report sets out such a       strategy.                  The Syrian Conflict and American Interests         From the conflict's beginning in 2011 as a peaceful       domestic uprising, experts warned that President Bashar al-      Assad's brutal response was likely to have serious, negative       impacts on U.S. interests. Given Syria's central location in       the Middle East, its ruling regime's ties to terrorist groups       and to Iran, and the incompatibility of Assad's authoritarian       rule with the aspirations of the Syrian people, many worried       about the conflict  [[Page S5866]]       spilling over Syria's borders. These concerns are now a       reality. The Syrian conflict spawned a refugee crisis that       has encumbered Syria's neighbors and roiled European       politics, strained U.S.-Turkish relations to the point of       crisis, led to direct hostilities between Iran and Israel,       provided a vector for Russia's resurgence in the Middle East,       and challenged international norms around weapons of mass       destruction and the protection of civilians. Areas of Syria       have become safe havens for al-Qaeda and its fellow travelers       and home to the largest concentration of foreign terrorist       fighters since Afghanistan in the 1990s. The conflict also       fueled the rise of ISIS, prompting an ongoing U.S.-led       military intervention. Eight years in, the conflict has not       been meaningfully contained, nor has the United States been       sheltered from its effects.        Events on the ground disprove the narrative that the       conflict has been won by the Assad regime. The Syrian war,       far from ending, is entering a new phase. As of this writing,       the Assad regime and its patron Russia are pressing an       offensive against Idlib that could spur a new humanitarian       catastrophe and outflow of refugees. Tensions are simmering       between the Kurdish element that dominates the U.S.-trained       Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeastern Syria and the       Arab populace of some of the areas under SDF control. Turkey       is positioning troops to invade northeastern Syria, which       would divert the SDF away from the essential task of       preventing ISIS's resurgence. ISIS itself, down but not       defeated, is already resurfacing as an insurgency and may yet       attempt to retake territory in both Syria and Iraq. Iran and       Israel, already locked in a low-level conflict in Syria, may       escalate to open conflict, especially in the Golan Heights.       The Assad regime and its partners may seek to cross the       Euphrates River, which could in turn breathe life into the       ISIS insurgency and allow Iran to consolidate its land routes       from Iraq to Lebanon. All of these scenarios become more       likely without U.S. forces in Syria and without committed       U.S. leadership to avert these scenarios.        The Syria Study Group uncovered no easy solutions in Syria;       optimal outcomes were left behind long ago. Yet the Group       determined that the threats the conflict in Syria poses--of       terrorism directed against the United States and its allies       and partners; of an empowered Iran; of an aggrandized Russia;       of large numbers of refugees, displaced persons, and other       forms of humanitarian catastrophe; and of the erosion of       international norms of war and the Western commitment to       them--are sufficiently serious to merit a determined response       from the United States. The United States and its allies       retain tools to address those threats and the leverage to       promote outcomes that are better for American interests than       those that would prevail in the absence of U.S. engagement.       Using those tools effectively, however, will require better       alignment of ends and means--the former must be more       realistic and the U.S. investment of the latter increased--as       well as clear, consistent, and high-level political       leadership. Sharp shifts and reversals in American policy,       and the failure of senior U.S. government officials to       prioritize the issue with their counterparts, have undermined       American credibility and the effectiveness of U.S. policy.                 Assessment of the Current Situation in Syria         While the conflict in Syria is often characterized as       winding down, it is the assessment of the Syria Study Group       that this is incorrect; in fact, the conflict remains dynamic       and dangerous. In particular:        The liberation of ISIS-held territory does not eliminate       the group's threat to the United States. ISIS no longer holds       significant territory in Syria or Iraq, but it is not       defeated. The group has morphed into an insurgency with the       will, capability, and resources to carry out attacks against       the United States. ISIS will seek to take advantage of any       opening, whether a reduction in U.S. counterterrorism       pressure or discontent among eastern Syria's Arab population,       to recruit new fighters and mount attacks. ISIS's terrorist       ideology, or ``brand,'' continues to hold global appeal.        The ISIS detainee population is a long-term challenge that       is not being adequately addressed. Although ISIS has suffered       significant casualties, many of its fighters--including       thousands of foreign fighters--remain in detention under SDF       management. If released, they will form the core of a new       iteration of ISIS or a similar group. In addition, tens of       thousands of family members of ISIS fighters are residing in       camps in eastern Syria. The SDF has custody of both groups       but lacks the resources and outside support to hold them       indefinitely. U.S. and allied efforts to deal with this       problem have suffered from a lack of political will.        Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups remain active in Syria       and threaten the United States. Although ISIS has received       far more attention, other terrorist groups are active and       control territory, especially in Idlib. Al-Qaeda offshoot       Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has formed a government in Idlib, which       is home to numerous other groups, including al-Qaeda's Syrian       affiliate, Hurras ad-Din, and a large number of foreign       terrorist fighters. The United States lacks freedom of action       to conduct a full-fledged counterterrorism campaign in these       areas.        Despite Israeli air strikes and U.S. sanctions, Iran       continues to entrench itself in Syria; Russia and Iran show       few serious signs of divergence. Iran appears to be pursuing       a two-track policy of military entrenchment and political and       economic activity designed to enhance its power and influence       in Syria for the long term. Iran's activities have reportedly       caused discontent among Syria's population, but the Assad       regime is heavily dependent on Iranian support. Israeli       officials believe that Israel's air strikes have disrupted       Iran's attempts to move sophisticated weapons systems into       Syria, but Iran's overall objectives appear unchanged and the       risk of broader Iran-Israel conflict remains high. Although       Russia has acquiesced to the Israeli campaign against Iran,       there are few signs of a wider divergence between Moscow and       Tehran regarding aims or tactics in Syria.        Assad has not won the conflict in Syria. The regime has       recaptured large swaths of territory and now holds 60 percent       of the country. However, its control outside Damascus is       tenuous, in part because it lacks the forces to secure the       areas it retakes, but also because it pursues punitive       policies against local populations. In much of regime-held       areas, civilians are subject to conscription as well as       arbitrary arrest, torture, and execution at the hands of the       regime. Crime and warlordism are rampant. The Assad regime is       determined to retake Idlib and is receiving Russian       assistance to do so, but so far it has struggled to recapture       territory without the help of Iranian ground forces        Progress toward a political settlement to the Syria       conflict has stalled, and Assad shows no willingness to       compromise with his opponents. Neither the UN-led ``Geneva       process'' based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254 nor       the ad hoc ``Astana process'' comprising Russia, Iran, and       Turkey has yielded progress toward a political settlement to       the conflict. While the United States is leading a new effort       to break the stalemate, the fundamental obstacle remains the       Assad regime's unwillingness to countenance meaningful       reform. Presidential elections in 2021 are unlikely to       produce a legitimate electoral outcome, because there is       little chance that the regime will permit free and fair       elections or the credible participation of the Syrian       diaspora.        The United States underestimated Russia's ability to use       Syria as an arena for regional influence. Russia's       intervention, beginning in 2015, accomplished its proximate       aim--the preservation of the regime in defiance of U.S. calls       for Assad to ``go''--at a relatively low cost. Russia has       enhanced its profile and prestige more broadly in the Middle       East. The extent of Russia's success in Syria is debatable--      it has yet to translate Assad's military gains into the       political victory Moscow seemingly seeks--but Russia has       nevertheless reestablished itself as a crucial player in the       region's politics for the first time in decades.        U.S.-Turkey relations are strained in Syria by starkly       diverging views of the SDF. A Turkish incursion into       northeastern Syria would represent a major setback to U.S.       aims in Syria and a new crisis for the U.S.-Turkish       relationship. The United States regards its decision to       partner with the SDF to fight ISIS as having been       necessitated by the lack of credible and timely Turkish       alternative; Turkey regards the SDF as a grave security       threat due to its links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party       (PKK), a threat made more dangerous by U.S. training and       equipping of the SDF. This dispute has played a significant       role in the erosion of U.S.-Turkish relations and may yet       prompt a third Turkish incursion into Syria, which would       severely complicate the U.S. military campaign against ISIS.       There is little sign that Turkey intends to relinquish       control of the two Syrian areas it currently controls--Afrin       and the ``Euphrates Shield'' area.        Although the SDF has been a highly effective partner in the       fight against ISIS, it must undergo a transition to ensure       stability in northeastern Syria. The SDF is regarded by the       U.S. military as a highly effective partner in the       conventional military campaign against ISIS. That partnership       faces new challenges with the shift from fighting to       governing. The SDF remains dominated by Syrian Kurds--      specifically by the People's Protection Units (YPG)--despite       its control over large stretches of predominantly Arab       territory. This disparity, and the YPG's heavy-handed       approach to governing and resource allocation, has led to       unrest in Arab tribal areas. Minimal U.S. civilian engagement       and the halt in U.S. stabilization funding in northeastern       Syria have diminished American influence.        The Assad regime's systematic targeting of civilians and       civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes and demands       accountability, as well as enhanced efforts to protect       civilians. The Assad regime and its patrons, including       Russia, have systematically targeted civilians and civilian       infrastructure. A UN commission found the regime guilty of       crimes against humanity. Syrians have been subjected to       arbitrary detention, torture, and execution at the hands of       the regime. Although prospects for accountability are dim in       the near term, efforts to document the regime's atrocities       are under way.        Syria's humanitarian crisis, not least the challenges posed       by internally displaced people and refugees, will reverberate       for decades. Most refugees are unlikely to return voluntarily       given current conditions in Syria. The Syrian conflict has       provoked the most serious human displacement since World War       II, 6 million Syrians are internally displaced, and nearly 6       million more are registered as refugees outside the country.       Refugees have placed a heavy economic  [[Page S5867]]       burden on host countries, especially Syria's neighbors;       pressure is increasing, particularly within Lebanon and       Turkey, for nonvoluntary returns. Inside Syria, a large       proportion of the population relies on humanitarian aid, over       which the regime seeks to exercise control in order to       enhance its power.        Despite these challenges, the United States maintains       leverage to shape an outcome in Syria that protects core U.S.       national security interests. The Group identified several key       points of leverage held by the United States, particularly if       used in coordination with allies and partners: influence over       northeastern Syria; sanctions against the Assad regime and       its backers; the withholding of reconstruction assistance       desired by Assad and Russia; and the ongoing diplomatic       isolation of the Assad regime.                       Recommendations for U.S. Policy         Despite its daunting assessment of the situation in Syria,       the Group believes that the United States is still able to       exercise influence over the conflict's trajectory, and that       it must do so given the threats the conflict poses to       American interests. The Group believes that the best end       state in Syria is one in which a Syrian government is viewed       as legitimate by its own population and has the will and       capability to end Syria's dependence on foreign forces and to       prevent terrorist groups from thriving on Syrian territory.       This in turn requires conditions in which Syrian citizens       live free from fear of the Assad regime and of Russian,       Iranian, and ISIS brutality and within an updated political       and social compact based on decentralized governance and       equitable resource allocation.        Recognizing that such an outcome is a distant prospect, the       Group recommends a strategy that makes a negotiated political       settlement in Syria more likely yet also allows the United       States to defend its interests even if a political solution       is not found. None of those consulted by the Group believe       that withdrawing U.S. forces would make ISIS less likely to       regroup, Iran less likely to entrench itself, or a negotiated       settlement more likely. Although the U.S. military mission in       Syria is often lumped together with the Iraq and Afghanistan       missions in the ``forever war'' category, the Syria case       offers a different--and far less costly--model. A small U.S.       military footprint, supported by U.S. air power and other       high-end capabilities, reinforced by a global coalition of       like-minded allies and partners, rallied a local partner       force many times its size to liberate territory from a       terrorist group. What U.S. forces and their partners have       gained in Syria should not be discarded with a premature       withdrawal.        To that end, the Group recommends that the United States,       working in concert with allies and partners, continue its       military mission in order to maintain pressure on ISIS and       other terrorist groups while maintaining and strengthening       pressure on the Assad regime and its backers until conditions       are conducive for a political settlement that ends the Syria       war. In particular, the Group recommends that the United       States:        Halt the U.S. military withdrawal; consolidate gains       following the territorial defeat of ISIS; and support       communities liberated from ISIS in forming an alternative       model for governance, resource allocation, and security in       Syria. The Group recommends that the United States (1) update       its military mission to head off an ISIS insurgency; (2)       adequately prepare for various contingencies and escalation       scenarios; (3) return a U.S. civilian presence and       stabilization funding to northeastern Syria; (4) press the       SDF to govern more inclusively; (5) elevate the ISIS detainee       problem set; and (6) prioritize diplomatic and military       engagement in Iraq.        Until conditions inside Syria improve, deny the Assad       regime and its backers all avenues for normalization by       enforcing the regime's diplomatic isolation and a rigorous       sanctions architecture. Among other steps, the United States       should continue to press allies and partners to refrain from       reestablishing diplomatic ties with the Assad regime, to       withhold reconstruction assistance, and to strictly enforce       sanctions and seek to expand them. In addition, the       international community should begin preparing the ground now       for the eventual accountability of those responsible for war       crimes in Syria, without imposing accountability as a       precondition for a political settlement.        Test and verify Russian willingness to support political       settlements acceptable to the United States but continue       activities that increase the costs to Russia for its actions       in Syria. Many observers believe that agreement between the       United States and Russia is a prerequisite for progress       toward a political settlement, yet Russia has consistently       failed to deliver on its commitments in Syria. The United       States should require concrete actions of Russia pursuant to       any discussions of a political settlement and, absent such       actions, should avoid making concessions to Moscow or       legitimizing its positions. Concurrently, the United States       should pressure Moscow, in part by highlighting Russian       complicity in war crimes.        Remain focused on expelling Iranian forces and proxies from       Syria but recognize that this is best accomplished in phases.       The key near-term goal should be to prevent further       entrenchment of Iran and its many partners and proxies while       raising the cost to Iran for its actions in Syria. To this       end, the United States should continue its support of Israeli       air strikes; enforce sanctions aimed at undermining Iran's       ability to fund its proxies and partners in Syria, Lebanon,       and Iraq; maintain the U.S. military presence at the al-Tanf       military base; and support efforts to expose Iranian       influence efforts in Syria. The United States should insist       that any political settlement require the withdrawal of       Iranian forces and proxies from Syria.        Seek areas for cooperation with Turkey and address       legitimate Turkish security concerns while pressing Turkey to       avoid any incursion into northeastern Syria and to improve       conditions in the Afrin and Euphrates Shield areas. U.S.       efforts to reach agreement on a security zone or security       mechanism along Turkey's border with northeastern Syria       should continue, and every attempt should be made to isolate       Syria from other problems in the U.S.-Turkey relationship.       The United States should encourage the resumption of Turkey-      PKK peace talks, which hold the best possibility of leading       to a detente between Turkey and the SDF. The United States       should press Turkey to improve conditions and access in the       areas of Syria it controls.        Seek to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib while       addressing the presence there of terrorist groups. The United       States should explore avenues to increase the pressure on       terrorist groups in Idlib that may be plotting external       attacks. At the same time, the United States should seek to       deter the Assad regime and its partners from continuing to       target civilians in the territory. In preparation for a       renewed humanitarian and refugee crisis in Idlib, the United       States should press Turkey to facilitate the work of       nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) serving the population.        Energize efforts to address the humanitarian crisis inside       Syria while taking steps to shore up countries hosting Syrian       refugees. The United States should work to ensure the       continued provision of humanitarian aid to vulnerable       populations inside and outside Syria. The United States       should press for the renewal of the UN ``cross-border       resolution,'' rally other states to fund humanitarian appeals       for Syria, and work with international financial institutions       to support refugee-hosting countries. The United States       should stand firmly against efforts to forcibly repatriate       Syrian refugees and should resume accepting Syrian refugees       in the United States.     The report read that the United States should make the  most of its gains and hold this critical piece of land until a  negotiated settlement was reached between all parties. Moreover, the  report, which was bipartisan--that had Representatives appointed by  Members of Congress and by the administration--read that withdrawing  U.S. troops would not make ISIS less likely to regroup or Iran less  likely to entrench itself.   President Trump's ill-informed and hasty decision will not only  breathe new life into the terrorist groups--into ISIS, which is really  just al-Qaida by another name--and cede America's hard-fought gains in  the region to Russia, Iran, and Assad, but it will erode U.S.  credibility in the long term. It will cede America's hard-fought gains  in the region.   I wish there were alternatives that we as a country could pursue.  Sadly, I don't think we can put the genie back in the bottle. Here in  Congress, though, I hope we will look at ways to hold Turkey and  President Erdogan accountable for his actions.   I certainly hope President Trump will revoke his invitation to  President Erdogan to visit the United States. President Erdogan needs  to hear an unequivocal message of opposition to this incursion from the  United States, and it makes no sense to extend hospitality and niceties  during this moment of crisis.   Republicans and Democrats must come together and ensure that the  administration understands the consequences of these actions. We have  to do more to ensure that such mistakes never happen again.   I yield the floor.                                 S.J. Res. 53
