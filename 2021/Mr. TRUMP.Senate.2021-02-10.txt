 I have to see. Look, I have to see. No, I'm not       just going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.         Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very       peaceful--there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a       continuation.    Senators, the President of the United States said: There won't be a  transition of power, frankly. There will be a continuation.   President Trump was given every opportunity to tell his supporters:  Yes, if I lose, I will peacefully transfer power to the next  President. Instead, he told his supporters the only way he could lose  the election is if it were stolen.    In tweet after tweet, he made sweeping allegations about election  fraud that couldn't possibly be true. But that was the point. He didn't  care if things were true. He wanted to make sure that his supporters  were angry, like the election was being ripped away from them.   On May 24, 6 months before the election, he tweeted:         It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history.    How could he possibly know it would be the greatest rigged election  in history 6 months before the election happened?   And, on June 22, more of the same:         RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!    Again--about an election that had not even happened.   On July 30:         2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in       history.    Again, just big words with nothing to prove them, but he wanted to  make his supporters believe that an election victory would be stolen  from him and from them. This was to rile up his base, to make them  angry.   Now, these were just a few of the many times President Trump tweeted  about this, and he did it in speeches, in rallies, and on television,  too.   (Text of video presentation of 7-31-2020.)         President TRUMP: This is going to be the greatest election       disaster in history.        Because the only way we are going to lose this election is       if the election is rigged. Remember that.        The only way they can take this election away from us is if       this is a rigged election. We are going to win this election.        It's a rigged election. That's the only way we are going to       lose.        But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent--most       fraudulent elections ever.    This is clearly a man who refuses to accept the possibility or the  reality in our democracy of losing an election, and there are dozens  more tweets and speeches of Donald Trump spreading his lie, but you get  the point. His supporters got the point as well. They firmly believed  that, if he lost, it was because the election was rigged.   (Text of video presentation of 9-15-2020.)         The Interviewer. Will you accept the result if Joe Biden       wins?        Unidentified Speaker. No.        The Interviewer. Under any circumstances?        Unidentified Speaker. No.        The Interviewer. Why is that?        Unidentified Speaker. Because it's lies and deceit and       corruption.        The Interviewer. Do you think that, when you get to       election night or in the following  [[Page S621]]       days, if Biden winds up somehow becoming the winner--do you       think it's rigged?        Unidentified Speaker. Oh, yes, very much so.        The Interviewer. On election night--        Unidentified Speaker. Yes.        The Interviewer.--if it ends up that Joe Biden wins--        Unidentified Speaker. Yes.        The Interviewer.--in your opinion, would that be the only       way that Trump could lose, that it would be a rigged       election? Is that the only way Joe Biden could win?        Unidentified Speaker. Absolutely. I agree with that because       there's no way in heck our President is going to lose, but,       yes, it would be a rigged election. There will be--some type       of cheating went on, what have you, and I firmly believe       that.    Now, all of us in this room have run for election, and it is no fun  to lose. I am a Texas Democrat, and we have lost a few elections over  the years, but can you imagine telling your supporters that the only  way you could possibly lose is if an American election were rigged and  stolen from you?   Ask yourself whether you have ever seen anyone at any level of  government make the same claim about their own election, but that is  exactly what President Trump did. He truly made his base believe that  the only way he could lose was if the election were rigged.   Senators, all of us know and all of understand how dangerous that is  for our country, because the most combustible thing you can do in a  democracy is convince people that an election doesn't count, that their  voices and their votes don't count, and that it has all been stolen,  especially if what you are saying are lies.   Let us turn now to the election.   As you know, the results were not fully reported on election night,  which is not unusual in our Nation's history. But by November 7, major  news networks, including FOX News, reported that, once the remaining  votes were counted, Joe Biden would be the likely victor. So President  Trump began urging his supporters to stop the count.   I would imagine that, if we went around this room, there would be  folks sitting here who started down on election night and ended up  coming back up and winning their races. Perhaps that is why some of you  are seated in this room today.   But imagine if you were behind, and the results started coming in,  and as you started pulling ahead, your opponent said: That's not fair.  Stop the count while I am still ahead.   That is what Donald Trump did, but that is not how America works.  Here, every vote counts. You don't just stop counting when one person  is ahead. We count every vote.   And let's be clear: President Trump knew that you just can't stop  counting votes, but he wanted to inflame his base. There was a purpose  behind this--to truly make them believe that counting votes would  result in a stolen, rigged election.   He said at 12:49 a.m. on election night:         They are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let       them do it.    A little over an hour later, at, roughly, 2:30 in the morning, before  all the votes were even close to being counted, he goes even further  and actually declares victory. Take a look.   (Text of video presentation of 11-4-2020.)         President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the American public.       This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting       ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this       election.    ``Frankly, we did win,'' rather than calmly saying: Let's count the  votes. If there are legal issues, we will go to court, and we will  resolve them.   Instead, he told his supporters that he had actually won the election  and that the whole thing was a fraud. He said that on November 4, and  he has never renounced that statement since.   Despite President Trump's pressure at the time, election officials  around the country continued to carry out their duties, and as votes  were counted and his loss became more certain, he riled up his base  further. Take a look at these tweets.    On November 5, he tweeted, in all capital letters, as if shouting  commands:         STOP THE COUNT!        STOP THE FRAUD!    Senators, this is dangerous.   I also want you to remember these tweets for another reason, because  that is what it looks like when Donald Trump wants people to stop doing  something.   Bear in mind, this is not the President saying to his supporters that  somebody stole your cup of coffee. This is the Commander in Chief  telling his supporters ``your election is being stolen, and you must  stop the counting of American votes,'' and it worked. His words became  their actions. His commands led to their actions. Take a look at this.   The same day as those tweets--the same day as those tweets--around  100 Trump supporters showed up in front of the Maricopa County  elections center in Phoenix, some of them carrying rifles, literally  trying to intimidate officials to stop the count just as President  Trump had commanded. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said that  protesters were ``causing delay and disruption and preventing those  employees from doing their job.''   Let's call this what it was. We were facing a global pandemic, and  workers were risking their health to ensure the integrity of our  elections. President Trump's supporters were encircling them, trying to  prevent them from doing their own jobs. This was dangerous, it was  scary, and it was a blatant act of political intimidation.   In Philadelphia, that same day, police investigated an alleged plot  to attack the city's Pennsylvania Convention Center, where votes were  being counted. Police took at least one man into custody who was  carrying a weapon. This happened all over. In Atlanta, in Detroit, and  in Milwaukee, his supporters used armed force to try to disrupt the  lawful counting of votes because they bought into Trump's big lie that  the election was stolen from them.   President Trump's months of inflaming and inciting his supporters had  worked. They believed it was their duty to, quite literally, fight to  stop the count. So they showed up at election centers across the  country to do just that.   (Text of video presentation of 11-5-2020.)         President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the American public.       This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting       ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this       election.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        (People chanting: ``Stop the count.'')        (People chanting: ``They ain't taking it from us.'')        President TRUMP. We were winning in all the key locations       by a lot, actually, and then our numbers started miraculously       getting whittled away in secret.        (People chanting: ``They will pay. They will be destroyed       because America is rising.'')    And there it is. They had bought into his big lie. President Trump  told his supporters over and over again, nearly every day, in dozens of  tweets, speeches, and rallies, that their most precious right in our  democracy--their voice, their vote--was being stripped away, and they  had to fight to stop that. They believed him, and so they fought.   You may say: Well, he didn't know that they would take up arms. But  when he did know, when it was all over the news, President Trump didn't  stop. As Mr. Swalwell will show, after Donald Trump lost, he became  even more desperate and incited his base even further. He urged them  again and again, with increasingly forceful language, to fight to stop  the steal. Even as the certification got closer and he grew even more  desperate, he gave them specific instructions on how, where, and when  to fight to stop the steal. He told them to show up on January 6 and  march to the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the election  results, and he told them to come here and fight like hell.   You will see, clearly, that this violent mob that showed up here on  January 6 didn't come out of thin air. President Donald John Trump  incited this violence, and that is the truth.   Mr. Manager SWALWELL. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, my name  is Eric Swalwell, and I represent California's 15th Congressional  District.   Manager Castro just told you about Donald Trump's lies and acts  before the election, but to paraphrase Winston Churchill, that wasn't  the end of his efforts. That wasn't the beginning of the end, but  perhaps it was the end of the beginning. Here is what I mean.   You saw President Trump prime for months his supporters to believe  that, if the election were lost, it only could  [[Page S622]]  have been so because it was rigged, but that took time just like, to  build a fire, it doesn't just start with the flames. Donald Trump, for  months and months, assembled the tinder, the kindling--threw on logs  for fuel--to have his supporters believe that the only way their  victory would be lost was if it were stolen. So, that way, President  Trump was ready, if he lost the election, to light the match.   And on November 7, after all the votes were counted, President Trump  did lose by 7 million votes.   But for Donald Trump, all was not lost. He had a backup plan. Instead  of accepting the results or pursuing legitimate claims, he told his  base more lies. He doused the flames with kerosene.   And this wasn't just some random guy at the neighborhood bar blowing  off steam. This was our Commander in Chief.   Day after day, he told his supporters false, outlandish lies that the  victory--that the election outcome was taken and it was rigged. And he  had absolutely no support for his claims, but that wasn't the point. He  wanted to make his base angrier and angrier.   And to make them angry, he was willing to say anything. On November  15, he stated:         I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a       RIGGED ELECTION!    He doesn't say why the election is rigged.   November 17, in a Twitter statement:         DEAD PEOPLE VOTED.    That is it. No evidence, just ``DEAD PEOPLE VOTED.''   November 28, Twitter statement:         We have found many illegal votes. Stay tuned!    This just wasn't true. He never found illegal votes. He didn't even  try to pretend that he had evidence for that. And ``stay tuned''? Well,  that was all about inciting his base, not about bringing legitimate  claims. It was about dramatizing the election to anger his supporters.   December 5, you see here he goes after the Governors of Arizona and  Georgia, Governors from his own party, claiming that they weren't with  him.   You see, Senators, he is casting this in combat terms; that either  you are with him, making sure that he won the election, or you are  fighting against him.   These are just a few of the hundreds of Twitter statements that  President Trump sent. And it wasn't just Twitter statements.   As you will see, he was dialing into meetings, holding rallies,  appearing on television, continuing to spread the big lie that his  election victory was stolen.   (Text of video presentation of 12-2-2020.)         President TRUMP. People that were dead were signing up for       ballots. Not only were they jumping in and putting in a       ballot, but dead people were requesting ballots, and they       were dead for years, and they were requesting ballots.        President TRUMP. Dead people voting all over the place.        President TRUMP. The alleged Biden margin of victory in       several states is entirely accounted for by extraordinarily       large midnight vote dumps. You saw them going up to the sky.    Massive ``midnight vote dumps.'' Dead people voting all over the  place. He said there were votes ``going up to the sky.''   This was never about pursuing legitimate claims. He was saying  anything he could to trigger and anger his base so that they would  fight like hell to overturn a legitimate election.   And it worked. Just as Manager Castro showed you, President Trump's  supporters were taking up arms to stop the count. His message to  ``fight like hell'' was having real consequences.   In Michigan, you will recall that President Trump was attacking that  State and its officials. He continued these attacks even after Michigan  certified its votes.   (Text of video presentation of 11-26-2020.)         President TRUMP. Take a look at Michigan. Take a look at       what they did with respect to counties, and then you get to       Detroit and it's like more votes than people. Dead people       voting all over the place.    (Text of video presentation of 12-5-2020.)         President TRUMP. You know I won almost every county in       Michigan, almost every district.        President TRUMP. We should have won that state very easily.       We have a similar type of governor, I think, but I'll let you       know that in about a week.    He is literally telling them that there were more votes in Detroit  than people.   About 260,000 people voted in Detroit. There are roughly 500,000  registered voters in Detroit. There are approximately 670,000 people  living in the city. So, again, not true. But he needed to make these  outlandish claims to truly make his supporters believe that their  victory was stolen from them.   And it was working. A few days after these clips, on December 5, his  supporters surrounded the Michigan Secretary of State's home.   (Text of video presentation of 12-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. I'm just sharing our Secretary of       State's House and . . .        (People chanting: ``Stop the steal.'')        Unidentified Speaker. You are a threat to democracy. You       are a threat to free and honest elections.    Nine o'clock at night, Secretary's family is inside; protestors have  surrounded her home; and they are chanting that she is a felon.   And, as we saw, when armed protestors showed up to follow President  Trump's direction to stop the steal, this was not the first time that  President Trump's supporters used threats and intimidation.   President Trump cannot say: I didn't know what I was inciting. From  what Manager Castro showed and what I just showed, there was plenty of  evidence that his words had consequences, and if he wanted to stop it,  he could stop it.   You saw Mr. Castro read statement after statement from our Commander  in Chief saying, ``Stop the count.'' ``Stop the steal.''   President Trump was never shy about using his platforms to try and  stop something. He could have very easily told his supporters: Stop  threatening officials. Stop going to their homes. Stop it with the  threats.    But each time, he didn't. Instead, in the face of escalating  violence, he incited them further.   The next phase in the certification of results was the certification  on December 14 of the electoral college votes.   The night before, President Trump personally issued 14 Twitter  statements, with more false claims about the election being stolen and  directing his supporters to make sure that ``they cannot be  certified.''   He states here:         The RINOS--    The RINOS--       that run the state voting apparatus have caused us the       problem of allowing the Democrats to so blatantly cheat in       their attempt to steal the election, which we won       overwhelmingly.        We will never give up!    In the face of threats to elected officials, this is his message.   And he calls them RINOS--Republicans in name only--and tells them to  never give up.   President Trump, to him, it was his supporters against anyone who  would not overturn the election results so that President Trump could  win.   But on December 14, despite all of President Trump's efforts to stop,  the electors cast their votes according to the will of the American  people, and Joe Biden was certified as having won 306 electoral college  votes.   The day after this occurred, Leader McConnell recognized this,  stating:         Many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield       a different result, but our system of government has       processes to determine who will be sworn in on January 20.       The Electoral College has spoken.    As Manager Castro said, no one here, no one among us wants to lose an  election. Sometimes there is a reason to dispute an election. Sometimes  the count is close. Sometimes we ask for a recount or we go to court.  That is entirely appropriate.   But what President Trump did was different. What President Trump did  was the polar opposite of what any of us would do if we lost an  election because once the outcome is clear and a judge rules, we  concede. We recognize the will of the American people because we let  the people decide.   And that is what all of the courts, the Justice Department, and the  50 States that had counted the votes--they said it was time for a  peaceful transition of power because that is what our Constitution and  rule of law demands.  [[Page S623]]    Except President Trump. He directed all of the rage that he had  incited to January 6. That was his last chance to stop the peaceful  transition of power.   And that brings us to the attack. Manager Castro told you the power  of the lie--especially when the lie comes from the most powerful person  in the world, the Commander in Chief.   It also helps if you spend millions of dollars to amplify that lie.  You will see here, in mid-December, President Trump announced the  release of ads, including ones entitled ``The Evidence is  Overwhelming--FRAUD!'' ``STOP THE STEAL.''   He spent $50 million from his legal defense fund on these ads to stop  the steal and amplify his message. They were released nationally,  played in video ads, online advertising, and targeted text messages.   They used the same words and phrases that President Trump had been  spreading for months; that the election was full of ``fraud,'' to  ``stop the steal.''   But now they had a specific purpose. How do we know that purpose?  These ads were designed to run all the way up to January 5, and then  they stopped. This was purposeful and deliberate planning to target his  base to rally around that day.   And it wasn't just his ads. He continued to use his own platform. He  told his supporters, who truly believed their victory had been stolen  and were ready to fight, when, where, and how to stop what he believed  was a steal.   Donald Trump would issue a deliberate call to action, and just like  in his ads, that action was centered around January 6.   On December 19, at 1:42 in the morning, our Commander in Chief  tweeted:         Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!    ``Will be wild!'' We know why he picked this day. It wasn't random.  It was his last chance to stop a peaceful transition of power, and he  gave his supporters plenty of time to plan.   This was the save-the-date sent out 18 days before the event on  January 6, and it wasn't a casual one-off reference or a single  invitation.   For the next 18 days, Donald Trump would make sure to remind them  over and over and over to show up on January 6.   And he would tell them exactly what he wanted them to do.   On December 26, he tweets:         If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged       & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen       before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of       war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the Republicans do       NOTHING, just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!    He is saying that the Republicans are doing nothing and have no fight  because you are doing your job, taking on the constitutional process of  certifying the electoral college results.   And he also suggests, President Trump, that if this was the reverse  and the Democrats had lost, it would be an act of war--an act of war.  That is how Donald Trump prepared his supporters for January 6.   He even stated again, 14 minutes later, to make sure his supporters  understood:         The ``Justice'' Department and the FBI have done nothing       about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest       SCAM--    All caps.       --in our nation's history, despite overwhelming evidence.       They should be ashamed.    And then he adds:         History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C.       on January 6th.    That phrase, ``History will remember,'' was the only time--the first  time--Donald Trump had used it in his Presidency, and he sent this to  70-plus million Twitter followers the day they needed to show up and be  ready to fight.   On December 27, he reminds them again:         Don't miss it. Information to follow!    A few days later, December 30, all caps, ``SEE YOU IN DC!'' This  continues all the way up to January 6.   On January 1, he states:         The BIG Protest Rally in Washington . . . will take place       at 11:00 A.
