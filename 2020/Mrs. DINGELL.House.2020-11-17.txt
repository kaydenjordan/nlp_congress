 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Block, Report,  And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act, which would crack down on pill  dumping and other abusive practices to address the ongoing opioid  epidemic, which still remains one of the most significant public health  challenges facing our country.   In 2018, over 67,000 Americans still lost their lives to drug  overdoses, and preliminary data for 2019 suggests that deaths are  rising again.   My home State of Michigan has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic,  which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. We have seen a 15 percent year- over-year increase in fatal overdoses across the entire State since  March of this year.   New tools to address pill dumping and other dodgy practices that have  [[Page H5818]]  perpetuated the opioid crisis are needed more now than ever. The Block,  Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act will crack down on these  abuses. It will improve oversight of the opioid supply chain by  mandating that the drug manufacturers and distributors exercise due  diligence when they receive a suspicious order for controlled  substances. This includes blocking or declining to fill the suspicious  order, and providing the DEA with additional data and background on the  indicators on the order in question.   Distributors and manufacturers should be active partners in  addressing these abuses, and this legislation's commonsense protections  will save lives in Michigan and the country.   Madam Speaker, I want to recognize my colleague, Congressman  McKinley, for his years of leadership and work in highlighting this  issue and driving action to address the role bad actors continue to  play in perpetuating the opioid crisis. I also thank Chairman Pallone  and Ranking Member Walden, who I am going to miss greatly, as well as  the Democratic and Republican committee staff for working tirelessly to  advance this important bipartisan priority.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
