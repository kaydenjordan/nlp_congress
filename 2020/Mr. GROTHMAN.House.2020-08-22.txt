 Madam Speaker, at this time when the coronavirus is  going on, I realize a lot of energy is expended as we work toward a  possible vaccine, but I would like the Centers for Disease Control to  bring up two other topics which may be helpful, though not quite as  expensive.   One is three universities--Trinity in Dublin, Harvard, and  Northwestern University--have shown that Vitamin D can do a lot toward  lessening the damage of COVID.   Madam Speaker, 40 percent of Americans suffer from a lack of vitamin  D, and you can get enough vitamin D--in addition to going outside, if  you are not staying inside too much--you can get it at your local  drugstore.   I wish the Centers for Disease Control would spend more time  publicizing this, as 40 percent of Americans are short of vitamin D.   I also wish they would spend more time dealing with fenofibrate,  which in Israel they are looking at. Perhaps this common  anticholesterol can also save a lot of lives as we await the vaccine.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This is a very interesting debate today. I think it would be a good  debate to be reviewed by every political science class in the country  as we analyze how Congress has spent us to a $25 trillion debt.   We have a situation today in which the U.S. Postal Service is sitting  on $15 billion. They have the right to borrow $10 billion from a  stimulus package bill we passed earlier. They are making more money  this year than last year because deliveries of packages are up. But  despite all these numbers, the majority party has decided to spend an  additional $25 billion.   Now, I like the post office. I really do. But when you have an agency  that can spend $25 billion that is unspent right now, $24 billion, and  you introduce a bill to say they need another $25 billion, and if you  don't vote for that $25 billion bill, it means you don't want children  to get little toys they are  [[Page H4276]]  going receive in the mail, or it means that we don't like the post  office, that is outlandish.                                time  1415    There are other things we can look at as well.   They talk about getting rid of post offices. In the first 3 years in  which President Trump has complete control of the administration, they  will be getting rid of less post office boxes than Obama from 2013 to  2016--I don't have the numbers before 2013; it might be 4 years in a  row--in the greatest year in which President Trump got rid of  mailboxes.   Another thing to point out is, even if every single person in this  country votes absentee, which they won't, it would only increase mail  that month by 1\1/2\ percent. So we have no crisis here. It is  something they will easily be able to handle.   The idea that we are even talking about spending another $25 billion  today is indicative of why this country is going to wind up spending  itself into oblivion.
