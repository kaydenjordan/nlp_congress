 Mr. Speaker, like many people, I have noticed renewed  interest in the 25th Amendment, as we have seen erratic behavior out of  the White House, an inability of Donald Trump to even tell whether it  rained on him during his inaugural speech, and repeating false  statements that are demonstrably wrong.   Last Friday, the mechanism to deal with Presidential incapacity, the  25th Amendment, celebrated its 50th anniversary. I became intrigued  with its history and application because it is clear, whether with  Donald Trump or a future President, this mechanism is very important.  Accidents can happen: President Reagan suffered from early onset  Alzheimer's that concerned his staff. President Wilson was  incapacitated by a stroke, and his wife, Edith, effectively governed  the United States for months.   It is only a matter of time before we face these challenges again. As  I examined the amendment, it became clear that, in the case of mental  or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw. For a mentally  unstable, paranoid, or delusional President, the 25th Amendment has no  guarantee of its application. In fact, it is likely that it would fail.   As written, the 25th Amendment requires the Vice President and a  majority of the Cabinet to concur that the President is no longer  capable of exercising authority. There are other safeguards. It would  take time to process. Ultimately, two-thirds of both Houses of Congress  must agree.   But look at the current Cabinet. Even if one thinks that a group with  no meaningful government experience, all approved in a heightened  partisan context, most of whom don't even know the President  personally, could objectively exercise the power should the President  become mentally incapacitated, the larger question is whether they  would ever be allowed to do so.   A President who is paranoid or delusional is very unlikely to  tolerate dissent within the ranks. He or she could simply fire any  Cabinet member who would stand up to them.   That is why we need to exercise the other part of the 25th Amendment  that allows Congress to designate another body, instead of the Cabinet.  Who could exercise that authority with the confidence of the American  public and with the knowledge of what it takes to understand the  personal and political stresses of the Presidency?   I submit that the best failsafe to a President who is emotionally  unstable would be to impanel our previous Presidents and Vice  Presidents to make that determination.   Think about how it would work. Currently, there are 10 bipartisan  former distinguished Americans who, in most cases, enjoy even greater  public support than when they left office. Most importantly, there is  no group of people better suited to evaluate the evidence and the  dynamics at work for the good of the country and the President who  needs help.   Now, we have made real progress with mental illness. We have made it  easier to get care. We are taking away the stigma for the one in five  Americans who suffer from mental health issues. We find people to be  more open and candid and accepting of themselves and others. We are  making real strides in terms of treatment and acceptance.   But all of this requires access to help; and this drama should not  play out with somebody whose fingers are on the nuclear buttons and  whose every pronouncement can unsettle diplomatic conditions, affect  war and peace, and the global economy.   Having Congress establish this panel of former Presidents and Vice  Presidents from both parties as a guardian and failsafe mechanism is  important, and it needs to happen as soon as possible.   We never know when catastrophe might strike. There is no good time to  fix this problem. In today's world of alternative facts and fake news,  in a sea of bitter partisan controversy, we need to have a mechanism  that can be reliable, command public confidence, and be above politics.   It is hard to think of a group that would collectively have more  support and credibility than the distinguished  [[Page H1188]]  Americans who have been in that position and, regardless of partisan  differences, whose allegiance to America is unquestioned.   We need to start now to protect the integrity of the most powerful  position on the planet.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, my friend, Mr. Roskam, said you can't  make things up. Well, unfortunately, people are. First and foremost, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are conflating accounts that  are in the name of individual savers who don't have pensions that would  be set up under these proposals, with what has happened with State and  local pension plans and, frankly, private pension plans that got over  their skis, that overpromised, that added to things. These are just the  accounts that belong to individuals.   Now, the hypocrisy strikes me that my Republican friends want to  strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act and turn it back  to the States. Let them do with it what they will for Medicaid, for  other local health programs. They think that is a great idea. But when  governments on the State level like mine spent years developing a  proposal that is innovative, that would protect people, that would  involve no public tax dollars but at least engage people in a low-cost,  transparent savings plan like we all have as Federal employees, then  they don't want innovation, then they don't trust the States, then they  want extra regulation that was never designed for programs like this.   I find it troubling that we would take a low-cost, high-impact  program that has been developed in a number of States to help savers  who have no program, that the private sector doesn't think they are  important enough to invest in--or it is not worth their while--and  strip that away. I think there is a reason why some business  organizations, like the Chamber and other financial groups, are worried  about this because this is a low-cost, high-impact, transparent program  that will deliver benefits directly to employees. That is what more  people should have.   I think they are afraid of the model and they are not willing to give  the flexibility to the States in retirement that they are trying to do,  throwing out the Affordable Care Act and having all sorts of innovation  there.
