 Mr. Speaker, the irresponsible policies  of Biden and the liberal Democrats have caused a 40-year high  inflation, leaving American families in financial distress and jobs  destroyed.   Bidenflation has affected the cost of everyday goods and services and  limited the annual purchasing power of families by thousands of  dollars. Worse, Biden does not seem to comprehend the reality of these  decisions, proven when recently describing his economic policies. Biden  said, I don't know what Bidenomics is, but it is working.   Among the most damaging effects on families is the highest seasonal  gas price in more than a decade, with the national average at over  $3.80 a gallon.   Sadly, American autoworkers are being sacrificed to create dependency  on Chinese batteries. The Republican House majority is working to  correct this, having recently passed the Lower Energy Costs Act to  streamline the permitting process and reduce energy costs to achieve  energy independence, which President Donald Trump had achieved in his  administration.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders.                            ____________________
