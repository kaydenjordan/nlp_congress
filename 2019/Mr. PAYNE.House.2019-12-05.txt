 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate one of my  district's most venerable churches. This year marks the 75th  anniversary of the Peaceful Zion Baptist Church in East Orange, New  Jersey.   It has been known as a sanctuary for those in need throughout that  time. It runs a food pantry for those in need of a meal. It provides  clothing for those who could use a warm coat or socks.   The community of Peaceful Zion is so strong that members have been  known to bring food to ailing families. One of its members said:  ``Everyone is there for one another.''   Congratulations to Peaceful Zion Baptist Church on its 75th  anniversary. They are a blessed beacon of loving care in my 10th  District in New Jersey.                            ____________________
