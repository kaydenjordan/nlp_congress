 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Karen  McGinnis on her retirement.   For the past 20 years, Karen has served as the director for what is  known as the Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response  Federal Training Center, or HAMMER, which is in my district at the  Hanford Site in Richland.   I have personally visited and can truly say HAMMER is a one-of-a-kind  facility. I have witnessed the hands-on training they provide to  Federal employees, like Hanford workers and emergency responders who  are deployed throughout our Nation. The services they provide to the  Tri-Cities community and the country are essential.   Karen has worked to strengthen HAMMER's partnerships with Federal and  State agencies, Tribes, safety professionals, and community leaders.  She focuses on worker health and preparedness, and she has a passion  for employee safety. Her leadership has made HAMMER one of the premier  training centers in the world. As director, Karen has facilitated the  training that makes it possible for the Federal Government to fulfill  its obligation to clean up the Hanford Site.   I thank Karen for her dedication to HAMMER, and I wish her the best  in her retirement.                            ____________________
