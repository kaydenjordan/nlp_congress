 Madam Speaker, recently the Supreme Court took an  unprecedented, deeply disappointing, and ideologically driven action to  overturn Roe v. Wade.   This is a targeted attack on Americans' rights to make decisions for  their bodies, their lives, and their future.   This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for our Nation's  highest court and is the result of a premeditated agenda from radical  conservatives to dismantle access to comprehensive reproductive care.   The decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one, one that  should be made between a patient and their doctor, not by politically  motivated judges or politicians.   Roe offered Americans protections from the unsolicited belief systems  and the ideologies of others being imposed on them and their personal  healthcare decisions.   I am committed to continuing to work alongside House Democrats and  President Biden in the fight for reproductive freedom and reproductive  justice and the right to abortion across the United States.
