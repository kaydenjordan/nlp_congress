 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  legislation.   Civilian control of the military is a very important principle that  has served our country well. Current law provides that there should be  a 7-year gap between military service and serving as the Secretary of  Defense. This is a general rule, but we know there are always  exceptions to the rule. That is what this legislation makes today,  clearing the path for a retired general who has been back in the  civilian world for more than 3\1/2\ years.   I support this exception because we live in exceptional times. Over  the past 15 years, we have seen millions of American servicemembers  deployed overseas. Thousands are still deployed. They have served well  and served with courage. Many of them, and their families, have paid a  particularly heavy price. More than 6,000 did not come home. Tens of  thousands sustained life-changing injuries. Thousands have injuries we  cannot see. Many families broke under the pressure of repeated  deployments.   Retired General James Mattis, now a civilian, has been there. He has  been with these soldiers. He has been with these families. I appreciate  the perspective General Mattis will bring to the Defense Department and  President-elect's national security team. He understands more than most  in a very personal way the gravity of putting our servicemembers in  harm's way. He understands the moral obligation we have to ensure that  those who are sent into harm's way are properly equipped. As important,  he will be able to convey to his national security counterparts the  impact decisions made in Washington have on the war fighter.   General Mattis is the right person at the right time. I encourage my  colleagues to support this waiver and vote for this legislation.   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.
