 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Dr. Doug Reisig of Missoula County as Montanan of the  Month for his distinguished career as an educator and for his devotion  to Montana students, parents, and the community.   Doug was born and raised in the great State of Montana. He earned his  master's degree from the University of Montana and his PhD from Montana  State--``Go Cats!'' Doug taught at Billings West High School before  accepting a job at the St. Ignatius School District. It was in St.  Ignatius that he met his lovely wife, Mary Jo. Doug and Mary Jo have  been married for almost 43 years and have raised two wonderful  daughters, Megan and Callie. They are now the proud grandparents of  four grandsons.   Doug has been a teacher, building administrator, and superintendent  for 46 years, serving as the superintendent at Hellgate Elementary for  the past 34 years. Prior to his retirement, he received the G.V.  Erickson Award from the School Administrators of Montana for his  contribution to the betterment of education in our great State.   Since Doug took over as superintendent, the school has seen a 33- percent increase in enrollment. He also oversaw the construction of the  new middle school.   During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, under Doug's leadership,  Hellgate Elementary was a leader in delivering meals to children in  need, and he went the extra mile by selflessly donating his increase in  salary to the Family Resource Fund. With Doug's direction and  precautions in place, both Hellgate Elementary School and Middle School  were in session 5 days a week during the 2020 and 2021 school years.   It is my honor to recognize Dr. Doug Reisig for serving the State of  Montana as an educator and for his dedication to ensuring Montana  students have a bright future ahead.   Congratulations on your retirement, Doug. You make Montana  proud.                            ____________________
