 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wildfire Smoke  Relief Act of 2019 with the ultimate goal of providing Federal  emergency assistance to at risk individuals in areas with unhealthy air  quality caused by wildfire smoke. By actively preparing for the effects  of wildfire smoke inhalation, this bill attempts to ensure the long  term health and security of all of those affected by wildfires.   In 2018, over 2,000 fires burned nearly 900,000 acres in the State of  Oregon. The result of these fires was weeks and weeks of wildfire  smoke. In Southern Oregon alone, there were 39 days with unhealthy air  quality directly caused by smoke from wildfires. People need proper air  filtration equipment, and in extreme cases, to seek refuge in a  smokeless area. Communities are being choked by wildfire smoke, and  each year wildfires are becoming more destructive than the previous.   Vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, pregnant women,  and low-income families are disproportionately affected by wildfire  smoke. Additionally, those with chronic heart or lung conditions are at  a similarly heightened risk. Symptoms from smoke inhalation can develop  within a relatively short time of exposure, and according to research,  is akin to smoking several packs of cigarettes per day. Symptoms vary  and can include poor development of lungs in children, shortness of  breath, coughing, chest pain, nausea, reduced lung capacity,  bronchitis, headaches, and visual impairment.   The bill would authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) to provide assistance to at risk individuals by providing smoke  inhalation prevention equipment and low-cost home improvements when air  quality causes unhealthy air quality levels or three consecutive days.  Smoke inhalation prevention equipment would include an air filter, a  face mask or respirator, a portable air filtration unit, and other low  cost equipment used to keep smoke out of a house.   In severe cases, the Wildfire Smoke Relief Act would authorize FEMA  to provide transitional sheltering assistance for at risk individuals.  In these extreme cases FEMA can arrange alternate, cost-efficient  housing arranged for at-risk people to escape the smoke.   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Jeff Merkley in  introducing the bill today and look forward to working with my  colleagues toward enactment of the Wildfire Smoke Relief Act in the  116th Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wildfire Smoke  Relief Act of 2019 with the ultimate goal of providing Federal  emergency assistance to at risk individuals in areas with unhealthy air  quality caused by wildfire smoke.
