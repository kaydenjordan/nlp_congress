 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  my friend, the dearly departed Mrs. Mary Freeman Keller Zervigon, an  outstanding, cherished public servant from my home State.   A lifelong New Orleanian, Mrs. Zervigon was a policy advocate,  philanthropist, and beloved civic leader who held posts in two mayoral  administrations and spent countless hours working to improve the city  of New Orleans as a member of many boards and commissions.   She lived her life doing what she believed in and in doing what was  right. Raised with civic activism in her DNA--her mother played a key  role in desegregating New Orleans' public libraries--her ability to cut  right to the chase made her an ideal lobbyist representing the city of  New Orleans during rough legislative sessions.   She was an incredible lady and an incredible leader, one who will be  sorely missed.   Rest in peace, my friend. God bless.                            ____________________
