 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, we just had a vote in this Chamber on a  very significant piece of legislation. It was the motion to proceed to  it. It was agreed to with good Republican and Democratic majorities,  with both sides of the aisle supporting moving to this debate.   Because we have cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, I feel  confident that we will get to an end point, and we  [[Page S1781]]  must. This issue of trafficking human beings is something the Senate  must stand up against, particularly because there is a Federal law that  now permits trafficking online that otherwise would be considered a  criminal act. I want to talk a little about that legislation tonight.   We probably will not have the final vote until Wednesday, and some of  the information I will provide tonight will be setting the reasons, the  basis for doing this legislation. Then, between now and Wednesday, we  will have to learn more about the specifics of it, what is happening  online, and how the U.S. Senate can step in and provide the legislation  to remediate what is an obvious problem to anyone who looks at this  issue.   Human trafficking is such an egregious crime. We all, I hope, agree  with that. It is also a very lucrative crime--$150 billion a year is  the estimate, and that is probably second only to the drug trade in  terms of the amount of money involved. Think about this. This is  selling human beings.   The Senate has taken steps in this body in a bipartisan way over the  past 6 or 7 years to focus on this issue, and I certainly commend my  colleagues for that. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and I, as  a Republican, started a bipartisan caucus to stop human trafficking  about 6 years ago. We started with the two of us, and now there are a  couple of dozen. There are many Members who are engaged and involved in  this.   Over those past 6 years, the Senate has passed legislation to  increase the penalties on those who buy children for sex. For the first  time in a decade and a half, we increased the Federal penalties.   We have helped to stop international trafficking by U.S. Government  contractors overseas with legislation that was signed into law.   We have helped with regard to finding missing children by requiring  for the first time that those missing children have a photograph  attached to them. Unbelievably, until that legislation, most kids in my  home State of Ohio and other States who went missing did not have the  information provided to law enforcement and others--people who work in  shelters, people who are in the juvenile justice system--to be able to  find those children. Why is that so important? Because, as you can  imagine, kids who go missing are sometimes the most vulnerable to being  trafficked.   We also passed legislation to improve the data on trafficking. There  is legislation called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act, which  we passed in this body to provide better information about this problem  so we could come up with better solutions by understanding what is  going on. Trafficking is in the shadows. It is very profitable, but it  is an illicit activity. So that legislation was critical.   By the way, the primary author of that legislation was Senator Ron  Wyden of Oregon. Senator Wyden will probably be on this floor over the  next couple of days talking about some of the concerns he has about the  online legislation we have, but I want you to know that Senator Wyden  has been out front on opposing trafficking through this Sex Trafficking  Data and Response Act. I was the lead Republican on that legislation,  so I worked with him, and I commend him for that.   We also passed legislation to change the paradigm in Federal law and  treat these children who are trafficked as victims rather than as  criminals. The key is to get these young people into treatment, longer  term recovery, and deal with what is, as you can imagine, a very  traumatic situation--often related to drugs as well, so drug treatment.  Something that I think is perhaps the most important thing we can do is  to understand that these are victims who, in order to get back on their  feet, need to be taken from the criminal justice system and put into  the kind of treatment they need.   Despite efforts here in the Senate--and by others around the country,  by the way--to deal with this trafficking issue and raise an awareness  of it, unbelievably today, as we stand here in this country, we are  seeing an increase in one type of trafficking, and that is sex  trafficking. You might ask, how could that be possible? We passed all  this legislation to help. We have gotten increased consciousness about  the issue. People are more aware of the problem, and certainly there is  a consensus that this is something we ought to crack down on. Yet it is  happening. I will tell you what the experts say. They say it is  happening for one simple reason, and that is that more and more women  and children are being sold online--the ruthless efficiency of the  internet. So that is where this legislation focuses, and it focuses  there because that is where we see the problem.   Traffickers are using the internet to sell women and children, and we  have a responsibility to act. If we don't act, we will allow a Federal  law that was passed by this body 21 years ago, which I think  inadvertently has created part of the problem by shielding these  websites, to remain.   I will talk more about this later in the week as we get into the  specifics of our legislation and why it would address the problem, but  the bottom line is that we have a real problem.   The anti-trafficking group Polaris--we recently received its 2017  report. The report illustrates the true nature of the crisis. This is  the heat chart put up by Polaris. It shows the locations of cases  reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline last year alone, in  2017. As we can see--and this explains why we see such strong,  bipartisan support for our legislation--this is happening everywhere,  in every State in the Union. Unfortunately, it is increasing, not  decreasing, despite all the efforts locally and even here at the  Federal level.   The national hotline that Polaris runs--and I hope to be at that  hotline, by the way, later this week, as they are opening a new  facility and expanding what they are doing--experienced a 13-percent  increase in reported cases nationwide just last year. So despite all  the efforts, they are actually seeing an increase. In my home State of  Ohio alone, 371 cases of human trafficking were reported to the  hotlines. Across the country, their hotlines handled a record 8,759  cases in 2017, up from 7,737 reported cases in 2016. Again, these are  only the cases that are reported. That doesn't mean there aren't many,  many more cases out there that are not reported to the hotlines.   In the 10 years they have operated these hotlines, by the way, human  trafficking reports have increased 842 percent. Again, it is  unbelievable that this is happening in this country in this century and  increasing.   I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. A couple of  years ago, being interested in this issue, we started to talk to some  of the experts around the country. I met with people back home-- particularly the victims of trafficking and some of the survivors--and  I kept hearing the same thing from everybody, whether it was the  advocacy groups for those being trafficked, law enforcement, or the  social service agencies that are helping to treat these women and girls  who are dealing with the trauma we talked about earlier. The one thing  I kept hearing was the word ``backpage.'' That is just one website, but  it seemed as though there were a lot of people being trafficked on that  one website. I certainly heard it back home, where these women and  girls said to me: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the  smartphone, and backpage is where I was trafficked.   Nearly 75 percent of all child trafficking reports that the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives from the public  involved backpage--75 percent of the reports.   Another anti-trafficking organization called Shared Hope  International says that service providers working with child sex- trafficking victims have reported that more than 80 percent of their  clients were bought and sold on backpage.   We talked earlier about how lucrative this business is, but one  website seems to have practically monopolized it.   With that knowledge, in 2015 the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, led by Ranking Member Claire McCaskill from Missouri  and me, conducted an investigation. We spent 18 months researching  this. We looked at every angle of this issue, and specifically we  looked into how backpage operates. It wasn't easy because backpage was  not willing to cooperate, as you can imagine. What we did find was that  the company was far more complicit in these crimes than we had  previously thought.  [[Page S1782]]    We subpoenaed backpage for their company documents, and they refused  to comply. When you refuse to comply with a subpoena around here,  normally we can kind of tell people: Well, if you don't comply, we will  bring the full weight of the criminal law on you. They still wouldn't  comply. So we had to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to enforce  the subpoenas, which hadn't been done in 21 years around here.  Fortunately, when we made our case to our colleagues here in the  Senate, everyone in the Senate said: Yes, let's be sure they do comply  by taking this to the criminal justice system and allowing our lawyers  here to take this case. So we did.   We thought, well, we will win a case at the district court level,  which we did, and that will be it. No, they appealed that. We won a  case at the circuit court level, and we thought that was it. No, they  appealed that. Are you getting the drift here that they did not want to  supply these documents and did not want to testify? Finally, we took it  all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme  Court agreed with us and told them that they had to comply, with the  threat of criminal sanctions if they did not.   Having won that, we then found ourselves in possession of over 1  million pages of documents. In other words, they flooded us with  documents, and our lawyers did a good job going through them. Through  this investigation, we found what some of us had kind of thought might  be the case, which was that this company was actually complicit. In  other words, they knew what they were doing, and they were knowingly  facilitating criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and children.  They actually coached traffickers on how to edit the adult classified  ads to post so-called clean ads for these illegal transactions. Then,  of course, they would cover up evidence of those crimes in order to  increase their own profits.   In 2006, as an example, backpage executives instructed staff to edit  the text of adult ads--not to take them down, mind you, but to edit  them--which is exactly how they facilitated this type of trafficking.  By October 2010, backpage executives had a formal process in place, we  learned through all these documents, of both manual and automated  deletion of incriminating words and phrases in ads.   This is an email from one of backpage's executives in 2010. It says:         I'm attaching a spreadsheet with the most current list of       coded items to be stripped out. Email your lists to me by the       end of the day. . . . Thanks.    In other words, they were telling these people who were posting ads:  Oh, you can't say this word or that word because then law enforcement  will know that we are engaged in selling underaged girls online. So  they told them to take out those words. It is unbelievable.   What kinds of words were stripped out of the ads, allowing sex  trafficking posts to stay up without violating the posting words? These  are the kinds of words they took out: ``teenage,'' ``little girl,''  ``school girl.'' ``Cheerleader'' was one of them. For those of you who  are literary types, one was ``Lolita,'' which is a novel about an  underaged girl and an older man, and also ``fresh'' and ``AMBER  Alert.''   These are the kinds of people we are dealing with here. Once these  incriminating words were removed, the posts could then go on the  website. That is how backpage coached the traffickers on how to get  away with their crimes. Again, this filter didn't stop the ads, even  though they knew it was illegal activity; they only edited them to try  to hide that. So it didn't change what was advertised--the fact that  these were underaged girls; they only edited the way it was advertised.  Of course, this did nothing to stop the criminal activity, but it  facilitated it knowingly.   The incentive? Why would backpage go through all of this? Quite  simply, profits. This is a very profitable enterprise.   What is the cost of these crimes? It is very profitable, but the cost  is human dignity, trauma. The cost is far more than money; it is  suffering and sometimes human life. I have heard stories about this. I  know my colleagues in the Senate have heard stories about it, and that  is why there is so much support for this legislation across the  country. These individual stories are compelling, they are powerful,  and they are heartbreaking.   Imagine for a moment that your daughter is missing. She has been gone  for several weeks. She is 14 years old. Someone says: You ought to look  on this website called backpage. So you do. You look on backpage--you  are a mom--and you find your daughter.   This is the story of Kubiiki Pride and M.A. She told her story  bravely before our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. She told  us the details, and we were able to use that as part of our  investigation and to come up with a legislative response. She said she  actually told backpage--she called them and said: I found my daughter.  She has been missing for weeks. She is on your website. Thank you for  taking down the ad and helping me to connect with my daughter.   As you can imagine, these were sexually explicit photographs of a 14- year-old girl. She didn't know whether she was alive or dead, so she  was excited to find her but appalled by what she saw, as any of us  would be.   What did backpage say? We can't take down the ad because you didn't  pay for it, did you?   She said: Of course, I didn't pay for it; she is my daughter.   That is the level of evil we are talking about.   This is another story of another brave individual who has come  forward. This is Nacole, the mom, and J.S. Nacole also bravely  testified in front of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  J.S. was a 15-year-old when she ran away. She loved her family, and she  wrote them a 5-page letter saying how much she loved them, but she  chose to leave the safety of her family and home, and she ended up in a  homeless shelter for teens. A 22-year-old woman who was posing as a  teen there approached her and said, ``I can help you make some money''  and then introduced her to a pimp, who then sold her on backpage. For  more than 3 months, she was sold online multiple times a day.   Finally, an undercover police officer posing as a customer rescued  her. Thankfully, he did, because for some many of the girls, the story  goes on and sometimes ends in a very tragic way.    This is Yvonne Ambrose. Yvonne actually testified before the Commerce  Committee. She and her mom did a beautiful job talking about her  heartbreak and her tragic encounter with backpage. Yvonne got a call on  Christmas Eve in 2016 that every parent dreads. It was about her  daughter Desiree. They said in the call that her 16-year-old daughter  had been murdered after being exploited and sold for sex on  backpage.com. One of the backpage customers apparently was the one who  murdered her beautiful daughter.   Yvonne is honoring Desiree's memory by working with us to try to hold  these websites accountable, and Kubiiki and Nacole are fighting for  justice.   These are only three examples tonight, but there are so many others  and so many I have experienced back home. Again, these are  heartbreaking stories. One girl told me she started to be trafficked at  age 9 by her father. Some others have told me of not having parents at  home, being in foster homes and leaving the foster homes either when  they were emancipated at age 18 or earlier and the horrible situation  they found themselves in.   I have had the opportunity to meet with survivors in cities around  Ohio--in Dayton at Oasis House, in Columbus at Alvis, in Akron, Toledo,  Cincinnati, and Cleveland. The majority of these young women tell me  the same thing about backpage. Usually there are drugs involved as well  that create a dependency.   Unbelievably, for years, these websites have gotten away with this  because when parents like Yvonne, Kubiiki, or Nacole file a lawsuit for  damages to try to stop what is going on, they are told: We are immune.  When the prosecutors in these local communities step up and ask: ``How  could this illegal activity be going on? This is illegal to do on the  street corners, certainly it is illegal to do online,'' the judges say:  We are immune.   We will get into this later as to why that happens, how it happens,  and what  [[Page S1783]]  we are doing about it in this legislation. I look forward to that  discussion. I look forward to the debate on the Senate floor as to how  we came up with a very targeted and very specific approach to this that  doesn't interfere with the freedom of the internet at all, but it does  stop activity that never was imagined. When Congress passed a law 21  years ago, it never imagined it would permit this kind of criminal  activity online.   Tonight I thank those families who had the courage to step forward,  tell their stories publicly, and channel their grief into something  constructive, which is to come up with a legislative solution that  helps address this problem so the next 14-year-old daughter or 16-year- old daughter does not find herself in these same horrible situations,  with all the trauma and all the heartbreak that occurs.   Justice cannot be seen, but its absence can be felt, and that is what  is happening now, an absence of justice. Those who have been trafficked  online only see the websites that knowingly facilitated it to prosper  and escape legal consequences. That has to stop. That is an injustice  to me.   I look forward to further debate again this week. I look forward to  the vote on Wednesday. If we can pass the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers  Act, we will make a difference. We will save lives. We will save women,  girls, and boys from going through this traumatic experience and  instead enable them to achieve their God-given potential in life.   I yield back.
