 Mr. Speaker, as a former teacher, I know that education  can be and should be a pathway to financial freedom. For over 45  million Americans facing crippling student debt, education has become  an unsustainable economic burden.   Student debt is keeping Americans from buying homes, starting  families, and saving for their futures. It is holding back a generation  from getting the education that they need, that they want, and that  they deserve. This impacts all of us. Our education suffers because of  this debt. Our economy suffers, our families suffer, and our children  suffer.  [[Page H976]]    President Biden's student debt relief plan will change lives and open  doors for so many working families.   It is urgent that the Supreme Court uphold this critical program that  will free millions of Americans from this heavy financial burden. So  today I call on the Supreme Court to support President Biden's plan and  make the historic step in making higher education attainable for  everyone in this country.                            ____________________
