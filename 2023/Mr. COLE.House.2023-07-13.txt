 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 583 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 583         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize       appropriations for fiscal year 2024 for military activities       of the Department of Defense and for military construction,       and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to       prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year,       and for other purposes.        Sec. 2. (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution and       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution.

Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc offered pursuant       to this section shall be considered as read, shall be       debatable for 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Armed Services or their respective designees, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as       amended, to the House with such further amendments as may       have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern)  the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  House Resolution 583.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported out a rule, House Resolution 583, providing for further  consideration of H.R. 2670, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2024, or NDAA, under a structured rule. It makes in  [[Page H3496]]  order 80 amendments for consideration on the floor, and it provides for  one motion to recommit.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House passed a rule setting the  parameters for general debate on H.R. 2670 and making in order 289  amendments. At the time, we made clear that the work of the Rules  Committee was not yet finished. There was additional work that was left  to be done, additional considerations to be had, and additional member  priorities to take into consideration.   After a robust discussion, we reported out the rule that is before us  today. Taking up this rule will allow us to advance our work forward  and will move H.R. 2670 toward a vote on final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I know some in this House will express frustration with  the process. Yes, perhaps it would have been more convenient for us to  have done our work more quickly.   As this House is well aware, the NDAA is one of the most critical  pieces of legislation the House considers each year. It sets overall  policy for the Department of Defense and the armed services and allows  Congress to set our defense priorities for the year. Perhaps most  importantly, it authorizes spending levels on national defense for the  fiscal year.   Mr. Speaker, on a bill that is this critical to the Nation, it is  much more important for us to get things right rather than to do things  quickly. When dealing with national defense, we have a sacred  obligation to give the American people our best efforts. Although this  may have taken a bit longer than anyone, including myself, would have  liked, I am proud to say that the rule fulfills that obligation.   I like to think of this, Mr. Speaker, as a process where the House  has been working its will. Frankly, we will have a pretty spirited  debate here, I suspect, but it is worth noting that the underlying bill  that came out of the House Armed Services Committee is pretty much  intact. In other words, it has been changed very little in the  amendment process yesterday, and I would argue it will be changed  relatively little by the amendment process today.   The majority of the items that we deal with today are going to shift.  These aren't going to be straight partisan debates in many cases. My  friend, Mr. McGovern, and I will probably be on the same side when it  comes to helping Ukraine in what we think is a very important struggle.  We will probably be on different sides when we come to cluster  munitions and whether they should or should not be used.  Uncharacteristically, I will be on the President's side, and my friend  will have a different opinion on that.   I say that just to say that that's how this place is supposed to  work. You move back and forth, you pick the right decisions, and at the  end of the day, there will be a final product and we will have a  straight up or down.                                time  1230    Before anybody gets too elated or too disappointed, I will remind  everyone that it is not as if this is the last day. This is a vehicle,  if it passes, that we will take into conference, and that will be a  conference between a Republican House, a Democratic Senate, and it will  involve a Democratic President.   Mr. Speaker, I say all that to say that I suspect the process will  continue to change the product as we move along. Again, I wouldn't be  too giddy if I won today, and I wouldn't be too disappointed, no matter  what your particular issue is, if I lost. I do think it is critically  important that the vehicle move and that we push forward and sit down  and work with our colleagues on the other side of the Rotunda in the  Senate, and work with the President of the United States at the other  end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We need to make sure that we do--for the  63rd consecutive year--what we have done for 62 years, and that is  provide for the common defense of the country.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is worth remembering that this is going to be  a bipartisan product at the end of the day. There is no way a  Republican House, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic President are  going to do anything on any issue that is not essentially bipartisan.  That is the way the process works.   No matter what is happening at a given moment, I think we are  preordained to come to an agreement that broadly reflects compromise.   Mr. Speaker, we have had two very late nights at the Rules Committee,  and I thank particularly my friend, the ranking member, and each and  every member of that committee for putting in the hours that it took. I  thank our staffs on both sides of the aisle who worked really, really  hard.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the staff of the House, particularly our  overworked stenographers that were staying there late at night to make  sure that we got our job done.   Again, I credit my friend, the ranking member, for this. We have had  the good fortune to serve together on this committee for a long time.  We had a contentious debate last night, but it was always a civil  debate and it was always a professional debate.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the tenor he set for our committee when he  was chairman. I am proud of the manner in which he approaches his work  each and every day. I am very proud to have the opportunity to work  with him in the House.   Again, we will have our differences today--fair enough. I thank my  friend for the kind of committee member that he is and, frankly, his  commitment to the institution. I say that about each and every member  on the Rules Committee on both sides of the aisle, and about their  staff and about the staff of the full House that facilitates our  ability to work together and produce a product.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Langworthy), my very good friend who was there for every  minute of the Rules Committee hearings last night and the night before,  and a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy), who is another member of the Rules Committee who has been  fighting the good fight for the last two nights well past midnight.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to go back to a point on this issue of abortion. Quite  frankly, we look at this issue very differently. As my friend, Mr. Roy  from Texas, said, we see the administration as having directly  intervened and changed existing policy.   We have something called the Hyde amendment, which has been passed  for years, decades, over and over again, and it prohibits using Federal  tax dollars for abortion. Facilitating abortion is exactly what we are  talking about here.   Now, was there any consultation with us when the executive branch  decided to do that? No, there wasn't.   As my friend from Texas pointed out, there is a pretty big pushback  on our side.   We have worked in a bipartisan fashion. That is why that bill came  out of committee 58-1. Most of the amendments on this floor in the last  couple days have been bipartisan, and we have worked together.   There are issues where we simply don't agree, and this is, at the end  of the day, a majoritarian institution.   While my friend talks about the extremist this or the extremist that,  if it is an extremist amendment, it won't win the majority.   These amendments that are going to come up here are either going to  win or lose. Some of them are going to lose.   Some of the time, my friend and I are actually going to be voting the  same way on those amendments. Other times, we will vote differently. We  will certainly vote differently at the end of the day when it comes  time to vote on the bill.   That is the way the game is played here. To say that some majority is  being run by extremists, by definition, that is almost impossible  because you can't be the majority on the House floor if it is true.   Again, you can disagree, and I respect the disagreement, but the  initiator, particularly in the case of abortion and I would say some of  the other culture clashes that we are having on this bill, has been the  administration, has been policies that were decided in this  administration and sometimes pushed on the military against their own  wishes.   Again, it is the executive branch. They get to run the military. They  get to do what they want to do. But please, when you get a response  from people that genuinely disagree, to say they started it by  responding is simply not the case.   Again, I look forward to this debate. I understand that people will  have very different opinions. I do remind everybody that 95 percent of  this bill is this bill, you know. It was bipartisan. It does deal with  the military. Very little of much of the debate has dealt with the  military.   I actually sit on the Defense Appropriations Committee. We spend a  lot of time talking about what is the right mix of arms? What is going  to happen in terms of artillery? What are we doing to update AWACS? I  can go on and on. Most of the discussions in the House Armed Services  Committee were similar.   Again, we are going to have these differences and let the chips fall  where they may. I would suspect whatever product comes off this floor  will be the product that the majority of this body chose.   Then we will go, as my friends well know, to sit down with the United  States Senate, and they will have a different product, and the  President will be part of that discussion because he has to sign the  bill.   We are going to have a pretty good tussle here. To think this is the  be-all and end-all today I think is a disservice to the process and how  it unfolds and how it actually works.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.  Today's rule makes in order 80 amendments reflecting Member priorities  on both sides of the aisle.   Although I would have liked to have worked more quickly, on a matter  that is so critical as the annual NDAA we owe the American people no  less than whatever time is necessary to complete this important task.   I remind the House that the NDAA has been passed into law every year  for 62 consecutive years. I am confident that with today's rule, we are  well on the way to making it 63.                                time  1315    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to point out and emphasize several  important facts that sometimes get lost in the spirited debate.   The first one is that about 95 percent of this bill is exactly what  passed out of the House Armed Services Committee 58-1, as my friends  have pointed out, and I agree. Most of this bill is extraordinarily  bipartisan. Most of the amendments that have come to this floor, 300  yesterday, or 290, roughly, were bipartisan and were accepted no matter  who authored them, Democrat or Republican, by either side.   As I said yesterday, this was going to be more contentious today, and  that is fine. But to suggest that anything you disagree with that  passes is extreme, I think, frankly, you are leaping to a conclusion.   Some of these amendments that my friend points to the most probably  won't pass, probably won't make it. Again, there is nothing  inappropriate about that. I mean, I have come down here--and I know my  friend has--plenty of times and fought for things that we believed in  that may have been right or wrong, but we lost or won. What comes out  of here will be what a majority of the House decides is appropriate.   Now, as I have said multiple times in the course of the debate, this  is a process, not an event. The reality is, we are going to sit down at  some point, almost certainly, with the Senate and the President. The  Senate is Democratic, and the President is a Democrat. We are going to  have a discussion and a debate, and I suspect the product that comes  out of that will be different than the one that emerges here. That is  okay. It will be different than what the Senate writes, and it will be  different than what the President's budget was and what he proposed.   Nobody is going to get everything they want. At the end of the day,  everybody is going to have to give and take, and the reality is if we  get to a bill, which I think we will because we have for 62 consecutive  years, it is going to be a bipartisan compromise.   We can have all the theatrics and all the flailing of arms. That is  part of the process, too. At the end of the day, almost all of this  bill is bipartisan, and almost all of this bill is supported by the  majority of both sides of the aisle. There are individual flash points  where we disagree.   I know about getting rolled in debates. I remember my Democratic  friends spending $1.9 trillion without a single Republican vote and  unleashing the worst inflation we have seen in 40 years. I remember  them bringing a bill to this floor called the Inflation Reduction Act  that had zero to do with inflation and was everything about green  climate. Fair enough. If you want to do that, that is okay. You didn't  get a single Republican vote, but you won, and you got it through the  Senate and got the President of the United States to sign it.   There are plenty of times that one side has steamrolled the other.  There are other times when we negotiate together. Welcome to the House  of Representatives and to American politics.   What we are going to deal with today, there will be a lot of sound.  There will be a lot of noise.   Most of the bill is bipartisan. It is an extraordinarily good bill.  As a matter of fact, lost in the course of this debate is one of the  areas where my friends and I do disagree, and I disagree with the bill,  and that is that we are coming in at the President's number. This  outrageous, terrible bill is going to be at the number the President  proposed. I think that number is too low--I really do--but I am going  to vote for it because it is still better than last year and better  than a CR, and it moves the country in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, again, I have enjoyed the debate. I always do. I will  close by thanking my friend. I mean this with all sincerity. I will end  where I began. We have been through a couple of challenging days in the  Rules Committee, very long nights. I very much appreciate the  professionalism of my friend and his colleagues and my colleagues on my  side of the aisle. I very much appreciate the staff that worked very  hard on both sides of the aisle and also the wonderful House support  staff that we had facilitating our meetings. I thank them all, and I  particularly thank my friend.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 583 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
