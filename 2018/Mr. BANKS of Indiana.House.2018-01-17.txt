 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kate's Kart,  a group founded in memory of Kate Layman.   Monday marked 10 years since Kate's life was cut short due to a heart  condition at the age of 18 months. During Kate's final moments here on  Earth, listening to stories brought a sense of comfort and joy.   Today, Kate's memory lives on through Kate's Kart. This organization  brings joy to thousands of hospitalized children throughout northeast  Indiana by giving them free books. In the 10 years that it has  operated, Kate's Kart has passed out over 186,000 books.   Kate's Kart is particularly near and dear to my heart because Mr.  Layman, Kate's father, was my middle school history teacher, and he  helped spark my interest in government.   I want to recognize the life-changing work of Kate's Kart. Truly,  Kate's legacy lives on through this organization and its impact on  children throughout northeast Indiana.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  tireless efforts on behalf of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded on the universal principle that  all people have a God-given right to life. ``All'' includes every  single human being, regardless of race, gender, or age. Throughout our  Nation's history, we have continually fought to draw closer to this  ideal. However, there is still so much more work to do.   Forty-five years ago, the Supreme Court made a tragic decision in Roe  v. Wade, and since then, more than 60 million innocent lives have been  lost. Every single one of those lives was important and unique.  Tonight, as we reflect on those lives lost as a result of Roe v. Wade,  we also celebrate that our culture is increasingly recognizing the  value of human life.   A recent Marist Poll found that an overwhelming majority of the  American people want substantial limits on abortion. Another poll found  that 61 percent of Americans opposed using tax dollars to fund  abortions within the United States, while 83 percent of respondents  opposed subsidizing abortions outside of the United States.   Last year, the House took an important step by passing the Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill would prohibit any  elective abortion attempt on an unborn child who is 20 weeks or older,  the age at which research shows us that children are able to feel pain.  Sixty-three percent of Americans support a 20-week abortion ban, and I  am hopeful that our colleagues in the Senate will pass this bill later  this month.   We also must work to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not continue to  support the abortion industry, including Planned Parenthood, our  Nation's largest abortion provider.   Life is a precious and sacred gift worth fighting for. Tonight, I  urge my colleagues to stand for human rights and equal justice by  standing for our Nation's most vulnerable, the unborn. Let's make the  cause of life the cause of our time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  from the Third District, a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.
