 Madam President; today, I voted that the Senate should  proceed to consider H.R. 3755, the Womens Health Protection Act, which  would codify in Federal law the privacy of women's reproductive  healthcare established by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.   I support the privacy of women's healthcare, codification of Roe v.  Wade, and proceeding to consideration of this measure. Should the  Senate proceed, however, nonbinding commentary in the bill's preamble  as currently drafted wrongly and unfairly impugns the motives and  integrity of fellow Americans who view this issue differently.   I represent a State with a broad diversity of views, and I respect  that diversity. I respect the opinions of my constituents even when I  do not share them, and I recognize that good people may arrive at  different opinions in good faith.   So should the Senate proceed to consider this measure, as I will vote  that it should, it must remove from the preamble to this bill divisive  rhetoric that wrongly accuses Georgians who hold a different view than  mine of having views rooted in misogyny. In a country so politically  polarized and divided, we must recommit to tolerance and mutual  respect.                            ____________________
