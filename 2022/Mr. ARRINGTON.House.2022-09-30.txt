 Madam Speaker, on November 14, the proudest Dimmitt  Bobcat, biggest Texas Tech fan, and the legendary west Texas leader  Kent R. Hance turns 80 years old.   I wish my dear friend and former boss the happiest of birthdays and  thank him for his tremendous and matchless service, leadership, and  love for the people, values, and spirit of west Texas.   He strengthened the Lone Star State as a Texas Senator. He helped  Reagan pass the tax cuts of 1986 as a U.S. Congressman. He unleashed  energy independence in Texas as chairman of the energy commission. As  the Texas Tech chancellor, we saw unprecedented growth in endowment,  enrollment, and research.   God blessed west Texas, and He broke the mold with Kent R. Hance.  [[Page H8323]]    Kent, my brother, happy birthday. God bless you. Guns up.                            ____________________
