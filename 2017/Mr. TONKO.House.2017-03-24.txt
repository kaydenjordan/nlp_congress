 Mr. Speaker, a resounding ``no'' to TrumpCare, President  Trump's broken promise to our great America. There is no disputing the  devastation this bill will cause for America's working families.   TrumpCare will rip health insurance away from 24 million people.   It will raise costs for consumers and lower standards of care, with  premiums rising and deductibles increasing by an average of $1,500.   TrumpCare will eliminate required mental health and addiction  benefits, jeopardizing recovery for millions of Americans in the midst  of this opioid epidemic.   It imposes a crushing new age tax on seniors and those approaching  retirement, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.   TrumpCare steals from Medicare, and it cuts Medicaid by $839 billion,  mercilessly putting children, the elderly, the disabled, and our most  vulnerable at risk.   It does all this to give a $1 trillion tax cut to millionaires,  billionaires, and corporations.   The American people overwhelmingly reject this bill.   Defeat TrumpCare. Vote ``no.''
