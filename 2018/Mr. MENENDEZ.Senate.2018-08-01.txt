 Madam President, tomorrow marks 1 year since President  Trump signed into law the Countering America's Adversaries Through  Sanctions Act of 2017, CAATSA, which passed with overwhelming  bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate. He did so with  strenuous objections to what he called an encroachment on the  Executive's ability to negotiate, and claimed that, ``As President, I  can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress.''   Unfortunately, despite his claims, the President has made no such  deal. Russia continues its attacks on our country, with reports this  week of another concerted effort on Facebook to influence the 2018  midterm elections. Despite this, the President has repeatedly cast  aside the facts of the Russian Government's interference in our  democracy and inspires little confidence in this body that he will take  seriously the duty to prevent it going forward.   So I remind my colleagues today, we must take on the duty to protect  our democracy from foreign interference, and we must continue to work  in a bipartisan fashion to ensure appropriate legislative guard rails  are in place on the U.S. policy toward Russia, to ensure that the  Kremlin's aggression is punished, not excused, and to build resilience  so that it will not happen again. The sanctions we enacted in CAATSA,  including related to the Russian defense and intelligence sectors that  were the source of past attacks against us, are part of this effort.   I strongly oppose language in the conference version of the Fiscal  Year 2019 NDAA which expands the scope of a waiver on CAATSA section  231, which requires sanctions on significant transactions with Russian  defense and intelligence sector entities. We targeted these sectors  specifically because they attacked our 2016 election and imposed  sanctions on them to dissuade anyone from doing business with them. The  State Department argues that billions of dollars' worth of deals have  been turned off as a result of the leverage created by section 231. I  fear that these new waiver provisions severely undermine that leverage.   Moreover, CAATSA includes a very important provision, the Russia  Review Act codified in section 216, which requires the President to  submit a report to the Congress before taking any action to terminate  or waive sanctions or issuing a license that significantly alters the  U.S. Russia policy. Section 216 imposes a reasonable and necessary  limitation on President Trump's ability to precipitously lift sanctions  or otherwise alter U.S. policy toward Russia without input from the  Congress. This NDAA says that the Russia Review Act no longer applies  to defense and intelligence sector sanctions. Without the Russia Review  Act, Congress loses its voice and ability to ensure that section 231  has teeth.   It is our ongoing responsibility to hold the executive branch to  account in fully implementing the laws we pass, including all of the  mandatory provisions in CAATSA and its provision enabling us to review  the President's decisions to lift or waive sanctions. This is all the  more important given President Trump's inclination to act as a  supplicant toward Vladimir Putin and his regime, even as that regime  has and continues to attack our country. I strongly oppose the language  in the Fiscal Year 2019 NDAA that weakens CAATSA and will oppose any  effort in the future toward that end. I will continue to work through  other legislative vehicles to continue to go after Russia's most  egregious offenders and continue to hold the administration accountable  for protecting Americans and American interests.    Mr. President, I rise today because Senate Republicans  have blocked a vote on my amendment, No. 3532. My amendment is really  quite simple. It would have struck language in the underlying bill that  prohibits  [[Page S5574]]  the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to  tell their investors and the public how they spend money in politics.   It has been 8 years since the Supreme Court's Citizens United  decision, a decision which gave corporations the right to spend  unlimited, unchecked, and--more often than not--undisclosed money on  our elections.   For 8 long years, more and more money has flowed from corporate  coffers into campaign ads and political expenditures, and Republicans  have defended the dark money poisoning our politics every step of the  way.   In the 2016 elections alone, outside groups spent more than $1.4  billion, much of it funneled through trade associations and nonprofits,  and much of it undisclosed to the public.   This is elementary; shareholders don't invest in political agendas or  candidates. They invest in companies, and they deserve to know whether  the corporate executives of those companies are using their money to  grow their businesses or to advance political outcomes that are  contrary to investors' values.   With no requirement to disclose how this money is being spent,  shareholders and the public are left in the dark with no way to know if  corporations are spending their money to defund Social Security and  Medicare, keep the cost of prescription drugs high, dismantle  environmental protections, undermine education programs, or eviscerate  rules on Wall Street.   This information is material to how shareholders decide to invest  their money and vote in corporate elections. Even setting aside the  case for this disclosure as a matter of corporate governance and  investor protection, this issue gets to the very core of our democracy.   Corporations can secretly funnel money to organizations that have no  requirement to report on their contributions, and then the American  public is left with no way of knowing who is advancing what causes.   All of this secret cash and dark money undermines the ability of the  American people to hold their government accountable.   Disclosing corporate spending in our elections is the least we can do  to help ensure that voters and not dollars set the agenda in  Washington.   That is what Americans want. The Securities and Exchange Commission  has received a record 1.2 million comments from investors and members  of the public in support of requiring corporations to disclose how they  spend money in politics.   Moreover, a May 2018 University of Maryland study found that  Americans, both liberal and conservative, overwhelmingly support a  constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United. Seventy- five percent of those surveyed support such an amendment. Even more, 88  percent of those surveyed want to reduce the outsized influence of  corporations in our politics.   But Republicans in the Senate wouldn't even let us have a vote on  this amendment. What was behind their refusal? After passing trillion- dollar tax cuts for big corporations, Republicans are hoping some of  that money trickles down into their reelection efforts. The Republican  Congress and this President depend upon this influence being kept in  the shadows. It makes you wonder, what are they hiding? What would  happen if the American people knew who was really funding their agenda?   That is why they slipped this language into a must-pass spending bill  a few years ago, and why they are holding on to it with all of their  might today. As long as the American people are kept in the dark,  Republicans are better able to hold onto power.   That is why just 2 weeks ago, President Trump's Treasury Department  announced that it would no longer certain nonprofit organizations that  engage in political activity to disclose their donors to the IRS.   They want to make it easier for big corporations, billionaires,  special interests--and even illegal foreign money--to influence our  elections.   They don't want the American people to know that behind every bill,  amendment, and Executive order is a corporate benefactor. A corporate  benefactor that knows so long as the money keeps flowing, there is  someone in Congress to do their bidding.   They are so afraid of what these disclosures will reveal that they  would not even allow the Senate to vote on my amendment, which does not  nothing more than restore the status quo allowing the SEC to move  forward with a rule-making requiring corporations to disclose how they  spend money in politics.   The fight is not over. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to  shining a light on dark money in our politics. I will continue pushing  to end Republicans' toxic prohibition on the SEC, which only serves to  silence the voices of hard-working American families in favor of  amplifying the speech and magnifying the influence of corporations.   In our democracy, the size of your wallet should not determine the  power of your voice. I urge my colleagues to listen to the American  people who have been loud and clear: They want disclosure, they want to  reduce corporate influence in our politics, and they want this  government to work for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to raise concerns  about violence perpetrated against religious minorities in Afghanistan,  particularly the Sikh and Hindu communities.   One month ago today, on July 1, a suicide bomber attacked a crowd of  Afghan Sikhs and Hindus as they gathered to meet with Afghan President  Ashraf Ghani on his visit to Jalalabad. At least 19 innocent civilians  lost their lives, and 10 more were wounded. The attack also claimed the  life of Awtar Singh Khalsa, the only Sikh candidate running in  Afghanistan's upcoming Parliamentary elections, and Rawail Singh, a  prominent community activist.   Of the 19 killed, 17 belonged to the minority Sikh and Hindu  religious groups.   I condemn this cowardly and heinous attack and all those like it in  the strongest possible terms. The Islamic State in Afghanistan claimed  responsibility for the July 1 attack and multiple attacks on civilian  targets since then. It is impossible to overstate the depravity of this  group that resorts to killing innocent people when it fails to  otherwise advance its cause.   We cannot allow attacks such as this on civilians to pass unremarked,  nor can we ignore violence specifically targeted toward Afghanistan's  diverse religious minorities. Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan have long  faced systemic discrimination, economic marginalization, and, as this  latest attack only serves to further illustrate, unspeakable violence.  Members of Sikh and Hindu communities report facing prejudice,  harassment, bullying of children, and attacks from militant groups;  disproportionate denial of their rights in Afghan courts; and even  interference in their efforts to cremate the remains of their dead and  peacefully adhere to other tenets of their faiths. Only a few places of  worship remain available to Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, many of  whom face discrimination so severe that they choose to leave the  country.   For his part, Mr. Khalsa's candidacy was a testament to the strength  and resiliency of Afghan Sikhs who, even in the face of unrelenting  hardship, remain dedicated to their country's democratic future. After  last month's attack in Jalalabad, that kind of political engagement has  been dealt a terrible blow.   The recent and ongoing attacks against Sikhs and Hindus come against  a broader backdrop of sustained violence in Afghanistan. According to  recent figures from the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, more  Afghan civilians were killed in the first 6 months of 2018--1,692  deaths--than in any other 6-month period over the last 10 years. This  figure demonstrates the continuing devastation caused by the past 17  years of war in Afghanistan and the need for the United States and our  partners in the international community to redouble efforts toward  reaching a negotiated political settlement that can bring this long war  to an end. Without peace in Afghanistan, the scourges of terrorist and  insurgent violence, illegal narcotics trafficking, corruption, and  limited government capacity to deliver justice and other public  services will remain, and the Afghan people will continue to suffer.   All Afghans, of all beliefs, stand to benefit from the end of  bloodshed. Cowardly attacks against religious minorities such as the  one that took place in Jalalabad only serve to damage prospects for a  peace that can benefit all.   The Jalalabad attack is also a stark reminder of the sectarian  violence facing religious minorities in many parts of South Asia.  Across the region, members of minority religious groups are being  denied their basic human rights and the ability to live free from  discrimination or violence. Attacks like the one in Jalalabad  underscore the urgent need for governments in the region to hold  perpetrators accountable and to enact laws and policies that foster  tolerance, protect minorities' rights, and respect individual freedoms.   America is also home to many Sikh and Hindu communities living in  every U.S. State, who, like so many minority groups in our diverse  country, have played a positive role in the social, cultural, and  economic development of the United States. In my home State of New  Jersey, I am reminded every day of how much better off we all are for  the contributions of Sikh and Hindu communities to our great State and  Nation. This is despite the fact that individuals in the United States  of South Asian heritage and representing diverse faiths have faced  attacks on account of their identity, including harassment,  discrimination in employment and schooling, or even violent  [[Page S5576]]  hate crimes, such as the devastating mass shooting in Oak Creek,  Wisconsin Sikh Gurdwara in 2012.   Just as we as a country will not stand for religious intolerance at  home, we must not fail to speak out against it abroad. Respect for  religious and other basic human freedoms worldwide is a core American  value, one that bears repeating whenever and wherever those freedoms  are threatened.   In closing, I will say it again: I condemn the July 1 attack against  Afghan Sikh and Hindu civilians and any individual or group that would  harm innocent people based on their peaceful religious beliefs. We  stand in solidarity with religious minorities in Afghanistan, in South  Asia, and around the world.                            ____________________
