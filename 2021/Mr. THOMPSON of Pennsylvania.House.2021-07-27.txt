 Madam Speaker, last week the 2020  Summer Olympics kicked off in Tokyo. For the next 2 weeks, we will see  the best of the best compete in a variety of events.   This year the United States sent a 613-member team to compete in the  Olympic Games. The journey to these games and to be on the 2020 Olympic  team is unlike any other. For the first time in Olympic history, the  games were postponed from last summer due to COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania sent 21 athletes to Tokyo. But there is  one member of the team I would like to honor today: Michael Shuey.   Michael is an Elk County, Pennsylvania, native and a 2016 graduate of  Pennsylvania State University. Michael is a two-time NCAA Big Ten  champion in javelin and a two-time NCAA Big Ten first team member.  While in Tokyo he will be competing in the javelin throw.   Congratulations to Michael and to all the athletes on this incredible  achievement. We are cheering for their success.                            ____________________
