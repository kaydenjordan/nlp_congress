 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions  of Monsignor Zenz, a staple in southeast Michigan and the pastor of  Holy Name Catholic Church.   Ordained almost 40 years ago, Monsignor Zenz received a doctorate in  spiritual theology in 1984 and has served the faculty at Sacred Heart  for over 35 years.   Starting as a weekend associate at my hometown parish in Birmingham,  Michigan, Monsignor Zenz became the pastor at Holy Name in 2008, where  he has faithfully served our community since.   He also serves on the board at the Academy of the Sacred Heart and  chaplain to the Detroit Chapter of the National Christ Child Society.  He is currently a chaplain to the Detroit Cardinal Club and has  extensive experience working with Catholic Network of Detroit, ensuring  God's word reaches as many homes as possible.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to host Monsignor Zenz here today, and I  want to thank him for his tireless service and dedication to southeast  Michigan. We should all strive to serve our communities with the same  rigor that Monsignor Zenz demonstrates on a daily basis.                            ____________________
