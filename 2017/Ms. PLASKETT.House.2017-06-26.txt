 Mr. Speaker, at this time I rise to take this Special  Order hour on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.   It is with great honor that I rise as coanchor for the next 60  minutes. We have a chance to speak directly to the American people on  the issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congress, and the constituents we represent, as well as all Americans.   This evening, myself and coanchor Marc Veasey will discuss two  topics: wealth care over healthcare and the contributions of Caribbean  Americans.   On the matter of healthcare, Senate Republicans have finally released  their draft version of the House-passed American Health Care Act, and  it is clear why they kept it behind closed doors all this time. The  bill is worse than the one that was passed in the House, with deeper  cuts to Medicaid  [[Page H5170]]  and a ban on Planned Parenthood funding for 1 year.   Just like the bill that passed the House, this proposal will likely  strip coverage for millions of Americans and do nothing to address  affordability. This bill is just as mean and heartless as the one the  Republicans jammed through the House.   As bad as it already was, Senate Republicans have made TrumpCare even  more devastating to Americans on Medicaid, and those include veterans,  middle class seniors with long-term care needs, vulnerable children,  and pregnant women. No, it is not just minority Black people who are on  Medicaid.   TrumpCare's Medicaid cuts will have an especially severe impact in  rural America, shutting rural hospitals, an important source of good- paying jobs. TrumpCare fundamentally means higher health costs,  millions of hardworking Americans losing healthcare coverage, gutting  key protections, a crushing age tax, and stealing from Medicare.   Republicans shut the American people out of writing TrumpCare. And if  TrumpCare passes, the American people will be shut out of affordable  healthcare, too. Now, after crafting this monstrosity in secret, the  GOP wants to rush it to the floor before the American people see the  damage it will do, abandoning any pretense of respect for the  democratic process.   Democrats in Congress and across the country will continue to fight  with all our strength to protect seniors and hardworking families from  TrumpCare's assault on their healthcare.   June, as we know, is Caribbean American Heritage Month, and we will  later hear from Members of Congress related to that.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Fort Worth, Texas (Mr.  Veasey), my co-chair, an advocate for his constituents and for all  Americans. He sits on the Armed Services Committee and is here to  discuss the effect that this bill will have not only on his  constituents, but to the people that we care deeply about.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words. We  were discussing the Medicaid expansion and the fact that it is going to  disappear after 2023.   The other thing that is going to be removed from this bill is the  Prevention and Public Health Fund which presently has billions of  dollars that are supportive to the CDC. What is this money used for?  [[Page H5171]]    This money is used for preventative block grants that go to all  places, like my district, the Virgin Islands, that deal with chronic  conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, provide maternal and  child care, support public laboratories and research, and maintain  vital statistics. Those moneys would be gone if this bill passes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Scott, my esteemed colleague from  Richmond and Hampton Roads in Virginia, who is the ranking member of  the Education and the Workforce Committee, to talk about the issues and  how he sees this is important, not only to his constituents, but to  America as well.   I thank the gentleman for being here this evening and giving us his  thoughts.    Mr. Speaker, it is their loss.    I know the gentleman is still working for them though.    I know the gentleman is still working for them though.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for those  thoughts and reflections that we should have about this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee). She has been an advocate for Americans, has spoken, and  done so eloquently, related to her work on the Judiciary Committee, as  well as Homeland Security, and I am eager to hear what the gentlewoman  has to say about healthcare. And as well, of course, as a fellow  Caribbean American, I would wish her and her family a Happy Caribbean  American Heritage Month, which was, of course, offered by our  colleague, Barbara Lee, in 2005.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman who represents  the U.S. Virgin Islands for her constant leadership and consistently  allowing us to come to the floor to speak to our colleagues and,  hopefully, the American people on important topics.   I can't think of a topic more important than this one that really  represents, when I say this one, the question of healthcare for  Americans.   Might I say that the healthcare statement or framework was issued  about 12 noon on Thursday. As you well know, we worked through Friday,  and I left about 12 noon, landed in Houston, and went directly to the  Legacy Community Health clinic on Lyons Avenue in Fifth Ward, Texas.  That was a federally qualified health clinic that was able to be  constructed in the neighborhood of Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland by  the Affordable Care Act and to bring healthcare to senior citizens  living across the street access, easy access to healthcare.   There was 40, 50, 60, 70 people who came. We walked down the street  to ask that this President and the Senators leave our healthcare alone.  But more importantly, the disabled community came. I want to personally  thank them.   There were children, there were pastors, there were doctors, there  were good people there, but there was the blind, there was the deaf  community, there were people in wheelchairs, and they cried. And one of  them said: Please don't take my Medicaid healthcare away; and please  allow me to continue to live independently, because I have at least the  healthcare.   Of course, the Senate did not listen. The President today said that  he hopes that the Affordable Care Act will crash and burn. And we know  that polls are showing that they increasingly think their healthcare  will get worse. But polls are showing that 51 percent of Americans  believe and support the Affordable Care Act.   I want to spend the remaining moments of my life here on the floor-- not my life, but my time on the floor. I hope to the Lord that it is  not the remaining time of my life, but I am so overwhelmed by this  bill, I know that some people will lose their lives.   So I am going to include in the Record an article entitled ``Center  for American Progress Coverage Losses Under the Senate Health Care Bill  Could Result in 18,100 to 27,700 Additional Deaths in 2026.''           [From the Center for American Progress, June 22, 2017]     Coverage Losses Under the Senate Health Care Bill Could Result in                 18,100 to 27,700 Additional Deaths in 2026                         (By Ann Crawford-Roberts)         One Republican member of Congress, defending the GOP health       care plan--the American Health Care Act (AHCA)--suggested       that concerns that the loss of health care coverage leads to       death are overblown. However, the scientific literature on       the effects of insurance coverage on mortality shows that the       coverage losses from the AHCA would result in tens of       thousands of deaths.        The secret Senate bill was finally released today, and it       is broadly similar to what passed in the House: It ends       Medicaid expansion and makes further deep cuts to the       program; eliminates the individual mandate; and reduces       funding that helps low-income Americans afford health       coverage. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not yet       released its score of the Senate bill, although it is       expected to do so early next week.        The CBO, however, has released a score of the House's       version of the AHCA, which is largely similar to the Senate       bill. The score projected that, by 2026, 23 million more       Americans would be uninsured under the House bill compared to       the Affordable Care Act (ACA).    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is what we are confronting. These  are not numbers that anyone would print just to create hysteria. These  are truthful numbers.   Now, let me answer the question. The critics keep saying that we are  crumbling. I said to you the President said: crash and burn. That is  not the case, that insurers appear to be fleeing the Affordable Care  Act's health insurance exchanges or State-based, online marketplaces  where people can buy individual health insurance.   The fact that one-third of counties are projected to have just one  insurer  [[Page H5172]]  on their ObamaCare exchanges this year has been a popular talking point  among Republicans, including President Trump, trying to gain or gin up  support to replace the Affordable Care Act.   The stat was echoed in a recent editorial by Tom Price. Though some  insurers are still deciding whether to participate in ObamaCare  exchange, the complaint about lackluster insurer participation is  valid.   In recent weeks alone, Aetna pulled out, leaving its participation in  ObamaCare limited. But the real issue is that we have been strangling  these insurance companies.   They leave out that the insurers might be less likely to exit if more  States had expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I include this article in the Record, ``Why So Many  Insurers Are Leaving ObamaCare.''                     [From The Atlantic, May 11, 2017]                 Why So Many Insurers Are Leaving Obamacare       HOW REJECTING MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT DECISIONS HAVE HURT                             INSURANCE MARKETS         One of the most common reasons critics of Obamacare say the       law is ``collapsing'' is that insurers appear to be fleeing       the Affordable Care Act's health-insurance exchanges, or the       state-based, online marketplaces where people can buy       individual health-insurance policies.        The fact that one-third of counties are projected to have       just one insurer on their Obamacare exchanges this year has       been a popular talking point among Republicans--including       President Trump--trying to gin up support for their       replacement bill, the American Health Care Act.        The stat was echoed in a recent editorial by Health and       Human Services Secretary Tom Price, in which he portrayed       Obamacare as a house that's on fire and ``many of our fellow       Americans are trapped inside.''        Though some insurers are still deciding whether to       participate in the Obamacare exchanges, the complaint about       lackluster insurer participation is valid. In recent weeks       alone, Aetna pulled out of Virginia's Obamacare exchange,       leaving its participation in Obamacare this year limited to       just four states. Medica, the last insurer remaining in most       of Iowa, threatened to stop selling individual plans. And       after Humana pulled out of Tennessee in February, leaving       40,000 people with no insurance option, BlueCross BlueShield       reluctantly stepped in on Tuesday, but only if certain       conditions are met. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation       analysis, 31 percent of counties will have just one insurer       this year, up from just 7 percent last year.        There is one thing Republicans usually leave out of their       indictment of Obamacare, though: Insurers might have been       less likely to exit if more states had expanded Medicaid       under Obamacare.        The Affordable Care Act was written with the idea that       states would expand Medicaid, the insurance program for the       poor, to cover people earning up to 138 percent of the       federal poverty level, or $16,400 for a single adult. But a       2012 Supreme Court case made that expansion optional, and so       far 19 states have rejected the expansion. People earning       below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about       $12,000 annually, in those states aren't eligible for       subsidies to buy private insurance on the Obamacare exchanges       or, in most cases, for Medicaid. They fall in an insurance       no-man's land, the ``coverage gap.''        People earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty       level in those Medicaid-rejection states, however, do qualify       for subsidies to buy insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.       Many of them enrolled in Obamacare, and they make up about 40       percent of the Obamacare enrollment population in the non-      expansion states, compared to 6 percent in the expansion       states.        The catch is, poor people tend to be sicker than rich       people are. And having so many poor, sick people in their       Obamacare marketplaces might have made it more expensive for       insurers to operate in the non-expansion states.        In Alabama, for instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the       only insurer participating in the exchange in 2017, and it's       spending $1.20 for every $1 it collects in premiums--an       unsustainable ratio, as insurance writer and analyst Louise       Norris points out.        So, then, what happened in states that did expand Medicaid       but nonetheless have very fragile insurance markets? Iowa,       for example, expanded Medicaid, but it has had so many       insurers pull out of its exchange that there might be no       Obamacare plans on offer this year. In Iowa and several other       Medicaid-expansion states, a different Obamacare-related       choice might have contributed to the high cost of insuring       their Obamacare enrollees.        Before Obamacare, insurers could reject customers they       thought would be too sick and too expensive. After Obamacare       was passed, about 35 states continued to allow the sale of       non-Obamacare-compliant plans. (The states that didn't allow       this tended to be more liberal--New York, Vermont, and the       like.) Therefore, the people on these so-called       ``grandmothered'' plans were likely to be healthier than       average, since they had to pass the healthiness test that       insurers were formerly allowed to use to screen their       customers. These plans can also raise peoples' rates as they       get sick--something that's not allowed under Obamacare. Many       healthy people in the grandmother states were, in a sense,       kept out of the Obamacare marketplaces, only joining       Obamacare if and when they get sick. Thus, the grandmothered       plans might have made the Obamacare pool sicker in those       states.        According to a 2016 KFF analysis, states that both did not       expand Medicaid and allowed the grandmothered plans had an       average ``risk score'' that was 8 percent higher than those       that that did expand Medicaid and did not allow the       grandmothered plans. The Kaiser researchers caution that       there could be other hidden demographic factors at play, but       write that the study ``does suggest that state policy       decisions may have had a noticeable effect on risk pools.''        Karen Pollitz, a KFF senior fellow, gave an example of how       this worked in Iowa, via email:        In Iowa, most of the Wellmark (BCBS) market share continues       to be in non-compliant plans (the grandmothered/grandfathered       pre-ACA plans), so Wellmark cherry picks its own market       share. Over three years, news reports show Wellmark lost $90       million on ACA compliant plans, with one enrollee accounting       for $18 million in claims for one year alone. So for 2018       Wellmark will not only leave the marketplace, it will stop       offering all ACA compliant plans, keeping in force just their       pre-ACA policies.        Today, of course, insurers have even more to worry about,       like whether the Trump administration will continue to make       payments called cost-sharing reductions to defray medical       costs for low-income people on Obamacare. House Republicans       successfully sued the Obama administration in 2014 to stop       the payments, and the Trump administration could simply drop       the appeal. In that case, insurers participating in Obamacare       would be on the hook for billions of dollars in medical       expenses. (The House health-care bill would eliminate the       payments as well.)        As Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American       Academy of Actuaries, put it to NBC News, ``Insurers need to       know if they are going to get paid.''        What's more, some insurers are skeptical that the Trump       administration will enforce Obamacare's individual mandate,       so they are raising their rates as a precaution.        And of course, with the Senate currently debating its own       version of the Obamacare repeal bill, the entire future of       Obamacare is uncertain. Indeed, ``uncertainty'' comes up a       lot in stories about insurers leaving Obamacare.        At this rate, Republicans might live to see the Obamacare       ``death spiral'' they have long been prophesying. But       insurance markets don't just collapse on their own. Decisions       by states, Congress, and the Trump administration can--and       have--given them a hefty nudge.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. And the answer, of course, is a litany of ways that  the Republicans have extinguished the very essence of it.   But I just want to close by bringing to the attention of my  colleagues Ryan Smith. He has a mental health generalized anxiety  disorder. He has got a beautiful picture with, it looks like, his mom  and him. And it says: Without the ACA, I would not have been able to  move and find a new job.   He has generalized anxiety disorder. He is a young man with a job who  worked for the Michigan House of Representatives, and he was diagnosed  in 2013. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he keeps his job.   Then we have, how TrumpCare will kill me before cystic fibrosis. I am  34 years old. If I was a Canadian, there would be a good chance I would  live for 17 more years, but, in the Americas of Donald Trump and Paul  Ryan, that is not going to happen.   At 2, I was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. And this individual  indicates: I got married. I hope one day to have children. But without  the Affordable Care Act, they too may lose their lives.   ObamaCare saved my life. What now? This was a gentleman, lying in bed  with my dog, recovering from the most recent surgery, when the news  alert went off on my iPhone after midnight. Breaking news: the Senate  has just taken a major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act.  Fear, that is what I and millions of Americans felt.   This is a breast cancer survivor, and she is worried about being able  to survive.   So there are many stories like this, and there are stories of the  disabled and senior citizens who may be thrown out of nursing homes and  children who are very sick who may, because of a preexisting disease,  not have insurance.   I am glad to be with you on the floor, and I think I will end by  saying, my commitment is to see that this never  [[Page H5173]]  happens to the American people; that whatever the shenanigans and  negotiating that are going on in the Senate--and I respect the other  body, but whatever is going on to pass a bill that may kill people, or  cause people to lose their lives under the medical system, or, in fact,  throw people off of insurance, I believe we have a moral obligation to  stand in the gap and stand against this.   I really would lift up my hand to my friends, Senators and others, I  lift my hand. Let us sit down to the negotiating table together, and  let us save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague in strong opposition to the  issue of repealing, revising, and replacing the Affordable Care Act  presented by the Republicans.   Tonight, after seven years of claiming to have a workable replacement  for the Affordable Care Act, the Senate, just as House Republicans  before them, showed their hand; and it is empty.   Senate Republicans have finally released their draft version of the  House-passed American Health Care Act and it is clear why they kept it  behind closed doors all this time.   Today, the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint  Committee on Taxation (JCT) completed their estimate of the direct  spending and revenue effects of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of  2017, which is the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute to  H.R. 1628.   The Senate bill would increase the number of people who are uninsured  by 22 million in 2026 relative to the number under current law,  slightly fewer than the increase in the number of uninsured estimated  for the House-passed legislation.   By 2026, an estimated 49 million people would be uninsured, compared  with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.   Senate Trumpcare is yet another plan that promotes Wealth Care--if  you are billionaire or a millionaire you will become wealthier.   If you are part of the middle class or the working poor your economic  you will become less well-off due to higher health insurance cost or  out of pocket health care expenses.   Earlier today, they were making changes to address the growing chorus  of objections to their ill-conceived attempt to end Obamacare for more  than 20 million Americans   The change they proposed could be described as a post-script that  people should try to keep health insurance coverage while they strip  away the assistance that makes health insurance a right that is  affordable and accessible to all Americans.   The reality of keeping health insurance under the Republican proposal  would be nearly impossible for the very sick who are receiving coverage  under Medicaid.   The added difficulty for the chronically ill is that their  preexisting condition may mean higher premiums that the Republican plan  will not help them cover through subsidies or the removal of  prohibitions that insurance companies cannot discriminate against them.   If you or your loved one depends on Medicaid you will be worse off  because the insurance market may allow you to purchase insurance, but  there is no subsidies to help you purchase plans, and no control over  how high a premium might become.   The Senate bill is worse than the one that passed the House, with  deeper cuts to Medicaid and a ban on Planned Parenthood funding for one  year.   Just like the bill that passed the House, this proposal would likely  strip coverage from millions of Americans and do nothing to address  affordability, all while providing a windfall to corporations and the  richest of the rich.   Both healthcare bills are immoral bill and I call on Republicans to  abandon their efforts to repeal and replace the law of the land at the  expense of the most vulnerable Americans.   The President promised to a plan to provide health insurance for  everybody.   But that promise has not been kept.   The legislation unveiled by House and Senate Republicans would kick  millions of Americans off their health coverage and force millions to  pay more for less.   This plan is a prescription for misery and spells disaster for hard- working families struggling to make ends meet in the face of spiraling  health care costs.   The Affordable Care Act was always about real people who have real  lives that are impacted by not having access to affordable and  accessible health insurance.    Those caught up in the Opioid addiction rely on Medicaid for  healthcare treatment for withdrawal special medical care centers.   The Senate and House Republican bills would eliminate Medicaid  coverage for tens of thousands of Opioid addicts who are seeking help.   The Affordable Care Act has established healthcare as a right and not  just something that the privileged can afford.   This repeal charade must end.   Republicans have had seven years to show they have a better way to  cover millions of Americans but we have learned at last that they have  none.   Republicans will be held accountable for whatever happens to our  health care system under their watch, especially the destabilizing  uncertainty their efforts have already engendered.   With America finally on the move thanks to the expansion of coverage  through the Affordable Care Act, the Republican plan to repeal and  replace the ACA threatens to turn the clock back by making America sick  again.   Statistics Texas   Should the Republicans be successful in repealing the Affordable Care  Act people living in the State of Texas will be harmed: 1,874,000  individuals in the state who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented could lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or  partially repealed.   1,092,650 individuals stand to lose their coverage if the Republican  Congress dismantles the exchanges.   913,177 individuals who received financial assistance to purchase  health insurance in 2016, received an average of $271 per person, would  be at risk of having coverage become unaffordable if the Republican  Congress eliminates the premium tax credits.   1,107,000 individuals in the state could have insurance if the State  of Texas would accept the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.  These individuals will not be able to gain coverage if the Republican  Congress eliminates the Medicaid expansion.   508,000 kids who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented  are also at risk of having their coverage rolled back.   205,000 young adults in the state who are able to stay on a parent's  health insurance plan thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage if  the Republican Congress eliminates the requirement that insurers allow  children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.   646,415 individuals in the state who received cost-sharing reductions  to lower out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles, co-pays, and  coinsurance are now at risk of having healthcare become unaffordable if  the Republican Congress eliminates cost-sharing reductions.    10,278,005 individuals in the state who now have private health  insurance that covers preventive services without any co-pays,  coinsurance, or deductibles stand to lose this avenue of access to  affordable healthcare if the Republican Congress eliminates ACA  provisions requiring health insurers to cover important preventive  services without cost-sharing.   Women in the state who can now purchase insurance for the same price  as men are at risk of being charged more for insurance if the  Republican Congress eliminates the ACA's ban on gender rating in the  individual and small group markets. Before the ACA, women paid up to  56% more than men for their health insurance.   Roughly 4,536,000 individuals in the state who have pre-existing  health conditions are at risk of having their coverage rescinded, being  denied coverage, or being charged significantly more for coverage if  the Republican Congress eliminates the ACA's ban on pre-existing  conditions.   346,750 seniors who have saved an average of $1,057 each as a result  of closing the Medicare prescription drug ``donut hole'' gap in  coverage stand to lose this critical help going forward.   1,746,043 seniors who have received free preventive care services  thanks to ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual wellness visits  and eliminating cost-sharing for many recommended preventive services  covered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer screenings, are at risk of  losing access to these services if congressional Republicans go forward  with their plan to repeal the ACA.   National Statistics 2013-2016   There were over 41 million uninsured persons in the United States in  2013, and by 2015 that number had declined to a little over 28 million  because of the tremendous success of the Affordable Care Act.   In March 2016, HHS reported that due to the Affordable Care Act, 20  million Americans have gained health care coverage.   In 2016, Medicaid's share of total U.S. health care spending amounted  to 17 percent. The program is funded by both federal and state  government. In 2016, there were 72.2 million people enrolled in  Medicaid.   Since 2012 the number of people receiving healthcare through Medicaid  grow by 24.6 million.   The number of children enrolled in Medicaid coverage is 43%.   As more families were able to purchase health care insurance through  exchanges the number of children receiving health insurance through  Medicaid decreased from 50% in 2011 to 43% in 2016 because their  families' health plan provided them with coverage.   The 2016 HHS report said that 6.1 million uninsured young adults ages  19 to 25 have gained health insurance coverage because  [[Page H5174]]  they could remain on a parent's health plan due to the Affordable Care  Act.   Black and Hispanic Insurance Rates   Gains in coverage because of the Affordable Care Act were strong  across all racial and ethnic groups between October 2013 and early  2016.   The uninsured rate among Black non-Hispanics dropped by more than 50  percent (from 22.4 to 10 percent); corresponding to about 3 million  adults gaining coverage.   The uninsured rate among Hispanics dropped by more than 25 percent  (from 41.8 to 30.5 percent), corresponding to about 4 million Hispanic  adults gaining coverage.   The greatest demographic that benefited from the Affordable Care Act  were White non-Hispanics whose uninsurance rate declined by more than  50 percent (from 14.3 to 7.0 percent), corresponding to about 8.9  million adults gaining coverage.   History of Universal Healthcare in the United States   In 1949, Harry Truman became the first sitting President to propose  universal healthcare for all Americans as part of the ``Fair Deal.''   On March 23, 2010, with the stroke of President Obama's pen, the  American people received this part of the ``Fair Deal.''   The Affordable Care Act has been affirmed to be law by every means  provided by our nation's constitution: On March 21, 2010, it passed the  House and was sent to the President.   On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act  into law.   On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court in National  Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius ruled that it was  constitutional.   During the 2012 Presidential Election the Affordable Care Act was a  central issue. President Obama was soundly reelected with 51.1 percent  of the vote and 62% of the Electoral votes (332-206).   In 2014, the Affordable Care Act provisions banned insurance  companies from:   Discriminating against anyone with a pre-existing condition.   Charging higher rates based on gender or health status.   Enforcing lifetime dollar limits.   Enforcing annual dollar limits on health benefits.   The Affordable Care Act means:   Over 19 million Americans now have health insurance.   105 million Americans have no life time limits on health insurance   Nearly 134 million people with pre-existing conditions have coverage.   6.6 million young-adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents'  health insurance plans.   5 million Seniors in the `donut hole' have saved billions on their  prescription drugs.   3.2 million Seniors have access to free annual wellness visits under  Medicare, and   360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to help  them provide health insurance to their workers.   [Statistics on Texas and the Affordable Care Act]   1.7 million Texas have health insurance because of the Affordable  Care Act.   7 million Texans no longer have lifetime limits on their healthcare  insurance.   300,731 young adults can remain on their parents' health insurance  until age 26.   10 million Texans have insurance although they have pre-existing  conditions that would have prevented them from getting coverage before  the Affordable Care Act became law.   346,750 seniors are no longer in the prescription drug donut hole,  which means they are no sudden large out of pocket expenses to get the  medicine they need.                                time  2000     I thank the gentlewoman so much for that information,  for much of the testimonies that you have given for the record.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gaetz). Is there objection to the  request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, it gives me great pleasure  to yield to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who not only represents  California in the area of Berkeley as well as Oakland, but is also  someone who is a real progressive fighter for the American people,  cares passionately about healthcare.   But on this evening when we are also talking about Caribbean American  Heritage Month, I have to tell you that, in June of 2005, the House  unanimously adopted H. Con. Res. 71, which was sponsored and ushered  through by Congresswoman Barbara Lee with other Members, which was  recognizing the significance of Caribbean people and their descendants  in the history and culture of the United States. On February 14, 2006,  the resolution similarly passed the Senate, culminating a 2-year  bipartisan, bicameral effort that was issued by President George Bush  on June 6, 2006.   Since the declaration, the White House has issued annual  proclamations recognizing June as Caribbean American Heritage Month,  and it gives those of us of Caribbean-American heritage great honor and  a real opportunity to extol and let other Americans know about the  contributions, the issues that are important to us.   I thank Congresswoman Lee for bringing that forward and for ushering  that through. It is really, I feel, quite often that we get subsumed,  that the experiences of Caribbean Americans often get glossed over, and  I want to thank her for affording us the opportunity to have this month  to be able to talk among ourselves and among other Americans about the  things that we have done.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California to discuss healthcare as  well as Caribbean American Heritage Month.    It says a lot for what we can accomplish.    It says a lot for what we can accomplish.    It says a lot for what we can accomplish.    I thank the gentlewoman for that information and for  her passionate words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  who is an advocate for people throughout this country, not just  Wisconsin, and who is a poet along with being a great Congresswoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands has  25 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, it is with enormous, not just gratitude,  but great pride, actually, to yield to someone who, to me, is one of my  big sisters here, who is the champion in the House, the foundation for  those of us within the Caribbean Caucus who are Caribbean Americans  here in the Congress. She represents probably one of the largest  Caribbean constituencies in the United States, that being part of  Brooklyn, New York, which I tell everybody is the largest Caribbean  island in the world.                                time  2015    Congresswoman Yvette Clarke is a great member on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce. She is one of the co-chairs of the Congressional  Caribbean Caucus, and she is a passionate progressive advocate for  healthcare and for all care for Americans and for those who have been  forgotten.   I am so glad and so grateful for the gentlewoman's continued efforts  to raise the level of awareness on issues related to the Caribbean  Basin, of Caribbean Americans here in the United States, and the  African diaspora as a whole, that we are not a monolithic group, that  we have a richness and a variety within even Americans who are of  Caribbean descent here in America. And that needs to be celebrated and  discussed, and the achievements and how we all, as a mosaic, make  America great by being part of different cultures.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke)  this evening to discuss healthcare and Caribbean American Heritage  Month.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the  United States Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my Caribbean-American  sisters and brothers across this country. For  [[Page H5176]]  hundreds of years, Caribbean Americans have contributed to the  artistic, legal, literary, diplomatic, business, athletic, and  medical--you name it, there is not an endeavor where you won't find a  Caribbean American who helped shape American society.   Alexander Hamilton grew up in the Leeward Islands of St. Kitts and  Nevis and went on to found our economic system. Former Attorney General  Eric Holder, whose family came from Barbados, served honorably as the  first Black Attorney General. General Colin Powell, whose own parents  immigrated from Jamaica, became our Nation's first Black chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the first Black Secretary of State.   Constance Baker Motley, whose parents were from Nevis, drafted the  complaint in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education before  serving as our Nation's first Black female Federal judge.   Shirley Chisholm, my predecessor and role model, served in Congress  for seven terms and became the first Black woman to seek a major  party's nomination for President. Her family was from modern-day Guyana  and Barbados.   Who can forget the unmatched contributions of such notable performers  as Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis, Jr., and even Beyonce?   Let me add Rihanna. I could go on.   But by any measure, Caribbean Americans have enriched the United  States beyond their numbers. They have made the United States better,  stronger, and more vibrant while serving as a credit to the Caribbean  region and the United States of America.   I, myself, am the proud daughter of Jamaican immigrants. My mother,  Dr. Una Clarke, served as the first Caribbean-born female member of the  New York City Council. In fact, she was the first foreign-born female  to serve in the New York City Council.   For those reasons, I am proud to represent one of the largest  Caribbean diaspora communities in the Nation and to serve as one of the  co-chairs of the Congressional Caribbean Caucus.   However, unfortunately, the Caribbean region stands at a crossroads  today. Many of the nations face high energy prices, environmental  degradation, public health challenges, and economic challenges imposed  by the correspondent banking crisis. Haiti, in particular, has been  beset by numerous challenges over the past few years through no fault  of its own.   I believe that the United States must not be silent in the face of  those challenges. The Caribbean region is known favorably as the third  border of the United States. Instead, it should aid our Caribbean  neighbors to help ensure a vibrant future in the region.   Indeed, the State Department's recent report to Congress on the U.S.- Caribbean strategic partnership marked a step in the right direction.  However, we must continue making strides on the road to full diplomatic  engagement in accordance with our values and as befitting our friends  and neighbors in the region.   I find it quite fascinating that so many other nations around the  world have found this region in the Western Hemisphere to be partners  with, and, we, right on its borders, have given it short shrift. When  you look at the level of investment that China is making in the  Caribbean region right now, it should give us all pause in the United  States as we are concerned about the expansion of their influence into  the Western Hemisphere.   So, Mr. Speaker, as I speak with pride today, I want to mention the  name Susan Rice, former Ambassador to the U.N., another proud Caribbean  American; and Patrick Ewing, formerly of the New York Nicks, another  proud Caribbean American. The list goes on and on. We have deeply  benefited from their contributions to our life, enriching society here  in the United States of America.   I would be remiss if I left the floor this evening without adding my  voice to that of my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus in  condemning this horrible healthcare bill that has been put forth in the  United States Senate. It is a companion to the horrible bill that was  put forth by United States House of Representatives.   I am a Christian and I practice my faith regularly. There is  something said in the Bible about wickedness in high places. I have to  speak to the wickedness within this bill that we, as a civil society,  would remove the ability for people to just have human dignity, to have  life, to be able to see their doctors, to be able to make sure that  their children are well taken care of, that their parents can live out  their days in dignity and in as best health as possible is really a  blot on this Nation.   We have been through generations of challenges. We have reached a  point where, in this Nation, we have made a lot of progress in really  doing our best for our neighbors as we would do for ourselves. This is  totally a step back.   Our children are going to ask us where we were when this vicious bill  was proposed that Americans would be stripped of the ability to access  healthcare in the United States of America in the 21st century.   I stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues in the Congressional  Black Caucus to say that we stood on the floor of the House and we  fought. We fought for human dignity. We fought to make sure that this  would not be something that would not rest on the mind and the  conscious of our colleagues, that they would reflect on how they would  feel if this bill were to impact them personally.   I find it really ironic that in many of the districts that this  healthcare bill would impact, our colleagues are basically stripping  away the well-being of their own constituents--people who voted and  sent them here. It is truly unfortunate that we value wealth over human  dignity; that we value giving money to people who haven't even asked  for it over making sure that we can stop pandemics, that we can  continue research into cures for those who may be ill, and that we can  continue to move along the path of preventive health, which is, by far,  the best way for us to conduct our lives in the United States of  America. To see emergency rooms, if they remain open, filled with those  who are uninsured in this day and age is not worthy of who we are as a  nation.   So I stand with my colleagues to say that we will fight until the  last person standing to bring dignity to our Nation--to all people--but  we fight, in particular, as a Congressional Black Caucus for those who  have been most victimized and are the most vulnerable amongst us, and  those are the people of the African-American communities here in the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett) for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting for myself that  we have Congresswoman Yvette Clarke and the next Member to come up is  also from New York. Both of them have been Representatives of districts  that I have lived in and that my family lives in. They represent what I  think of when I think of my parents who live now in Congressman Meeks'  district, and my mother who was partly raised in Congresswoman Clarke's  district. My parents represent most Caribbean Americans who come to  this country--people who come here with not much, who are willing to  work hard, who believe that the sacrifice toward education and support  of their families and helping others to come and find good, stable jobs  and create middle class is what America is about.   We have contributed so much, and we can talk about so many of the  Caribbean Americans who have done amazing things in this country. But  it is those individuals who we do not talk about--our parents, our  families--who come to this country, who provided the stability for  others. It is why we are so concerned about the temporary protective  status of Haitians--the 50,000 Haitians who are hardworking Haitians in  this country, who are being sent back, who are now here working hard  and sending so much money back that is the backbone of the economy of  Haiti, who we cannot let go back because that country will collapse  with them, leaving this country, and being good citizens--as much as  they can be citizens--yearning for the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meeks represents Queens, which is one of the  backbones of Caribbean Americans. He is my parents' Congressman. The  gentleman has been so good to the people that he represents as well as  all the American people. The gentleman sits on the Committee on  Financial Services. He also  [[Page H5177]]  sits as a member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he advocates  and speaks for those individuals who cannot speak for themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands has  2\1/2\ minutes remaining.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  and I will close out after that.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  and I will close out after that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  celebration of Caribbean American Heritage Month. In June 2005, the  House of Representatives adopted H. Con. Res. 71, recognizing the  significance of the Caribbean people. In February 2006, the resolution  passed in the Senate, and was signed by President George W. Bush in  June 2006.   Since the declaration, the United States has celebrated June as  Caribbean American heritage month every June, this year marks the  twelfth anniversary. Approximately 3 million people in America can  trace their ancestry to the Caribbean.   Historically, African-Caribbean migration to the United States can be  traced back to the 17th century during British colonial slavery. While  enslaved Africans imported from the Caribbean decreased after revolts  in the 1700s, Caribbean immigration grew in the mid-1800s. After World  War II, Caribbean immigration boomed during periods of economic growth.  Between 1960 and 2009, the number of Caribbean immigrants grew from  190,000 to 2 million.   Caribbean Americans have contributed the fabric of our society,  bringing a unique and vibrant culture to mesh with that of America's.  Just to name a few, Colin Powell, Eric Holder, Cicely Tyson, and Lenny  Kravitz are all Caribbean Americans.   I urge my fellow members of Congress to commemorate this month as  National Caribbean American Heritage Month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 39 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, June 27, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
