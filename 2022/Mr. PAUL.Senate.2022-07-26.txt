 Over 6 million people died worldwide from COVID; over a  million Americans died from COVID.   Last year, we passed unanimously an amendment I had to ban any U.S.  tax dollars from going to Wuhan, China, to the lab. There was a great  deal of evidence that this pandemic arose out of the lab.   Gain-of-function research enhances the severity of transmissibility  of existing viruses that may infect humans. The dangers are so acute  that, from 2014 to 2017, the National Institutes of Health suspended  funding for all gain-of-function projects.   The emergence of COVID serves as a reminder that this dangerous  research, conducted in a secretive and totalitarian country, is simply  too risky to fund.   I, therefore, ask my colleagues to restore this crucial provision  that would prohibit the funding of gain-of-function research in China.   I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up my amendment  No. 5159. I further ask that there be 30 minutes of debate, equally  divided between the two leaders or their designees; and, finally, that  upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on adoption  of my amendment with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has  lost one of its own. Deputy Sheriff Brandon Shirley, 26, of Louisville,  was fatally shot by two suspects. It is painful whenever we lose an  officer, but it is especially horrendous when that loss is for no  apparent reason.   Deputy Sheriff Shirley was working as a security officer at Rockford  Lane Auto Sales when he was shot at approximately 2:30 a.m. Brandon was  able to report the shooting on his radio and was transported to the  University of Louisville Hospital, where he ultimately succumbed to his  wounds.   In a particularly agonizing moment for our country, Deputy Sheriff  Shirley was the 25,000th law enforcement officer killed in our Nation's  history, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a nonprofit  organization that reports U.S. law enforcement deaths.   Deputy Sheriff Shirley was well-liked and respected by his colleagues  and supervisors. Jefferson County Sheriff John Aubrey shared these kind  words, ``He loved being a deputy sheriff, and he was a good one.'' He  was equally praised by Lt. Col. Carl Yates of the sheriff's office as  being ``very active, proactive, courageous, a good Deputy, and well- liked.''   Deputy Sheriff Brandon Shirley was an asset to the residents of  Louisville and a testament to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. I  am proud to salute Brandon and mourn alongside the entire Shirley  family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, every Member of Congress vividly  remembers his or her path toward engagement in our government. Some  have been more circuitous than others, but we all remember how that  spark was ignited and how action ensued.   Katherine Wetherton, a freshman at the University of Louisville,  hopes to kindle that passion for civic engagement in young women. In  doing so, Katherine wrote a book for middle and high school students  entitled ``She Rocks the Vote.'' She distributes it at seminars,  workshops, and the Little Free Library, which she built and installed  in her hometown in Oldham County.   A results-focused young woman, Kate was active in Girl Scouts for 13  years  [[Page S3690]]  and completed her Girl Scout Gold Award, which is achieved by only  about 5 percent of Girl Scouts. And while she has big plans for her  education, including graduate school, she doesn't intend to stop  connecting young women with the information and skills they need to  become involved at every level of government.   I am proud to recognize Kate for her accomplishments and leadership  and have no doubt she will continue to play an integral role in  bettering the Commonwealth.                            ____________________
