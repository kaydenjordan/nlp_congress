 Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend, Theodore  ``Ted'' Bornstein. Ted recently announced his well-deserved retirement,  after a long career as a vital and vigorous public servant and  advocate.   In the late 1970s, Ted began his work in Washington, DC, establishing  and overseeing the State of Missouri's DC office, and led it for more  than 6 years on behalf of Governors Joe Teasdale and Kit Bond. He later  shifted to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as chief of staff  to Representatives Cecil Heftel and Les Aspin. After Representative  Aspin's confirmation to be Secretary of Defense under then-President  Bill Clinton, Ted served as the director of the Defense Reinvestment  Task Force.   Following his time in the Department of Defense, Ted returned to  Capitol Hill to serve the people of Wisconsin as chief of staff for  former Senator Herb Kohl. As Senator Kohl's chief of staff, he led  legislative outreach strategies and programs and oversaw the operation  of several offices of more than 40 staff. He later departed Senator  Kohl's office and joined the firm of Foley & Lardner, LLP, where he  will retire as a partner this year.   Ted's experience on Capitol Hill and the executive branch have made  him a valuable asset to clients across a wide breadth of interests. He  has successfully assisted clients in areas ranging from congressional  investigations to defense policy and appropriations, as well as tax  policy, healthcare, and governmental ethics.   Outside of his professional work, Ted is a cofounder of the  influential Wisconsin Group. This group brings together Wisconsin- connected professionals in business and public policy to meet regularly  on issues of importance. His efforts on this front have been invaluable  to many bipartisan achievements of the Wisconsin congressional  delegation.   I am pleased to recognize Ted's long career in public service and  advocacy, and I wish him all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to honor someone who was a  true leader and inspiring figure to many in my hometown of Madison, WI,  and across our country.   Scholar and activist R. Richard ``Dick'' Wagner sadly passed away on  December 13, 2021, at the age of 78. Dick devoted his life to public  service and advancing our common good. In 1980, he was elected as the  first openly gay member of the Dane County Board of Supervisors, where  he served for 14 years, including 4 years as chair.   I first met Dick in 1984. Fresh out of college and looking to connect  with the local political scene, I was invited to a gathering of local  progressive elected officials, labor union leaders, and civil rights  and environmental activists to strategize about candidate recruitment  for city council and school board seats to be contested in the spring  elections. We met on the second floor of a popular local establishment,  Mother's Pub, which had long been a gathering spot for local  progressives. I observed how much respect Dick had earned from his  fellow progressive leaders. Following a discussion about the issues the  group hoped to advance, we broke into small groups. Dick Wagner led a  discussion on opportunities to advance policies, initiatives, and  ordinances to counter discrimination against our community. That day,  Dick became my role model and mentor, and a lifelong friendship ensued.   As one of the first dozen openly gay officials in the Nation, Dick  was a founding member of the International Network of Lesbian and Gay  Officials, now known as the Victory Institute. With quiet determination  and the utmost civility, he provided me and many others a path forward.  Together, Dick and I cohosted the fifth Victory Institute conference in  Madison in 1989.   Dick had an expansive professional career in public service, serving  on the Wisconsin Arts Board, the Wisconsin Humanities Committee, the  National Board for the Assembly of State Arts Agencies, the Madison  Landmarks Commission, Olbrich Botanical Society, Friends of UW  Libraries, and the Governor's Council on Lesbian and Gay Issues.   He also cofounded UW-Madison's LGBT Alumni Association; and the New  Harvest Foundation, the LGBT foundation for south-central Wisconsin,  and served on the board of Fair Wisconsin.   Dick understood that change grows at local grassroots level, and he  worked hard in a collaborative way to bring it to Wisconsin. His work  as a leader in the gay community helped lead to a city gay rights  ordinance in 1974 and a county ordinance in 1980 prohibiting  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He was also  instrumental in establishing some of the State's first  antidiscrimination laws against gays and lesbians.   In retirement, he fully utilized his doctorate in history by  authoring two groundbreaking volumes on gay history in Wisconsin:  ``We've Been Here All Along'' provided an illuminating picture of  Wisconsin's gay history from the reporting on the Oscar Wilde trials of  1895 to the landmark Stonewall Riots of 1969. ``Coming Out, Moving  Forward: Wisconsin's Recent Gay History'' outlined the challenges that  LGBTQ Wisconsinites faced in their efforts to right past oppressions  and secure equality. It also powerfully told the stories of our State's  LGBTQ pioneers who pushed back against injustice and found ways to live  openly and proudly as themselves.   Dick Wagner was a deeply inspiring person in my life as a role model,  mentor, and lifelong friend. In fact, I may not have ever entered  public service if not for the guidance and encouragement he provided me  to walk the path he paved. He provided the opportunity for young people  like myself and others growing up all over Wisconsin to know that they  are not alone and that they stand on the shoulders of people who came  before them. Dick lived a life that showed to all of us that history  only moves in one direction: Forward. For that, I am forever grateful.                            ____________________
