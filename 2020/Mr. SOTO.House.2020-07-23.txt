 Mr. Speaker, this appropriations package continues to make  important investments to restore and protect the environment of our  beautiful State of Florida.   We have language in there encouraging the National Park Service to  consider the Kissimmee River at the headwaters of the Everglades for  the Wild and Scenic Rivers Program, one of the highlights of our  district.   Everglades restoration: over $15 million, including $10 million for  CERP.   We help address harmful algal blooms that hurt our coast, including  recognizing the threat and encouraging EPA for more support and  research.   We address the threats to the Great Florida Reef by recognizing the  coral disease outbreak and recommending additional resources with State  and local partners.   We help out with sinkholes throughout Florida by having the USGS  identify and map them out so we can protect Floridians.   We are also recognizing natural disasters like the earthquake in  Puerto Rico by continuing to develop new programs.                                time  1545
