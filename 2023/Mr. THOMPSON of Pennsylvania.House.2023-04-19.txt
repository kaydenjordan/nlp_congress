 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m.  tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  veterans of Potter, McKean, and Warren Counties who flew to Washington,  D.C. on Saturday, April 15 as part of the Buffalo-Niagara Honor Flight.   The Buffalo-Niagara Honor Flight is part of the National Honor Flight  Network, which ``recognizes United States veterans for their sacrifices  and their achievements by flying them to Washington to see the  memorials at no cost to the veteran.''   Honor Flights prioritize World War II veterans, Korean war, and  Vietnam veterans, and veterans with medical issues requiring special  attention. Honor Flight guardians fly with each veteran on every flight  helping them have a safe, memorable, and rewarding experience.   In patriotic spirit, Bradford Area High School welcomed participating  veterans for lunch, a celebration, and community escort on Friday  before the flight.   This month, the following veterans from Potter, McKean, and Warren  Counties made the flight: Ronald Bosworth, Richard Dugan, Robert  Langfitt, and Donald Shinn, all of whom served bravely in the Vietnam  war.   We honor and thank these brave men and women for their service to our  country and the communities they call home.                            ____________________
