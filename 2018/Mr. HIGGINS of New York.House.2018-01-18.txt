 Mr. Speaker, a continuing resolution to  extend Federal spending for 1 month may not pass because the President  tweeted that he does not support funding for healthcare for 9 million  American kids.   This is a terrible indictment on a congressional leadership that is  again cowering to a petulant, uninformed, and impulsive President, a  President who is making a mockery of Congress as a coequal branch of  the Federal Government; and that the congressional Republican  leadership is complicit is a national embarrassment. I say Congress  should roll the President and force him to veto children's healthcare.   Mr. President, a continuing resolution is a failure to act; it is a  failure to decide; it is a failure to lead; and it represents gross  negligence as it relates to the basic duty of the institution of the  United States Congress.   This is a sad day. Once again, Congress capitulates to a petulant and  pouting President.
