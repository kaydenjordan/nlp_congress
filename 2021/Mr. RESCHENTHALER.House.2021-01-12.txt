 Mr. Speaker, let me be clear about something. The  violence and the rioting in our Capitol last Wednesday was tragic. It  was undemocratic, and it was unacceptable. I unequivocally condemn this  criminal behavior that occurred in this building.   Our great Nation is deeply divided. Unfortunately, rather than  looking forward and working together on issues that actually unite our  country, we are here debating a partisan issue, a partisan resolution  that will only further divide us.   The Constitution is very clear on the issue we are debating. The  ability to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment lies with the Vice  President and Cabinet members, Cabinet members who are vetted and  confirmed by the Senate.   Congress is only drawn in, House Members are only drawn in, when the  President disputes a declaration of incapacitation. That is not what is  happening here. We should respect that constitutional prerogative.   Mr. Speaker, I am also perplexed by my Democrat colleagues' attempt  to force the hand of a man that they clearly had faith in to run our  country. They must recognize that by calling for the President's  immediate resignation, they are also advocating for Vice President Mike  Pence to lead our Nation. Therefore, they should have full trust in  Vice President Pence's decision-making ability to act in a manner  consistent with his constitutional responsibilities, just as he did  last week.   Further, I am incredibly and deeply disappointed that the rule before  us suspends prohibitions on engaging in personalities against the  President. It is somewhat ironic. If we are truly worried about  rhetoric, then we must set an example and ensure that civility and  decorum remain an essential part of the American discourse.    Mr. Speaker, we must set an example and ensure  that civility and decorum remain an essential part of the American  discourse.
