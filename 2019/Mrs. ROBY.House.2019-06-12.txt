 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense  amendment that will allow the courts, rather than the majority in the  House, to decide the fate of a proposed rule set forth by the  Department of Health and Human Services.   In February of this year, HHS issued a new rule that would restrict  Title X family planning grants from going to entities that are not  physically and financially separated from abortion providers. But a  series of court injunctions have frozen these new rule changes and, as  a result, hundreds of Planned Parenthood facilities nationwide are  still receiving Federal tax dollars.   Americans have made it clear time and time again that they don't want  their tax dollars paying for abortions.   This rule, which prevents any tax dollars from going to any abortion- providing facility, is going through the constitutional challenges of  our judicial process. Unfortunately, lawmakers here in the House have  chosen to tie the hands of HHS through legislation by effectively  stating that the HHS Secretary may only act in accordance of  ``regulations and instructions'' established before January 18, 2017,  just 2 days before Donald Trump became President.   My amendment would strike that provision, allowing the U.S. courts to  decide if HHS' proposed rule should stand.   We cannot handcuff the current administration to regulations of past  administrations, and I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4537]]         Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I am prepared to  close.   I am unapologetically pro-life, and I will continue to use this  platform and every opportunity it provides to stand up for those who  cannot defend themselves.   Congress must ensure that our constituents' tax dollars are not being  used to end innocent lives. This is our enduring responsibility.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to please support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
