 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Girl Scouts' 107th birthday, which was celebrated earlier this month.  This anniversary is important to women everywhere, but particularly in  the First  [[Page H2805]]  District of Georgia where the Girl Scouts were founded.   In 1912, Juliette Gordon Low started meeting with 18 girls who played  basketball, hiked, camped, studied foreign languages, and worked to  help people in need. With Juliette Gordon Low and these 18 women in  Savannah, the seeds were sown for a movement, which now includes 2.6  million Girl Scouts in 92 countries and 50 million alums.   With their motto of being go-getters, innovators, risk-takers, and  leaders, the international organization has made an enormous impact in  the lives of young women in their 107-year history. A testament to  their work includes alums aboard the International Space Station,  Members of Congress, artists, athletes, and so much more.   Thank you to the Girl Scouts for making our world a better place to  live and for encouraging young women to always push the envelope.  Congratulations on a successful first 107 years, and I wish the Girl  Scouts the best in years to come.                            ____________________
