 Mr. President, article II, section 2 of the  Constitution gives this body, the Senate, the responsibility to advise  and consent on judicial appointments. It is an important check on  executive power. We are invested with this special responsibility to  ensure that individuals nominated by the President to be Supreme Court  Justices will be people who will make decisions fairly and impartially,  without favor and without bias. That is why Lady Justice wears a  blindfold and holds a balance scale on which to weigh the merits of  arguments and claims that come before her. The integrity of the Supreme  Court requires that every person who comes before that Court has  confidence that each Justice will fairly weigh the evidence and the  arguments. Judge Kavanaugh does not meet that standard.   I had that concern at the very beginning of this process, and I fear  it more than ever today at the end of the process. Any remaining hope  that Judge Kavanaugh could be trusted to be an impartial Justice or  could be perceived to be an impartial Justice was shattered by his  opening statement at his last hearing. In that statement, which he  emphasized he wrote in his own words, Judge Kavanaugh launched into an  ultra-partisan diatribe and into wild conspiracy theories. He suggested  that Dr. Ford's compelling testimony about her sexual assault was  somehow manufactured by Democrats as payback for his participation in  the Starr investigation, as if Dr. Ford were an actor in a bitter  partisan battle rather than a brave citizen who had come forward to  tell her story.   While Judge Kavanaugh attempted the other day to walk back his words  in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, the damage he had done was  irreversible. If he is confirmed, hundreds of people who go before the  Supreme Court and the millions of Americans whose lives will be  affected by his decisions will believe that Judge Kavanaugh has already  put his hands on the scales of Justice before they have had their say  in court.   That is why hundreds of law professors, Jesuits, and personal friends  withdrew their previous support for his nomination after his statement  at that hearing. That is why the American Bar Association has called a  meeting to reconsider its endorsement, and that is why former Justice  John Paul Stevens took the extraordinary step of saying that Judge  Kavanaugh was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court of the United  States.   It didn't have to be this way. The process was flawed from the start,  and it got worse as time went on. It started when President Trump  contracted out the process of picking a Supreme Court nominee to  rightwing groups like the Federalist Society and the Heritage  Foundation. During his campaign, candidate Trump said he was going to  pick Supreme Court nominees based not on who would be impartial, based  not on who would be independent but based on who would do his bidding  on certain issues. He had a number of litmus tests.   For example, during the campaign, when talking about the Affordable  Care Act, candidate Trump promised that, unlike Chief Justice Roberts,  his nominee would ``do the right thing'' and get rid of the Affordable  Care Act. The Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation didn't  need much coaxing, but they dutifully compiled lists of names of people  to fit the bill. Judge Kavanaugh fit the bill, and he fit the bill  according to his own former law clerks.   One of his former law clerks wrote an article entitled ``Brett  Kavanaugh Said ObamaCare was Unprecedented and Unlawful'' in order to  assure people that Judge Kavanaugh would be the Justice Kavanaugh to  undo the protections of the Affordable Care Act. Another one of Judge  Kavanaugh's own law clerks said that no other contender on President  Trump's list is on record so vigorously criticizing the Affordable Care  Act. These are Judge Kavanaugh's law clerks.   We all know that the case of Texas v. United States, which threatens  to take away protections for millions of people with preexisting  conditions, is currently making its way through our Federal courts as  we gather here today. It was filed by a group of 20 Republican  attorneys general. The Trump administration decided not to defend the  current law and decided not to defend the Affordable Care Act, and he  said to these Republican attorneys general to have at it--to get rid of  the Affordable Care Act.   We know that the Texas case is very likely to end up in the Supreme  Court of the United States. In Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump has his  man, according to Judge Kavanaugh's own law clerks, to rule against the  Affordable Care Act--in doing so, stripping millions of Americans from  their protections for preexisting health conditions.   On the issue of a woman's right to reproductive freedom and choice,  Candidate Trump promised he would appoint a Justice to take those  rights away. Specifically, he said overturning Roe ``will happen  automatically, in my opinion, because I am appointing pro-life justices  on the court.'' Again, he found his man in Judge Kavanaugh, and we have  Judge Kavanaugh's own law clerks saying as much.   In a July 3, 2018, National Review article, one of his former clerks  wrote: ``No court-of-appeals judge in the nation has a stronger, more  consistent record of enforcing restrictions on abortion.''   Now, at the confirmation hearing, we all heard Judge Kavanaugh say  that Roe v. Wade was an important precedent, and he said to some  Senators that it was settled law. We know from many Republican judicial  nominees who have testified before the Senate about settled law that as  soon as they have gotten on the Supreme Court, it has no longer been  settled. In fact, Judge Kavanaugh, before he was a judge, said himself  in a 2003 memo that came to light: ``I am not sure that all legal  scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme  Court level since the Court can always overrule its precedent''--a  clear indication of where Judge Kavanaugh's reasoning lies, especially  in light of the testimony from his own law clerks.    If you look at other parts of his record, you will find that Judge  Kavanaugh consistently rules in favor of powerful special interests and  against the public interest. He has sided with those who want to lift  all of the restrictions on political campaign expenditures. In one  opinion, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that PACs are constitutionally entitled  to raise and spend unlimited money in support of candidates for elected  office because it was ``implausible'' that contributions to independent  groups could corrupt candidates.   Those million-dollar expenditures on behalf of candidates have no  impact on the thinking of those candidates once they are elected. This  is according to Judge Kavanaugh and, of course, according to the  Citizens United decision. In fact, Judge Kavanaugh has been  [[Page S6684]]  credited by one campaign finance expert as ``the man who created the  super-PAC.''   Judge Kavanaugh has gone further. He has even suggested that limits  on direct contributions to candidates are unconstitutional. Back in  March of 2002, in an email, he wrote: ``I have heard very few people  say that the limits on contributions to candidates are  unconstitutional, although I, for one, tend to think those limits have  some constitutional problems.''   We can see that if it is Justice Kavanaugh, not only will he double  down on Citizens United, which says that corporations can spend  unlimited amounts of money, including unlimited amounts of secret  money, but he will question the constitutionality of putting limits not  only on independent expenditures but on direct contributions to  candidates.   We know Judge Kavanaugh was also the pick for those who want  corporate power to trump workers' rights, consumers' rights, and  environmental protections. The day that Judge Kavanaugh was nominated  for the Supreme Court, the White House circulated a letter to corporate  leaders that touted the fact that he would protect their interests. The  White House proudly noted that he had overruled Federal regulators 75  times on cases involving clean air, consumer protections, net  neutrality, and other issues.   When it comes to workers' rights, Judge Kavanaugh has routinely sided  with corporations that want to prevent workers from unionizing, even at  President Trump's own hotel in Atlantic City, which at the time had  admitted its refusal to bargain with workers in a 2012 case.   When the card dealers across several hotels voted to unionize, Judge  Kavanaugh and a panel of judges invalidated the will of the workers,  overturned an administrative law judge's ruling that the union be  certified, and allowed the Trump hotel to continue violating workers'  rights.   On environmental issues, Judge Kavanaugh's record shows that time and  again, he favors polluters over clean water and clean air. With his  confirmation, it will be much harder for Americans to seek redress in  the courts, and it will be easier for polluters to continue to pollute  the environment. As a circuit court judge, he has written 10 dissenting  opinions in environmental cases, and in each one, he has argued against  the side that sought to protect the public health and the environment.   Judge Kavanaugh's sweeping view of executive power should cause alarm  among every Member of this Senate, Republican and Democrat alike. We  have all heard the testimony, and we have seen the writings. It appears  to be no surprise that President Trump, who is watching that Mueller  investigation get closer and closer to his doorstep, would want a judge  who will give excessive deference to the executive branch--somebody who  may be on the Supreme Court when that Court has to decide whether or  not President Trump can be subpoenaed in that case or otherwise or be  brought to justice in that case, if that is what the conclusions  demand.   It is clear on all of these issues that President Trump and the  Republicans had their man in Judge Kavanaugh. They have someone they  believe will overturn the Affordable Care Act, once again giving  insurance companies a green light to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions.    They think they have someone who will overturn Roe v. Wade or  dramatically limit a woman's right to reproductive freedom and choice;  someone who will gut environmental regulations, undermine workers'  rights, and consumer protections; someone who will give corporations  the ability to continue to spend unlimited amounts of money in  elections and who might even argue that the contribution limits to  candidates are unconstitutional and can be limited; and, finally,  someone the President believes will get him off the hook if the Mueller  investigation gets too close to him.   So here we had Republicans in this Senate and a President on the  verge of getting someone they thought could do all of those things, and  then something unexpected happened: The country learned about what  happened to Dr. Ford.   Our Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten that Dr. Ford did  not want to come publicly to report her sexual assault. It was only  when she found out that Judge Kavanaugh was on the second short list  that was released that she became concerned. Even then, she didn't want  to come forward publicly. But she thought it was her civic duty to let  people know what had happened to her, so she reached out to her  Representative in Congress on a confidential basis.   The story did become public, and when it did, she felt dutybound to  testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and tell Senators what  happened to her on that awful day. We all know she had nothing to gain.  She has been subjected to all sorts of awful death threats and other  kinds of verbal abuse. She had nothing to gain and everything to lose.   Our Republican Senators who listened to her testimony, for the most  part, said that her testimony was both powerful and credible; we know  she answered questions directly. By contrast, Judge Kavanaugh's  testimony was partisan, evasive, and, on many points, even under oath,  untruthful.   When the female prosecutor Republicans hired to ask questions for  them could not discredit Dr. Ford's testimony, we saw many of our  Republican colleagues launch into full partisan attack mode; no longer  did the facts matter. They picked up on Judge Kavanaugh's opening  statement about partisanship rather than seeking to get to the truth  about what happened to Dr. Ford and others who have alleged sexual  assault.   What mattered was ramming through their nominee. The majority leader,  Senator McConnell, said they would ``plow right through'' and, by God,  nothing was going to stop them. They even scheduled the vote on Judge  Kavanaugh before they had heard the testimony about sexual abuse and  sexual assault from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.   It was only when Senator Flake recognized what a sham the process was  that he at least forced the Republican leadership to do what they did  not want to do and agree to a short FBI investigation into the  allegations of Dr. Ford and Deborah Ramirez, but the goal never  changed. The goal of ramming through the nomination never changed.   That is why Senate Republicans and the White House dramatically  limited the scope of the FBI investigation. They tied the hands of the  FBI. They told the FBI whom they could interview. The investigation  that was already going to be short at about a week was cut even shorter  and was finished up in a matter of days.   What is the result? The result is completely predictable. The result  is we have lots of key witnesses who were not interviewed who say they  have corroborating evidence to support the allegations of Dr. Ford and  Deborah Ramirez. The country will continue to hear from these witnesses  after today's vote.   Because the investigation was orchestrated by the White House and the  Senate Republican leadership, the FBI was not allowed to do its full  job. It would have been better for all parties involved--and I mean all  parties, including Judge Kavanaugh--to have had a thorough  investigation where, at the end of the day, the public could have  confidence that all of the available evidence could have been tracked  down and reviewed. That would have been best for the integrity of the  Court and the integrity of the Senate.   We all know there is no requirement that we rush this confirmation.  We all know that. After all, it was the Republican leader who kept a  seat open on the Supreme Court for months and months and months after  President Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland. So this notion  that there is some kind of artificial deadline is simply untrue. This  is all being done, as the majority leader said, to ``plow right  through.''   Taking time to do the investigation right would have put the entire  enterprise at risk--the entire plan to put on the Supreme Court the  person President Trump and Republicans believe will deliver the legal  outcomes they want. Even if all of the testimony shows he can no longer  be impartial, in this case, his record and testimony indicate that he  will deliver the legal outcomes they want.  [[Page S6685]]    Dr. Ford's courage in coming forward and telling what happened to her  has empowered many of my Maryland constituents and many others around  the country to come forward with their own stories of abuse.   I have received written statements from over 50 Marylanders--over 50  Marylanders--telling me about the sexual abuse they had encountered.  Some of them told me they have shared with me what they have not shared  with their own family members. They felt it was important that I know  why they did not report their abuse at the time, why they did not tell  their parents, and why their memories were not perfect decades later.   They told me what they do remember. They told me they remember the  clothing they wore the day they were assaulted. They told me they  remember the scent, the cologne, and the feeling of unwanted hands.  Those memories haunt them.    These stories are reminders of how our society has let down survivors  of sexual assault for decades. The way that these survivors have been  treated has been shameful. I am humbled by the trust they have shown in  sharing these experiences with me, and I will let the stories of a few  of them speak for themselves here on the floor of the Senate.   Here is what one woman wrote:         Once [when] I was 16, I was at a party. There was alcohol.       He was popular, I wasn't. He was big and strong, I have never       been. He threatened me afterwards. He needn't have bothered.       He told me no one would believe me. He told me I wanted it. I       showed a friend the bruises. He said everyone would say I was       a slut. I told another friend I was frightened. She said I       should just avoid him in school. I told an adult I trusted at       my job. She told me about how when she reported when she was       young, how the police treated her, how her parents reacted.       How she regretted saying anything. I never told my parents. I       went to a free clinic and the ``therapist'' asked how could I       know it was rape if I had been drinking.    Those are the powerful words from one Marylander.   Another wrote:         I remember the assault vividly. I was on my way home from       church. I don't remember the sermon before. Details are       fuzzy. But I remember the assault. I remember looking at a       nearby home where I knew elderly people lived. I could see       that their TV was on and I wondered, ``Would they even hear       me scream?'' I didn't tell people. I didn't think people       would believe me.    Another constituent wrote me this quickly, without editing. She told  me she cried when she read it to her husband. Here is what she wrote:         Having experience in working with victims in a       prosecutorial manner, or as a judge, or even defending the       accused does not make you an expert. The expert is the       victim. I am that victim. I am that expert. And as such I can       tell you absolutely, without hesitation, that what haunts you       most, what affects how you relate in the future with your       loving spouse, what affects how you feel about yourself, and       what affects even your sense of smell, is the memory of the       person who abused you. Not the address where it took place,       not the time on the clock, not the day of the week--but the       smell of the person assaulting you, the feel of their hands,       the confusion in your head because you don't know what is       happening because it's all happening so fast, and yes--their       name. You never forget their name.    She went on to say:         Then comes the shame. What did I do to cause this? What       will people think of me now because I've been touched, I've       been tarnished, I'm not pure. Will I be believed? At this       point my life has already been altered beyond repair, but       it's an internal alter. If I talk, it alters my external       world as well. Maybe it's better to just not talk because       then at least I can pretend things are as they have always       been. I can just pretend that I'm exactly the same person--      but I'm not.    Another wrote that she understood that a man could move on from  assaulting a woman particularly if they were drunk at the time. She  said:         The man who assaulted me later acted as if he was catching       up with an old friend and had no memory of the event. I have       several friends who have experienced the same thing.    Another echoed a similar experience, writing:         He had been drinking heavily with friends at a restaurant       or bar. I had not. Later that night, he raped [me]. He was       very inebriated and displayed a complete personality change.       He was violent and angry and did not even seem to see me. I       was paralyzed and probably saved my own life by not fighting       back as he had essentially become a rabid animal. The next       day I confronted him about what happened and he had no memory       of the crime he committed.    These are not isolated incidents for survivors. As I have said, I  have gotten over 50--over 50--personal testimonials from survivors  since Dr. Ford had the courage to come forward. These are people who  have not shared what happened to them with some of their closest  friends or family members. These are stains etched in their memories.  Many of them never told a soul. Others were ignored or dismissed when  they brought up these awful experiences and were told to stay quiet.   It is an insult to these survivors when some have called them  partisan. In many cases, they went out of their way in their messages  to me to say their concerns had nothing to do with ideology or  partisanship--nothing. Some told me they are Republicans, and others  are Independents. Some of them grew up in families who had no care  about politics. Others told me they were Democrats but they would be  more than willing to accept a different, conservative judge--but not  this one.   When Donald Trump went to a campaign rally and mocked Dr. Ford, he  mocked every one of those 50 survivors who wrote to me. He mocked every  survivor of sexual abuse around the country. And this Senate's decision  to do as the majority leader said, ``plow right through'' without  undertaking a thorough and serious investigation into the charges from  Dr. Ford, Deborah Ramirez, that also disrespects these survivors. That  is what they say to me.   Of course, Judge Kavanaugh did the same thing in his opening  statement at his most recent hearing because his entire opening  statement suggested that Dr. Ford's coming forward was part of some  political conspiracy. Unfortunately, that is where this conversation  has gone ever since--not an effort to really get to the truth, to  really get all the facts but just to do what the majority leader said  before she even testified: ``Plow right through.''   We know that etched above the Supreme Court are the words ``Equal  Justice Under Law.'' It does not say ``plow right through.''   The decision to ``plow right through'' will undermine and haunt the  integrity of the Supreme Court for decades to come, and it will also  haunt and undermine the integrity of this U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.
