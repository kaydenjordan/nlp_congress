 Madam Speaker, with regard to what is going on in  Ukraine, I stand with everybody in saying it is an absolutely horrific  [[Page H1259]]  thing. If the United States can keep Ukraine and free Ukraine, that is  what we should all be hoping and praying for.   We heard a speech last night, in addition to the very relevant  numbers, and in addition to the numbers of people dying in Ukraine and  the people being injured, we cannot forget that every month in America  another 90,000 people cross our southern border. We cannot forget that  every month in America 8,000 more people die of drug overdoses. We  cannot forget in America, compared to 3 years ago, we deport, every  month, approximately 6,000 less people from this country for committing  crimes.   Madam Speaker, I realize a lot is going on around the world and it is  easy to forget about it, but America should not allow its politicians  to forget about this huge sea of people crossing the border and the  huge number of people dying of drug overdoses and the broken hearts of  their parents, their siblings, and their children.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to comment a little bit on  the speech last night and some of the issues that have been ignored and  should be addressed and some of the issues that were given such short  shrift it was almost comical.   The first issue I would like to address is inflation. Next time I  should get my own billboard here. But if you look at M2, which is one  measure of the monetary supply, in the 1970s--and I am old enough to  remember the 1970s when inflation was really a horrible thing and  something that we were never supposed to repeat--M2 was going up at a  rate of about 7 percent year over year. We now are up about 37 percent  year over year.    I mean, if you look at a graph, it is shocking the degree to which  the Federal Reserve is just flooding money into our system. Of course,  a major reason why they have had to do this is wildly excessive  spending, because if you have excessive spending and foreign  governments do not want to buy your debt, and who would want to buy  your debt, you wind up with no alternative but to degrade the value of  the dollar.   I thought it was particularly amazing that the President said or told  businesses that you have to ``lower your costs,'' meaning that we  shouldn't reduce wages, which is fine, but like it is an easy thing to  lower your costs. I wonder, has President Biden ever actually talked to  the businesses who are raising their prices?   The first thing I hear about is the metals, the aluminum, the  different kinds of steel that are up 300, 400, 500 percent. When the  market, the cost of these things go up to that degree, and you are a  businessman, what in the world are you supposed to do?   The cost of transportation is going up, and the amount we pay  truckers, which is a tremendously good occupation, has gone up.  Sometimes you can't even get trucks. And what has President Biden done?  He imposes a vaccine mandate on truckers, which further reduces the  supply of an occupation that is already in demand, thereby guaranteeing  the cost is going to continue to go up even more.   I strongly encourage President Biden to have some of his staff run  around Washington, D.C., or maybe run around and talk to some of the  factory owners in this country and ask them or advise them what they  are supposed to do to ``lower their costs.'' Most of them, because we  have a shortage of people working, are already probably exceeding last  year's output in product. Despite the fact that they are doing that,  and so, therefore, they are getting more per hour worked, but they  can't find any new ways to reduce costs.                                time  1830    But, again, I hope President Biden sends some of his cabinet members  around the country and either advises them on how it is going to be  easy to lower your costs or hears from them how impossible it is for  them to lower their costs.   By the way, every single manufacturer I have talked to in the last 2  months--and I bet I have talked to 15, 20--every one of them thinks  inflation is going to get worse. When I talk to farmers who use a  variety of fertilizers, whatever, that goes into their product, they  see the costs going through the roof. And every single farmer I talk to  thinks inflation is going to get worse.   So I strongly encourage the Biden administration to have some people  get out there among the hoi polloi and find out what is really going on  with regard to inflation.   Next, President Biden talked about the police. And maybe President  Biden doesn't realize what the problem he and his allies have created  by going after the police. In Milwaukee, the city just to the south of  my district, there was a dramatic increase to an all-time record high  number of murders in 2020, something that you never thought you would  see again, and it was exceeded again in 2021.   Why is that happening? It is because President Biden and his allies  have adopted an antipolice rhetoric, in particular implying an amount  of racism out there, and they are pushing a bill that has already been  through this House, a bill that will make it much easier to hire a  policeman.   Now, if a policeman wants to do his job, sometimes they have to  arrest people, sometimes they have to wrestle with people. If you can  wind up being sued, you are much less likely to want to do that. And  when you have police that are less engaged, particularly in our busiest  cities, what are you going to get? More crime. We cannot say we are  serious about the spiraling number of people who are being shot to  death or stabbed to death in this country until we allow the police to  be police again. We have got to stop that police hatred that goes on.   And I don't care whether we eventually send a few hundred million  dollars around the country to hire more police or whatever President  Biden has up his sleeve, what we have got to do is we have got to build  respect for police again so that they are free to maintain the safety  in this country.   The third thing I will look at that I thought, again, was misleading  to the public, concerns election laws. Many States, including  Wisconsin, have a photo ID law. President Biden and his acolytes imply  that a photo ID law is motivated by racism. Again, this is  unnecessarily divisive.   One of the reasons why I feel that Joe Biden is the most divisive  President in my lifetime, I have praised him for his speech last night  in which he didn't call this country racist after using the racial word  or white supremacy so much in his inaugural speech; nevertheless, it is  a little bit ridiculous when in order to have fair elections some of us  want to have photo ID and then people stand around when photo ID is  needed for things that probably have a much more dramatic impact on the  average person's life, but it doesn't bother them.   We had a requirement here in town that you present proof of vaccine  with which you had to produce a photo ID, if you wanted to go to a  restaurant in this town. I would say it is a fairly significant thing.  Did anybody say that the District of Columbia was being racist because  they required a photo ID if I want to eat at a restaurant?   They want to look at my ID before I get in an airplane. If I had to  fly somewhere to get some surgery, if I had to fly somewhere to see an  ailing relative, that could be a real life-changing experience. Does  anybody say, oh, it is racist to require a photo ID if I got on an  airplane? We just put up with this routinely.   Nevertheless, President Biden fans the flames of division by claiming  that those of us who want to make sure that we have fair elections are  motivated by racism when photo IDs are needed so commonly.   The next thing I want to point out that I think he gave short shrift  to with an insultingly small amount of time was the huge number of  people who are dying of drug overdoses in this country.  [[Page H1267]]    I got this job only 7 years ago. At the time, 47,000 people a year  died of drug overdoses. By comparison, in 12 years during the Vietnam  war, 57,000 people died. And every politician was supposed to talk  about it. Now we shoot up from 47,000 to 100,000 people, and President  Biden can't even bring himself to talk about fentanyl, the drug  responsible for most of those deaths.   I don't know why he wouldn't talk about fentanyl. My guess is because  overwhelmingly it is coming across the southern border, and he doesn't  want to do anything about the southern border. However, I would hope in  the future, President Biden would meet with law enforcement around the  country, find out what it is like to have to tell the parents or  siblings or children of the people who have died that their relative  has died. That is a horrible thing.   And I think to gloss over the 100,000 deaths we have every year in  this country--twice the number of people who died in the 12 years in  Vietnam--was I thought very callous. But, again, I would encourage  President Biden to ask members of his administration to get out and  about a little bit, talk to relatives of people who have died of drug  overdoses, particularly fentanyl, and maybe it will cause him to devote  a little bit more time on that in next year's State of the Union  address when he realizes what a horrible situation we have.   There are many other things that I don't think were addressed  accurately or in depth during the State of the Union address that  should have been.
