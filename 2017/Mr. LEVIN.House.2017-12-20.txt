 Mr. Speaker, if you will listen, this bill is trickle-down  at its worst. Except for the very wealthy trickle, it is, at best, a  trickle; and for millions, not even that; and for the economy at large,  a discredited theory.   It is a deficit time bomb.   The Speaker said to the middle class: Don't worry, the expiring tax  cuts will surely be extended.   That means the real deficit from this bill is $2.5 trillion, a  humongous deficit wrapped in your hypocrisy--in your hypocrisy.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded that they should  address their remarks to the Chair.
