 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time, and  I am proud to rise in support of this strong, bipartisan legislation.   Improving career and technical education programs is the most  important thing Congress can do to help close the skills gap, combat  poverty, and help put Americans back to work.   Studies clearly show that there are unfilled high-wage jobs out there  that remain open because people lack the skills to fill the jobs. That  is where CTE comes in.   When I was chancellor of Alabama's 2-year college system, I saw  firsthand just how impressive these programs are. They really do work  like magic by taking an untrained worker and giving him the skills he  needs to fill an in-demand job. It is a win-win for everyone.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and supporter  of this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  this reform-oriented bill that helps build the 21st century workforce.                                time  1400
