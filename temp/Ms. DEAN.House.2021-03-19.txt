 Mr. Speaker, last week, President Biden signed the American  Rescue Plan. Although the bill received no Republican votes, it has  bipartisan support and will have a long-lasting bipartisan impact.   Many constituents in my district have already received relief checks,  with as many as 90 million stimulus checks out this week.   Yet, this transformative legislation goes even further. It expands  funding to get shots in arms and kids safely in school, and it cuts  child poverty in half with an expanded child tax credit.   Additionally, we finally targeted relief to our local restaurants and  eateries that have been devastated by the pandemic.   Let's not forget about our State and local governments. We will  finally be sending them much-needed aid.   My home State of Pennsylvania will receive more than $13 billion.  Montgomery and Berks Counties, where my district resides, will receive  a combined $242 million.   The American Rescue Plan, and all it provides, is the responsible way  to fully reopen all of our communities and Build Back Better.                            ____________________
