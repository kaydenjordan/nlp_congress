 Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate Mr. Rush yielding  time to me. I also thank him for organizing this Special Order. I thank  my colleague from Chicago, Mr. Davis, for participating, and earlier  today, Andre Carson, a Member from Indianapolis, for also expressing  deep regard for Mayor Hatcher.   Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the gentleman's eloquence in  describing the incredible contribution that Richard Gordon Hatcher made  to our world and, in particular, those most in need. He is absolutely  correct: it certainly transcended the city of Gary and his immediate  responsibilities.   Everyone here knows the vast and immeasurable contributions that  Mayor Hatcher has provided to advance the cause of civil rights and  racial equality in all of our communities and throughout our Nation.   On a personal level, I would note that my father, John Visclosky,  also was mayor of Gary. While the mayors may not have always agreed on  every issue, Mayor Hatcher always treated my father with respect and  grace, and for that, I will always be grateful.   Everyone he met and worked with was treated with similar dignity and  respect.   Mayor Hatcher's value of respect is one we should all strive to  emulate.   It was through this value that he became a trailblazer for the city  of Gary and our Nation. It was also through his selfless leadership and  desire to bring other people along that led to countless other  trailblazers for civil rights.   One of those trailblazers who was inspired by Richard Gordon Hatcher,  as Mr. Rush pointed out so eloquently, was my predecessor from the  First Congressional District of Indiana, Representative Katie Hall.                                time  1845    When Mrs. Hall was sworn into office as U.S. Congressperson from the  First District, she became the first Black woman from Indiana to serve  in the United States House of Representatives. Again, as Mr. Rush  pointed out, there are many more African Americans in this Chamber  today.   Representative Hall was also the Member of Congress who sponsored the  legislation that was signed into law that established Dr. Martin Luther  King's birthday as a Federal holiday. As we take time honoring Dr. King  this month, let us remember that that legislation's sponsor was  mentored by Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher.   As a resident of Gary, I would conclude by saying that I knew Richard  first and foremost as a dedicated husband and a proud and loving father  and grandfather. In his three beloved daughters and six grandchildren,  it is plainly evident that he has instilled his exemplary dedication to  hard work, the value of education, and a commitment to public service.   Again, I appreciate that this time was organized. Let us never lose  sight of the example that Mayor Hatcher provided for all of us to  follow.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.
