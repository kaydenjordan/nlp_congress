 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   My State of Connecticut was still recovering from the 2008 recession,  and now COVID-19 has again thrown it into dire economic straits.   With businesses shuttered from prolonged economic pause, nearly  200,000 Connecticut residents are now forced into unemployment. If we  say we agree on this, then now is the time to create pathways to high- wage employment with long-term prospects. While a 4-year degree is a  great opportunity for many, it cannot be the only option.   I include in the Record a letter in support of the National  Apprenticeship Act from the National Education Association.                                 National Education Association,                                  Washington, DC, November 18, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our 3 million members,       who prepare students across America to pursue fulfilling       careers that support their families and communities, we urge       you to vote YES on the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020       (H.R. 8294). Votes on this issue may be included in the NEA       Report Card for the 116th Congress.        Apprenticeship programs are a key part of the education       landscape, yet the National Apprenticeship Act has not been       significantly updated in the nearly 80 years since it was       signed into law. H.R. 8294 recognizes that programs offering       on-the-job training and mentoring pave the way to successful       careers, and helps bring these programs into the 21st       century. The legislation is particularly timely given rising       joblessness and financial insecurity stemming from the COVID-      19 pandemic.  [[Page H5971]]         The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 would:        Create the Office of Apprenticeship in the U.S. Department       of Labor, with responsibilities including supporting       development of apprenticeship models, providing technical       assistance to state agencies, updating requirements for each       occupation in the program, and determining whether to approve       new occupations for the program;        Codify provisions implemented over the years regarding       registered apprenticeship programs and expand the programs to       new industries;        Amend the existing law to include pre-apprenticeships and       youth apprenticeships; and        Authorize annual grants ranging from $400 million to $800       million to expand apprenticeship programs and encourage       employer participation in them.        The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 recognizes the       value of apprenticeships in supporting the dreams and       ambitions of students of all ages and preparing them for       high-wage careers. We urge you to vote YES on H.R. 8294.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.     Mr. Speaker, the National Apprenticeship Act ensures that  today's workforce can fill the jobs of tomorrow by creating 1 million  apprenticeship opportunities over the next 5 years.   With an average starting salary, after completion, of around $70,000,  registered apprenticeships create the opportunity to attain critical  training while earning an income and incurring little to no student  debt. Apprenticeships also ensure businesses can fill key vacancies  with credentialed, skilled employees--in short, putting people back to  work.   The National Apprenticeship Act will invest in Connecticut workers  and our country's workers and businesses at a time when we need it  most. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
