 Mr. Speaker, my home State of Florida is still  reeling from shock, horror, and sorrow.   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, on a seemingly peaceful Saturday afternoon,  the community of Jacksonville endured an evil attack. I am honored  today to stand with the entire Florida delegation who stands as one  against this evil.   On August 26 in Jacksonville, Florida, three innocent people lost  their lives to an act of hatred at a Dollar General store: Angela  Michelle Carr, 52 years old; Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29 years old;  Anolt Joseph ``A.J.'' Laguerre, Jr., 19 years old.   Angela was a beloved mother and Uber driver, Jerrald was the proud  father of a 4-year-old little girl, and A.J. was a recent high school  graduate. He had just started working at the Dollar General to earn  some extra money.  [[Page H4259]]    They each had individual passions and dreams for the future. Each one  had a spark that will continue to burn bright in the hearts and minds  of those who knew and loved them.   Today, I, and the delegation, join all Floridians in grieving for the  victims and praying for their loved ones.   There are no words, Mr. Speaker, to describe our heartbreak but also  the anger we feel over this racially motivated act of evil. Hate has no  place, nor does it belong in America.   Today, my Florida colleagues and I stand in solidarity with the  Jacksonville community. May their memories be a blessing. May God bless  and comfort the families.   I now ask, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues in the House join us all  for a moment of silence to remember these three individuals.                            ____________________
