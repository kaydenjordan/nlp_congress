 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation,  with my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, that would  reauthorize the only federally funded programs specifically designed to  develop a health provider workforce to care for older Americans. The  Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the Geriatrics  Workforce Enhancement Program, known as GWEP, and also reinstate the  Geriatric Academic Career Awards program, known as GACA.   The number of Americans aged 65 and older is growing rapidly. In  Maine, we are reaching an aging milestone faster than other States--by  2020, the number of seniors is projected to outnumber children. This is  15 years aheadV the national projected date of 2035, at which point the  number of Americans 65 and older will outnumber those under age 18 for  the first time in U.S. history.   The United States is facing a critical shortage of geriatric health  professionals and direct service workers to support our aging  population. Today, we need 20,000 geriatricians; however, fewer than  7,300 of our Nation's nearly one million physicians are board-certified  geriatricians. By 2030, we will need 3.1,000 geriatricians and even  more geriatric health professionals and direct service workers. We need  to train 1,600 geriatricians per year over the next 12 years to reach  the targeted need by 2030.   As many as 90 percent of older adults are expected to have one or  more chronic health conditions. Multiple chronic conditions, multiple  medications, and changes that occur in aging make caring for older  adults complex and challenging, yet also rewarding to healthcare  professionals who choose this specialty. In any given year, it is  expected that 30 percent of older adults and their families will  require specialized geriatric care.   Today there are 44 geriatric workforce enhancement programs or GWEPs  in 29 states. GWEP sites include 25 schools of medicine, ten schools of  nursing, five healthcare facilities, two schools of allied health, a  school of social work, and a certified nurse assistant program. GWEPs  have the flexibility to tailor training in geriatrics to the unique  needs of their own communities.   GWEP programs focus on Geriatric Education by:   1. Changing clinical training environments so that geriatrics is  integrated into primary care delivery systems;   2. Training providers to assess and address the needs of older  adults, their families, and caregivers at multiple levels within their  communities;   3. Delivering community-based programs for patients, families and  caregivers; and   4. Providing Alzheimer's disease education for families and  caregivers, including direct care workers and other providers.   In 2016, the 44 GWEPs produced significant outcomes. They provided  continuing education courses to 94,000 practicing public health  professionals, from disciplines such as medicine, nursing, allied  health, heath services administration, social work, and psychology.  They have also created opportunities for healthcare providers in rural  and underserved areas to learn from and consult with top experts in  geriatric care through tele-consults, and educational webcasts, as well  as online geriatric education programs that are publicly available and  accessible online, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for free.   GACA programs focus on Resource Optimization. Established in 1998,  GACA programs were funded to increase the number of faculty engaged in  geriatric education. Transitioning from clinical training and practice  into an academic faculty role is particularly challenging, and requires  gaining new skills as an educator. These skills are not typically  taught in clinical training programs.   Following a restructuring of the geriatric workforce program, GACA  has gone unfunded since 2015. GACA would be reauthorized as a stand- alone resource within our legislation in order to optimize future  growth and stability of early-career geriatric faculty. GACA supports  early career development for emerging leaders by providing funding that  supports 50 percent of their effort to develop skills as an inter- professional educator in geriatrics.   The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the GWEP  program at $45 million per year over the next five years, and reinstate  GACA at $6 million per year. Together, these programs would train the  current workforce and family caregivers, while simultaneously  developing a cadre of emerging leaders in geriatric education, in a  variety of disciplines. By doing both, we will assure that older  Americans will be cared for by a health care workforce specifically  trained to meet their unique and complex health needs for decades to  come. This training to use the most efficient and effective methods for  older adults will result in improved care while saving valuable  resources, and reducing unnecessary costs.   Exposure to geriatrics, particularly through pre-clinical and  clinical education, has been identified as an important factor for  increasing interest in the field. This exposure provides faculty the  opportunities needed to demonstrate the specialty is a viable, complex,  yet rewarding specialty. The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would  provide these critical platforms by creating the infrastructure needed  to attract the best and the brightest into the field of geriatrics.   This legislation already has broad support. I ask to enter into the  record a letter of support from the National Association for Geriatric  Education and the National Association of Geriatric Education Centers.   Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation that would ensure geriatric education for our current  workforce, while optimizing resources to bolster academic careers in  geriatrics. Together, GWEP and GACA would develop a high-quality  geriatric workforce ready to provide care for Americans as we grow  older.           National Association for Geriatric Education, National             Association of Geriatric Education Centers,                                                      May 21, 2018.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Casey: On behalf       of the HRSA Title VII and Title VIII funded Geriatrics       Workforce Enhancement Programs (GWEPs) across the country,       thank you for your past support of geriatric education and       for introducing the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act. The       National Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is       pleased to offer our support for this important legislation,       which will reauthorize the GWEP and once again make the       Geriatrics Academic Career Award program (GACA) a part of the       effort  [[Page S2796]]       to prepare the geriatrics workforce for the aging of our       population. We and the growing numbers of older adults,       caregivers, and clinicians caring for elders will urge       Congress to move quickly to pass your bill and provide the       resources to address our nation's growing demand for       geriatric care.        We appreciate the many discussions that your staff       facilitated with NAGE, as well as with the Eldercare       Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, and The       Gerontological Society of America during the process of       developing this legislation. This authorization and related       funding is needed for the development of a health care       workforce specifically trained to care for older adults and       to support their family caregivers. Currently there are only       44 GWEP sites in 29 states. The modest increase in the       authorization in your bill will have an important impact on       training in geriatric care. Likewise, the funds you have       authorized for the GACA program will assist in ensuring that       rural and underserved areas will have geriatrics education       programs.        NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing       GWEP sites, Centers on Aging, and Geriatric Education Centers       that provide education and training to health professionals       in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to       help America's healthcare workforce be better prepared to       render age-appropriate care to today's older Americans and       those of tomorrow.        Thank you for your continued support for geriatric       education programs.            Sincerely,      Maura Brennan, MD, FACP, AGSF, FAAHPM, CHMD,        President NAGE/NAGEC; Project Director, Baystate Health,       Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program; Chief, Div. of       Geriatrics, Palliative Care & Post-Acute Medicine; Prof. of       Medicine, Univ. of Massachusetts-Baystate; Adjunct Prof. of       Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine.                                   ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. King, and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 2890.
