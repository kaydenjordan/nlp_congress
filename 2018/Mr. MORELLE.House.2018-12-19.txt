 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Connie  Mitchell, an iconic civil rights activist and leader in the Rochester  community, who passed away on December 14.   Connie dedicated her life to the pursuit of equality and racial  justice, and her commitment to breaking down barriers was truly awe  inspiring. She was the first African American woman elected to office  in Monroe County, winning a seat on the board of supervisors in 1961.  She was a role model in the fight for equality. Her contributions  helped to open the door of opportunity for so many people in our  community.   I join all of Rochester in mourning her passing and extend my prayers  and deepest sympathies to the entire Mitchell family.                            ____________________
