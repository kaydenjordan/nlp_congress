 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Mr. Jim Smith, a dedicated community advocate, a mentor, and the  Father of Gay Pride on Staten Island.   Jim was the consummate Staten Islander. As a kid, he was the Staten  Island Advance paperboy and a standout at Curtis High School. He went  on to serve his country in the Coast Guard and honored his fellow  veterans by bringing home a Vietnam memorial to West Brighton.   But he is best known as one of the founders of Staten Island's Pride  Center, where he spent years opening hearts and minds to the idea that  love is love. So, it is only fitting that Jim left us on the 51st  anniversary of Stonewall, leaving behind countless Staten Islanders  whose lives are better for having known him.   Today, we honor his incredible life, and I hope next year we can  honor him one last time when he looks down and sees the Pride Center  finally marching down Forest Avenue in our St. Patrick's Day parade.                            ____________________
