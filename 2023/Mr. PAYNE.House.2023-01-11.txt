 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Republican  decision to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics.   It is an independent, nonpartisan office that reviews allegations of  ethics violations by congressional Members.   It is a watchdog that makes sure that this Chamber operates in the  best interests of the American people.   The Republicans voted to take control of it so they can limit  investigations of Republican Members.   Republicans claim to represent Americans, yet the first acts were not  to help the working American families.   Instead, they weakened the governmental oversight of their actions,  all done to make sure that they can abuse their power and push an  unpopular agenda on the American people.   It is a disgraceful action that reveals the anti-American nature of  the Republican Party today.                            ____________________
