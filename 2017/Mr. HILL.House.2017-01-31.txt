 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  one of Arkansas's great leaders and a dear friend, former State Senator  Stanley Russ, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 86.   Born and raised in Conway, Arkansas, Stanley served in the U.S. Army  during the Korean war before becoming a State senator for 25 years.   Stanley received numerous awards for his work, including being named  of one of the Ten Outstanding State Legislators in the United States by  the Assembly of State Governmental Employees. He also received the  Distinguished Service Award from the Conway Chamber of Commerce and was  elected into the Arkansas Tech University Hall of Distinction as well  as the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame.   Our State and Faulkner County will miss Stanley's smile, his  enthusiasm and ability to get things done to enrich the lives of all  Arkansans.   I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family and loved  ones.                            ____________________
