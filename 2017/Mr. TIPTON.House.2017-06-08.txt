 Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for  offering the legislation under consideration today.   The Financial CHOICE Act takes the necessary steps in reforming the  supervision of our financial system that the Dodd-Frank Act failed to  do. Among other provisions, this legislation requires financial  regulatory agencies to tailor regulatory actions to fit the risk  profile and business model of supervised institutions. Not only will  this ensure appropriately tailored compliance obligations for banks and  credit unions of various risk profiles, but it saves valuable time and  resources for bank examiners.   As it stands now, community banks are facing an ever-increasing  regulatory burden that they can no longer shoulder. This has had a  devastating impact on small banks, forcing consolidation or failure and  stifling the creation of new banks in areas that need access to credit.   In December 2015, a report by the Dallas Fed highlighted this  problem, noting that the regulatory environment tends to be one-size- fits-all and concluding that the regulatory oversight should match the  risk level an institution poses to the financial system and the economy  at large.   The CHOICE Act will stop the trend of increasing compliance costs and  decreasing financial services.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) for his  tireless efforts on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support  it.
