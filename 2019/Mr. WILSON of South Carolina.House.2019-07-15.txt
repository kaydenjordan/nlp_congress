 Madam Speaker, last week, House  Democrats had the chance to bring the Military Surviving Spouses Equity  Act on the floor to repeal the widow's tax.   Roll Call described, today, the bill as a ``broadly supported  bipartisan bill'' with 365 cosponsors. This was the first legislation  to achieve the Consensus Calendar and would have received a standalone  vote, having 86 percent cosponsorship.   Roll Call said: ``Wilson's bill, the Military Surviving Spouses  Equity Act, would end a disparity between government payments made to  surviving spouses of servicemembers who die on Active Duty.   ``The `widow's tax' . . . requires the surviving spouses to forfeit  much of their DOD Survivor Benefit Plan annuity when they receive  Dependency and Indemnity Compensation from the VA.   ``The Rules Committee did not give Wilson a heads-up that they were  going to put language in the NDAA rules to remove his bill from the  Consensus Calendar.''   This was a partisan political gimmick. It is not too late to bring it  back up as a standalone bill to help the spouses.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.  [[Page H5780]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 441, Condemning the  attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires in July  1994, authored by Mr. Deutch of Florida.   In July 1994, a terrorist tied to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah  carried out a murderous bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center in  Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 85 innocent people and injuring  hundreds more.   Unfortunately, 25 years later, the cowardly perpetrators of this  attack have evaded justice due to a series of coverups and a botched  investigation. This reminds us that terrorism is a continuing threat in  our hemisphere and that we must always be vigilant.   This important resolution condemns the attack, expresses concern over  the continued delay in the resolution of the case, and it encourages  accountability for those responsible.   The resolution also recognizes a series of critical events, including  the mysterious death of the lead prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, who  formally accused the Government of Iran and Hezbollah for their role  and implicated the Fernandez Kirchner government in negotiating  immunity for the Iranian suspects.   This resolution demonstrates our commitment to supporting the  Government of Argentina, one of our great regional partners, in finding  justice for the victims and their families, and combating the continued  threat of terrorism in our hemisphere.   I was grateful to work with my colleague, Mr. Deutch, the chairman of  the Middle East, North Africa, and International Terrorism  Subcommittee, on this important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution condemning the  attacks on peaceful protestors and supporting an immediate peaceful  transition to a civilian-led democratic government in Sudan. I thank  Congressman Kildee, Congressman Bilirakis, and Chairman Engel for their  leadership on this issue.   For months, thousands of Sudanese peacefully took to the streets to  protest the brutal and oppressive dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir. In  April, he was removed from office.   I condemn the brutal attacks against peaceful protestors that took  place on June 3. Over 120 people were killed, and hundreds more were  wounded. The security forces responsible for carrying out and  orchestrating these heinous attacks must be held accountable.   While we are hopeful that the July 5 agreement on the composition of  a transitional government will be officially signed and set into  motion, there is still much more to be done to advance a true civilian- led democracy. We cannot tolerate spoilers of this process,  particularly those who look to support the status quo and the military  regime in Khartoum.   I support the diplomatic efforts of Special Envoy Booth and commend  President Donald Trump's administration for convening high-level  working groups to align other countries in supporting a peaceful and  democratic future for Sudan. We must continue our engagement at the  highest levels to stand with the Sudanese people and their struggle for  freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the primary Republican  cosponsor of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank my colleagues for offering  this timely resolution to condemn the brutal attacks on peaceful  protesters and stand in solidarity with the people of Sudan.   The United States must continue our efforts to support a civilian-led  democratic government in Sudan and take action against those who wish  to undermine the will of the Sudanese people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to condemn  dangerous threats to freedom of the press and freedom of expression  around the world, understanding that the media has a responsibility of  fairness without bias and an independent media is a cornerstone of an  educated society and a necessary pillar to a healthy democracy.   Unfortunately, freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not  protected in many countries.   Dictators fear anything that challenges their power. They go to great  lengths to restrict the rights of their citizens and control their own  people. They attack human rights activists and protesters who march in  the street.   The last thing that a tyrant wants is to be exposed as a corrupt and  immoral leader. As a result, they intimidate, arrest, and sometimes  kill members of the media for doing their jobs.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 251 reporters  worldwide were being held in prison in 2018. More than half of them  were being held in Turkey, China, and Egypt.   Last year, over 54 journalists were killed in the line of duty.  Thirty-four of them were murder victims.   Of course, sadly, we are all familiar with the heinous killing of  Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who was murdered  by Saudi agents.   These crimes are completely unacceptable. Republicans and Democrats  stand together as Americans in condemning foreign governments that  attack journalists and crack down on press freedoms.   This resolution allows us to speak in a unified voice to express our  support for those who want to report the news without fearing for their  lives. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairman Schiff and Congressman  Chabot for their bipartisan work on this issue. The United States must  continue to provide a strong voice for a free press and independent  media across the globe emphasizing fairness. Supporting a free press  must remain an essential part of America's foreign policy, and I urge  all Members to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2037, the Saudi Arabia  Human Rights and Accountability Act.   The killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist and  former diplomatic adviser, was a hideous and gruesome crime. The United  States must ensure that everyone involved in this appalling human  rights violation must be identified and held accountable.   Intimidation and violence by any government against peaceful dissent  must be met with strong disapproval by responsible nations. If we do  not respond forcefully to this brutal attack,  [[Page H5799]]  we invite future violations of international norms. Peaceful dissidents  all over the world are watching us, waiting to see if we will stand up  for their cause.   That is why I am grateful to support H.R. 2037, which requires a  report to identify those responsible for this heinous assault and  blocks visas for those directly involved with this murder. We cannot  have business as usual with those who carried out an extrajudicial  murder in cold blood. They should not get to come to the United States  and pretend like nothing happened.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their commitment  to ensuring that Jamal is not forgotten. He deserves justice, and his  family deserves justice.   I thank the chairman and Mr. Malinowski for working to ensure that  even as we press for accountability, we can continue diplomatic  engagements with our partner of Saudi Arabia. These diplomatic  engagements are crucial in pushing for human rights improvements  mutually beneficial to our Saudi allies, such as the release of  wrongfully detained Americans and other matters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to, once again, thank Chairman  Engel and the Committee on Foreign Affairs' membership for their  bipartisan work to respond to the terrible injustice of Jamal  Khashoggi's murder.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 129, Condemning the  Government of Saudi Arabia's Continued Detention and Alleged Abuse of  Women's Rights Activists.   Last year, we were all heartened by the news that Saudi Arabia was  planning to lift its longstanding ban on women driving. We hoped that  this would be a sign that the kingdom would finally shed its  notoriously harsh policies toward women, such as the guardianship  system under which women cannot make decisions without the permission  of a male relative.   Tragically, we were mistaken. The kingdom has detained and reportedly  tortured several of the activists who had long campaigned for more  rights for women, including the right to drive. While some of these  activists have been temporarily released, they continue to face trial  for their peaceful protests.   This resolution calls on Saudi Arabia to release these peaceful  activists and to hold accountable those who tortured them. It also  calls on Saudi Arabia to end the guardianship system.   We welcomed reports from the past week that Saudi Arabia may loosen a  few select restrictions within the guardianship system, but it is far  past time for women in Saudi Arabia to make their own decisions about  their lives.   The United States has a responsibility to advocate for human rights  all over the world, including the right for peaceful dissent.   While we value our strategic partnership and alliance with Saudi  Arabia, our partnership does not let the kingdom off the hook for  abuses of fundamental human rights.   Today, the United States House of Representatives calls on Saudi  Arabia to do better, to treat its women as citizens with full and equal  rights, and to release and exonerate the peaceful dissidents who have  long campaigned for human rights, including the rights of women.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank Chairman Engel,  Representative Frankel, Representative Wagner, and the Foreign Affairs  Committee members for their bipartisan work to advocate on behalf of  the women of Saudi Arabia, including human rights activists.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to prioritize the  targeting of wildlife traffickers as part of the Department of State's  Rewards for Justice Program.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Buchanan) for leading this  important bill and also Chairman Engel for bringing this bill to the  floor.   This legislation would give explicit authority to offer financial  rewards for information pertaining to the capture or conviction of  high-profile wildlife traffickers around the world. This is a powerful  tool for Federal law enforcement to target those who engage in wildlife  trafficking.   Illicit wildlife trade is a multibillion-dollar industry. This funds  terrorists and criminal networks around the world, destabilizing  countries and stripping communities of valuable economic resources.   We know that the criminals that poach and then traffic wildlife  products are the same people and networks that traffic weapons, drugs,  and people.   Our ability to crack down on illicit funding streams for criminal and  terrorist networks is critical to U.S. national security interests in  the global war on terrorism.   We must ensure that the State Department and our law enforcement  personnel have the tools they need to combat this horrible trade.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
