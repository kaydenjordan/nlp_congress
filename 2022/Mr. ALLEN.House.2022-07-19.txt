 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of my amendments  on this en bloc package.   Let's review our Nation's fiscal trajectory here. Our Nation is over  $30 trillion in debt. American families are dealing with record  inflation, in large part due to unprecedented Federal spending.  [[Page H6839]]    What does the other side want to do? Spend more money, which will  make inflation worse.   This time last year, the President told us inflation was temporary  when the rate was just over 5 percent. Fast forward 12 months, and  inflation in this country has skyrocketed to 9 percent. This bill  spends almost 14 percent over last year's spending levels.   If adopted, my three amendments would reduce spending by a modest 5  percent in Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Financial  Services and General Government, and Department of the Interior,  environment divisions of this spending package.   This amendment should be an easy one for everyone to support. Look at  the American people. Don't you think they have cut their expenses much  more than 5 percent because of inflation? Are we going to respond to  them like this? Yet, Democrats oppose those cuts.    Every time I am in the district, I hear about the cost of food, the  price of gas, and how the other side's failed fiscal policies are  harming American families.   Milk is up 16 percent. Butter is up 21 percent. Eggs are up 33  percent. The American people are not happy, and it is showing up in the  President's approval ratings.   Instead of continuing down this reckless path, let's change course.  Americans shouldn't have to watch their hard-earned money continue to  be devalued due to radical Democratic policies. If we are serious about  stopping inflation, Congress must rein in wasteful spending and enact  policies that will enable us to reclaim our energy independence.   I urge all Members to vote in favor of my amendments in this en bloc  package.
