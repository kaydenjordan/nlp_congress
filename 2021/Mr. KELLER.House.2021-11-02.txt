 Mr. Speaker, Northeast Pennsylvania is home to a world- class energy industry that is creating prosperity and opportunities for  our students, families, and economy. It is one of those things that you  must see to believe.   That is why I recently hosted my colleagues from the Western Caucus,  Representatives Yvette Herrell and Chairman   Dan Newhouse, to see  firsthand the widespread benefits of Pennsylvania's natural gas  industry.   We saw how students are being prepared for good-paying energy jobs at  the Lackawanna College's School of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the  Susquehanna County Career and Technology Center. We experienced the  sheer volume of natural gas production at an active drilling site, the  Williams' Potter Compressor Station and Coterra Energy's natural gas  wells.   To put Pennsylvania's energy dominance into perspective, one well in  Susquehanna County produces as much natural gas as 4,000 wells in West  Virginia. This energy means national security, a stronger workforce,  and lower energy costs.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for taking time to see the  great work happening in Pennsylvania. We must protect it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for  having this Special Order. At a time when we should be doing everything  we can to help small businesses thrive and strengthen America's  workforce, President Biden's radical socialist agenda is driving a  wedge between job creators and the workforce.   Drawing upon 25 years of experience in private industry, working in a  factory, later managing that factory, I understand the challenges that  our businesses face and what it means to get up every day, go to work,  and support a family.   President Biden and House Democrats aren't looking out for American  families. If they were, they would not be working to increase the tax  rates for small business owners or dumping more than a trillion dollars  into the economy. That will only worsen the inflation we have seen and  the supply chain crisis.    This build back better scheme is a farce. It is simply out of  control. Whoever controls more of an individual's money and how they  earn it controls more of their actions. That should be the person who  earns it, not the government.   When you look at these tax policies, when you look at inflation, when  you look at the fact that this administration has taken us away from  energy independence, people are spending more for groceries, they are  spending more for fuel, they are going to spend more to heat their  homes, and that is controlling more of their money because of these  poor policies. The best thing government can do is get out of the way  and return economic independence to the American people.   I thank the ranking member for having this Special Order and allowing  us to point out that we believe in the American people. They built the  greatest economy the world has ever seen. They built the greatest  nation on the face of the Earth, and I just wish that President Biden,  when he talks about being frustrated with American citizens, would get  half as frustrated with China and Russia and the Taliban.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  hosting this Special Order and thank him for his distinguished service  in the United States Marine Corps.   America's military is the most powerful fighting force on the planet,  and it draws its strength from the determination and might of its  members, the men and women who have answered freedom's call.   This Veterans Day, we recognize the many sacrifices our veterans have  made in order to defend our way of life and secure the blessings of  liberty for all to enjoy.   From the dawn of our Nation, valiant Americans have risen to confront  every threat we face. For generations, America's veterans have served  our country with honor, beating back tyranny to the ends of the Earth.   We also recognize America's military families: the wives, husbands,  children, parents, and siblings who share in their sacrifice.   We are fighting for them in Congress, pushing for policies like the  RECORDS Act, which would expedite requests for the records our veterans  need so they can access the benefits they have earned.   A grateful Nation salutes your service. May God bless our veterans  and the United States of America.  [[Page H6119]]
