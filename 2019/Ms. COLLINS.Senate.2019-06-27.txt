 Mr. President, before I deliver comments on a bill that  I am introducing, let me express my disappointment that the Senate will  not be voting today on the amendment that Senator Jones and I have  filed to eliminate the military widow's tax. This is a tremendous  inequity, as is recognized by the fact that 75 of our colleagues have  cosponsored our freestanding bill.   Nevertheless, I am heartened by the commitment and the compassion of  the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator Inhofe, who has  indicated his receptivity to dealing with this issue but in a different  way on a different bill. I hope that today is just a temporary setback  and that we can see this bill taken up as a freestanding bill by the  entire Senate.   Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask that it be  appropriately referred.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American  Broadband Buildout Act of 2019, or ABBA. This legislation would help  ensure that rural Americans have access to broadband services at speeds  they need to fully participate in the benefits of our modern society  and economy regardless of whether they live in the largest cities or  the smallest towns. I am delighted to be joined by my friend and  colleague Senator Doug Jones in introducing this bill.   Twenty-five years ago, when the internet was known as the World Wide  Web, Americans typically accessed the web using their home phone lines  via modems capable of downloading data at just 56 kilobits per second-- too slow even to support MP3-quality streaming music. Today, the  threshold for broadband service as defined by the FCC allows downloads  at speeds nearly 500 times faster--25 megabits per second. At these  speeds, Americans not only can watch their favorite movies on demand in  the comfort of their very own living rooms but can also participate in  the global economy while working from home, upgrade their skills  through online education, stay connected to their families as they age  in place, and access healthcare through advances in telemedicine.   While the increase in broadband speeds has been dramatic and is  encouraging, these numbers mask a disparity between urban and rural  Americans. Nearly all Americans living in urban areas have access to  the internet at speeds that meet the FCC's broadband threshold, while  one in four rural Americans does not.   Similar disparities occur in terms of broadband adoption--the rate at  which Americans subscribe to broadband service if they have access to  it. According to the Pew Research Center survey last year, 22 percent  of rural Americans don't use the internet at home, compared to just 8  percent of urban Americans.   The bipartisan bill that we are introducing would help close the  digital divide between urban and rural America by directing the FCC to  provide up to $5 billion in matching grants to assist States and State- approved entities in building ``last-mile'' infrastructure to bring  high-speed broadband directly to homes and businesses in areas that  lack it. Let me briefly discuss a few key points about the bill that I  would like to highlight.   First, projects that receive funding must be located in unserved  areas where broadband is unavailable at speeds that meet the FCC  standards. Narrowing the focus to those areas will ensure that the  money goes where it is needed most and will also protect against  overbuilding where broadband infrastructure is already in place.   Second--and this is important--the bill requires that this Federal  funding be matched through public-private partnerships between the  broadband service provider and the State in which the last-mile  infrastructure project will be built. This means that States and their  private sector partners will have ``skin in the game'' to balance the  Federal commitment, ensuring that projects will be well thought out and  designed to be sustainable.   Third, the bill requires that projects be designed to be ``future  proof,'' meaning that the infrastructure installed must be capable of  delivering higher speeds as broadband accelerates in the future. This  will ensure that Federal tax dollars are used to help build a network  that serves rural Americans now and in the future without our having to  rebuild it every time technology advances.   Furthermore, the bill directs the FCC to prioritize the funding of  projects in States that have traditionally lagged behind the national  average in terms of broadband subscribers and are at risk of falling  further behind as broadband speeds increase.   Finally, the bill provides grants for states and state-designated  entities for digital literacy and public awareness campaigns,  highlighting the benefits and possibilities of broadband service and  helping to attract employers to rural parts of our country in which  broadband services are lacking and yet are essential for a business's  success. The key reason to do this is to address the disparity in the  adoption rates I have already mentioned, which will help drive down the  costs of the service and make it more affordable for everyone.   One broadband application that holds special promise for rural  America is telemedicine. As a native of Aroostook County--the largest  county by land area east of the Mississippi, with fewer than 70,000  residents--I know how important healthcare is to the vitality and even  to the survival of rural communities. Often, these communities struggle  to attract and retain the physicians they need to ensure their having  access to quality care for their citizens. Broadband can help to bridge  this gap by enabling innovative healthcare delivery in these rural  communities.   In an example described to me in a recent letter, hospice workers at  Northern Light Home Care and Hospice were able to use the internet and  video technology to help support a patient who was living on an island  off the coast of Maine--not as far as the seagull flies but hours away  in travel time. Although the connection was very poor, the video  enabled the hospice nurses to monitor the patient's symptoms and  provide emotional support to her family. As the author of that letter,  Lisa Harvey-McPherson, put it, ``Our hospice team could be doing so  much more with video and telemonitoring technologies if Maine had  better connectivity.''   I ask unanimous consent that immediately following my remarks, this  letter from Lisa Harvey-McPherson be printed in the Record.   Mr. President, in closing, rural Americans deserve to enjoy the  benefits of high-speed internet in the same way that urban Americans  do, but a digital divide has arisen due to the simple fact that rural  areas are more sparsely populated than urban ones and are therefore  more expensive to serve. The bill that Senator Jones and I are  introducing today would help to bridge this digital divide by funding  future-proof broadband where it is needed most and giving a real boost  to job creation in rural America.   I urge my colleagues to support our bill.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                          Northern Light Health,                                           Brewer, ME, May 13, 2019.      Senator Susan Collins,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Northern Light Health       member organizations and the patients we serve, I want to       thank you for your support for the need to advance health       care technology in Maine. Technology is an essential strategy       to increase access to health care services in rural Maine.       Northern Light Health is a technology leader in Maine       providing a variety of telehealth services including       cardiology, stroke, psychiatry, trauma, pediatric intensive       care and in-home telemonitoring services state wide. As we       work to expand opportunities for patients to receive health       care services through technology we consistently encounter       the challenge of inadequate (or absent) broad band capacity.       Northern Light Health member organizations compete nationally       to recruit specialists to Maine, technology is often the only       option to expand access to specialists in rural Maine.        The following Northern Light Health examples highlight       technology opportunities  [[Page S4633]]       and the need to increase broadband speed and capacity in       rural Maine.        Our hospice program cared for a patient on an island off       Hancock County. Staff placed a tablet at the patient's home       and one with the hospice nurse. Because of the challenges of       Island travel, it took hours to get to the home to manage and       support the patient and her family. While the broadband       connection was very poor we were able to help with symptoms       and emotional support using video technology. Our hospice       team could be doing so much more with video and       telemonitoring technologies if Maine had better connectivity.        At Northern Light AR Gould in Presque Isle, they are a       pilot site for the telehealth virtual walk-in clinic. Those       using the system within the pilot are amazed at the ease of       access to a provider to ask those easy questions that keep       patients out of the ED. If successful, in a broader roll-out,       patients in local communities will have access to walk-in       level care (colds, rashes, general health questions) without       leaving their home via technology. This is important given       the average age of the population and the difficulty of       traveling roads during the winter months in Aroostook County.       The barrier to fully expanding the telehealth virtual clinic       is broadband capacity.        Broadband access is also a professional recruitment tool,       often provider spouses have difficulty finding meaningful       employment. Addressing rural broadband capacity will support       remote work.        In Aroostook County we are also evaluating telepsychiatry       services for the regional nursing homes. This will       significantly increase access to psychiatry services which is       in clinical demand. Connectivity is a foundational component       of offering this service.        Our electronic health record has expanded access to       individualized health information for our patients,       connectivity is a barrier to patients accessing this       important resource in rural Maine.        As we increase our electronic health record capacity       providers are reliant on this technology as much as they are       reliant on clinical tools like a stethoscope. In areas with       broadband capacity challenges the providers spend time       looking at buffering symbols on their screens for long       periods of time in the day.        We appreciate the opportunity to share these examples with       you and your staff as you explore Congressional solutions to       Maine's broadband challenge.            Sincerely,      Lisa Harvey-McPherson RN, MBA, MPPM,        Vice President Government Relations.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Brown, and Ms.          Collins):   S. 2026. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch  Act to reauthorize the farm to school program, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.   In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act, which  reauthorized child nutrition programs and made healthy meal choices a  reality to children nationwide. Far too many children and adolescents  in the United States suffer from obesity, which puts them at risk for  developing chronic health conditions later in life. One of the best  ways to help students make healthy choices is to teach them about their  food and how it is grown. Making that connection makes a difference.  That is why I championed the inclusion of funding for a farm to school  grant program, which was included in the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids  Act.   The program has had tremendous success and interest nationwide, and  has awarded grants in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to  support programs in more than 33,000 schools. Building upon the success  of this program, I am glad to be joined today by Senators Perdue,  Brown, and Collins in introducing the Farm to School Act of 2019. In  years past, I have championed this important farm to school legislative  effort with one of my dearest friends, Thad Cochran, who sadly passed  away last month.   We all know that hungry children cannot learn. Studies have shown  that healthy nutrition in a young person's diet is crucial to cognitive  ability and better health in the long run. Food insecurity and obesity  rates are still too high in this country, resulting in poor health, and  learning and behavioral difficulties at school. The school meal program  has made tremendous strides in recent years to ensure not only that  children have access to meals throughout the school day, but that those  meals are nutritious. The Farm to School program has given children and  schools across the country the tools to craft farm-fresh, healthy, and  delicious meals that students enjoy.   The Farm to School grant program offers support to farmers and local  economies, while teaching kids about nutritious foods and how they are  grown. The program has a strong educational component, making our  school cafeterias an extension of the classroom, giving students an  opportunity to learn about nutrition, well-balanced meals, and even how  to grow the food themselves.   In Vermont, I have seen first-hand how farm to school efforts have  better connected children with the food in their cafeteria. Students  participate in school gardens, sustainability projects, and taste tests  for new school menu items. With the help of a USDA Farm to School  grant, the Burlington School Food Project has created a partnership  with a local Vermont beef processor and 100 percent of the beef served  the last school year was locally sourced, and that will continue next  year as well. Organizations in Vermont such as Vermont Food Education  Every Day, Shelburne Farms, and the Northeast Organic Farming  Association have been able to expand their programs to link more farms  to the classroom throughout Vermont.   Farm to school is equally crucial to farmers and ranchers by opening  another market to them to sell their locally grown and locally  harvested goods. The program links the classroom with the farm to  engage students in the importance of farming and contributing to the  local economy. Every dollar spent on local food generates up to an  additional $2.16 in economic activity.   This program is so popular among school and farmers alike that demand  for grants far outpaces available funding. Since the program began in  2013, USDA has received more than 1,900 applications, but has only been  able to fund 437 projects. The Farm to School Act of 2019 would build  upon the success of the program and expand its reach by increasing the  funding for the program to $15 million per year. The bill also  recognizes the importance of growing the program to include preschools,  summer food service program sites, and after-school programs.   Ensuring children have enough food to eat is an issue that unites us  all. There is simply no excuse that in the wealthiest, most powerful  Nation on Earth people go hungry. Small changes in eating habits by  children will result in lifelong health benefits for generations to  come. The Farm to School program empowers children and their families  to make healthy choices now and in the future. As the Senate begins  considering reauthorizing the child nutrition bill this year, I look  forward to including these improvements in the Farm to School program.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Schatz, Mr.          Durbin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Ernst, and          Mr. Cramer):   S. 2032. A bill to expand research on the cannabidiol and marihuana;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American  Broadband Buildout Act of 2019, or ABBA.
