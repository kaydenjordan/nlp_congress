 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5645, the Standard Merger  and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act. This bill would  significantly undermine the Federal Trade Commission's ability to  enforce the Nation's antitrust laws, which help protect Americans from  anticompetitive behavior in the marketplace. In the guise of  harmonization with the Department of Justice, it would eliminate the  FTC's administrative litigation enforcement authority with respect to  corporate mergers and other transactions. It would also change and  potentially increase the burden the FTC must demonstrate in court when  seeking a preliminary injunction against the proposed merger.   In doing so, the bill would undercut a critical tool that the FTC  relies on to promote competition. It also risks sacrificing the  fundamental nature of the FTC as an independent administrative agency,  rather than an executive department, subject to the political whims of  the President. This blatant attack on the FTC's congressionally  mandated independence contravenes more than a century of legislative  intent.   In 1914, Congress responded to a wave of mergers and corporate abuses  by establishing the FTC as an independent body of experts tasked with  developing and advancing competition policy free from political  pressure. In doing so, Congress specifically gave the Commission broad  enforcement and investigatory authorities, including the power to  challenge anticompetitive mergers and other conduct through  administrative litigation.    This broad grant of statutory authority was not accidental. Louis  Brandeis, a visionary architect of our Nation's competition system,  advocated for the embrace of administrative litigation during Congress'  consideration of the FTC Act, and President Woodrow Wilson said such  authority was critical to the FTC's mission ``to warn where things were  going wrong and assist instead of check.''   As former Republican FTC Chairman William Kovacic warned: ``Without a  substantial, effective administrative litigation program, the aim of  making the Commission an influential competition policy tribunal could  not be accomplished.''   Nevertheless, this bill would eliminate this critical tool for  promoting competition and, in the process, would erode the Commission's  unique qualities and independence.   To further undermine the Commission's independence, the bill would  also require the FTC to meet the same standard in court that the  Justice Department meets when seeking a preliminary injunction against  the proposed merger. But the FTC and the DOJ are two different agencies  with different missions and different traditions.   Under current law, the Commission, by statute, must show that a  preliminary injunction ``would be in the public interest.'' The Justice  Department, on the other hand, has no statutory standard and must  simply meet the common law preliminary injunction standard, such as the  balance of equities and the risk of irreparable harm.   As our Nation's leading antitrust enforcers have previously  testified, there is no practical difference between the standards or  evidence that the Commission has abused its authority. So it is  entirely unclear what problem the bill is attempting to solve. But in  making this change, this bill could cause unnecessary confusion for the  courts or could signal a desire to increase the burden on the agency to  demonstrate the harms of an anticompetitive merger. That result alone  is unacceptable.   But even more fundamentally, this legislation is a step in the wrong  direction for our economy and for the prosperity and security of all  Americans. The decline of antitrust enforcement over the past several  decades has been an economic catastrophe for millions of workers who  have lost their jobs or seen their wages lowered. It has resulted in  fewer choices and higher prices for consumers, including increased  costs for healthcare, prescription drugs, and other essential goods and  services.   The importance of robust antitrust enforcement is not simply a  question of preventing higher prices for consumers. In the absence of  competition, employers have the power to suppress the wages and  mobility of American workers through anticompetitive contracting  practices, such as noncompete clauses and no-poach agreements.   And when large corporations run amok, locally owned businesses, the  economic lifeblood of our communities, wither on the vine. Concentrated  economic power is also a serious threat to our vibrant democracy. Large  corporations with an outsized role in the policymaking process are able  to further entrench their dominance through favorable rules and  enforcement decisions.   And when a large corporation with market power has the ability to  control the flow of information, it also has the power to shape public  opinion in ways that erode democratic values and undermine the voice of  the many in favor of the outsized profits of the few.   By further weakening our antitrust laws, H.R. 5645 would accelerate  this disturbing trend. Accordingly, I must oppose this legislation and  urge my colleagues to vote against this very bad bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the distinguished ranking member of the  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the nonpartisan Open Markets Institute, in its  opposition to H.R. 5645 states: ``Given the severity of the  concentration problem in America today, and its economic and political  consequences, Congress should be looking to enhance the powers of all  of America's antimonopoly agencies.''   I strongly agree: Congress should be strengthening, not weakening,  our competition system to protect economic opportunity, innovation, and  choice. That is why I have joined several of my Democratic colleagues-- Representatives Joe Crowley, David Cicilline, and Keith Ellison--in  introducing a package of bold economic measures to strengthen  protections that will help ensure that hardworking Americans have more  economic opportunity by ending anticompetitive employment practices.    This package includes H.R. 5642, the Restoring and Improving Merger  Enforcement Act, legislation that I introduced to prohibit the  consideration of false economic efficiencies--like corporate layoffs,  actually costing employment--to justify anticompetitive mergers.   But rather than address these important measures, which would  actually  [[Page H3854]]  help American workers and consumers, or give the antitrust agencies the  resources they need to really promote competition, this bill would do  the opposite by undermining the FTC's ability to vigorously enforce  antitrust laws under the guise of attempting to solve a problem that  does not exist.   I would submit that an economy in which we are down to four major  airlines and two major railroads, and going in the same direction in  almost every other segment of the economy, we should not be weakening  our antitrust laws and our antitrust enforcement, we should be  strengthening them. This bill goes in exactly the wrong direction and  is guaranteed to further increase the concentration of economic power  in our economy, and to further decrease the bargaining power that  workers have to get decent wages and working conditions.   Mr. Speaker, this is a deeply anti-employee bill, it is a pro- monopoly bill, and it is a very anti-economic growth bill. I urge my  colleagues to oppose this deeply flawed measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment makes several technical revisions to clarify that the  bill does not apply to consummated mergers and other transactions.  While this change marginally addresses one concern with the bill, it  does nothing to change the most fundamental flaw with the bill, which  is that it eliminates the Federal Trade Commission's administrative  litigation authority in merger cases.   As we noted during consideration of this bill in the Judiciary  Committee last year, and in prior Congresses, the SMARTER Act is  overbroad as currently drafted and applies to both unconsummated and  consummated transactions.   According to John Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney, who served  as commissioner of the Antitrust Modernization Commission, this bill  could easily be ``construed as prohibiting a challenge to the  consummation of any merger in administrative proceedings, even a post- merger challenge, notwithstanding the term `proposed.' ''   Technical feedback by senior staff at the FTC, under both Democratic  and Republican administrations, confirmed this view.   While the amendment makes the useful clarification that H.R. 5645  would not apply to already consummated transactions, the bill would  still eliminate the FTC's ability to use administrative litigation in  proposed mergers, striking at the core of the Commission's independence  and congressionally mandated design, without any evidence that such a  change is warranted or desirable.   As Mr. Jacobson has also noted in his testimony in opposition to a  similar  [[Page H3856]]  version of this legislation considered by the Senate, eliminating the  ``FTC's ability to conduct administrative proceedings in pre- consummation merger challenges is harmful to the sound administration  of the antitrust laws.''   At a time when there is an increasing desire across the ideological  spectrum to strengthen antitrust enforcement in the face of extreme  concentrations of corporate power in industry after industry, the  SMARTER Act proposes to go in the opposite direction. Congress was wise  to establish an independent agency in 1914 to ensure strong antitrust  enforcement, and we would be wise today not to undermine that choice.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment essentially puts lipstick on a pig. It  does not change my basic opposition to a bill that is fundamentally  flawed in its conception. Therefore, I must oppose this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Mr. Speaker, as a practical matter, the FTC only challenges a handful  of proposed mergers, on average, per year. These transactions present  some of the largest, most complex, and potentially most concerning  issues. But in most of these cases, the parties either abandon the  transaction or negotiate a settlement.   Nonetheless, in those few instances where the FTC does challenge a  transaction, it is in a position to answer novel questions of law and,  thereby, develop expertise and guidance for future applications.  Indeed, that is the whole point of having an FTC, and that is the whole  point of administrative adjudication authority.   As the Antitrust Institute has noted in its opposition to the SMARTER  Act to this bill, ``the FTC's use of administrative powers should be  carefully safeguarded, because it has contributed critically to the  effective shaping of U.S. merger policy without detracting from the  speed or effectiveness of merger review.''                                time  1415    In addition, Republican FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen's 2016  study on administrative litigation debunks the claim of procedural bias  against merging parties. Her study found that the FTC's appellate  success and case work ``do not support a narrative that the Commission  blindly supports ill-conceived cases because of systemic bias. To the  contrary, they show a recent history of solid, well-supported  enforcement actions.''   Even where the FTC does not use administrative adjudication, the  potential use of this tool is invaluable in the agency's ability to  successfully get emerging parties to agree to structural remedies, such  as divestitures, to address concerns with a proposed merger.   It is unthinkable to remove the FTC's administrative litigation  authority, as this amendment would continue to do, when such authority  is only used to protect against the most anticompetitive mergers that  are certain to substantially lessen competition, harm consumers, raise  prices, and hurt workers.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
