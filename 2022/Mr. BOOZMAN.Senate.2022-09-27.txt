 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Hiller and  Marilyn Suber of Monticello, AR, for their tremendous work as foster  parents, opening their home to more than 350 foster care placements  over the last 20 years.   The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute--CCAI--recently  recognized the Subers as 2022 Angels in Adoption honorees.   Since 2001, the CCAI has played a vital role in eliminating barriers  standing between orphaned and foster children becoming part of a loving  family. As the CCAI's signature public awareness program, Angels in  Adoption annually recognizes outstanding individuals, families and  organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to adoption  and child welfare.   The Subers are well-deserving of this honor for their work with  children in need and the amazing example they set for families across  Arkansas and the Nation.   When Hiller and Marilyn married in 1999, they decided to foster  instead of trying to have children of their own. Although they cared  for children of many ages at first, they found their niche with  teenagers and are now one of the few homes in Arkansas that only  fosters teens.   The Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services recognized the  Subers as the Arkansas Foster Parents of the Year in 2021. As DCFS  Director Mischa Martin attested, many families are hesitant to open  their homes to teenagers, but the State knows it ``can always count on  the Subers to take in teens and provide them with the love and support  they need to really thrive,'' adding, ``they care deeply about our  kids, and the kids love them right back.''   As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I am inspired  by the love and dedication families like the Subers share every day to  improve the lives of young people. It is my honor to congratulate them  as 2022 Angels in Adoption and wish them many more years of happiness  and fulfillment in their mission.   On behalf of the people of Arkansas, I extend my gratitude and  congratulations to Hiller and Marilyn Suber on earning this tremendous  honor and applaud their humility and compassion.                            ____________________
