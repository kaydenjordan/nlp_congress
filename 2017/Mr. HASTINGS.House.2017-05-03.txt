 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017. As you know, this  $1 trillion omnibus will provide discretionary funding for most of the  Federal Government for the remaining 5 months of fiscal year 2017.   Before moving to the specifics of the legislation, we need to get a  few things straight. It bears repeating that the appropriations  measures contained in this bill should have been passed months ago.  While I am glad that we have arrived at this compromise, and the words  of my good friend from Oklahoma, I certainly support with regard to the  extraordinary work of the chairman and the ranking member, and their  respective staffs, as well as all the appropriators, generally, and  their staffs, they have done a good job with reference to the measure,  as far as compromise is concerned.   But the fact remains that the bill is 7 months late. The House  Committee on Appropriations is already hard at work for fiscal year  2018, and yet this body is still trying to fund programs for the  current fiscal year. The root cause of this disarray does not lie with  the Appropriations Committee but with the majority's leadership, or  lack thereof, in this Congress and in the White House.                                time  1245    I also need to level another critique at my friends across the aisle  who have time and again brought us to the brink of a government  shutdown. We needed months of negotiations and three continuing  resolutions to keep the government funded. Much of the time, poison  pill riders gummed up the works. Among other things, the majority  continuously tries to strip funding from women's healthcare  organizations, slash environmental protections, and end protections for  Federal employees through the appropriations process.   Well, here we are, Mr. Speaker, 7 months later, with a bill that does  none of these things. Yet we do it again and again, lurching from  manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. I said yesterday or the day  before in the Rules Committee that we will be back here with a stopgap  measure and repeat this same crisis routine that we have done for many  of the years that I have had the privilege of serving in this body. Mr.  Speaker, maybe next time we will skip the grandstanding and start off  with a commonsense measure from the get-go.   This brings me to the bill itself. The measure includes $1.07  trillion in base discretionary budget authority, including $551 billion  in base defense spending, $518.5 billion in base nondefense spending,  $62.1 billion in overseas contingency operations defense spending, and  $16.5 billion in overseas contingency operations nondefense spending.  More than 160 partisan toxic riders were floated but kept out of the  legislation.   Despite Donald John Trump's insistence on draconian cuts, the omnibus  includes $1.2 billion in additional nondefense budget authority. It  provides funding to alleviate Puerto Rico's emergency budget shortfall  and their underfunded Medicaid program. It increases funding for the  National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. It provides $1.1 billion  in disaster assistance for regions affected by storms and flooding in  2015 and 2016, and it includes $900 million in humanitarian assistance  to alleviate international famine.   Toward that end, with reference to famine in the world, we are  witnessing a rising number of countries that are experiencing famine.  Without identifying them all, it is estimated that some 20 million  people in the world are at risk of dying from starvation. In this  country, too many people are in a position of being hungry during the  course of a day. In the land of plenty, we can do better.   In this vein, I was pleased to see the inclusion of language that  will positively impact the district that I serve and every other  district that faces the threat of natural disasters. Toward that end,  my good friend from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. In the compromise  measure, there are some things that will impact all of our districts,  and that is, in my judgment, as it should be.   Additionally, I am one of few Members around here who continuously  argues that Members should have earmark responsibilities so that they  can be held accountable for things that are vital in their districts  rather than allowing the bureaucracy to dominate that sphere.   The language clarifies a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  codifying the Department of Labor's views on lifting the work  restrictions on insurance claims adjusters responding to disasters.  When a natural disaster strikes, like a hurricane or a wildfire,  insurance adjusters are there to help those affected piece their lives  back together and get back on their feet. By ensuring that adjusters  can quickly and readily respond to disasters, this codification helps  them complete their important work.   I did say in the Rules Committee, and I have said for 20 years here,  that this Congress needs a disaster relief committee that is  constituted of all of the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction. It  is not complicated. It is something that is done in other countries so  that when these disasters occur--be they fire, flood, hurricane,  tornado, or any disaster--we can respond more quickly than we do now,  rather than allowing for the residual remains of the kinds of disasters  that we experience in this country.   Just this past weekend, at least 16 lives were lost and many people  were injured in tornadic activity in the States of Alabama,  Mississippi, and Arkansas and floods in Missouri, and we need to  respond to those.   Additionally, something else that I want to say that I consider to be  important are the responsibilities of FEMA. While I believe they do an  extraordinary job with what they are allowed to work with, I don't know  what it takes to get across to people that FEMA can only react when  there are a certain number of people that have lost their homes. Please  know this: when 1 person loses their home to a natural disaster, it is  just as important as if 1,000 or 100,000 lost their home; and we,  [[Page H3082]]  this Congress, need to be able to respond to that 1 the same way we do  to 1,000.   Furthermore, I was glad to see that the bill includes year-round Pell  grants to provide 1 million students in this country with an additional  average award of $1,650, and it permanently extends health insurance  benefits for retired mineworkers.   I might add that that has been and will continue to be a bipartisan  effort to provide for the health of those mineworkers. Hopefully, in  spite of all the talk coming out of the White House, we may, one day,  find a way to help those that have lost their jobs because of the  industrial changes transition to good jobs.   But what is included in this bill is just as important as what is  not. In his first major budget negotiation, Donald John Trump made many  demands that were defeated. He requested $30 billion in additional  defense spending and $3 billion to fund construction of a U.S.-Mexico  border wall and is around crowing that there is money in this bill to  do something about the wall, and there is not.   The President wanted policy riders to restrict sanctuary cities from  receiving Federal grants. He wanted to defund Planned Parenthood and  undermine health care. As I have already said, there were 160 riders  that were floated here in this measure but are not included.   Rather than governing responsibly, Donald John Trump and the House  Freedom Caucus have spent a good deal of time and energy pushing  partisan interests, from repealing health care to gutting the  Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the  Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and successful  programs like community development block grants. All of these programs  are fully funded in this measure.   As the President gets cozy with authoritarian strongmen around the  world and revisits the history of the Civil War--and for your  information, Donald Trump, it was slavery that caused the war--Congress  has stepped up and asserted itself, and I am glad.   I have said repeatedly that the legislative branch has given too much  authority not to this President but to the one before him, the one  before him, and the one before that one. We have continuously ceded our  authority. So it is understood by virtue of this action and, I hope,  future action that the legislature is an equal branch of our  government, and we need to act like it.   Funding the government is one of the most important responsibilities  Congress has. There are, undeniably, differences in policy priorities  between Members in this body, Democrats and Republicans, and  differences between Democrats and differences between Republicans in  this body, but holding the Federal budget hostage is not the way to  work through these problems. This measure is a responsible compromise  that serves the interests of the American public, and that is what we  came here to do.   My good friend from Oklahoma, last night in the Rules Committee, said  that the people that win in this measure are the American people, and I  agree with him. That is why I was even dismayed and, quite frankly,  disturbed at the irresponsible comment that Donald John Trump tweeted  yesterday morning that what this country needs is ``a good shutdown''  in September.   I made it a point, when we were in the Rules Committee, to ask the  fine young gentleman that works with me to learn the context because I  just can't believe that this man comes out and says that this  institution needs to have ``a good shutdown.''   Donald John Trump, there is no such thing as a good shutdown.   The President champions a government shutdown not only to his but to  his party's peril. The hardworking and working poor Americans are at  peril with that kind of undertaking. He does so to the peril of our men  and women fighting overseas, to the peril of working families and their  health care, to education, and to safe, clean, and secure communities.   Donald John Trump may think he can run the country on Twitter while  daydreaming of taxpayer-funded jaunts to his private golf club, but he  needs to wise up. We don't need a good shutdown. We need a good leader.  If he continues and isn't prepared to get serious, then he needs to get  out of the way.   As my colleague Congressman McGovern said yesterday, rather than a  shutdown, the President ought to shut his mouth. I will put it another  way from the vernacular: zip his lip, put that Twitter off somewhere on  the side and let birds tweet while he talks sensibly to the American  people.   Maybe the President thinks that if the government shuts down people  suddenly don't need to pay taxes and that national parks become free.  Maybe he thinks that if the government shuts down--if we have a good  government shutdown--every regulation suddenly stops and corporations  are free to run wild without complying to clean water or clean air  standards.   I don't know what he is thinking. I don't think anybody else around  here knows what he is thinking. I am not even certain he knows what he  is thinking. And to be honest, I would be afraid to see what is going  on in his head.   But here is what I do know. According to the financial ratings agency  Standard & Poor's, the 2013 government shutdown cost the United  States--the American people--$24 billion. According to a report from  the Council of Economic Advisers, it sidetracked the creation of as  many as 120,000 jobs.   I hope you are listening, Donald John Trump, because these aren't  alternative facts.   The furloughs amounted to more than 5.5 million days' worth of  Federal employment lost spread across dozens of agencies. Businesses  that relied on tourism lost out on more than a half-billion dollars.  The Small Business Administration couldn't process some 700  applications for $140 million in small businesses loans.                                time  1300    According to the U.S. Travel Association, the 16-day shutdown cost  $152 million per day in lost travel spending. According to CNBC, 2  weeks into the latest shutdown, the Internal Revenue Service reported a  backlog of 1.2 million verification requests that could not be  processed.   Mr. Speaker, we don't need a good government shutdown. We don't need  a shutdown at all. We just got through a 7-month negotiation to keep  the government open.   Naturally, the media picked up on the fact that Donald John Trump got  virtually none of his priorities. When the report started to air, he  threw a political temper tantrum and took to Twitter to undermine the  compromise.   I will be honest at this point: it is nothing new, so it shouldn't  surprise anyone; nor should the backlash that ensued or his sudden  change of heart. In just a few hours, Donald John Trump went from  condemning the deal and whining about the rules of the Senate to  hailing it as a great compromise. I must have missed that chapter in  his ``The Art of the Deal.''   So let's leave it at this: we need to do more, not less, to  strengthen our communities and help working families. I urge President  Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric and get serious.   I hope you are listening, sir, because you can put that in a tweet.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.   Also, Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities  toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, would you be kind enough to advise how  much time remains?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 11 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 19\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, news flash here for those that might have been trying to  make plans for leaving here tomorrow morning: it appears that House  Republicans are intent on trying to bring TrumpCare back to life.   The Republican healthcare bill was bad the first time, bad the second  time, and its latest iteration is even worse. In addition to kicking 24  million people off their health coverage, gutting Medicaid in order to  give a trillion-dollar tax cut--mostly to the richest Americans--and  dismantling the requirement to provide the essential health benefits,  the latest proposal completely guts protections for people with  preexisting conditions and imposes an unlimited age tax on older  Americans.   Now we see in the press that the Republican leadership is trying to  cut yet another backroom deal on expensive, high-risk pools to try and  muster enough votes to pass this monstrosity.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has not gone through regular order from the  start. There have been no hearings. There is no CBO score. We are  reading in the press that even more changes are on the horizon.   I wish I could start reading in the press or looking at television  and just have people that have the responsibility and leadership to  inform those of us that are in the minority just what the plan really  constitutes and when it will be put forward. Every single Member in  this institution should be as outraged as I am, regardless of party.  This is a bill that will affect every American.   Therefore, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an  amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to  prevent any healthcare-related legislation from being considered if it  does not have a CBO cost estimate; or if it would deny health coverage  or require higher premiums due to preexisting conditions; impose  lifetime limits on health coverage; prevent individuals under age 26  from being covered under their parents' plans; reduce the number of  people receiving health care under the Affordable Care Act; increase  costs to seniors by reopening the doughnut hole and raising  prescription drug costs; require people to pay for preventive services,  including cancer screening; reduce Medicare solvency or change the  Medicare guarantee; or reduce Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the  population with the highest incomes or increase taxes on the 80 percent  of hardworking Americans earning moderate to low income.  [[Page H3084]]    Every American deserves affordable, high-quality health care. This  amendment would ensure that the Republican bill can't sacrifice that  goal in favor of giving tax cuts to the wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways  and Means, to discuss the proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways  and Means, to discuss the proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts  an additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   The President has said that Americans would win so much, they would  be tired of winning. I think for once he and I may be in agreement.   Today's measure advances medical research, protects coal miners,  fights back against the opioid epidemic and international disasters,  and protects funding for science, education, and health care. It should  not have taken us 7 months to get here. But I hope this measure will  give the Appropriations Committee a springboard for fiscal year 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on:   Adopting the resolution, if ordered; and   Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 1665, if ordered.
