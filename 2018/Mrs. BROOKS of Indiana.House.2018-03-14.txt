 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership, and I thank the Members who have come before us today to  speak about their experiences, like my colleague who suffered from a  horrific act of gun violence last year.   I also want to speak on behalf of the thousands of students who stood  up all around the country. They have asked us to take action to address  gun violence.   Our children do deserve to be safe while they are at school, to feel  safe and to be safe. I am the mother of a teacher, sister of a teacher,  and daughter of a new teacher. We want our schools to be safe.   We in this country have focused on violence in our communities for a  very long time. When I was deputy mayor of Indianapolis in the late  nineties, we were very focused on reducing gun violence and homicides  of all kinds in the city of Indianapolis.                                time  1345    Later, as U.S. attorney in the southern district of Indiana, I led  what was called Project Safe Neighborhoods, which I understand that  Attorney General Sessions is reinvigorating to reduce the gun violence  in all of our communities, which includes our schools.   As our colleague from Florida just said, this is a very complex  problem. This is something that we have been paying attention to for  many years and, in fact, decades. It is going to take complex  solutions, but this bill is a very important part of the solution.   In fact, last year, my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee worked to enact 21st Century Cures Act, which included a  number of mental health provisions. One of those reforms ensured that  State and local governments can use grant funding from the Department  of Justice to develop and operate school-based mental health crisis  intervention teams. Today we will reauthorize that Department of  Justice program for another 10 years with this bill.   I read this morning in The Indianapolis Star, the new movement about  walk up, not just walk out. It is important for students and everybody  to walk up to those people who they have concerns about in their  schools or those people who are lonely, and those people who need help  or who just need a friend.   The STOP School Violence Act authorizes $75 million in annual funding  to support increased security and training and increase the use of  anonymous reporting systems. In one school in my district, over 100  tips were sent into that school system with the anonymous reporting on  the night of the Parkland shooting, and teachers worked around the  clock on shifts all night to run down all of those tips. That is what  is critically important, that people continue to report and that law  enforcement working with school officials continue to investigate.   These tips come from outside the school. They come from inside the  school. This is critically important. They come from social media. They  come from conversations. It is important to share. This bill increases  the amount of funding that can go to schools for anonymous reporting  systems. That is just one of the things it does.   This bill will add more resources. It is not enough. I am not saying  that it is enough. It is one of the many steps. In fact, in this  appropriations bill, I want to encourage my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee to continue to increase funding for school  safety and mental health programs in the omnibus bill and in budgets  going forward.   We know this bill is one important step. I want to applaud one of my  colleagues, Sheriff Rutherford, a Member from Florida. He and another  Member from Florida introduced this bill 1 week before the shooting.  They, along with many colleagues, have focused on school security for  many years. We do have to do more. This is an important step. It is a  critical step. And when men like Sheriff Rutherford have devoted his  life to protecting and serving his community and his schools in his  community, we need to listen to him.   This is a very important step. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  We will not stop. We have heard the young people. We have heard their  families. We are going to continue to listen. We will continue to fight  for safety in schools in our communities.
