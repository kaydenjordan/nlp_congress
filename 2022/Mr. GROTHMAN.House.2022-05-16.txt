 Madam Speaker, we just got back from our home  districts, and we all heard different things, but I am sure I talked to  dozens, maybe over 100, people over the weekend. The number one topic  of concern is inflation.   In particular, I ran across someone whose house sold for probably 50  percent more than I would have thought that house would sell for a  year-and-a-half ago. I am sure it was good for the person who sold the  house, but I feel so sorry for young people today.   Now, why is the cost of housing up so much? The same reason the cost  of gas is up and the same reason the cost of food is up. It is because  we have a greatly increased money supply.   I encourage all Americans to get on your computers, look at M2 and  M1, measure of the monetary supply. That is not something that has  anything whatsoever to do with the war in Ukraine. It is simply  overspending on the part of this Congress.   The American Rescue Plan Act, the first big spending act of the new  administration, is one of the most fiscally irresponsible things I have  ever seen.    But I encourage all Americans, when you talk to your Congressman,  tell them: ``Government is big enough. Please don't spend any more.''                            ____________________
