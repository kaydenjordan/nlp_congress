 Madam President, I am here to say a few words on  behalf of Deb Haaland to be Secretary of the Interior.   There is something wonderfully beautiful and symmetrical about her  appointment to this position because of the Department of the  Interior's role supervising America's public lands. Well, of course,  before America's public lands were America's public lands, they were  Native American lands, and Deb Haaland will be the first Native  American to serve in any President's Cabinet and the first to serve as  the Secretary of this Department. So that is kind of a wonderful  harmony with history, and I hope we appreciate that here.   The second thing that I want to say is that it is, to me, deeply  ironic how much of the opposition to her as Secretary has come on the  theory that she won't be fair to fossil fuels. We have lived through 4  years of a Trump administration with Secretaries of the Interior who  were out-and-out operatives of fossil fuel. The fossil fuel hand in the  Secretary's glove was obvious.   The idea that anything other than fossil fuel was treated fairly in  the Trump administration is a preposterous notion. Basically, anything  that wasn't nailed down, they gave to the fossil fuel industry with no  consideration for any of the competitors, and they did it so badly and  so shabbily and so sloppily because they were so greedy that a lot of  the stuff they did got thrown out by courts because they didn't even  bother to do their homework.   So, please, let's not talk about fairness after the last 4 years. Our  friends on the other side lost their standing to talk about fairness  after what they did for fossil fuel in the last 4 years, including  outright lies about climate change.   My good friend from Texas talks about hurricanes. He has real  hurricanes coming because of climate change. Yet where is the climate  plan from the other side? None, because the fossil fuel industry won't  let them.   Let me last say as I conclude, I come from the Ocean State.  Representative Haaland comes from one of those interior square States.  Her Agency is called the Department of the Interior. When you look at  things like the Land and Water Conservation Fund, floods of money go to  inside America, interior America, upland and inland America, and the  coasts always get overlooked. I have made it very clear to Ms. Haaland  that has to stop. With climate change coming, with fisheries moving  about, with sea levels rising, with oceans warming, with actual seas  acidifying in front of our eyes, to overlook the coast can happen no  more. I trusted her when she said she would. I will take her at her  word, but I also intend to work very hard to make sure that I can  support her in keeping her word that oceans and coasts will matter.   I yield to my friend from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 15, 2021, at 6 p.m., to conduct  a hearing.                            ____________________
