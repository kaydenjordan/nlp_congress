 Madam Speaker, this week is National Police Week. It is  a time to honor the sacrifice and service our men and women in blue  make every single day to protect our neighbors and our loved ones.   In my district today, unfortunately, we are off to a very sobering  start. Last night, two Concho County officers were shot and killed in  the line of duty. These officers died protecting their community to the  very end, defending the freedoms, values, and safety our country holds  so dear.   Though we are unable to thank them personally for their sacrifice, we  will never stop honoring their legacy, the legacy of service and  selflessness.   I would like to extend my deepest condolences to their families,  friends, colleagues, and community members who are affected by this  enormous tragedy and remind all of us of the danger that law  enforcement officers put themselves in every single day, willingly, to  help our communities.   It is time that we stand up and honor them, and thank them for what  they do. As a country, I request that we all keep our law enforcement  officers in our hearts, our thoughts, and our prayers and that we thank  them for what they do.                            ____________________
