 Mr. President, I come to the floor to address an       important issue, which is the ability of our women who have given birth       to a child to be able to sustain breastfeeding by being able to pump       breast milk when they return to work.        We adopted this law in Oregon. It was universally successful. When I       came here to the Senate, I proposed that we do the same across the       Nation; and 12 years ago, we passed that bill. It was a great time for       nursing mothers, enabling 49 million women of childbearing age to know       that if they wanted to breastfeed, they would have a cooperative       employer giving them privacy and flexible break times to be able to       pump breast milk.        It was a triple win. It was a triple win for the babies; it was a       triple win for the mothers; and it turned out to be a big win for the       employer as well because the employers found that their employees were       more likely to come back to work and that they felt appreciated because       the employer recognized the importance of that mother trying to do       their very best by their newborn.        We know that half of women in America return to work within 3 months       of giving birth. We know that about one in four will return to work       after just 2 weeks. That is why this is so important.        When I first raised this idea here in the Senate, I thought that       there would be significant opposition, but an unexpected champion was       Senator Coburn of Oklahoma. Senator Coburn said that Senator Merkley       had not begun to list all the ways that breastfeeding works to the       benefit of the baby and the mother. He went on to list all of the       health benefits, and we passed the amendment unanimously in the HELP       Committee. Democrats and Republicans working together for new moms and       for our children to get the best launch into life.        I will have a unanimous consent request in a moment, but I want to       turn to the cosponsor of our bill. I so much appreciate Senator       Murkowski of Alaska.         Much appreciation for the minority and majority side of       the Commerce and HELP Committees for doing so much work on this.       Senator Burr, Senator Wicker, Senator Lummis, all added a lot for       getting us to this point.        I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate       consideration of Calendar No. 65, S. 1658; further, that the committee-      reported substitute be withdrawn, and the Merkley-Murkowski substitute       amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be       considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider       be considered made and laid upon the table.            [[Page S9722]]               Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, our       bill does address the motor coach situation. It clarifies, in terms of       conversations we have had with that industry, that, in fact, no       additional expense will be required and no additional drivers. We know       already, under the accommodations of the Disabilities Act, that there       are rights that exist to drivers as well.        We have here a very limited provision because we make it clear that       it does not require the employer to incur any significant expense, such       as the removal or retrofitting of seats, or for any driver to drive in       unsafe conditions or make unscheduled stops. That is from a long       conversation that I would have been happy to have filled my colleague       in about if he had explored this issue.        It has now been 8 years that this topic has been before us. It has       not just been studied in some academic sense; it has been studied in       real life, and we still have thousands and thousands of women who have       great difficulty getting permission to pump breast milk when they       return to work. Those who have been accommodated say it has made a big       difference in their lives with their bonding with their child, with       their health, as well as the child's, which is the point that Senator       Coburn made. We have this in place for 49 million American women. Why       have we left 9 million out?        By the way, in my State, we have a hardship waiver that says any       company that finds that this is too difficult to implement can seek an       accommodation. Do you know what? Nobody applied because they could all       figure it out.        It is time to embrace the fact that we need to do right by our       children. Senator Paul's amendment, which guts this bill and says let's       study it, is not an answer for the millions of women who are seeking to       do the best by their children.        Therefore, I object.         Mr. President, my colleague doesn't share the view that       many of us have reached on both sides of the aisle, which is actually       what the legislative process embraces--that people come to this floor       and share their different views and then we hold a vote. He has really       been a champion for holding votes on amendments. He probably has had       more amendments before this body than any other Senator.        Therefore, I would say to my colleague that I will provide an       additional unanimous consent request that will enable us to have a vote       on this bill. He can weigh in as he likes, and his side may carry the       day. But I think it is important that a question of such magnitude--      there are so many million new moms across this country--be considered       and not be simply tossed in the waste bin. So I will ask consent for a       vote on the PUMP Act.        I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate       consideration of Calendar No. 65, S. 1658; further, that the committee-      reported substitute be withdrawn and that the Merkley-Murkowski       substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the       bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that       the Senate vote on the passage of the bill.         Mr. President, I will simply conclude by noting that we       are all better off when issues can be debated and voted on on this       floor. There is tremendous frustration in the Chamber right now. We       have a very thick bill awaiting action. Why is it so thick? Because so       few bills can get debated and voted on on this floor.        I would ask that my colleague from Kentucky, whom I have worked with       on many issues, think about this a little bit and maybe come back and       say: Yes, you are right. We should have a debate and a vote. This       should not be something that any one individual suppresses.         Madam President, today I would like to pay       tribute to my State of Oregon's outgoing Governor, Kate Brown, who has       not only led the Beaver State for the last 8 years but has devoted much       of her life to public service.        Governor Brown got her start in Oregon politics when she was       appointed to fill a seat in the Oregon House in 1991, which she would       continue to serve in for a total of three terms before going on to       serve another three terms in the State senate. Recognized for her       leadership, she was elected by her peers to serve as majority leader in       2003 and would go on to serve in that position until leaving the senate       in 2009. Her 6 years as majority leader were marked with an impressive       list of major accomplishments and bills passed. And I was fortunate,       during a portion of that time--between 2007 and 2009, to be exact--to       work alongside her as speaker of the Oregon House and push through a       number of those bills that have had such a positive impact on the            [[Page S9774]]            people of our State--bills like the Oregon Equality Act, which banned       discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the       Oregon Family Fairness Act, which created domestic partnerships for       same-sex couples. We established a rainy-day fund to help guard Oregon       against sudden economic downturns and updated the Oregon Bottle Bill       for the first time since it was passed in 1971 in order to add water       bottles to the list of containers with mandatory deposits.        Working together, we made those 2 years some of the most productive       in the history of our State. But in 2009, we each set off on new       chapters of or lives and our careers--me to serve in the U.S. Senate       and Governor Brown to serve for two terms as Oregon's secretary of       state, where she made expanding the right of every Oregonian to vote       and breaking down the barriers to registration her top priority. As       secretary of state, Governor Brown implemented online voter       registration, which 87,000 Oregonians availed themselves of within the       first year of its enactment. She pushed the use of tablets and iPads to       ensure our elections were increasingly accessible to every Oregonian.       And because of her efforts, our State became the first to use tablets       to help voters with disabilities actually mark their ballots, a       practice which has since caught on across the country. And she crafted       and pushed for passage of the ``motor voter'' program to automatically       register voters when they get a driver's license that she would       actually go on to sign into law and implement once she became Governor.        Like her time in the legislature, Governor Brown distinguished her       tenure as secretary of state by her work to bring fairness and       opportunity to our State. And that continued into the Governor's       mansion where she always strives to put the best interests of       Oregonians first, especially working families. Under her watch,       Governor Brown oversaw historic investments in education with the       Students Success Act. She signed a transformative 10-year, $5.3 billion       package to improve our roads and highways, while creating more       pedestrian- and bike-friendly communities.?? She expanded the Oregon       Health Plan so that every child and 94 percent of all adults in our       State have some form of health coverage today. Her budget plan included       some of the most ambitious goals in the country for taking on climate       chaos by reducing carbon emissions and moving to 100 percent clean       energy sources. And, of course, Governor Brown saw our State through       the dark and difficult days of the COVID-19 pandemic.        Her career in public service has been defined by working to improve       our State and help lift up families everywhere. And it is important to       remember that, time and again, she had to do so while breaking down one       barrier after another. She was the first woman to serve as our senate       majority leader, the first openly LGBTQ+ person elected as a secretary       of state in the country, and then the first as Governor. It takes       immense courage to be the first at anything--to be a pioneer. And it is       her courage which has made Governor Brown such an inspiration to so       many in Oregon and across the Nation who have questioned their own       place in the world and seeking their own path in life.        As she prepares to transition into the next phase of her life, I am       going to miss having Governor Brown there in Mahonia Hall, leading our       State through good times and bad. I am going to miss the regular phone       calls that we have shared, almost every month, for nearly 8 years. But       I know that this is far from the end. I know that, even as she leaves       office, Governor Brown will continue to make important and meaningful       contributions to the lives of her fellow Oregonians. And I, for one,       cannot wait to see what she decides to do next.                                      ____________________                Madam President, when the Oregon Legislature       comes into session on January 9, it will embark on a new era because,       for the first time in 38 years, it will convene without Oregon's       longest serving legislator and longest serving senate president, Peter       Courtney, among its ranks.        Since the day he stepped off that greyhound bus in Salem, back in       1969, Peter has been a captivating presence in Oregon politics. Through       6 years on the Salem City Council, 7 terms in the Oregon House and 12       in the senate--10 of them as senate president--Peter has sought to not       only make government work by pushing to make the legislature meet       yearly rather than once every 2 years, but to work on behalf of the       people of our State. And he has certainly been a tireless advocate for       his community, exemplified by his support for the Salem YMCA he loved       so much and once called ``home'' for 2 years and through this year's       groundbreaking on the 34-unit which will serve veterans in need of       affordable housing.        As senate president, Peter helped usher a number of landmark bills on       everything from housing, to healthcare, to jobs. Among them are the       rainy-day fund that I worked with him to establish in order to       safeguard our State from sudden economic downturns; the Healthy Kids       Act which provided health insurance to 90,000 uninsured children and       30,000 low-income adults; and through the Housing Opportunity Bill       which created a new trust fund to increase affordable rental housing       development, help more Oregonians become homeowners, prevent       homelessness,and maintain and expand the network of community-based       nonprofit housing providers.        But there is no question that, of all the issues he has worked on       over the years, mental health care is that Peter is most passionate       about. Peter has long been recognized throughout Oregon as a champion       for providing mental health services to those who need it. This passion       began when, visiting the Oregon State Hospital back in 2004, the same       hospital where ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was filmed, Peter       and a group of local leaders discovered the unclaimed cremated remains       of more than 3,500 Oregonian patients sitting in a neglected storage       room in corroding copper canisters. Finding those remains and the lack       of care with which they were treated set Peter off on a personal       mission to ensure that Oregonians suffering from mental illnesses get       the care they need and that they are treated with dignity and respect.       He led the charge to replace that old State hospital with a new modern       facility that also had a boost in staffing so patients could get the       care they need. He pushed through a mental health parity bill in 2005       which said that insurance companies had to cover mental health       treatment the same as they did physical health treatment. And Peter was       also the driving force for successfully increasing our State's       cigarette tax and dedicating the extra funding it generates to mental       health treatment.        And if there is a second issue that Peter is most passionate about,       it would probably have to be preparing our State for a Cascadia       Subduction Zone earthquake. He once gave each Democrat in the House a       small piece of marble with an engraved image of the State capitol once       repairs were finished after the damage caused by the 1993 Scotts Mill       earthquake as symbol of the importance of this issue. That commitment       to safety led Peter to successfully shepherd 12 seismic safety measures       into law. And schools and emergency services facilities across Oregon       are now safer in the event of an earthquake thanks to the Seismic       Rehabilitation Grant Program that he created.        It is hard to imagine what Oregon State politics is going to look       like, starting in just a few weeks, without Peter Courtney running the       State senate. But as work continues on a multiyear project to retrofit       and prepare our capitol in Salem for an inevitable and long overdue       earthquake in the Cascadia Subduction Zone, I know that Peter's legacy       and his work on so many important issues will continue to touch the       lives of Oregonians for a long time to come.                                      ____________________                Madam President, today I would like to       recognize Robert Stoll, a dear friend, brilliant legal mind, and a       steadfast champion for the people of Oregon who just celebrated his       80th birthday on December 16, 2022. Adlai Stevenson once said, ``It is       not the years in your life but the life in your years.'' Well, Bob has       certainly crammed a lot of life into his 80 years on this planet.        A dabbler in journalism as a publisher of the University of Wisconsin            [[Page S9775]]            (Madison) student newspaper, Bob got a firsthand view of history on a       summer trip to Europe in 1963. After embracing the brazen courage of       youth to request press credentials from Press Secretary Pierre       Salinger, he got to stand 20 feet behind John F. Kennedy as the       President declared to Germany and the world ``Ich bin ein Berliner,''       no doubt sparking a lifelong passion for Democratic politics.        A world traveler, Bob adores spending time in Rome, Italy--his second       favorite city behind Portland. On their first trip to the city back in       1983, Bob's wife Barre became so ill, she had to undergo emergency       surgery. Spending time in that Roman hospital, surrounded by the       constant traffic of generous and caring visitors, the two fell in love       with the city and the Italian people, wanting to spend as much time       there as they could.        A self-described ``frustrated architect,'' Bob has been involved in       renovating and restoring a number of historic buildings around       Portland, including the former Portland police headquarters that was       originally built in 1912 and which is where the law firm he founded       more than 40 years ago, Stoll Berne, can be found.        It is through that firm that Bob has worked tirelessly, over the       course of his long and distinguished legal career, to help others. He       has tried over 150 cases--both jury and nonjury cases--in State and       Federal courts that cover nearly the entire gamut of criminal and civil       law.        But the majority of Bob's cases were focused on large complex       financial litigation like securities, antitrust, and class actions in       which he fought time and again on behalf of small investors and the       less fortunate. All you have to do is look at the class-action suit       against Exxon Mobile Corp after the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez       supertanker in Alaska's Prince William Sound that resulted in an 11-      million-gallon oil spill. Bob led the Oregon State trial team and       served on the committee that organized suits filed by more than 32,000       plaintiffs like small business and fisherman effected by the spill.        Bob also stood up for residents of the Fairview Hospital and Training       Center when the hospital ignored a statute to continue       institutionalizing patients past the age of 18 without reason. He also       took up the case of State hospital patients who were left with no       financial resources upon release, after the State laid claim to all       their Social Security benefits. A former associate justice of Oregon's       State supreme court once described Bob in a news article as ``a well-      grounded, common-sensical legal expert, to the point where people as       high up in our system as the governor seek him out for personal counsel       on complicated legal issues and political matters.''        And, as the long-time vice chair of Oregon's Democratic Party who got       his start in politics running Lyndon Johnson's 1964 Presidential       campaign in the State, Bob has indeed been an incredible source of       political counsel and leadership to so many. Among his many       achievements on behalf of the Democratic Party is launch of the       informal Oregon Progressives group that transformed Oregon politics by       building out civic engagement infrastructure like robust voter files       and supported new organizations that brought stakeholders together       around a shared agenda, especially on things like ballot measures.        But Bob's contributions to our State and to our country have gone far       beyond his legal career and his political work. A strong believer in       giving back to the community, Bob has regularly provided legal services       to poor and minority communities, helped mentor ``at risk'' children,       and served on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's first Consumer       Advisory Board, where he championed ordinary Americans dealing with the       powerful financial services industry.        On top of all that, he has also poured himself into the work of       finding solutions to the homeless crisis that has plagued our State,       especially Portland. He has helped raise the financing for the       construction of temporary transition shelters, like Harbor for Hope's       River District Navigation Center under the Broadway Bridge, and       inspired Portland State University's Homelessness Research and Action       Collaborative to conduct a far more accurate and in-depth report on the       scale of the homelessness crisis over a single year. Bob's most visible       work in this area, though, is as a board member of Here Together, a       coalition of service providers, business leaders, elected officials,       leaders from communities of color and faith, and community advocates       who all refuse to believe that homelessness in our community is an       unsolvable problem. In this role, Bob helped craft and pass a regional       supportive housing services ballot measure which targets the root       causes of the problem through a dedicated funding source to pay for       mental health, addiction and recovery services, case management,       housing supports, and other proven solutions to the complex challenge       of chronic homelessness.        The website for his firm, Stoll Berne, has this to say about Bob:       ``If our lives are only half as full as Robert's has been, we will all       feel as though we have lived a life and a half.'' As we look back on       and celebrate Bob Stoll's 80th birthday, I cannot think of anything       more fitting to describe this great legal and political son of the       Beaver State. And I join all those who have paid tribute and have sent       their affections and best wishes in honor of this special       occasion.                                      ____________________
