 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  trailblazer and Springfield, Illinois, native, Frank Mitchell, who on  Christmas Day at age 70, unfortunately passed away after a fight with  lung cancer.   In the spring of 1965 Frank made history right here in the House of  Representatives when he became the first African American page since  Reconstruction. Nominated by the late Congressman Paul Findley, who  represented what makes up much of the 18th Congressional District  today, Frank was appointed by then-House Republican leader and future  President, Gerald Ford.   As a page, Frank answered calls in the Republican Cloakroom, worked  on the House floor, and witnessed many historic events, including the  civil rights movement and the debate on the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Frank's historic appointment was long overdue, and he blazed a path  for those who followed him with his work ethic and compassion for  everyone he encountered. Frank often said that he couldn't fail because  the door of opportunity had to remain open. Frank succeeded in every  respect, keeping that door of opportunity open for generations to come.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the Mitchell family, and may Frank  rest in peace.                            ____________________
