 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National  Defense Authorization Act.   The heart of our Nation's defense capabilities runs right through the  congressional district that I serve, from the Rock Island Arsenal to  aerospace manufacturing in Rockford, to the Peoria Air National Guard  Base.   Because of COVID-19, the last several months have relied on the  service of our National Guard in new ways.   The Peoria Air National Guard set up health clinics and testing  centers in Bloomington, Illinois. They built a field hospital when  Chicago needed it most. They have protected and served us throughout  this pandemic. They deserve our support, and the National Defense  Authorization Act will do just that.   I was proud to help secure provisions that protect the benefits of  our National Guard members that they have earned, expand student loan  benefits to make sure that they have a bright future ahead, and to give  our men in uniform a much-earned pay raise.   The district I represent is steeped in rich tradition of service to  our Nation. The bipartisan defense package that we passed this week  honors and upholds that tradition.                            ____________________
