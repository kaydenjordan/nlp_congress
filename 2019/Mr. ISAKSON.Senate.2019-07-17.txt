 Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York for  his tireless work to ensure that the brave men and women who selflessly  responded to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, receive the  compensation and care they deserve. Out of respect for his work and  their sacrifice I do not want to hold up the passage of this bill.  However, I think it is also important that we remember the other  Americans who have suffered and lost loved ones at the hands of foreign  terrorists. In 1979, a group of Americans were taken hostage from the  U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran.   In 1981, after 444 days of torture, 52 of them were finally released.  Years later, I had the opportunity to meet with several of these brave  Americans who reside in my State. In 2015, I worked with my colleagues  in this body to ensure that these victims, their families, and other  victims of international terrorism were able to receive compensation  through the creation of the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism  Fund. Congress was clear that this fund was created specifically to  help the Tehran hostages and other victims of state-sponsored terrorism  who were not eligible to participate in other compensation funds.   However, due to a misinterpretation of the statute, the fund has  become overwhelmed. This year will mark the 40th anniversary of the  Iran Hostage Crisis. Time is not on our side. People who have been  waiting for decades are now dying without the compensation they were  promised.   Will Senator Schumer work with me and Chairman Graham to secure a  solution to this problem in the next appropriate vehicle so that the  Tehran hostages and other victims of state-sponsored terrorism can  finally receive their due?
