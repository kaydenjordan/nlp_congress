 Madam Speaker, it is very much an honor to share  the podium with my colleagues from Utah. Utah is a very special, very  unique place.   At this time of Thanksgiving, I would like to focus on what Utah  really is. We often get lauded as having the lowest unemployment in the  country and the strongest economy in the country, or as the fastest  growing State in the country. What Utah is, is the most philanthropic  State in the country. It shares more volunteer hours and dollars than  any other State. That is the type of stuff that our delegation and  Members of Congress, the community that we serve, are really proud of.  We reflect on that often, particularly during this time of year.   We are more than a week away from Thanksgiving Day. Like Utahns  across the State, my family--and I have three little boys, a fourth boy  on the way, and an amazing wife who deals with a lot during this crazy  time of my time in Washington. We look forward to this annual  opportunity to come together, enjoy each other's company, and give  thanks for all of our many blessings.   Turkey and stuffing are staples, but each Thanksgiving Day looks a  little different from the last. That is okay. Unfortunately, this  year's Thanksgiving is going to be much more difficult than others.   Americans are bracing for this year's turkey tax, which we expect to  be the most expensive in modern history as inflation rates hit their  highest level in decades.   My colleagues from Utah can talk about this a little bit better than  I can because they are a little bit older than I am, but they talk  about how this hasn't been this high in the last 40 years. That is how  old I am.   I don't want to experience this type of inflation. I haven't had to  yet, and I am very concerned about what we are going to have to  experience.   That was not a cut at their age.   According to the Department of Labor, the Consumer Price Index for  October was 6.2 percent, the highest in over three decades. This high  rate means that, compared to last year, home heating will be 50 percent  more expensive, a gallon of gas will be 61 percent more expensive, and  the cost of groceries will be 5.4 percent more expensive. Beef is 20  percent higher; pork is 14 percent higher; and the cost of used cars is  26 percent higher.   This is data. This is directly related to policy decisions here in  Washington.   As Utahns get ready to celebrate Thanksgiving and find reprieve from  this challenging past year-and-a-half, inflation is threatening to  stifle this entire time of year.   In fact, real wages have decreased in 7 of President Biden's first 9  months in office. As President Biden rushes to spend trillions more, as  he is doing now, to spend trillions more as of this week, economic  pressure will only continue to drive everyday costs up and incomes  down.   The Wall Street Journal editorial board said: ``The current burst of  inflation isn't an accident. . . . This is the result of reckless  policy.'' This is simply incompetence.   CNN noted President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan fueled  inflation by sparking demand that it could not keep pace with.   Even The Washington Post editorial board--I did not expect to ever be  using sort of liberal media outlets to defend some of my points when I  came to the House floor. But The Washington Post says that you cannot  ignore that the American Rescue Plan bears some of this blame.                                time  1815    We cannot simply spend more. We have to stop President Biden's tax- and-spend monstrosity.   All of this comes as the administration botched a military exit from  Afghanistan, created a sustained crisis at the border, and has failed  to address a looming debt crisis.   With this as the backdrop, Thanksgiving may feel uniquely  challenging. Yet, through the most difficult times in our Nation's  history, Thanksgiving Day has been a celebration when communities come  together to give thanks for life's great blessings.   Following the Battle of Gettysburg in October of 1863, President  Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving to be a national holiday to ``heal the  wounds of the Nation.''   As our Nation experiences great challenges, I can't think of a better  holiday to observe this coming week.   My colleagues and I in the Utah delegation are working every day to  carve a more prosperous path forward for our State and communities.  There is hope on the horizon.   Earlier this month, Democrats and Republicans in this House came  together to pass the Fiscal State of the Nation Resolution, which I  cosponsored. If agreed to in the Senate, this resolution will mandate  the U.S. Comptroller General conduct an annual joint session before the  members of the House and Senate Budget Committees to provide a report  on the fiscal health of our Nation.   This is a huge, important time to have done something like that after  what we have seen over the last year. This expertise would provide our  leaders with the information they need to correct our course and back  away from our patterns of destructive spending.   Back home, I have also convened a debt and deficit task force, which  has provided me an opportunity to work with local leaders to begin  crafting innovative solutions to our Nation's debt crisis.   My colleagues from Utah and I genuinely hope to help those in our  home  [[Page H6313]]  State find more blessings in the days, months, and years ahead. As we  work toward those brighter days, let us reflect and be grateful for the  good moments we have had this year.   Though our year has been filled with difficulty, it has also been  filled with, in the words of Lincoln, ``the blessings of fruitful  fields and healthful skies.''   Today, I am back in Washington with my colleagues to continue the  important work we do on behalf of Utahns. I look forward to next week  when I will join my family and the community in Utah in celebrating  this important holiday.
