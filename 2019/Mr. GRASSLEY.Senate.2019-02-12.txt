 Madam President, today I wish to acknowledge Emilia  DiSanto, an outstanding civil servant who is retiring after almost 36  years of distinguished service in the Federal Government, 16 of which  were here on Capitol Hill.   Emilia is a proud New Yorker, who graduated from Fordham Law School.  She served in the Department of Energy, at the Legal Services  Corporation, in both the House and Senate, and she worked for  inspectors general.   Emilia is the ultimate civil servant who worked in both the executive  and legislative branches of government. During her 16-year career on  Capitol Hill, Emilia worked for, among others, Speaker Newt Gingrich  and former-Representative Bill Goodling, Henry Hyde, Bill McCollum, and  Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. In the Senate, Emilia served as staff  director for the Small Business Committee for Senator Kit Bond and,  later, Senator Olympia Snow.   I had the pleasure of having Emilia on my staff in two different  capacities. First, as the chief investigative counsel for the Special  Committee on Aging where she conducted oversight of the nursing and  funeral home industries. Emilia later served on the Finance Committee  as my chief investigative counsel and special counsel and tackled such  issues as drug and device safety, medical conflicts of interest, and  other healthcare issues. She is known to be trustworthy, bold, honest,  and bipartisan. Emilia has boundless energy and good judgment, and she  is deeply committed to the interests of the American people. The  American people are better off because of her public service.                            ____________________
