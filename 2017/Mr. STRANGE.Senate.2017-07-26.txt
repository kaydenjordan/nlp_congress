 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today in defense of those who  cannot defend themselves. After 8 years of policies that have  undermined the sanctity of life, we have an opportunity today to extend  the protections of the Hyde amendment wider than ever before.   After 8 years of a failed social experiment that subverted the will  of a majority of Americans and denied rights of conscience and  religious freedom, we have an opportunity to ensure that taxpayer  dollars will not contribute to the scourge of abortion under any  circumstance.   As we consider options to fix our nation's failing healthcare system,  partisan lines cut deeper on abortion than on any other issue. However,  we should all be able to agree that taxpayer funds have no place in  funding abortions.   I also hope we can agree that our society cannot be truly prosperous  until it respects the rights of the most vulnerable among us. If we  fail to stand for those who cannot stand for themselves, then the words  of our founding documents, the words inscribed in the halls of this  building, and the truths we each hold in our hearts mean nothing.   To that end, I will be offering a motion to waive the point of order  on Hyde amendment protections as we work to solve our healthcare  crisis. Today, and every day, I stand for life. I am joined by  colleagues who understand what is at stake, and I thank Senator Enzi  for his leadership.   I yield the floor.
