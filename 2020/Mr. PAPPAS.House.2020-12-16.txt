 Madam Speaker, I rise to remember the life and legacy of  State Representative Dick Hinch, the speaker of the New Hampshire  House. I was deeply saddened last week when I learned of the sudden  passing of Speaker Hinch. He was yet another American we have lost due  to COVID-19.   Dick was a dedicated elected official for the people of Merrimack,  the town he represented at the State house for six terms. Just a week  before his passing on December 2, Dick was sworn in as the new speaker  of the New Hampshire House, a role he considered to be the honor of his  life.   I saw him on election day, when he warmly greeted me at his polling  place just like everyone else coming to vote. It didn't matter that I  was a Democrat and he was a Republican. He knew that public service was  a higher calling, and he treated everyone with the utmost respect.   Dick was a happy warrior and embodied the spirit of New Hampshire's  citizen legislature. We are better off because of his decades of work  on behalf of the people of Merrimack and New Hampshire.   My thoughts are with his wife, Pat, and their children, as well as  his family, friends, and colleagues, during this difficult time. May he  rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for getting this  important legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7105, a crucial piece of  veterans legislation that aptly bears the name of our distinguished  ranking member, Dr. Roe.   The bill now includes three pieces of legislation that I introduced  to ensure VA is able to fulfill its mission of supporting all those who  have borne the battle. These three provisions will help improve the  quality of care and address deficiencies that frustrate and even harm  our veterans.   The first requires VA to address bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse,  and mismanagement identified by the Government Accountability Office's  High Risk List.   A second provisions honors the sacrifices of our female veterans by  ensuring they have access to properly fitted prosthetic items, just as  their male counterparts do.   The third focuses on punitive debt collection practices by VA against  our veterans, many of whom have done everything right. This provision  sets limits on when VA may initiate collection proceedings and even  gives our veterans the ability to update crucial benefit information  online.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the House and Senate committees for getting this  bipartisan bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to pass this  legislation today.
