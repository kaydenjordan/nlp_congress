 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask unanimous  consent for the confirmation of a highly qualified nominee standing  ready to lead the greatest military the world has ever known.   As we speak, it is no secret that Vladimir Putin's unprovoked and  deadly war is raging in Ukraine. Russia, along with China, Iran, North  Korea, and other adversaries, is actively working to erode our national  security and undermine democratic principles across the world.   Just last month, I had the opportunity to visit our troops stationed  in Eastern Europe. I could not have been prouder of these brave  American servicemembers who are at the tip of the spear protecting our  democracy. They have literally dedicated their lives to defending our  freedoms and the freedoms of our allies. These men and women need our  support, and they are depending on us to do our part and confirm  quality candidates to serve in strategic leadership roles.   With that in mind, I would ask to confirm Rheanne Wirkkala of  Maryland as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs.  This nominee's years of service at the Defense Intelligence Agency, as  a senior staffer in the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence, and as a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense  make her immensely qualified to serve in this position.   Our national security is critically important. It is a fundamental  responsibility of this body, and we must take action to make sure we  have the best people in the positions to defend our democracy and our  national security.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 993; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask for a  unanimous consent request on the confirmation of a highly qualified  nominee standing ready to help lead the greatest military this world  has ever known.   Last month, I had the opportunity to go to Eastern Europe. I had the  opportunity to visit with folks, to visit with our troops who are out  there on the frontlines. I could not have been prouder of these folks  who are placed far, far, far away from the United States, fighting the  fight, stopping Russian aggression, and doing what they need to help  protect our democracy and, quite frankly, the democracies around the  world.   It is our responsibility, as the U.S. Senate, to ensure that these  folks have the support they need to protect our national security and  defend our country against foreign adversaries like Russia.   It is going to happen with the appropriations process. Hopefully, we  will get a top-line number very, very soon, and we will get that done  in December.   But equally important is the kind of leaders we have in our military.  We have to have capable leaders; otherwise, things won't happen as  Congress intends them to. When these positions are left open, the  military has their hands tied behind their back. I might add, this is  the biggest budget by far in the United States of America.   I had a visit with Senator Lee, and he is going to raise some  important points today. I understand where he is coming from. I also  got notification today that the Secretary of Defense is going to meet  with Senator Lee on the 23rd of November. I intend to hold them to that  so that Senator Lee can bring up the challenges that he sees, and  hopefully there will be good faith involved on both sides and a  solution can be found, if there is a solution to be found.   I can't emphasize enough how, if we want to hold people accountable  to spend the money right, that we appropriate--if we want to hold  people accountable for doing the job of protecting this country and  defending democracy and our freedoms, we have to have people in these  critical positions.   For that reason, we have a nominee before us today as Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Security and Intelligence--let me say it  again--Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Security and Intelligence.  This is a very, very important position when it comes to our security.   Milancy Danielle Harris is her name. She has an incredible resume  within the intelligence community. She has proven leadership within the  DOD. There is no doubt in my mind that she will make the world a safer  place, and that is why it is critically important today to confirm this  nominee.   I am a U.S. Senator, just like the good Senator from Utah, and I can  tell that you when we ask questions, we want answers. When we have  problems, we like to find solutions.   I am willing to commit to the Senator from Utah today that I will  work with you to try to help you find solutions, but we really need to  get this nominee confirmed.   With that in mind, I want to ask unanimous consent that, as in  executive session, the Senate consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 1153, Milancy Danielle Harris, to be Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I wish to say this: The Senator from Utah  has every right to object, and he has every right to get his questions  answered, but we are 2 years into this administration. I hear every day  folks from the other side of the aisle get up and rail on the Biden  administration for not doing this and not doing that. That is patently  unfair if we can't get people confirmed to the positions that need to  be confirmed 2 years after he was sworn into the Presidency.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to share a few words today to  acknowledge the 30th anniversary of the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast  Cancer Campaign and the important work this organization has done to  expand breast cancer awareness.   When Evelyn H. Lauder cocreated the pink ribbon and launched the  campaign back in 1992, breast cancer research was underfunded and few  folks understood the dangers of this deadly disease.   In the past three decades, the Pink Ribbon Campaign has led the  charge to raise awareness and collect funds for lifesaving breast  cancer research and treatment. The campaign and charitable foundation  has collectively dedicated more than $108 million to fund research,  education, and medical services, including therapy and counseling  services, as well as expanded access to mammograms and screenings for  vulnerable groups with limited access to healthcare.   Like too many folks across this country, the disease touched my  family when my wife, Sharla, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020.  Fortunately, Sharla caught it early, and 2 years after her final  chemotherapy treatment, she is cancer-free.   We often hear that ``it takes a village''--well, when it comes to  cancer, that saying is true. We couldn't have gotten through Sharla's  treatment without the tireless efforts of Montana's top-notch medical  professionals, support staff, and fierce advocates like the ones  working with the Pink Ribbon Campaign, who have moved the needle in the  fight against breast cancer nationwide.   So today, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Pink Ribbon  Campaign, I want to stress that breast cancer is no joke. Check  yourself often and get regular screenings. Early detection can save  your life.   Thank you to the folks at the campaign for 30 years of lifesaving  work. Because of you, we are closer than ever to achieving a breast  cancer free world once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to Lauren Sahagun during the pendency of the  117th Congress.
