 Mr. President, I rise, along with Senator Capito, today  to say a few words on behalf of S. 3742, Recycling Infrastructure and  Accessibility Act of 2022, and S. 3743, the Recycling Composting  Accountability Act.   Senator Capito and I have the pleasure of leading the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee. With the legislation that we  are about to discuss here, along with Senator Boozman--Senator Boozman  is on his way. We are all a part of the Recycling Caucus in the U.S.  Senate. We work with our  [[Page S3753]]  staffs and others outside of this body in order to make possible this  legislation, to debate it, to report it. And if I am not mistaken,  Senator Capito reported it unanimously out of our committee, as we do  with so much legislation.   These bills were introduced by Senator Capito and myself and Senator  Boozman. As an avid recycler and composter, for a long time I have long  believed in environmental stewardship. After all, we have a moral duty  to leave behind a cleaner, healthier planet for our children.   Senator Capito and I are both born in West Virginia. My sister and I  grew up along Beaver Creek, right outside of Beckley. My dad used to  take me and my grandfather fishing and hunting, even at a young age,  along the New River and other parts of Raleigh County. One of the  things that my dad and my grandfather always made clear to me was that  if we are out in a boat and there was trash or something in the water  or there was something that could be recycled, to pull it out of the  water and to put it in something we were carrying and take it home. The  idea was to try to leave our State--West Virginia then--better, better  than we found it. So from a very early age in West Virginia, I really  had those values instilled in me. And they still are. We instilled them  in our sons too.   But we have a moral obligation to leave behind a cleaner, healthier  planet for our children. There are many ways to meet that moral  obligation. One of those is to make sure that the products that can be  recycled, we recycle them. We don't have to landfill them. We can  actually address the climate change in a very positive way but  especially with respect to aluminum cans and things like that that we  recycle.   I wish I could stand here today to say our recycling rate in Delaware  is 100 percent, West Virginia is 100 percent, or the country is 100  percent; it is not. The recycling rate in our country is something like  35 percent. It is like getting a grade in school. If you get a 35 on a  paper or test, that is a failing grade. With respect to recycling,  unfortunately, we are racking up failing grades year after year after  year, and we ought to do something about it. As it turns out, we can.  Part of that doing something about it is the legislation before us  today.   We have to do more when it comes to improving our Nation's recycling  and our composting efforts. These bills would take action to address  several of the challenges facing America's recycling efforts.   One of the challenges that we face is the availability of good data.  That might sound strange, but it is true. This past November, for  example, the Environmental Protection Agency, though, released its  first-ever National Recycling Strategy. Now, that is kind of late to  the game, but it is better to be late to the game than not to be there  at all. It turns out it is a good document. It is a document that  reflects input that we provided, our staffs provided, others on our  committee, and across the country provided. And to the EPA's credit,  they accepted that input, and they actually did something with it. So  it is reflected in the National Recycling Strategy that was  promulgated.   The document offers a transformative vision for shrinking our  Nation's waste management efforts, and it also highlights the need for  greater standardization around data collection.    To address this, Senator Boozman and I developed the Recycling and  Composting Accountability Act. Senator Boozman, myself, Senator Capito,  and others are part of the Recycling Caucus here in the Senate, a  bipartisan group that focuses on how do we promote and encourage  recycling, not just on Capitol Hill, not just in the District of  Columbia, not just on the east coast, not just in West Virginia but  across the country from coast to coast.   Our legislation, the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act,  would improve EPA's ability to gather data on our Nation's recycling  systems and explore opportunities for implementing a national  composting strategy.   Another area where we can improve is by increasing access to  recycling. Many Americans in disadvantaged communities want to recycle,  they want to compost, but they are unable to do so. That is because  they live in neighborhoods that lack curbside pickup, bottle return,  and other necessary recycling infrastructure.   Senator Capito's Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act would  help address this by creating a pilot program at EPA to improve  recycling services in underserved areas. This legislation would bring  many communities into the recycling world, including those in urban and  suburban areas, while also protecting our environment.   I commend Senator Capito for her work and her leadership on this  bill. I want to commend her staff and my staff, led by Mary Frances  Repko, who is our staff director, and Adam on the other side of the  aisle. Members don't do this by themselves, as we know, and we are  really blessed with terrific staff who help us put these provisions  together.   I commend Senator Capito heartily for her work and her leadership on  this legislation, her support of the legislation Senator Boozman and I  have offered.   I want to work with her to make sure that this bill helps jump-start  recycling in communities with the greatest need, especially those who  have been historically left behind, and there are too many of those.   Both of these bills that we will have an opportunity to consider here  today are the result of a true collaboration and reflect a substantial  amount of bipartisan efforts dedicated to explore our Nation's  recycling and composting challenges.   I know a lot of people, if you watch the news, whether it is the  television or on the radio, newspapers, you read online, they think all  we do here is fight with one another; that we never find anything like  common ground on important issues like the one we are talking about  right now. The committee that Senator Capito and I are privileged to  lead actually reports out important legislation, including bipartisan  infrastructure legislation, all kinds of issues that enjoy bipartisan  support, unanimous bipartisan support.                                   S. 3743     So with that, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 358, S. 3743.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask that Senator Boozman, who is a  charter member of the Senate Recycling Caucus, be recognized to speak  on behalf of these measures, which he has played a key role on.    Mr. President, I just want to say again my thanks to--I  think I am pretty rabid on recycling, but this fellow from Arkansas is  right there with me. I appreciate very much both your leadership and  Senator Capito's.   I think we are going to shift gears here. We just passed two very  significant recycling bills for our country. This is something that I  am thrilled about, and I know Senator Capito is as well. And we are  going to shift gears and take some time to consider other important  legislation: the Water Resources Development Act.   Senator Cardin, who chairs the subcommittee, has jurisdiction on the  water resources bill. I think he is prepared to speak.   I think I need to make a unanimous consent request before we do that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and consider H.R. 7776, as provided for  under the previous order.    Mr. President, with that, I would please yield to the  chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Water  Resources Development Act, Ben Cardin.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cramer not just  for his words but--I will take my mask off--not just for his words but  for his great participation, he and his staff, in this effort.   I don't think it has been said in our short time we have been on the  floor here this morning: In the subcommittee, we don't just make up  this legislation. We have a tradition of reaching out to other Senate  offices. We reached out to all 100 Senate offices. We ask everybody-- Democrat, Republican, a couple of Independents--and say: What are your  priorities? What would you like to see prioritized, included in this  legislation?   We received feedback and input from, I think, every single office.  And we have tried to reflect that input in this legislation.   So this is very much a community effort. And for everyone who has  participated, thank you for doing so and putting us in a position today  to vote and, hopefully, in an affirmative way.   Before we do vote, I just want to express one more time my very, very  strong support for the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. As we  have heard before this bill: Affectionately known as WRDA, it is an  ambitious, bipartisan water resources package that ensures the timely  reauthorization of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer studies and  projects. The bill also equips the Corps with critical authorities to  restore ecosystems and protect communities from climate-change- exacerbated events like flooding and drought.   This legislation is a product of tireless commitment to  bipartisanship and doing the right thing. Senator Capito, Senator  Cardin, Senator Cramer, and myself and our staffs look past the party  differences and find, once more, a path forward on critical  infrastructure needs, just as we did last year on the bipartisan  infrastructure bill that the President signed into law late last year.    This is not the first time we have done this, and it won't be the  last. This Congress, the Environmental Public Works Committee, has  consistently advanced bipartisan legislation on drinking water;  legislation on wastewater;  [[Page S3759]]  legislation on transportation--roads, highways, bridges--and on  recycling just today, just today. All of those bills passed EPW  unanimously, just like this Army Corps of Engineers bill passed  unanimously.   As EPW chairman, I am quite proud of the committee's work. I just  wish that everybody in the country who thinks that all we do is fight  around here and agree on nothing--I wish they had a chance to kind of  tune in and maybe be a fly on the wall and hear how when you work  together, you can get some amazing stuff done and really important,  really important things, as well, for all of our States, for every  corner of this country.   A word, if I could, about the Army Corps of Engineers. I am a Navy  guy. I spent something like 23 years Active Reserve Duty. I am the last  Vietnam veteran serving here. But I have huge respect--huge respect-- for the Army Corps of Engineers. I like to say: Different uniforms,  same team. And in my State and, frankly, all 50 States, they do  extraordinary work--sometimes without a lot of recognition, without a  lot of thanks. And I just want to say, we recognize you in Delaware; we  recognize you even in the Navy; and we are deeply grateful for the work  that you do, the great work you do. We couldn't do a lot of what we do  without your help. And this legislation is needed for the Army Corps to  meet their responsibilities and obligations.   But all the bills that I mentioned earlier passed committee  unanimously, as did this bill. And, again, we are so proud of the  committee's work.   What a joy it is to work with Senator Capito. And I wish I could say  the same thing about her staff. No. I am just joking.   Adam, you know we love working with you and your team, and we are  really privileged.   We were privileged to be led on our side of the staff by Mary Frances  Repko, who is new at this. She has not worked long for many weeks or  months on the Hill. Actually, she has probably for a quarter of a  century or so, and I think she started at the age of 12. She has done a  lot, and she still has a lot of gas in the tank.   But going back to the Corps--the Corps is the principal steward of  our Nation's water infrastructure, and it serves both as a facilitator  and protector of our diverse economy.   This bill--WRDA 2022--recognizes that the Corps is an essential part  of our lives. This bill takes critical steps to better support the  Agency as it serves all parts of our country. From navigation to  ecosystem restoration and flood control, the Corps is the backbone-- really, the foundation, if you will, on which our country was built.   I would like to reiterate that every provision in this bill is the  result of bipartisan work. I can confidently say that WRDA 2022 will  benefit all corners of our nation--from Alaska to California to  Kentucky to New York, from Maryland to rural towns and every place in  between.   Again, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to staff on the  Democratic side, the majority staff, and to Senator Capito's staff on  the minority side, the Republican side.   Actually, you can walk into a meeting, some of the meetings we have  with Senator Capito and myself and our staffs, and if you didn't know  who worked for whom, you wouldn't know. You wouldn't know, which I  think is an amazing thing, a wonderful thing.   With that in mind, again, I want to thank again my staff and Senate  Capito's staff who worked so hard. I want to recognize, again, Mary  Frances Repko and Adam Tomlinson for their dedicated leadership on the  Democratic side and the Republican side of our committee.   I also want to thank Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend,  Katherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, Haden Miller, Mayely Boyce, Tyler  Hofmann Reardon, Jordan Baugh, Milo Goodell, Janine Barr, and John  Kane--especially John Kane--for their tireless efforts.   John, you are a force of nature. And thank you very, very much for  your great leadership.   I would like to say, again--I just said that, so I am not going to  say that again. I also want to thank Amy Klein and David Wethington of  the Corps--Amy Klein and David Wethington of the Corps--for their  countless hours of technical assistance and support as the bill was  developed.   In closing, I want to encourage all of our colleagues to join us in  supporting this excellent bill, because every State stands to benefit  from the legislation before us today.   Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the Water Resources  Development Act of 2022, affectionately known as WRDA. Not only is this  biennial legislation an ambitious water resources bill, it is also the  product of a tireless commitment to bipartisanship. Earlier this year,  we reached out to all 100 Senators to solicit their input for this  legislation. We developed this legislation using that feedback, and in  May, we advanced this legislation out of the Environment and Public  Works Committee by a vote of 20 to 0, something I am quite proud of as  EPW chairman.   In these times of partisan divide, it is not often we see legislation  receive unanimous support. But, as we all know, bipartisan solutions  are lasting solutions. That is how I think we should approach much of  our work in the Senate--by reaching across the aisle to find lasting  solutions, where possible, to the problems we face as a nation. The  bill before us today is a result of that partnership.   Before I delve into all we accomplish in this bill, let me thank  everyone who played a role in its development--especially our EPW  committee ranking member, Senator Capito, our Transportation and  Infrastructure Subcommittee chair, Senator Cardin, our subcommittee  ranking member, Senator Cramer, every member of our committee, and the  members of our staffs. I also want to thank the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers for supporting us throughout the drafting process.   This legislation continues the 2-year cycle for WRDA. By passing it,  we will ensure timely authorization of the Army Corps' studies and  projects. This work is critical in supporting our economy, restoring  critical ecosystems, and protecting communities from climate change and  extreme weather events like flooding and drought.   When we talk about WRDA, I cannot overstate just how important the  Army Corps' work is in the lives of Americans across the country. The  Corps is the principal steward of our Nation's water infrastructure.  That includes our beaches, our waterways, and our flood control  systems. Without the enactment of WRDA, our economy could well grind to  a halt.   The Corps operates and maintains America's water highway, a 12,000- mile-long system of inland waterways with 209 locks that are vital to  domestic and international commerce. Each year, more than 500 million  tons of commodities move through this system, including 60 percent of  our Nation's agricultural exports. Operating and maintaining this  extensive network results in an economic benefit of nearly $14 billion  each year for our country.   In addition to managing the waterways that connect our ports to world  commerce, the Army Corps of Engineers is also responsible for ensuring  safe, reliable, and efficient navigation at our coastal ports. As we  have seen over the past 2 years, navigable shipping channels are  essential to keeping global supply chains moving.   More than 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade volume moves through the  13,000 miles of coastal channels maintained by the Corps, supporting  over 30 million jobs across the country. Cargo activity at our Nation's  ports supports more than a quarter of the U.S. economy. And, over the  next decade, an estimated $66 billion in future investment will be  needed to ensure continued domestic job creation and economic growth.   Recognizing the economic importance of our Nation's inland shipping  channels, WRDA 2022 adjusts the Inland Waterways Trust Fund cost share  to expedite much needed project improvements.   The legislation also addresses the harbor deepening and maintenance  needs of commercially significant ports, as well as underserved  community harbors. While commercially significant ports are vital to  our Nation's economy, community harbors are similarly important to  local and regional economies.  [[Page S3760]]    WRDA 2022 ensures that these community harbors, which provide  essential fishing, recreation, and navigation services, will continue  to receive maintenance that will allow for their continued use.   As a recovering Governor, I often like to say that it is our  responsibility as elected officials to create a nurturing environment  for job creation and job preservation. Maintaining our ports and  coastal waterways is a cornerstone of that nurturing environment.   The Corps is also a leader in flood and storm damage mitigation and  ecosystem restoration. In addition to managing over 700 dams and more  than 13,000 miles of levees and floodwalls, it restores and nourishes  the Nation's dunes and beaches, constructs and maintains wetlands and  floodplains, and protects shorelines and riverbanks.   In total, the Corps' flood and coastal storm risk management  activities, and infrastructure portfolio, provide the nation an  economic benefit of nearly $260 billion in damage prevention and  reduction. This is critical to understand because more than 40 percent  of our Nation's population lives in coastal counties. If coastal  counties were their own nation, they would rank third in the world in  gross domestic product--beaten out only by China and the United States  as a whole.   This work is especially important for the communities I represent in  Delaware. Earlier this year, on the Saturday before Mother's Day, a  nor'easter pummeled beaches up and down the Delmarva Peninsula. When I  toured the damage, it was staggering to think that in 2 weeks, these  communities needed to be ready for the first real beach season since  the start of the COVID pandemic.   While many beaches had experienced severe erosion and destruction,  the dune system that the Corps had built worked as designed and  protected Delmarva communities from the storm. Homes and buildings  remained intact. Businesses could still operate. States were prepared  to handle the storm because of the work that the Army Corps had done.  Now, we are working with the Corps to rebuild these beaches, which are  the lifeblood of our States' economies.   Water, as we all know, is essential for life and a critical input  into virtually all economic activity. It is hard--in fact, it is  impossible--to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,  without the use of water and water-related infrastructure.  Unfortunately, climate change is fueling extreme weather in the form of  longer and stronger noreasters, hurricanes, and droughts. This  threatens the Corps' ability to be a good steward of our water  infrastructure, as well as that infrastructure's ability to protect and  support our economy.   And this is not just a problem for coastal communities. For inland  communities like those along the Missouri River, climate change means  heavier and more frequent precipitation events, inland flooding,  riverbank erosion, and the inundation of water treatment systems with  sediments and contaminants in some areas. For other communities out  west, climate change means historic droughts, water shortages, and  deeply destructive wildfires.   The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 recognizes these  challenges posed by climate change. It accounts for the new realities  that the Corps faces in carrying out its primary missions and takes  critical steps to address these looming concerns. How?   First, WRDA 2022 overhauls the Corps' project development  authorities, allowing the agency to better address the impacts of  climate change. This will make a big difference in States like Arizona,  where we are witnessing the worst drought conditions along the Colorado  River in 12,000 years.   Under our legislation, the Corps and local project sponsors will, for  the first time, be able to partner and develop cost-shared plans to  address drought risk management and water supply conservation during  the planning, constructing, and operating of water resources  development projects.   Communities in coastal States will also be able to develop projects  that address their specific climate-related impacts. This means that we  will see projects better formulated to combat sea level rise, as well  as back bay flooding or even sunny day tidal changes instead of just  storm surge protection.   In addition to overhauling the Corps' project development  authorities, WRDA 2022 makes clear that the protection and restoration  of shorelines and riverbanks from erosion and other damaging forces is  a primary responsibility. It also improves the Corps' ability to make  shorelines and riverbanks more resilient.   In crafting this legislation, we also made equity a top priority. I  am pleased to report that WRDA 2022 builds on the significant inroads  made in WRDA 2020 to rectify historical inequities for Tribal and  disadvantaged communities.   WRDA 2022 establishes a new Tribal and Disadvantaged Communities  Advisory Committee to help the Corps more effectively deliver projects,  programs, and other assistance to these communities. It also makes  permanent the 2020 pilot programs that cover cost shares for  economically disadvantaged communities.   In addition, this legislation reauthorizes the Corps' Tribal  Partnership Program and makes a series of targeted improvements to  increase opportunities for Tribal communities to partner with the Corps  on essential projects in a more cost-effective way.   Finally, WRDA 2022 establishes a new workforce development and STEM  outreach program at the Corps with a priority to recruit new engineers  from historically disadvantaged communities.   As we move to the consideration of the Water Resources Development  Act of 2022, I am reminded of an old African proverb that goes  something like this: ``If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to  go far, travel together.'' On this bill, we can proudly say that we  have chosen to travel together.   With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to thank my staff  and Ranking Member Capito's staff who together spent tireless hours  drafting and negotiating each provision in this bill.   I would like to recognize our staff directors, Mary Frances Repko and  Adam Tomlinson, for their dedicated leadership.   I would also like to thank Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend,  Katherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, Haden Miller, Mayely Boyce, Tyler  Hofmann-Reardon, Jordan Baugh, Milo Goodell, Janine Barr, and John Kane  for their tireless efforts.   I like to say that if you walked in a room and saw our staff in  discussions, you would be impressed at how well they work together-- even when discussing difficult issues.   I would also like to thank Amy Klein and David Wethington of the  Corps for the countless hours of technical assistance and support as  this bill was developed.   In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Capito and me  in supporting this excellent bill because every State stands to benefit  from the legislation before us today.   I yield the floor.   With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be  yielded back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I rise today to discuss the CHIPS and  Science Act, a bill approved by the Senate yesterday and, I am told,  just approved literally in the last several minutes by the House of  Representatives, a bill that I am proud to be able to support, along  with many of my colleagues.   This bipartisan legislation will invest in our Nation's semiconductor  industry, strengthen America's manufacturing competitive edge over  foreign competitors, and reduce supply chain burdens that exist with  respect to our country and our people. Yesterday's vote marked an  important step in providing America the authority to set the rules of  the road for a 21st-century economy.   I was pleased to join so many of our colleagues in support of this  bill so that States like Delaware and like Nevada can continue to punch  above our weight in the global economy for years to come.   We probably all heard the saying before: ``Today, they don't make  cars like they used to.'' Well, some of my colleagues know and many  folks in Delaware know I can attest to that personally. For two  decades, I drove a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, a silver  one, affectionately called by many the Silver Bullet. It had 600,000  miles on it.   When I went to the DMV and took with me the young man who wanted to  buy it, they asked me how much I was going to sell it for.   I said: $1.   The lady there at the desk at the DMV said: Well, what you have to  do, you have to turn it over and sign on the back of title ``$1.''   So I wrote ``$1,'' and I signed the document, as did the purchaser.   Then the lady at the DMV said: There is a transfer fee you have to  pay for the vehicle.   I said: What is it?   She said: 3 percent.   I said: 3 percent of $1?   She said: Yes.   I pulled a nickel out of my pocket and gave it to her and said: Keep  the change.   But my old minivan is more popular and famous in my little State in a  lot of places than I was.   But anyway, that vehicle had seen every corner of the First State,  with some 600,000 miles to her name. She carried ``Carpertown''  staffers, constituents, family members, and even a future President-- even a future President.   When it came time to retire her early last summer, through anguish  and heartache, I opted for a slight upgrade: a red Tesla Y that maybe  someday will have 600,000 miles on it. We will see.  [[Page S3769]]    Let me tell you, though, they don't make cars like they used to. They  make them a lot better, a whole lot better and a whole lot cleaner as  well.   On top of being fully electric--and let me just say that 2, 3, 4  years ago, our selection of electric vehicles, low-emission, no- emission vehicles, was limited, very limited, and folks from Tesla were  largely outside of the gate.   First, the people from GM had come up with a very good hybrid vehicle  for a number of years, but it took a long time for us to actually get  into the business--both domestic manufacturers and foreign  manufacturers--of building and selling fully electric vehicles.   But on top of being fully electric, right when you step into these  new cars, including the one I own, you see a world of technology in  front of us--a state-of-the-art touchscreen GPS system, backup cameras,  digital heating and air-conditioning controls. It is a far cry from my  own minivan that drove so many miles.   The odometer actually died on me at 500,000 miles. I don't know  exactly how many miles it did have, but it had a lot. But at 500,000  miles, we went to Dover Downs, the Miracle Mile, the Monster Mile,  where they do auto racing and NASCAR racing. They let me drive my  minivan around the track as fast as it would go. Holding the starter  flag out the window, I thought it was going to rip my arm off, but it  didn't. But it didn't.   One ride in a car like my new one, and it is clear, automotive  technology and the American economy have drastically advanced in the  last 20 years. That is thanks, in part, to the advances of  semiconductor technology or, as we sometimes say, chips.   Now, folks at home might have read about chips or may have heard  about some connection with semiconductors and our supply chain woes on  the nightly news, but they still wonder what that has to do with their  everyday lives. So here it is, a little bit of chips 101, a little bit  of chips 101 before I get in my new vehicle and head for the Delaware  State Fair as fast as I can go--legally, legally.   Chips 101: a semiconductor, oftentimes referred to as a chip, is  commonly used material in tech manufacturing made of elements like  silicon that are valued for their ability to manage the flow of  electricity.   In our technology, a chip as small as a puzzle piece or even smaller  than a fingernail is vital to creating the phones that we carry in our  pockets or in our purses, the washing machine in our basements, the  television in our family rooms, and, yes, all that technology in our  new vehicles.   But more than that, the semiconductors have a vital role to play in  some of the medical equipment that monitors our health and in the  weapons systems that protect our country.   But after 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic shock,  unpredictable shutdowns, along with labor shortages and logistic  failures, have led to severe supply chain constraints. These supply  chain issues have caused the same inflation that Americans have seen  play out in empty shelves at your local grocery stores or in new  technology that they have saved up for years to buy but are having a  hard time finding on the market as of late.   Just last month, Senator John Cornyn and I chaired a Finance Trade  Subcommittee hearing, and it was a hearing on supply chain resiliency.  We did it in order to take a look at what is causing supply chain  backlogs and hurting American consumers.   We heard that day from the experts about the need for greater  investments in semiconductor manufacturing here at home and about the  vulnerabilities we face when companies thousands and thousands of miles  away--maybe on the other side of the world--can determine the economic  success of entire American industries. Because our manufacturing sector  relies on this technology, we are beholden to the companies that  produce semiconductors and we are hamstrung--hamstrung--by the delays  that slow these companies down.   That is increasingly a problem when America's share of global chips  production drops from 37 percent--37 percent--in 1990 to just 12  percent today or when more than 75 percent of chips are manufactured in  Asia on the other side of the world. This reliance on foreign  manufacturers makes our economic and our national security vulnerable  to geopolitical shocks from halfway around the planet.   And that is a problem for companies in my State of Delaware and your  State of Nevada, Madam President. But one of the companies that I would  mention from our State is Hologic, and they are located in Newark, DE,  near the University of Delaware, the northern part of our State. They  rely on a reliable stream of chips to produce mammography machines. For  Hologic, a shortage of chips means not just slower production of new  mammography machines but a struggle to replace and repair old machines  that women across our country rely on for vital preventive care to  detect breast cancer.   After more than 2 years of this pandemic and cancer screenings all  too often delayed for months, that means more clinics and doctors'  offices with outdated equipment will offer limited screenings, and that  means more women in States like mine and like yours across America will  have to put screenings that could save their lives on the back burner.   That is just one very serious, real-world example of why these  investments are critical to families and they are critical to  businesses up and down the ``First State'' and across the United  States. So, Madam President, we can and we should take action to  address some of the weaknesses in our economy and to compete with  countries like China in the process.   That is why I am proud to support the CHIPS and Science Act. It is a  much needed investment for the manufacturing of semiconductors and the  development of other critical technologies in our country, and it will  provide tax incentives to make our tech sector the envy of the world  once again.   By investing in American-made chips, we can reduce costs of  technology for Americans, improve supply chain reliability, and we can  create new opportunities and jobs for a lot of American workers.   And by investing in the National Science Foundation and the American  innovation hubs, we have an opportunity to jump-start American  innovation and growth once again.   This legislation will make life a bit easier for businesses and  consumers across America, from car dealerships in Delaware, on the east  coast, and in your State of Nevada, out there in the middle of the  great West--from car dealerships in Delaware that don't have enough  inventory to meet customer demands to manufacturers struggling to  access critical parts and inputs.   As Secretary of Commerce Raimondo and the Defense Secretary have made  clear over the last couple of weeks, including in a briefing that they  held with us, this bill will bolster both our economic and our national  security--but not only that. To not act, to not invest in American jobs  and manufacturing, as Secretary Raimondo described it, would cause--her  words--``irreparable harm to the United States economy and the United  States military operations''--because when America isn't in the  driver's seat, someone else is taking the wheel, and Americans may well  fall behind as a result.   So we have not just an opportunity, I think we have an obligation to  American consumers and to our Nation's workforce to invest right here  at home. The action we are taking should be the beginning rather than  the end of our efforts to strengthen, once again, American economic  competitiveness.   There were many bipartisan ideas on the table through the debate over  this legislation, some ideas that didn't make it into the final bill.  Many of them are worthy of our future consideration. And as the  chairman of the Finance Subcommittee on International Trade that I lead  with Senator Cornyn, I will continue advocating for greater economic  engagement with our allies across the globe and especially-- especially--in the Asia-Pacific.   There is more we can do. I will say that again. There is more we can  do--and must do--to strengthen supply chain resiliency, combat unfair  trade practices, and support the American worker and innovation.   I was proud to vote in favor of the CHIPS and Science Act because,  first and foremost, I serve the people of the ``First State.'' And  yesterday's vote will mean investments that create jobs  [[Page S3770]]  for Delaware workers and States around us. We have a lot of people in  other States who work in Delaware even though they live in Pennsylvania  or New Jersey or in Maryland.   Yesterday's vote will mean support for the technology that keeps our  loved ones healthy and safe, and it will also mean more affordable  goods, delivered faster, to families in the ``First State'' and every  other State.   I want to commend the House of Representatives for the action that  they took today in passing this legislation. And when I leave here  today, I am going to go out and get in that red sports car that I drive  these days. And it has incredible music, just incredible music, as you  probably know. Most cars have that these days. And I think that, first,  I am going to head for the Delaware State Fair, which I love. The first  time I ran for office, that was sort of like where I announced it a  million years ago.   I will probably pick out some music to listen to, and the first song,  I think, is a Willie Nelson song. It is a Willie Nelson song: ``On the  Road Again.'' And I am going to get on the road again and head for the  ``First State,'' for the Delaware State Fair, and look forward to  meeting a lot of people.   I wish you a great weekend. To my colleague Dan Sullivan from Alaska,  the marine colonel who is about to take the floor, have at it. Danny,  it is all yours.   I yield the floor.
