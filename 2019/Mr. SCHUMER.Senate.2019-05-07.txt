 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I have just listened to my friend the  majority leader engage in an astounding bit of whitewash--not  unexpected but entirely unconvincing.   Yes, the Mueller investigation took 2 years, and, yes, it produced a  stunning document in the end--not only a damning appraisal of our  election security and just how willing a major Presidential campaign  was to accept and amplify the disinformation of a foreign adversary but  also a thorough examination of the behavior of a lawless President, who  at least on 11 occasions, according to the report, may have obstructed  a Federal investigation.   So while my friend the majority leader wants to say ``case closed''-- I don't blame them--375 former Federal prosecutors looked at the  Mueller report and said publicly that the conduct of the President  amounts to felony obstruction of justice. In any other case, were he  not President, those prosecutors would have recommended bringing  charges.   Our leader saying ``Let's move on'' is sort of like Richard Nixon  saying ``Let's move on'' at the height of the investigation of his  wrongdoing. Of course he wants to move on. He wants to cover it up. He  wants silence on one of the most serious issues we face--whether a  foreign power can manipulate our elections, the wellspring of our  democracy.   If the leader is sincere, then put election security on the floor.  Let's debate it. Put sanctions on Russia on the floor. Let's debate it.  He doesn't want to move on; he wants to run away from these awful facts  that relate to the wellspring of our democracy--foreign interference in  our election and a President who is lawless. That is what he wants to  push under the rug.   Of course, he would say this is all done. It is not done. If Russia  interferes in 2020, it is not done. If this President or future  Presidents believe that they can avoid the law and even break the law-- at least according to 375 prosecutors--it is not done. This is very  serious stuff.   The leader bemoans ``breathless conspiracy theorizing.'' For a  moment, I thought he was referring to the President and to those House  and Senate Republicans who for 2 years intentionally sought to undercut  Mueller's investigation by peddling farfetched conspiracy theories  about deep state ``coups,'' unmasking scandals, and uranium purchases  to muddy the waters. I guess he meant something about Democrats. But I  don't remember the Republican leader bemoaning those breathless  conspiracies; nor do I remember the Republican leader or the Republican  Senators having such a distaste for congressional oversight during the  Obama administration. On things far less serious, they were relentless  in wanting investigations. Now they say ``never mind'' when the  wellspring of our democracy is at stake, there is foreign interference  in our elections, and a President who just disobeys the law. The leader  sure acted differently a few years back.   What I remember is that from the very beginning, the Republican  leader has not taken the threat of Russia's election interference as  seriously as he should. In the run-up to the 2016 election, when the  Obama administration sought to warn State election officials about  foreign meddling and designate election systems as ``critical  infrastructure,'' Leader McConnell reportedly delayed for weeks,  ``watered down'' the letter from congressional leaders, and pushed back  against the designation. Yes, I would have swept this under the rug if  I had done that. I wouldn't want to keep talking about it.   Despite 2 years in charge of the Senate since the 2016 election,  Leader McConnell has pursued additional election security only after  being prodded by Democrats, and it has been half-baked at that.   Leader McConnell thwarted the Rules Committee from marking up the  bipartisan legislation designed to enhance election security.   At the beginning of the year, 42 Republicans, including Leader  McConnell, essentially voted in favor of the administration's proposal  to weaken sanctions against Russia.   In the last round of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked our  attempt to fund additional efforts to make our election safe in 2020.   Now, despite a preponderance of testimony from our intelligence  officials--not politicians; intelligence officials who are in charge of  our security and well-being--they testified that foreign powers are  ramping up to interfere in our next election. The Senate has done  nothing to grapple with the problem, even as minimal of a request as I  made to the leader: an all-Senators' classified briefing from our  defense and intelligence leaders so that the Senate understands what we  need to do to protect American in 2020 and beyond. I have been asking  for 2 weeks, and we still haven't gotten action.   Let's bring the bipartisan Secure Elections Act to the floor and  debate and amend. Let's strengthen sanctions against Putin and any  other adversary who would dare to interfere with the sanctity of our  elections.   Regardless of what you believe about the President's conduct, we  should all--every single Democrat and every single Republican--be  working to ensure that what happened in 2016 never happens again. We  can debate how much of an effect it had, but we sure don't want it to  be worse--whatever it was--in 2020 than it was in 2016. And the leader  sits on his hands, does nothing, creates a legislative graveyard for  these and every other issue, and then says: Let's move on. No way. No  way. We can do both. We can make our elections more secure. We can  examine what happened so we can make them more secure and do other  issues. So far, Leader McConnell is doing neither.   What we have here is very simple. What we have here is a concerted  effort to circle the wagons to protect the President from  accountability, to whitewash his reprehensible conduct by simply  declaring it irrelevant. In that effort, the leader and Senate  Republicans are falling down drastically on their constitutional duty  to provide oversight and, I fear, to defend the national interest as  well.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me now talk about something  related--the legislative graveyard.   Leader McConnell says: Let's move on and work together. There hasn't  been a single bill put on the floor on issues we can debate, whether it  is protecting preexisting conditions, making our education system  better, dealing with the problem of the high cost of drugs, doing  infrastructure--nothing. Just appointments have been put on the floor.  And nothing has been done on election security at the very minimum.   I know the leader is afraid to debate what happened and explore what  happened given the tawdry history of certainly President Trump and of  Senate Republicans in responding to this serious issue, but at least he  could move forward and we could put some bills on the floor and debate  them to strengthen our election security, which everyone admits is  weak.   So if Leader McConnell, as he says, is ready to move on to serious  things, then how about bringing forward legislation to protect our  elections? For 4 months, the Senate has been little more than a  legislative graveyard, and election security is exhibit A.   The House passed important reforms to improve and safeguard our  elections. No action here in the Senate. We have a bipartisan election  security bill waiting in committee. No movement from the leader.  [[Page S2660]]    As long as this place remains a legislative graveyard, we are rolling  out the welcome mat for foreign adversaries--not just Russia but Iran,  Turkey, North Korea, China--to interfere in our elections. We are  essentially encouraging a sequel to 2016 because the leader is sitting  on his hands, because the leader is presiding over a legislative  graveyard on election security and just about everything else. What  about bipartisan background checks? What about paycheck fairness? What  about election reform? What about even the Violence Against Women Act,  which passed the House with 33 Republicans? None of those are being put  on the floor so that we can act and debate.   Later this morning, my friend Senator Udall will come here to the  floor to press our Republican friends to take up this bill and shed  light on the fact that it includes long-overdue reforms to protect  Native American women. The House is moving on legislation this week to  protect our healthcare law and protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions from the administration's efforts to destroy  those protections. There is no reason for Leader McConnell, who says he  wants to move on, to let these bills collect dust in the Senate. Even  if he doesn't love every particular in these bills, why not bring them  to the floor to debate and amend? Surely, we could find a way to agree  on issues. Ninety, ninety-five percent of Americans agree on every one  of these. But the Republican Party and Leader McConnell are so in the  grasp of powerful special interests and lobbyists from the hard right  that they are afraid to move any of this.                            ____________________     Madam President, on disaster, last week, the city of  Davenport in Iowa became the site of the latest national disaster to  wreak havoc on our homeland. It has been 8 weeks since the Midwest  began battling major flooding, 6 months since the last major wildfire  in California, 12 months since a volcano erupted in Hawaii, and over a  year and a half since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island  of Puerto Rico. But because the President has stubbornly and  inexplicably opposed aid to Puerto Rico, a comprehensive disaster  package has failed to get the necessary support of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, of a majority in the House, and has languished  in the Congress.   Unfortunately, the President continues to belittle Puerto Rico and  tell flat-out mistruths about the level of support they are receiving.  Just yesterday, the President said the people of Puerto Rico ``should  be very happy'' with what he has done for them so far. Well, don't ask  me. Ask the Governor of Puerto Rico--hardly a left-wing, partisan  Democrat; ask the mayor of San Juan; ask the people of Puerto Rico if  they are happy. Don't put words in their mouths. Ask them if they are  happy with the support they have received from this administration. Ask  them if they are happy with HUD's missing its own deadline to advance  the release of $8 billion in disaster mitigation funding last week. Ask  them, and you will get a much different answer. No one in the Puerto  Rican community is happy with the way this President has treated the  island and its 3 million American citizens. He has treated them with  contempt. It needs to stop.   So, President Trump, if you want to help the farmers in the Midwest,  be fair to everyone. You can't pick and choose.   Some of them say: Oh, but Puerto Rico isn't spending its aid well. I  heard that when we wanted Sandy money for New York. You can say that  about any region. In an emergency, no government program will be  perfect, but that is not a reason to hold back the money. Instead, send  the money and have some oversight, but help the people. They need it.  You can't pick and choose which Americans to help.   I would say this to President Trump: As our President, you must  represent all Americans, not just the ones who voted for you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
