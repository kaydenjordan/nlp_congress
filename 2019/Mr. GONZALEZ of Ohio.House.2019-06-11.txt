 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule that would  provide for consideration of H.R. 2740. This package provides funding  for several items that would benefit my district in northeast Ohio, but  it falls short in several key regards, including funding for key  programs that would help keep our children safe.   In particular, Mr. Speaker, this package fails to provide adequate  funding for the School Safety National Activities program, which gives  grants to schools to support safe learning environments, including  programs to combat substance abuse and cultivate academic success.   This bill provides $80 million less in funding than what the  administration requested. I offered an amendment to raise that number  by $10 million, but  [[Page H4408]]  my colleagues in the majority blocked it from consideration.   I think we can all agree that school safety is of the utmost  importance and an area that is vital for Congress to invest in. I hope  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work with me to assure  that programs to protect our children, like the School Safety National  Activities program, remain a congressional priority.
