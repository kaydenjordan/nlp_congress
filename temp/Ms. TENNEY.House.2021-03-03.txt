 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life and memory  of New Hartford, New York Police Officer Joseph Corr. Fifteen years ago  last month, Officer Corr was shot and killed in the line of duty while  in pursuit of a robbery suspect.   Joe Corr, who was born and raised in my hometown of New Hartford, New  York, was a dedicated father to Kaitlyn, a loving husband to Tracie,  and a hero who served and protected our community with honor.   Today, the Officer Joseph D. Corr Foundation proudly honors Joe's  memory and gives back to his fellow members in blue by supporting other  families who have experienced similar tragedies. His parents, Dave and  Kathleen, continue to provide their love and counsel to those families  as well.   Officer Corr's death is a sad reminder of the dangers our brave men  and women face each day in the line of duty. These heroes deserve our  unwavering respect for the sacrifices that they make each and every day  to keep our communities safe.                            ____________________
