 Madam Speaker, I rise today as vice chairman of the  Congressional Steel Caucus to highlight a recent letter I wrote with  Chairman Crawford to the administration.   Specifically, we requested that the Department of Commerce and the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives take action to address a  recent surge of steel imports from Mexico.   The letter highlights how recent reports reveal significant volumes  of steel that were melted and poured in countries such as Brazil, South  Korea, and Russia have entered our market through Mexico.   This development is very concerning to us, as it is occurring when  the American steel industry is making significant investments in new  state-of-the-art, low-emission steel facilities.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with the Steel  Caucus and the administration to address this matter and defend  American workers and steel manufacturers.                            ____________________
