 I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman, and I  commend him for his extraordinary leadership on this very important  subject. To young people in our country and to every person in our  country from sea to shining sea and to the future of our country, I  join my colleagues in defense of the free and open internet which is a  pillar of our democracy. I am pleased to follow Mr. Doyle and his  leadership; Mr. Pallone, the chairman of the committee; Ms. Eshoo, a  godmother of net neutrality in an earlier time; Mr. Butterfield, for  his wonderful statement; and I know we will be hearing from  Congresswoman Matsui and other Members, and I am honored to join all of  them.   Again, I salute Chairman  Mike Doyle for his leadership of the Save  the Internet Act and for his persistent, dissatisfied leadership to  protect net neutrality. I also commend our former colleague in the  House, Senator Markey, for his leadership now in the Senate.   Let us salute the millions of Americans who have marched, mobilized,  and made their voices heard in this fight, the 4 million Americans who  wrote to the FCC--that would be the Federal Communications Commission-- to support the 215 Obama-era net neutrality protections; the 10 million  Americans who weighed in again this time to oppose the 2017 Trump  decision to destroy those protections; the 600,000 Americans who tuned  in to watch a livestream of the full committee markup on this  legislation, and, Mr. Chairman, it is now 4.8 million and a growing  number who have watched the committee proceedings on the House floor  today.   That is so much enthusiasm in our country, that is the growing extent  of the interest. That is unheard of for the work that we do here.   Net neutrality is a bipartisan priority for the American people. As  Chairman Doyle said, a full 86 percent of Americans oppose the Trump  assault on net neutrality, including 82 percent of Republicans outside.   Young people, in particular, get it. This is about their jobs and  their futures. With the Save the Internet Act, Democrats are honoring  the will of the American people. We are restoring protections so that  we can stop unjust discriminatory practices by ISPs--that would be  internet service providers--that try to throttle consumers' browsing  speed, block their internet access, and increase their costs--throttle  their speed, block their access, and increase their cost.  [[Page H3175]]    It would give entrepreneurs and small businesses a level playing  field on which to compete and ensure American innovation can continue  to be the envy of the world.   This legislation also brings the power of the internet to every  corner of the country from rural America to cities, as Mr. Butterfield  pointed out, because it provides the legal basis for the Connect  America Fund.   We must close the urban-rural digital divide, although we have  challenges in urban areas as well as in rural areas, but in rural areas  this is a must do. It will make all the difference in the world  guaranteeing better and cheaper internet for everyone, so we can create  jobs and unlock the economic potential of every person in every  community.   This debate is not just about legislation. It is about the quality of  people's lives. More than 30,000 San Franciscans in my own district  have written my own office about the impact of net neutrality in their  lives.   They know that American businesses are at risk.   One writes:         As a small business owner, I depend on free and unfettered       communication with my customers and vendors. My business and       personal lifestyle are in jeopardy.    They know that America's innovation is at risk.   As a young student writes:         Without net neutrality, we lose our last medium of allowing       small and upcoming companies to thrive.    They know that our spirit of entrepreneurialism is at risk. As  another constituent writes:         The internet is a place where anyone, rich or poor, can       make a living, become successful, and make themselves known.    They know that our very democracy is at risk because as one  constituent writes:         A world without net neutrality undermines a central       priority for a democratic society--the necessity of all       citizens to inform themselves and each other.    Those are some of the communications from my constituents.   I will just tell you about a family discussion I had. I was visiting  my brother in Baltimore, Maryland, Thomas D'Alesandro, and we were  sitting around the table with his children and grandchildren. We were  talking about one thing and another that was going on in the country.    I said to his grandson: What do you think about all of this?   We were talking about national security, et cetera.   He said: My friends and I care about one thing, net neutrality.   That was so exciting to hear, and here we are delivering for young  people.   Supporting this bill means supporting our democracy and showing that  our voices--the voices of the public--are heard, that their will is  respected, and that the internet remains free and open to all. We call  on our Republican colleagues to join us to support our democracy by  restoring net neutrality.   I hope we have a good, strong bipartisan vote as a tribute to  Chairman Doyle.   Mr. Chairman, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
