 Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my  special order.    Madam Speaker, I hope it is clear to all of my  colleagues in this body that rural America faces a myriad of  challenges.   Every day, members of the Congressional Western Caucus, of which I am  very honored to be chairman, and many partners throughout rural America  are working to ensure that local communities across the country are  heard in our Nation's Capitol, right here, and that these challenges do  not go unaddressed.   For many in big cities and urban areas, I think it can be pretty easy  to overlook our rural communities. But we truly are the backbone of our  great country, and our challenges are not our challenges alone. Rather,  they are reflective of the entire Nation's challenges, things like  managing public lands and fulfilling the government's multipurpose-use  doctrine, or supporting local economies and encouraging economic  development, promoting critical infrastructure like roads and bridges  and dams, ensuring a strong agricultural industry that feeds the world,  and empowering the communities that we represent to embrace expanded  domestic energy production and clean energy technologies.    Our State, local, and private land managers are conservation  partners. Small businesses and local communities are eager to take the  reins and make the improvements that we need, but they are consistently  held back by bureaucratic red tape, delayed permitting processes that  add years and millions of dollars in cost to projects, and outdated  laws that don't take into account the best available science of modern  technologies.   Over and over again, I hear from my constituents in central  Washington State, and also from community leaders from across the  United States, that we need to get the Federal Government out of the  way.   That is why, throughout this month of March, Congressional Western  Caucus members are taking the opportunity to highlight why reforming  our duplicative and burdensome permitting process is the key to  unlocking rural America's potential.   Madam Speaker, broken permitting systems negatively impact the  progress that we could be making at nearly every step of the way. The  National Environmental Policy Act, or what many refer to as NEPA, is  one of the most egregious examples of a well-intentioned law turned  into a bureaucratic nightmare for those of us who are working to  improve the communities where we live, work, and farm.   The Endangered Species Act is another. This landmark species  protection law has become outdated, and it is now used as a weapon by  serial litigators and misguided environmentalists, who want nothing  more than to sue and settle, wasting our limited government resources,  which are stalling projects across the United States and  disincentivizing investment in rural America.   Both of these laws play an important role in protecting lands,  waters, and wildlife that we cherish throughout the West and across  rural America. But because Congress has not been able to meaningfully  reform them, they have actually begun to work against us.   ESA regulations can add decades to the permitting processes for  forest management projects or projects that would help prevent  catastrophic wildfires across the West.   In my own home State of Washington, and across the Pacific Northwest,  the policies surrounding the northern spotted owl wreaked havoc on our  forest industry, destroying--literally destroying--local economies.  Now, our region experiences some of the worst wildfires in our Nation's  history.   Madam Speaker, that is not a coincidence. Delays and roadblocks, and  I intend to insert a pun there, Madam Speaker, that are caused by NEPA  regulations have slowed or completely stopped infrastructure projects  like highway improvements or installation of new hydropower  technologies that generate clean energy and provide increased fish  passage.   Just last week, our members met with former Secretary of the Interior  David Bernhardt, who worked within the Trump administration to  streamline inefficiencies and cut the environmental review process from  4.5 years, if you can believe that, down to no more than 2.   The Biden administration, of course, is now reversing this progress  and bending to politically motivated interest groups at the expense of  rural communities.   It is clear to us in the Western Caucus that it is time for Congress  to act. For decades, rural America has been kept in regulatory limbo at  the mercy of each changing administration.   Congress is a coequal branch of government, and we need to, we  should, assert our authority to ensure that our communities have the  certainty that they need to move forward on these critical projects.   Our rural communities deserve the investment and the development that  is disincentivized by our broken permitting processes.   I know we have Western Caucus members here today who will help shed  some light on some of these examples in their home districts, in their  States. We will continue to demonstrate the harmful impacts of the  status quo and outline our vision for a future that empowers rural  Americans to tackle our challenges head-on.   I am very happy to have a group of colleagues here who are very  interested in this topic, and I will first turn to Mr. Bruce Westerman,  who is the vice chair of the Western Caucus, one of my vice chairs, but  also the ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee.   I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Westerman for his comments.  It just goes to show that it is not just Washington State, but clear  across the Nation in Arkansas as well.   To further prove that point, I would like to turn to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller), my good friend and colleague from the  northeastern part of the State, a place where I have had the privilege  to visit and see the great things that are happening in the energy  sector there.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Keller for reminding us that  these policies and decisions have impacts not just domestically but  truly impact our relationships and our position of strength throughout  the world, and especially in the situation we find ourselves in today.   Next, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), a  good friend and colleague, the ranking member on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, someone I have served with for a long time, not  only in the statehouse in Washington State but here in the people's  House in Washington, D.C.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for  helping to bring home the impact this is going to have on Americans, on  families, on people just trying to get to work every day and having to  fill up their gas tanks. These policies have consequences, and we need  to understand that.    We do absolutely.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), one of our great Members who has truly been a  champion in helping to reduce red tape and improve the regulatory  picture for people throughout this country.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's work on  WOTUS and the navigable waters issue. I think I have heard her say  something like those things, WOTUS, is truly the most--the worst  regulatory overreach in our Nation's history and it is something we  have to stop. I thank the gentlewoman for her work on that.   I would like to go just a little bit south from the State of  Washington to another State that adjoins my State, and the good  gentleman from Oregon, in his first term in Congress, but just doing an  excellent job; and I am just delighted to have him as part of this  effort.  [[Page H3739]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for focusing on a  very important issue for us in the West. Every summer we hear the West  is burning. We have got to change our policies in order to prevent the  loss of property, loss of life, the detriment to our environment.   I would like to turn the floor over now to someone who is--you know,  we are the Western Caucus, right? But we have members from all over the  country. And one of our members represents almost the furthest east in  our caucus. The good gentleman from the great State of Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Georgia and the beautiful community of Savannah (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for helping  illustrate the impact that this has on local communities, the costs,  not only in dollars, of the long permitting process, but the delay to  communities for these much-needed projects.   Now, this could probably come under saving the best for last. The  great Representative from the great State of California, I would like  to say is was one of the premier members of the new freshman class. I  appreciate Mr. Valadao, a fellow farmer, a fellow West Coaster, being  here being part of this Special Order to talk about some very important  issues here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Valadao).    Madam Speaker, the gentleman is right. What is more  precious than water? And those of us in the West understand that very  well.   So, Madam Speaker, let me just say I am very grateful to have  colleagues from across this great country join me tonight to talk about  these issues, and to discuss our efforts in the Western Caucus as it  relates to permitting month.                                time  2015    As you have heard, the broken processes surrounding permitting  throughout the Federal Government have truly kneecapped our rural  communities. This has slowed progress and has cost millions and  millions of dollars.   In order to truly unleash American potential, we have to reform this  process, and we will. Between the Western Caucus and those of us in  Congress, we will continue to advocate for commonsense policies that  are going to do just that.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the Special Order opportunity this  evening, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
