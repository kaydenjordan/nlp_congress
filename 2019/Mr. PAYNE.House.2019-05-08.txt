 ``Mommy, there are gunshots at my school.''   Mr. Speaker, no parent should ever hear those words, but that is the  call a parent got yesterday when two students entered STEM School  Highlands Ranch in Colorado and opened fire.   Within minutes, first responders subdued the shooters, and I am  thankful for that, but quick is not fast enough.   One teenager died, and eight people were wounded.   As a parent and a Congressman, my heart aches for the families and  loved ones of the child who died and those who were injured.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday's shooting is one of 41 incidents of gunfire  on school grounds this year alone. Eight people have died and 20 have  been injured. We have lost far too many children to gun violence in our  schools and in our streets.   I am proud of the progress the House has made to reduce gun violence,  but the Senate GOP's inaction is outrageous. They need to do what is  right: dump the NRA and pass some of this legislation we have sent to  them to reduce gun violence.   Enough is enough.                            ____________________
