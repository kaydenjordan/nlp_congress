 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to  me.   I rise in support of, specifically, my amendment to prohibit the use  of Federal funds for the acquisition of chemical agents, such as  teargas and pepper balls.   Since the tragic death of George Floyd, millions of Americans have  sought to exercise their first amendment right to protest and to  assemble. Too often these actions have been met by the brutal force of  the State as the elderly, as children, as those with medical conditions  choke and asphyxiate due to the use of so-called riot control agents.   Mr. Speaker, we can no longer condone the use of agents that hundreds  of public health professionals say can help spread respiratory  illnesses, such as COVID-19.   The use of such agents is banned by international law, so why would  we use them against our own people? This is absolutely unacceptable.   And so with my amendment, it is my hope today that we are nearing the  dawn of a fairer, more equitable and more just era of policing in this  country.
