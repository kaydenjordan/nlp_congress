 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment  to increase investments in research and development that support marine  energy, hydropower, and pump storage.   I first want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for  their leadership in supporting the Water Power Technologies Office.  Robust funding for the Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies  Office will support investments in innovative hydropower, marine, and  hydrokinetic energy technologies.   This bipartisan amendment would increase funding for the Office of  Energy and Efficiency and Renewable Energy by $10 million for water  power and decrease funding for departmental administrative spending to  result in no additional cost.  [[Page H4931]]    Harnessing energy from waves, currents, and tides is an exciting  frontier in the renewable energy sector. Oregon State University, the  University of Washington, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks are  partnering to support marine renewable energy research and development  at the Pacific Marine Energy Center.   The center relies on Federal investments from the Department of  Energy to establish the Nation's fully energetic on-grid wave energy  test facility off the Oregon coast. This facility will be able to test  wave energy converters that capture the energy of ocean waves, current,  tides, and in-river resources and turn it into electricity.   Hydropower has tremendous potential to become the major source of  electricity for the United States and the world, but other countries  are ahead of us here. We must continue to develop clean and sustainable  energy sources, and that means supporting new solutions like marine and  hydrokinetic renewable energy.   We should be doing more to harness the power of water to meet our  Nation's clean energy needs, create good-paying jobs, and spur economic  growth in our communities.                                time  1715    Mr. Chair, I again thank the chairman and ranking member for their  work on this issue and also Representatives Perry and Pingree for their  bipartisan leadership on water power.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate that offer of the gentleman to  work together on this important issue with a lot of promise for  additional renewable energy jobs and sources.   So, Mr. Chairman, we do need to be making stronger investments in  clean and sustainable energy sources like water power. With that offer  to work together, I will withdraw this amendment but do hope that we  will work together going forward to increase funding for this very  important program.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment.
