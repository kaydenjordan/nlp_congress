 Mr. Speaker, last month, the Biden  press secretary falsely fabricated: ``The data shows that households  remain in a strong financial position.''   In reality, even CBS News admits: ``The typical American household  must spend an additional $11,434 annually just to maintain the same  standard of living they enjoyed in January of 2021,'' when Biden was  sworn in.   Additionally, it now requires $119.27 to buy the same goods and  services a family could afford with $100 before the pandemic, according  to Bloomberg.   Bidenomics is disastrous for families.   House Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to  pass legislation to reduce inflation and create jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders for  terrorists. It is sadly clear there will be more 9/11 attacks across  America imminent in our country, as finally revealed by the FBI.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman  Virginia Foxx for yielding, a former college president herself, who  understands these issues. I am very grateful for Republican Conference  Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, who is courageously leading this resolution  that condemns anti-Semitism on university campuses.   Most Americans are shocked at the insane campus anti-Semitism that  has developed. I reviewed this in a lead Op Ed in the Washington Times  on December 7.   My analysis was:         Sadly, college campuses have descended from coveted       citadels of intellectual freedom to illiberal sewers of       intolerance and bigotry. Diversity and inclusion are a George       Orwell 1984 implementation excluding conservative thought.        Over the years, as infantile leftists hire only other       infantile leftists, the most extreme hire even more extreme,       as each tries to outdo the other in leftism. This leads to       today's suicidal derangement, even as the regime in Tehran,       coordinating with war criminal Putin, develops missiles for a       nuclear attack on the big Satan America, which would vaporize       college campuses.    The solution for close-minded intolerance on campuses is obvious. To  liberate academia from denial of free speech, there should be the  inclusion and diversity of more conservative academics overcoming  today's blatant discrimination. All Americans in good faith want  college education to be uplifting for students to achieve the American  Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleague,  Congresswoman Manning. This should be bipartisan.
