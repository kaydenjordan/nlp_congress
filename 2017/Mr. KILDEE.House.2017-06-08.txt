 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I understand the President of the United States himself has no real  understanding of American history, but that is no excuse for this body  for ignoring even the recent history of this country and returning us  to the conditions, to the regulatory environment that not only preceded  but contributed to cause the worst financial crisis that I have  experienced in my lifetime, the Great Recession.                                time  1300    Millions of people lost their homes. Millions of people lost their  job and lost everything they worked for because they were completely  unprotected against institutions and organizations that were predators  against them. This proposed legislation would take away those very  protections and return us to a time when institutions and organizations  can use unfair and deceptive practices, and the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau under this legislation would be barred--would be  barred--from going to bat for those people being taken advantage of.   This makes no sense. We ought to reject it, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in doing so.  [[Page H4719]]
