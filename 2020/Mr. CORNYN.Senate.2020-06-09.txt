 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, if you were to approach a random person  on the street in any city in America today and say: Who is George  Floyd, I could all but guarantee you that you would be met with a quick  response. They would tell you about their horror at seeing this video  of him being killed at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer; that,  sadly, he was not the first victim of this type of crime; and that his  death has now mobilized Americans of all races, ages, and backgrounds  to demand action.   A friend of Mr. Floyd's for more than 35 years said:         Everybody in the world knows who George Floyd is today.       Presidents, Kings, and Queens--they know George Floyd.    It is true. His name and face are everywhere. He is the subject of  incredible artwork, passionate speeches, and dinner table  conversations. He is the reason for marches and demonstrations in the  cities from Houston to Minneapolis, to London, to Sydney. And today,  after 2 weeks of grieving, the Floyd family will finally lay their  beloved brother, father, and friend to rest in his hometown of Houston,  TX.   Over the past 2 weeks, I have joined the chorus of voices calling for  justice for Mr. Floyd. The first step is underway now that the officers  have been charged, but this alone is not enough. Our country has a  responsibility to do the best we can to prevent another family from  burying their son or daughter as a result of excessive force by a  police officer.   People of all races are now actively engaged in a national  conversation about the racial injustices that exist in our country--one  that is deeply needed and long overdue.   I want to assure the people of Texas that these conversations are  happening in the U.S. Senate as well. Our friend and colleague Senator  Tim Scott, from South Carolina, briefed the Republican conference today  on the package of bills he is developing, with help from a group of our  Members, to combat the racial injustice that still exists in our  country today--particularly, as it applies to law enforcement.   This is a product of discussions that Leader McConnell and I and  others have had that would make real and lasting changes in communities  across the country. I am proud to be part of the discussion led by  Senator Scott, and I want to commend both him and the majority leader  for their leadership and sense of urgency--one we all feel.   I think the necessary changes begin within our criminal justice  system. Despite calls from some to defund or even disband the police, I  believe these steps would do far more harm than good. It is not the  right answer. Instead, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of our  criminal justice system--something that has not happened in more than  50 years.   Senators Peters, Graham, and I have introduced a bill to create a  National Criminal Justice Commission that would do just that. Over the  course of 18 months, the Commission would examine our criminal justice  system and provide recommendations on specific changes that should be  made by Congress.   I have recommended this bill be included in the legislation Senator  Scott is developing, and I am eager to work with him and all of our  colleagues in the coming days in the hope of gaining broad bipartisan  support. As we know, the only way things get done around here is with  bipartisan support. I can't  [[Page S2788]]  think of anything more urgent, at this particular time, than we  demonstrate we can come together and rise above our partisan  differences and address this very real need.   Of course, there is nothing we can do to reverse what happened in  Minneapolis, but there is a lot that can be done to prevent the name of  another Black person in America from becoming a trending hashtag. A  former classmate of Mr. Floyd's at Jack Yates High School said he  always would say: ``I'm going to change the world.'' While this is  certainly not the way he or anyone could have fathomed, his story is  sure to have a lasting impact on our country's history.   Today, I would like to offer, once again, my condolences to the  entire Floyd family for their loss. I had the privilege of speaking  with them on the telephone yesterday. Rodney Floyd reminded me that the  family was from Houston, TX, and he said: We want Texas-size justice.   I said: Mr. Floyd, you will have it.   In the wake of this tragedy, I hope we can come together and deliver  that change. I appreciate Senator Scott and Leader McConnell leading  the charge in the Senate and look forward to sharing more details of  this proposal soon                         Paycheck Protection Program    Madam President, on another matter, since the CARES Act was signed  into law more than 2 months ago, millions of small businesses--I think  4.5 million businesses--have gotten loans from the Paycheck Protection  Program. This program has allowed restaurants, retailers,  manufacturers, farmers, and small businesses from virtually every  sector of the economy to stay afloat and keep their employees on  payroll.   Dr. Nora Walker operates a pulmonary practice in San Antonio--my  hometown--which experienced a near stop on patient visits once COVID-19  began to soar in March. Payroll is her largest expense. Without that  source of revenue, she and her husband were worried they wouldn't be  able to pay the practice's three employees, but then the lifeline came  in the form of the PPP loan. They applied for a $26,000 loan, and they  received the funds 2 weeks later. Because of that funding, these three  employees could stay on the payroll as Dr. Walker continued her  practice via telemedicine.   Her practice is a great example of PPP beneficiaries who don't  receive enough attention--the small employers who took out small loans  to help with a small number of workers in a very big way. From the  truly small businesses to those that have grown their footprint in our  State, the PPP has been essential to the survival of these businesses  and to the livelihood of their employees.   As I have spoken to small businesses throughout the State, I have  repeatedly heard how vital the PPP has been, but that praise has been  coupled with requests to make improvements in the program to ensure  that it delivers the most efficient and maximum benefit.   Last week, we took the first step in making some of those changes  through the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act, which was signed into  law by the President on Friday. It extends the amount of time  businesses can use these funds from 8 weeks to 24 weeks and reduces the  portion of the loan that must be used on payroll in order to be  forgiven from 75 percent to 60 percent. Many of our restaurants and  other businesses that simply closed their doors said there is no way  they can spend our PPP loan on payroll when our business isn't even  open. This provides flexibility for them and for others. In a nutshell,  it gives small business owners the ability to use these loans when and  where they are needed.   In the short term, these changes will be critical to protecting jobs  and supporting small businesses as they reopen their doors following  the coronavirus-induced shutdown. The jobs report we got this last week  provides great hope and promise that this recovery will come soon.   In the longer term, we need to ensure that these loans don't end up  creating any more burdens for small businesses down the road. Under  normal circumstances, businesses can deduct their expenses from their  taxable income. Of course, the Paycheck Protection Program covers the  cost to many of these expenses, and there is some confusion-- particularly, at Treasury--with how businesses should handle their  taxes.   I believe the intent of Congress was to allow businesses to continue  deducting those expenses. Basically, we were trying to get the money  where it was needed most the fastest. By allowing them to continue to  deduct those expenses, we do that, but the guidance recently issued by  the IRS said the opposite.   While it is fair to say this has led to confusion and frustration  among many, Congress needs to take action to eliminate the  misunderstanding. Last month, I introduced a bill to make clear that  small businesses can still deduct their expenses that were paid for  with a forgiven Paycheck Protection loan for their taxes. I know this  is an unusual circumstance, but isn't the pandemic the most unusual  circumstance we experienced in our lifetime? It calls for extraordinary  measures, and I believe, under the circumstances, trying to get money  to these small businesses is necessary.   Our goal with this loan program was to help them remain solvent and  keep their employees on payroll so they can recover as soon as  possible. Without this change, the PPP loan will fail to deliver the  maximum on this most basic objective.   The bipartisan Small Business's Expense Protection Act will ensure  that small businesses have the cashflow they need to survive today and  prosper in the future. After all, we are not interested in handing out  meals now only to slap people on the hands later for taking free food.   The bill has bipartisan support in the Senate. In fact, I introduced  it with the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee,  Senators Grassley and Wyden, as well as Senator Rubio, who chairs the  Small Business Committee, and Senator Carper. It has gained the support  of organizations that advocate for small businesses, including the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers of  Manufacturers, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.  It also has been endorsed by groups in the financial services industry,  including the Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants, the  American Institute of CPAs, and the Independent Bankers of Texas. Most  importantly, this bill is an answer to the real concerns that  businessowners are facing.   As we work to strengthen our coronavirus response and recovery, that  should be the guiding principle in the Senate--figure out what is  working, what isn't, and act appropriately. This is a big contrast  between the approach we are seeing from our House colleagues. A few  weeks ago, they passed a bill that was chock-full of ideological policy  proposals they know has absolutely no chance of gaining any traction in  the Senate, but they didn't seem to care. They did a driveby vote on a  Friday and left town and haven't been back since.   Tax breaks for blue State millionaires--they actually want to cut  taxes on the richest people in America by reducing or raising the cap  on the State and local tax deduction. They want to support marijuana  banking, environmental justice grants, soil health studies, changes to  election laws.   Forget about solving the problem at hand. Our Democratic colleagues  in the House, with this so-called Heroes Act, are attempting to use  this pandemic as an opportunity to slip their liberal wish list into  must-pass legislation. They are eager to stick taxpayers with another  $3 trillion tab. This isn't going to happen. It has no chance of  passing in the Senate, and they actually know it.   These unwanted, unaffordable, and, frankly, laughable proposals are  not the types of solutions America needs to recover from this crisis.  Indeed, I think it would be wise for a number of folks in the House  Democratic leadership to start listening to their constituents for a  change rather than try to figure out how do you posture and position  yourself favorably for the next election.   I have lost count of the number of video calls I have held--and I  know my colleagues have had the same experience--with small business  owners, medical professionals, farmers, educators, mayors, and  representatives from nearly every corner of my State. I appreciate the  countless Texans who have  [[Page S2789]]  shared their feedback with me to help me do a better job on their  behalf and who will no doubt continue to point out the gaps that need  to be filled in the months ahead, particularly when it comes to the  next installment of COVID-19 legislation.   I yield the floor.
