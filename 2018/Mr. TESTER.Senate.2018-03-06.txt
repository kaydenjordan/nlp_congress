 Mr. President, I thank Chairman Crapo. I want to  associate myself with my good friend from Tennessee, Senator Bob  Corker. We always say ``good friend,'' but the truth is that Senator  Corker has truly been a good friend. We came to this body together, and  he has exhibited uncommon common sense in this body time and again, and  once again, he has today. I thank Senator Corker for his remarks about  this bill.   Mr. President, time and again over the past year, I have been here on  the Senate floor raising my concerns about the direction this body is  heading--secret backroom deals on the healthcare bill, a ``take it or  leave it'' tax bill that was dropped on our desks literally hours  before the vote, and the floor time that has been wasted to score  political points. Quite frankly, this dysfunction has turned the  world's most deliberative body into a shell of its former self.   Folks in Washington have shied away from the big debates and refused  to tackle the tough issues that are facing hard-working Americans every  day, but this week I am hopeful that can change.   Today we begin the debate on the bipartisan Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. This bill is the  product of years of bipartisan negotiations, hearings, and compromises.  Under the leadership of Chairman Crapo and my good friends Senators  Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Warner, we have struck a bipartisan agreement  that is needed to provide an economic boost for rural America. Folks  from both parties put their differences aside. We negotiated from our  points of agreement, and we emphasized common ground. We kept working  toward our shared goal of strengthening America's economy by providing  commonsense regulatory reform to small- and medium-sized banks,  community banks, and credit unions.   During the committee process, this bill was marked up and debated for  7 hours. We voted on 36 amendments during an open amendment process.  The chairman handled that committee process incredibly professionally.   Since this bill was introduced in the Banking Committee last year, it  has been strengthened by Senators who are not on that committee, and it  has been endorsed by regulators, veterans groups, and job creators from  both parties. This bipartisan bill has support from folks of all walks  of life and is cosponsored by more than a quarter of this body because  they know that reform is desperately needed.   In my home State of Montana, prior to the financial crisis in 2008,  there were 72 chartered banks. Today that number has dropped to 49.  What we have seen in Montana is not unique throughout this country.  Across rural America, bank consolidation is leaving communities  underserved. Community banks and credit unions didn't cause the  financial crisis back in 2008, but they have suffered under a one-size- fits-all set of regulations specifically designed to rein in the  behavior on Wall Street. As a result of complying with these  regulations, many of our community bankers are hanging up their hats,  and our local banks are being swallowed up by bigger banks. Ultimately,  they will be swallowed up by the folks on Wall Street.   Furthermore, when a community bank is bought out by a big bank, its  business model changes and it is no longer tailored to fit that  community. Despite being a small portion of the banking industry,  community banks provide--listen to this--48 percent of the small  business loans in this country, 15 percent of the residential mortgage  lending, 43 percent of farmland and farm lending, and 34 percent of  commercial real estate loans. These banks are designed and built to  serve their communities.   Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the number of banks in this country  has declined by 14 percent, and in our State of Montana, with some  quick math, it is closer to 30 percent. If you are a product of rural  America like I am, you know full well the consequences when a bank  leaves town. It is just a matter of time before that community shrivels  up. Folks, something must be done.   Eight years ago, during the dark days of the financial crisis, I  proudly supported Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank was needed to crack down on  risky financial behavior. For the most part, Dodd-Frank has been  successful, but, like all major bills, Dodd-Frank had some unintended  consequences. Since its passage, small business lending has declined by  41 percent. That is why our bill is needed--to bring more capital to  Main Streets across America and to protect community banks from further  consolidation.   Our bill provides small and midsized banks and credit unions with  more flexibility to meet the unique needs of the communities they  serve. It also provides our community banks with much needed regulatory  relief and cuts the redtape to keep our local banks competitive. It  includes critical consumer protection provisions to better protect our  veterans, our seniors, and tenants. This bipartisan bill makes it  easier for young families to purchase their first home. It helps family  farmers and ranchers secure the capital they need to survive a tough  year when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate. It helps small businesses  and startups secure the funding they need to grow their businesses and  create more jobs. It protects the small banks that serve as a  cornerstone of rural communities from being eaten alive by the big boys  on Wall Street.   In addition to banking reform, this bill strengthens the rights of  consumers. It provides consumers with unlimited free credit freezes and  unfreezes. It prevents mortgage companies from immediately kicking  tenants out of their homes if a landlord is foreclosed on. It increases  safeguards against fraud for veterans, Active-Duty servicemembers,  seniors, and children.    Over the course of this debate, there are going to be some folks who  come to this floor and peddle misinformation, so let me be clear about  what this bill does not do. It does not roll back the regulations on  Wall Street's fat cats. It does not make structural changes to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It does not weaken or repeal the  Volcker rule for large banks. It does not change the way the Federal  Reserve regulates foreign banks. It does not weaken efforts to combat  lending discrimination.   I have already seen a lot of falsehoods about this bill claimed out  there, so I hope this debate stays grounded in the facts, and the fact  is that folks in rural America need this bill.   Take for instance the Community Bank in Polson, MT. Polson's  population is 5,000, and that might be generous. The Community Bank had  faithfully served this community for decades, but the regulations from  Dodd-Frank were so burdensome on that small bank and so costly that it  was forced to sell out to a larger bank.   But it is not just Polson. Here is what other folks in my State are  saying about the bill. A small credit union in Billings, MT, said:         As a small credit union, we spend a ridiculous amount of       time complying with complex rules and I am pleased to see a       bill that would eliminate some of this red tape so I can       focus my resources on serving members.   [[Page S1357]]     That was from Sydney El-Bakken, manager of Homestead Federal Credit  Union in Billings, MT.   This is a quote from another bank in Jordan, MT:         Dodd-Frank has disproportionately affected small banks like       mine who have limited staff and resources to comply with the       regulations created by the bill. Prior to Dodd-Frank's       passage, my bank was able to keep up with compliance       regulations with one staff member. Now, in addition to our       one staff person, we also have outside compliance consultants       that cost us over $23,000 last year alone.    I am going to get back to that figure in a second.         I have talked to many of my fellow bankers who decided to       sell to, or merge with, another bank. Almost every one of       them has told me that the regulatory burden was one of the       main reasons for them to sell or merge.        The loss of small community banks is not good for our       country, our consumers, or our economy. This bill provides       many remedies to lessen the regulatory burden on small banks,       which allow us to remain competitive, viable, and able to       serve the needs of our communities.    The reason I bring up the $23,000 is that there are some out there  who may be listening and may say that $23,000 is not even a rounding  error in a lot of businesses. Rex Phipps is the CEO of Garfield County  Bank in Jordan, MT. Their total assets are $86 million. This is a small  bank that is getting pounded and that this bill is going to help in a  big, big way.   I am going to tell you, I could go on reading the words of community  bankers and credit union leaders and businesses in Montana that support  this bill, but the bottom line is this: Folks sent us to the Senate to  do something to help out the folks we represent. For too long, this  body has been dragged into the mud, and as a result, we have had  partisan and zero-sum policies and zero-sum politics. Dysfunction has  kept this Congress from doing its job, and part of that job is to fine- tune laws to ensure that regulation fits the risk.   Enough is enough already. We must do something. And I am proud to  work with 13 Republicans, 12 Democrats, and 1 Independent who worked so  hard to compromise on this bill that I think works very well for rural  America. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer  Protection Act is a jobs bill, and it is a much needed solution for the  folks who power our local economies. I look forward to this week's  debate.   It is encouraging to see that the Senate is back here doing the job  we were sent here to do. It is encouraging that we have a bill here  that has gone through the process to gather public input, gather  bipartisan support, and it is now on the floor so that we can debate  it. I look forward to that debate, and I hope that debate is based on  the facts.   I want to say one more thing before I yield the floor. We would not  be here today without Chairman Crapo. Chairman Crapo has done a fine  job getting everybody's opinion, respecting everybody's opinion, and  walking that line to allow for negotiations and having a good bill as  the final product. I don't know what is going to be in the final  managers' package, but I hope it doesn't change this bill dramatically  because I think this bill really fits the needs of our economy,  especially in rural America right now.   With that, I would just say, look, we have some work to do. Hopefully  we can do it in a timely fashion and get this bill off to the House.  Hopefully the House doesn't screw it up and we can get it to the  President's desk for his signature.   I yield the floor.
