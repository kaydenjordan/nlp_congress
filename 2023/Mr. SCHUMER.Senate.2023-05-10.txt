 Mr. President, first thing this morning, on a happy  note, I join my fellow Senators in welcoming back our dear friend and  esteemed colleague Dianne Feinstein. It is so good to see her back here  at the Senate, ready to get back to work.   I have been in touch with Senator Feinstein over the past few weeks,  and I can report she is exactly where she wants to be, ready to do the  thing she loves most: serving the people of California.   So, Senator Feinstein, we are so happy to see you. Welcome back.
