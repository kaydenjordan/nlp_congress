(At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record).                            ____________________     Madam President, today, the Senate voted to  confirm Colleen Lawless to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the  Central District of Illinois in my hometown of Springfield.   Born in Joliet, IL, Judge Lawless received her bachelor's degree from  Illinois Wesleyan University and her J.D. from Northern Illinois  University College of Law. After graduating from law school, Judge  Lawless joined the Springfield, IL, firm Londrigan, Potter & Randle  P.C., where she represented plaintiffs and defendants in State and  Federal courts, including the court to which she has now been  nominated. In this role, she handled matters ranging from employment  discrimination to medical malpractice to family law and tried four  cases to verdict before a jury.   In 2019, the judges of Illinois' Seventh Judicial Circuit appointed  Judge Lawless to serve as an associate circuit judge, and she is  currently assigned to the domestic relations division. Since her  appointment to the bench, Judge Lawless has presided over 125 domestic  relations bench trials and many more proceedings implicating mental  health commitments, small claims, evictions, and emergency protection  orders. Notably, she has never been reversed or significantly  criticized by a reviewing court.   Judge Lawless received a rating of ``well qualified'' from the ABA  and a bipartisan vote in committee. She was also highly recommended by  a judicial screening committee that Senator Duckworth and I established  to consider judicial candidates for the Central District of Illinois.   Judge Lawless will fill the Springfield-based seat that has been  occupied over the past decade by Judge Sue Myerscough. I want to thank  Judge Myerscough for her outstanding service to the people of the  central Illinois. She leaves big shoes to fill, but I am confident that  Judge Lawless is more than up to the task. Given her significant trial  experience and deep knowledge of the Central District, Senator  Duckworth and I strongly support Judge Lawless. I was glad to see her  confirmed.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Madam President, today the Senate confirmed Judge  Jonathan Grey to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Michigan.   Born in Poplarville, MS, Judge Grey attended Morehouse College and  the Georgetown University Law Center before serving as a law clerk to  both Judge Damon J. Keith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit and Judge W. Louis Sands of the U.S. District Court for the  Middle District of Georgia. He then began his career in private  practice as an associate at Seyfarth Shaw, LLC, a role in which he  focused on labor and employment matters in Federal, State, and local  courts, as well as before administrative agencies. As an Assistant  United States Attorney for both the Southern District of Ohio and the  Eastern District of Michigan, Judge Grey briefed and argued dozens of  dispositive and nondispositive motions and also led several substantial  investigations in cases that spanned multiple States and countries. In  2021, Judge Grey was appointed to serve as a magistrate judge for the  U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, where he has  written opinions in approximately 40 cases.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Grey as unanimously ``well  qualified,'' and he enjoys the strong support of Senators Stabenow and  Peters. Judge Grey's experience as both a litigator and a jurist in the  Eastern District of Michigan demonstrates his deep knowledge of the  district to which he has been nominated to serve, and he will make an  outstanding addition to the Federal bench. I was glad to see him  confirmed.                            ____________________
