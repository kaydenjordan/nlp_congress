 Mr. President, I rise today to mark 132 years of  Kappa Sigma fraternity on the campus of the University of Arkansas and  100 years calling 711 W. Dickson Street its home. I join with so many  other former and current members of the storied Xi Chapter in  celebrating its tremendous legacy of brotherhood, academic achievement,  and service.   The Kappa Sigma Xi Chapter was established in 1890 and is the largest  fraternity on campus. The chapter is also the largest in the country,  with over 4,000 initiates all-time and 335 undergraduates currently. It  features prominent alumni, including notable figures such as Jerry  Jones and former public servants who have served their communities, the  State of Arkansas, and our country.   I am fortunate to be among several Kappa Sigma brothers to represent  the people of Arkansas in the U.S. Congress. It is an honor to follow  in the footsteps of William S. Goodwin of Warren, John McClellan from  Sheridan, William Alexander from Osceola, and Ed Bethune of Little  Rock, as well as Samuel B. Hill from Franklin who went on to serve the  people of Washington State. Our time in the Xi Chapter undoubtedly  shaped our desire to serve as leaders and give back through public  service.   Being part of this organization is also a family affair, as my great  uncle and cousin were members of Kappa Sigma's Xi Chapter. I know  families throughout Arkansas have similar stories, which speaks to the  broad and generational impact it continues to have in the natural  State.   As former Senator and Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole once  expressed, being involved with Kappa Sigma offers a great deal of  learning experience and the opportunity to make lifelong friends.   I am pleased and honored to help celebrate this milestone with other  Kappa Sigma brothers and the city of Fayetteville. Reflecting on the  history and tradition of this special brotherhood is just one way to  carry on its mission.   Along with the University of Arkansas Greek Life community, and  specifically to the Xi Chapter of Kappa Sigma, we applaud the longevity  and life-changing work the fraternity continues to demonstrate.   Congratulations, again, to all those associated with this institution  and who are connected through the bond it has established for well over  a century.                            ____________________
