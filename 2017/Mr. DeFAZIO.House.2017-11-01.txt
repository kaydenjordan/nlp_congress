 Mr. Chairman, I remember, 13 years ago, after another  spate of catastrophic fires in the Western United States, we came  together in a truly bipartisan fashion and passed something called the  Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It authorized up to 20 million acres  to be treated to remove  [[Page H8336]]  hazard fuels in what is called the WUI, the wildland-urban interface,  and in threats to municipal water supplies. We also authorized $760  million a year.   Well, it has been 13 years. We authorized 20 million acres of work.  What has been done? 2\1/2\ million.   Is it because of litigation, lawsuits, or, you know, obstruction? No.  It is because of this body, the United States Congress, which is  refusing to put up the money to do the work.   In my State alone, there are 1.8 million acres waiting for treatment.  They have gone through all environmental reviews. There is no potential  for litigation or any other blocking, but they don't have the money.   Does this bill fix that? No. We are addressing problems that don't  exist in terms of addressing the wildfire problem.   This is really, you know, kind of a lost opportunity, a missed  opportunity. Yes, it does a partial fix of the wildfire borrowing,  which devastates the Forest Service every year. I appreciate that. But  the fact is, we have got 44 million homes that are now at risk in terms  of wildland-urban interface, and we have only treated 2\1/2\ million  acres because this Congress isn't putting up the money.                                time  1600    And this year, yet again, they are proposing like one-half of what we  authorized. What does one-half get you? It gets you half the acreage.   So if we had appropriated at the levels we authorized over the last  13 years, they would have treated 5 or 6 million acres. Again, they  weren't blocked by litigation. They weren't blocked by appeals. The  HFRA Act became virtually noncontroversial because it didn't do away  with judicial review, which this bill will do on a certain number of  projects in each region every year.   I wish that this was a bipartisan approach, it isn't, and I cannot  support the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan amendment introduced  by myself, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader.   Section 913 of the bill requires all public lands managed by the BLM  and  [[Page H8353]]  five western Oregon districts to be managed under the O&C California  Lands Act of 1937. These are statutorily unique lands. They are all  contained in the State of Oregon. There are 2.6 million acres in 18  Oregon western counties.   The O&C Act directs the BLM to manage those lands for multiple uses,  including sustainable timber harvest, reforestation, protection of  watersheds. As Federal lands, counties with O&C acres are unable to  collect taxes. The Federal Government realized that put a tremendous  burden on the counties, and the revenues are shared 50 percent with the  counties and 50 percent with the Federal Government. These are critical  revenues for my counties, and we have been trying to enhance management  on those lands to help both with employment and with those revenues.   Without this provision, the bill would seem to open up wilderness,  wild and scenic rivers, the national trail system, and other  statutorily protected areas. It will also protect the Yaquina Head  Outstanding Natural Area on Oregon's coast.   So I would ask--I believe that was an oversight in the drafting of  the bill since similar protections are provided on Forest Service lands  for statutorily reserved areas, and I would urge Members to support  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support, and  I do thank him for the conversation we had about a number of concerns  that I had with the bill, and this addresses one, and the Schrader  amendment addressed another.   There are still other concerns. I am hopeful, we have twice passed  management bills out of the House, and I did support last Congress'  version introduced by the gentleman, 1 of 19 Democrats, I believe at  that time, and I am hopeful that, in discussions with the Senate, we  move back in the direction of the bill that we passed in the House 2  years ago.   However, the Senate totally stiffed us on that legislation, and I  fear that moving the bill to a number of the provisions in this bill,  which go further than in the last bill, will make it less likely that  the Senate will negotiate. But, I mean, who knows what works with the  Senate. So I wish the gentleman well in those discussions.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
