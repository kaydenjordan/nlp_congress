 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota  for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, on October 7, 2023, the world witnessed in real time on  the internet the heart-wrenching images of innocent Israelis  slaughtered in their homes. These attacks claimed the lives of more  than 1,400 innocent people, including at least 30 American citizens  that we know of.   We saw pure evil on display that day as Hamas murdered and kidnapped  children, raped women, and savagely attacked the elderly. They killed  entire families in the most brutal and shocking fashion that the world  has ever seen. Even worse, they went as far as to desecrate the bodies,  and they celebrated their war crimes.   Every single American should be heartbroken, should be disgusted, and  should be enraged. Shame on my colleagues who have called for a cease- fire. Shame on my colleagues who have acted as apologists for the  genocidal terrorist organization Hamas. Shame on my colleagues who have  joined anti-Semitic rallies and waved Palestinian flags, especially  here in our Nation's Capitol.   Every American should stand with the Jewish people in Israel. The  people of Israel are a lone beacon of freedom in the Middle East.   I have been there. Many of us have been there. We all should go  there. I have seen firsthand the threat that they face from radical  terrorists. They are the very same ones who hate the freedoms that we  enjoy here in the United States.   It is in these moments of crisis that the strength of our convictions  and the depths of our friendships are truly tested. In Israel's time of  need, America cannot be silent. H.R. 6126 provides Israel with the  support that they need to protect their freedoms and eradicate Hamas  while offsetting the financial burden on the American people.   It is time for Congress to step up and to send a message to the world  that Israel is not alone. Unfortunately, this administration's foreign  policy has failed. Their weak policies like unfreezing the $6 billion  in assets for Iran starkly contrast the previous administration's work  to establish the Abraham Accords and end ISIS.   This weakness on the world stage leaves our Nation vulnerable as  well. Combined with our wide-open borders, we cannot wait until there  is an attack on American soil to act.   The world is watching. Today we have an opportunity to send a  message, both to our allies and our adversaries, that we will not allow  this senseless terrorism to go unchecked.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 6126 to support  Israel, to eradicate Hamas, and to fight global terrorism.  [[Page H5238]]                                     time  0945
