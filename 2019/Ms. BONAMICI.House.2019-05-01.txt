 Mr. Chair, climate change is one of the greatest  existential threats of our time. I am honored to serve on the House  Select Committee on the Climate Crisis with the leadership of the  author of this bill, Representative Castor.   In Oregon, smoke from raging wildfires makes the air unhealthy to  breathe. Acidic oceans are threatening our fishing industries. Droughts  and extreme weather patterns jeopardize the livelihoods of our farmers.  Warmer water in the Columbia River is further threatening endangered  salmon.   My home State of Oregon is one of the many States committed to  meeting the Paris climate agreement targets, but climate change is a  global crisis, which is why more than 175 countries have signed on to  the agreement.   The Climate Action Now Act is a clear signal to our international  allies and to the world that the United States, at least the United  States House of Representatives, supports upholding our Nation's  commitments to the planet. This is about U.S. leadership.   The cost of inaction on climate change is too high to wait any  longer. We can protect the planet, unleash innovation, and create good  jobs. This bill is an important first step.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chair Engel, Chair McGovern, and Chair Castor for  their leadership. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this important bill.
