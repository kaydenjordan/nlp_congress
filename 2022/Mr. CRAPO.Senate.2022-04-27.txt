 Mr. President, I celebrate the life of a remarkable  American, Orley Waite, who passed away in February, just 2 months shy  of his 100th birthday.   I came to learn of Orley's extraordinary life and legacy from his  granddaughter, who serves on my staff. Orley was part of our country's  Greatest Generation, who helped secure Americans' and our allies'  freedoms in World War II and then returned home to help build our  country into the strongest in the world. Orley was born in Bunkerville,  NV, but later made his home of 66 years in Huntington Park, CA. After  attending Virgin Valley High School, where he excelled in track and  field, football, and basketball, in 1941, he served a mission for the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the Eastern States. He  then joined the Army during World War II and served in Germany. His  service included fighting in the Battle of the Bulge and helping  liberate Dachau Concentration Camp.   Orley returned from his World War II service and made a life and  career in one of the most important ways possible: creating a family  and shaping young minds to be ready for future success. He attended  Utah Agricultural College, Utah State, where he met and married Mary  Loughney on July 15, 1947. They moved to California, where Orley  received his master's degree in education at the University of Southern  California. He then dedicated more than 30 years to working for Los  Angeles Unified School District. Throughout his career in education, he  had many assignments, including math and science teacher, coach, and  head counselor at Gage Junior High, Carmelita Junior High, Jordan High  School, Fremont High School, and Fairfax High School. He influenced and  encouraged many on their early educational paths and helped create  opportunities as they learned and grew.   He also contributed significantly of his time and talents to his  community. As a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, Orley held many leadership positions in the church,  including bishopric counselor, bishop, stake presidency counselor, ward  mission leader, seminary teacher, and high council member. He was also  a member of the local Water Board for more than 50 years and served on  the parks and recreation committee for the City of Huntington Park.   Orley was a husband, father, teacher, missionary, church, and  community leader and so much more to the many who knew him, loved him,  and benefited from his remarkable life. As I honor Orley Waite, I  extend my deep condolences to his friends and family, including his  children and their spouses: Orley ``Bill'' Jr. and Carol; Wallace and  Donna; Carole; Joseph and Gail; Robert and Melinda; Martha and Curtis  Hadlock; Jesse and Victoria; his 22 grandchildren; and 37 great- grandchildren. The current turmoil and atrocities our world is  witnessing in Ukraine reinforce just how precious freedom is and how  much World War II Veterans and American servicemembers before and since  have given to secure the foundations we hold dear. Orley Waite left a  lasting legacy for all Americans with his service to our Nation and his  decades of advancing educational opportunities for so many. God bless  him and his lovely family.

Devoting 35 years to any occupation is certainly a remarkable  commitment, but particularly so when your job takes you to Idaho's  rugged and hard-to-reach places. From exploring Idaho's mountain ranges  and headwaters to examining what it is like to live and work in Idaho's  ``Spud Country'' and seeking out some of our State's most storied  barns, Bruce has given Idahoans a view of what lies beyond the roads,  trails, and ridges. For example, he was executive producer and host of  the award-winning ``Canyonlands Calling,'' showcasing the magnificence  and beauty of the Owyhee Canyonlands, where collaborative efforts to  manage these lands were achieved with private and Federal agencies. As  Bruce has said, ``It's a state you can easily get lost in, both  literally and figuratively. I know I speak for all who work on Outdoor  Idaho--it's an honor to share our state with fellow Idahoans. Idaho is  truly the keeper of special places. Esto Perpetua. May she live  forever.''   The other shows Bruce has produced include ``Idaho Geology: A  Convergence of Wonders,'' ``State of Change,'' ``50 Years of  Wilderness,'' ``Salmon Reckoning,'' ``Sawtooths on My Mind,'' ``Pend  Oreille Country,'' ``Land of the Lost River Range,'' ``Idaho  Headwaters,'' and ``Beyond the White Clouds.'' He has earned a number  of recognitions for his work. This includes multiple Emmys, Edward R.  Murrow, and Press Club awards.   Bruce, thank you, for your excellent work all these years to tell  Idaho's stories and shed light on the people, canyons, mountains,  aquifers, prairies, lakes, fish, and wildlife that make Idaho such a  magical place. You obviously realized long ago how truly special our  great State is and have devoted your career to enabling others to get a  sense of this spectacular treasure. Congratulations on your remarkable  career.                            ____________________
