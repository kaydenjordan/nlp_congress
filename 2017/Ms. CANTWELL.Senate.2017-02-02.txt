 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I see my colleague from Texas. Did he  want to make remarks in leader time?   Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the action today  in the Senate, which is to try to overrun the clean water rule as it  relates to the mining industry.   The bottom line is, polluters should pay for the pollution, and that  is what the rule says, and that is what is trying to be overrun today  after a very short debate in the Senate.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to  say it is about the coal industry and a war on coal. If they are so  concerned about the coal industry, I would suggest to them  [[Page S615]]  and coal workers that they take up the pension bill they promised to  take up in the last Congress and have failed to take up.   Last December, thousands of coal miners came to Washington, DC, and  asked the Senate to live up to their promise that was made and put  their health on the line and make sure that they had a pension program.  More than 20,000 retired coal miners are at risk of losing their health  care if we do nothing by April, and they have a very small pension-- averaging about $530 a month--that is also at risk.   I know some of my colleagues would like to believe this is somehow  entirely related to a war on coal, but that narrative ignores the  facts. In 2008, right before the financial crisis, the United Mine  Workers' pension plan was 93 percent funded--in 2008, 93 percent  funded. Its actuaries projected it was on track to reach full funding  in several years.   So this notion that somehow the discussion behind the scenes by the  Interior Department or the EPA caused an implosion in the mining  industry and thereby they didn't have resources is not the case. What  is the case is that the financial crisis hit, and Wall Street  speculators blew up our economy, costing it $14 trillion--according to  the Dallas Fed--and many in this body bailed them out. But we did  nothing to bail out the miner pension program. Those pensions were  thrown into crisis. By 2009, the United Mine Workers' plan had dropped  from the 93-percent funded level down to the low seventies--a 20- percent drop in a single year. So despite the fact that the plan was  well managed, the investment returns continued to be problematic. Wall  Street--not the Department of the Interior or EPA--is the reason mine  workers have so much challenge today.   If they care so much about the mining industry and the workers, then  bring that legislation forward on the floor of the Senate today instead  of trying to overturn a rule that says polluters should pay.   These safe drinking water issues and fishing issues are so important  to an outdoor economy that employs a million-plus workers and is a  vital part of practically every State's economy. The notion that  somehow this is a jobs issue--if they want to protect jobs in the  outdoor industry, then please allow people to fish in rivers where they  don't have to worry about selenium. This is a big issue, whether  talking about Montana, Colorado, Washington, or the State of Alaska.   I will say that the Alaskan issues of salmon and habitat far outweigh  the 113 jobs the Alaska coal industry produces. Both can be seen as  valuable jobs, but if we want to know about an economic impact to the  State, it is dwarfed by the issue of making sure salmon have clean  rivers and streams to migrate through.   This legislation today is about trying to protect those waters. I  would again say that the effects of mountaintop removal have been  called out by the press for a long time. I wish to quote from a  Washington Post editorial:         For decades, coal companies have been removing mountain       peaks to haul away coal lying just underneath. More recently,       scientists and regulators have been developing a clearer       understanding of the environmental consequences. They aren't       pretty.        In the 1990s, coal miners began using large equipment to       strip away mountaintops in states such as West Virginia. The       technique made it economical for them to extract more coal       from troublesome seams in the rock, which might be too small       for traditional mining or lodged in unstable formations.       Environmentalists were appalled, but the practice spread and       now accounts for more than 40 percent of West Virginia coal       production.        Burning coal has a host of drawbacks: It produces both       planet-warming carbon dioxide and deadly conventional air       pollutants. Removing layers of mountaintop in the extraction       process aggravates the damage. The displaced earth must go       somewhere, typically into adjoining valleys, affecting       streams that run through them. The dust that's blown into the       air on mountaintop removal sites, meanwhile, is suspected to       be unhealthy for mine workers and nearby communities.        Scientists have recently produced evidence backing up both       concerns. Over the summer, a U.S. Geological Survey study       compared streams near mountaintop removal operations to       streams farther away. In what should be ``a global hotspot       for fish biodiversity,'' according to Nathan Hitt, one of the       authors, the researchers found decimated fish populations,       with untold consequences for downstream river systems. The       scientists noted changes in stream chemistry: Salts from the       disturbed earth appear to have dissolved in the water, which       may well have disturbed the food chain.        Last week, the Charleston Gazette reported on a new study       finding that dust from mountaintop removal mining appears to       contribute to greater risk of lung cancer. West Virginia       University researchers took dust samples from several towns       near the mountaintop removal sites and tested them on lung       cells, which changed for the worse. The findings fit into a       larger, hazardous picture: People living near these sites       experience higher rates of cancer and birth defects.    Again, all this is from the Washington Post editorial.         With these sorts of problems in mind, the Environmental       Protection Agency is taking a more skeptical look at       mountaintop removal mining permits. The Clean Water Act gives       the government wide authority over industrial operations that       change rivers and streams.    The EPA has already used its efforts, in some cases where there was  concern, to revoke a permit and has instructed its branches and offices  to be more careful.         The coal industry and its allies--    And we have heard some of them here--       are howling. Skeptics of mountaintop removal, one industry       pamphlet insisted, ``promote an anti-coal, anti-business       agenda that uses environmental issues as a mere pawn to       redistribute wealth, grab power, and put forth liberal,       social ideology. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill that       would strip the EPA of some of its permitting power. But just       this month--    Because that was a couple years ago--       the Obama administration once again prevailed in court,       beating back another industry challenge.    This editorial ends by saying:         The emerging scientific evidence should cut through the       rhetoric. The EPA is right to move more firmly to protect       health and the environment.    We are right to defend this rule and law and say that polluters  should pay.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    I know we are going back and forth. I wish to inquire  if my colleague seeks to speak.   Go ahead because we are expecting someone on our side.    Madam President, I would like to continue the debate on  the measure before the Senate, which is to basically overturn a  provision that would require coal polluters to make sure they clean up  the damage they do to the clean water streams of our Nation.   We are here today because the agency who is in charge of setting  these rules has finalized a rule. They did so after more than 5 years  of discussion. They set it because there was so much scientific  information about the great degradation to our streams caused by  mining, when rocks are blown up and selenium is introduced into the  stream. I have pictures I showed last night of deformed fish, pictures  of river streams that are polluted. I have pictures of obvious  degradation of the environment around them.   The real issue is, the rule is now in place, and my colleagues want  to exempt the coal industry from such regulation. Why would you want to  exempt anybody from cleaning up their mess? Polluters should pay. I  know my colleagues are starting to chorus on some refrain about the  economy, which makes no sense. Natural gas has driven a very  competitive market to consuming more natural gas than coal,  [[Page S618]]  and Wall Street blew up the pension program of the miners, and now it  is in jeopardy. If you want to help miners, then come address their  health and safety and their pension program. If you want to make  natural gas more expensive, maybe you could make coal competitive  again, but I don't think that is what we really want in America.   My colleagues somehow ignore the fact that the people of the United  States of America are going to demand clean water one way or another.  You can protect the coal industry here with special interests and the  amount of lobbying they do, or you can step up this process and have a  regulation that works for the United States of America so the outdoor  industry, sportsmen and fishermen--who have many more jobs--can  continue to thrive. Why do I say that? Because my colleague from Texas  brought up the EPA nominee, Mr. Pruitt, who is coming to us from  Oklahoma. I found, with great pleasure, the same arguments that the  other side of the aisle is trying to make, they tried to make in  Oklahoma. ``Oh, my gosh. It is environmental regulation that is  stopping us from producing a greater, more robust farming economy. We  need to do something to stop those untoward regulations.''   What did they do? They had a big initiative for the ballot that  basically said: Let's make it really hard for anybody to regulate in  regard to farming, unless they show it is somehow in the greater State  interest. Even in red-state Oklahoma, they got it. They knew it was a  fast run on the Clean Water Act, and they defeated that basically 60 to  40.   If we want to have a debate by debate, State by State, a discussion  about clean water because people here will not defend the right for  people to have clean streams, then we will have that debate. My  colleagues sometimes try to say: Well, this is what attorneys general  are concerned about. Some of them don't like the rule. You have ample  opportunity to change the rule. You could come here and propose  legislation. You could ask your colleagues now to do something and move  forward on an alternative, but that is not what is happening. This  egregious approach is not only getting rid of a rule that currently  protects us, for safe streams, but because it is a Congressional Review  Act overriding that rule, it will prohibit us from taking up, in the  same fashion, an approach to make sure this is regulated in the future.  That is right. Turning down the rule this way will stop an agency from  doing the job it is supposed to do. Why not just leave it to the  States? That is like saying: I am going to leave clean air, clean  water, or nuclear waste cleanup to whatever a State decides. That is  not what Federal law is about.   Here is an editorial from Kentucky where a ``proposed $660,000  settlement of the Clean Water Act violations between the State's  environmental agencies, and two of its largest companies, underwent a  30-day review.'' What was that about? That was about the State of  Kentucky failing to implement the old law. This was in 2010. The State  of Kentucky's Attorney General--they were such laggards at this--people  sued the companies in the State because the State wasn't doing its job.  Eventually, they uncovered, as the article says, ``massive failures by  the industry to file accurate water discharge monitoring reports. They  filed an intent to sue, which triggered the investigation by the  State's energy and environmental cabinet.'' The notion that States are  on the job and doing their job in Kentucky--they weren't.   A State case was provoked by other people who were monitoring for  clean water. It is our prerogative to set a standard for miners to  clean up their mess. That is what we are talking about. Now the other  side of the aisle wants to overturn that, saying that polluters don't  have to pay.   How did we get to this situation? As mentioned, the past  administration worked hard at coming up with a stream protection rule.  Why did they come up with a new stream protection rule? Because it had  been 33 years since we had a stream protection rule. The old rule did  not prohibit mining through streams. Guess what? Neither does the new  rule. The new rule says you are not prohibited from mining through a  stream, but by gosh you ought to be required to mitigate the mess you  create in the water system by mining through that stream.   We are talking about mitigation requirements, and we are talking  about measurements. Why do we need that? Because since 1983, when the  previous rule was put in place--we now know that things like selenium  cause very bad things to happen in water, with rocks and the discharge.  We know selenium can cause the deformation of fish and that eating  those fish can make you sick. That is why we want to have a rule to  understand the impacts and to mitigate for them. I think about this  particular picture, and the deformation in the fish tail and in the  fish lip--the front end of the fish--are extreme examples of what  selenium is doing in our water supply. Why would you not want--as  someone blowing up a mountaintop and creating this kind of stream  damage, why would you not want them to mitigate that? Why would you  want to protect them? Because you think you are protecting some coal  industry jobs that basically have fallen off because natural gas has  become a cheaper product? Your economic strategy is a race to the  bottom. You think if you have the lowest environmental standards in the  United States of America, that is somehow going to generate jobs? I  think it is just the opposite. I have so many people in Washington  State who say: I can't attract employees unless we have a clean  environment here because people want to live in a clean environment,  they want to fish, they want to hunt, they want to recreate, and they  want an opportunity to do so. As a company, I can attract the best and  the brightest because they know they are going to live in that kind of  environment.   The notion that this kind of ``let us make sure the coal industry  doesn't have to play by the rules, they get an exemption from clean  water'' is some sort of economic strategy for the future of coal  country, it is absolutely not.   Saying that AGs are going to do the job, we have many examples of  where they haven't. There are also examples from Ohio and Pennsylvania,  where the degradation is so bad it is nearly impossible to clean up.   Let us talk a little bit about the comparison of jobs from outdoor  industry and the coal industry. It is not to demean the jobs of the  coal industry and the individuals who have worked their whole lives in  that sector or to say that one job is better than the other. There are  over 6 million jobs directly in the outdoor industry. They generate $80  billion in tax revenue, but if you come to Montana and there is a mine  on top of a stream and people don't want to go there to fish and  recreate anymore, then you have caused damage. What are we talking  about by State? Let's look at it. Montana, there are 64,000 jobs  related to outdoor recreation. Why? Because Montana is beautiful. It  has so many streams. I mentioned last night that wonderful movie called  ``A River Runs Through It.'' It doesn't say, ``A River Runs Through It  and a Mountaintop Mine Sits on Top of It.'' That is not what that movie  was about. It was about the beauty of the great outdoors. There are  122,000 recreation jobs in Utah. There are 125,000 in Colorado, 50,000  in Wyoming. There are 28,000 in North Dakota. Are people down here  defending those jobs? I am defending them because a clean stream is a  great source of recreation for people. I don't want to fish or hike in  a stream with selenium that could poison me or poison other people.  What is wrong with polluters paying? I say nothing.   The economic cost of this legislation is very minimal. The industry  would be responsible for less than .01 percent of the economic cost;  that is, the pollution that would be required to clean up from this  type of effort would be minimal to the industry. So what are they  complaining about? What are they complaining about? They don't want to  measure selenium in the water. They don't want to be responsible for  mitigating it.    The economic challenges that the industry faces from natural gas have  nothing to do with this issue. This issue is about whether polluters  should pay and whether we as a body are going to not only overturn this  rule that is about clean water and safety for our communities by having  streams protected. It is also about whether we are  [[Page S619]]  going to preclude another administrative approach to fixing this issue.   The Congressional Review Act is a very large cannon blowing a hole in  the clean water requirements for the coal industry. Once you turn this  down, you cannot easily reinstate something new. So our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, if they truly wanted to do something about  this, could come to the floor today and say: I propose something  different. President Trump, if he wanted to propose something different  that both guaranteed clean water and moved us forward, he could propose  something. Instead, they simply want to repeal this.   So this chart shows just what I have been referring to; that coal  basically now in 2016 is getting beat by natural gas. It is getting  beat by natural gas because it has become a cheaper source. We are not  going to get into the details of how that happened, but we are going to  say here today that the notion that you want to let them off the hook  from meeting environmental rules and regulations as a way to be  competitive is a dangerous, dangerous precedent for the United States  to be setting.   We will not win, and our economy will not win from that situation.  What we have to do instead is make sure that we are taking care of our  environment and being competitive in all sorts of industry issues. For  example, this story was about, in West Virginia, how mountaintop mining  caused a fish species to disappear. ``We are seeing significant  reductions of the species of abundant fish downstream from mining  operations.''   To me, that would be an anathema in the Pacific Northwest. Fishing is  everything. If somehow we were involved in a mining process that was  killing fish, that would be the worst thing that could happen to our  economy. There is no reason for us not to set rules and regulations to  make sure the mining industry cleans up their mess.   I hope our colleagues will understand how detrimental this rule is.  Do not give the mining companies an exemption from cleaning up messes  in their streams. Let's say that we are going to do the public interest  and not special interests.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I think my colleague from  Massachusetts is here on the floor to speak. I will let him have some  time.   I would say to my colleague from Alaska, the real bait-and-switch is  the side of this aisle that allows the Finance Committee to pretend  like it is going to do something on the pension program and votes a  month before the election, and then after the election, fails to act on  such an important issue. I hope people are not advocating pollution as  an economic strategy because it will not work.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for  being on the floor to speak. He is right. We are going to keep score.  There are going to be attempts by the Trump administration and the  other side of the aisle to level the score against clean water; that is  to say, polluters don't have to pay. So if we pass this override of  existing clean water rules--yes, this will be the start. Trump 1, clean  water 0.   Unfortunately, it is probably not going to the end because what is  happening now is, Republicans control everything in Congress. They want  to use their ability to have very little debate and to then override  rules that are on the books to protect streams in the United States of  America.   I so appreciate my colleagues coming to the floor to explain this  issue, as this is critical. It is critical because the impacts of  mining destroy headwaters. Between 1992 and 2000, coal mines were  authorized to destroy about 1,200 miles of headwater streams, and this  resulted in the loss of 4 percent of our upper headwater streams in  areas of Appalachia in a single decade.   The surface mining impact on water from fractured rocks above coal  seams react chemically with the air and water and produce higher  concentrations of minerals, irons and trace metals, and those  headwaters in West Virginia typically measure with electricity  conductivity on an order of magnitude of those downstream. What that is  saying is, these chemicals react in the water to create problems.  Understanding what has been going on with that level of conductivity is  one of the big advances in science in the last 10 years. That is why we  want to update the rule because we now know what goes on when selenium  is in the water. The conductivity is highly correlated with the loss  and the absence of various species that are very pollution sensitive.   This level of stream degradation comes from the various fractured  rock. When sulfate is present, you get acid mine drainage. That acid  mine drainage then mobilizes metals toxic to fish--such as iron and  aluminum and zinc--and that is where we start to have problems. A 2008  study found that 93 percent of streams downstream of surface mining  operations in Appalachia were impaired, and our colleagues don't want  to make sure that the mining companies monitor that and do stream  restoration?   Another study found that adverse impacts of Appalachian mines  extended on an average of 6 miles downstream; that is, this acid mine  drainage is flowing 6 miles downstream. Why not have the mines measure  this at the top of the stream, understanding what the selenium impact  is, and doing something to minimize the impact on our streams that we  are going to have to live with forever.   What is wrong with selenium? It causes very serious reproductive  problems, physical deformities, and at high concentration it is toxic  to humans. Basically, it is the similar effect to arsenic poisoning.   These coal mines are transforming our landscape, lowering our ridges,  and raising our valley floors. One study in 2013, in Central  Appalachia, found that mining lowered these ridgetops by an average of  112 feet. What we are trying to say is, you are impacting wildlife  downstream; that the deforestation of these sites allows the flow of  these rivers to increase flooding. The effects are worsened because the  compacted soil on these sites also causes a problem. It is not much  better than just plain old asphalt; that is, it means that plants and  forests cannot grow back, it means that it impairs these various  species, and it causes problems.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jan. 31, 2017]          A Plume of Pollution Discolors Part of Monongahela River                               (By Don Hopey)         An iron-orange acid water discharge from a long-abandoned       coal mine discolored the Monongahela River for a four-mile       stretch along the Allegheny County-Washington County border       over the weekend, raising public concern but causing no       problems for public water suppliers downriver.        The discharge from the Boston Gas Mine, its volume boosted       by recent rains, enters the river in the small Sunfish Run       tributary at Sunnyside, in Forward, 34 river miles from       Pittsburgh's Point. Beginning Saturday evening and continuing       through Sunday, it was visible flowing downriver in a 75-foot       wide plume that hugged the east bank until blending into the       river near New Eagle.        ``It was orange, and it had to be an enormous amount of       water to color the Mon,'' said Janet Roslund, a resident of       Monongahela, where she viewed the plume. ``Something about       that is just not right.''        Neil Shader, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of       Environmental Protection, said the plume likely contained       iron, aluminum and manganese, and the department is       continuing to take water samples. ``At this time there is no       concern for drinking water, and water systems have systems in       place to remove the contaminants,'' he said.        The Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation commission notified       all downriver water suppliers on the Allegheny and Ohio       rivers, but the closest, Pennsylvania American Water, with       intakes 10 miles down the Mon in Elrama and 18 miles       downriver at Becks Run, reported no water quality problems.        ``We've been monitoring the intakes for the past 40 hours       and have found no impacts to the water supply,'' Gary       Lobaugh, a water company spokesman said Monday. ``We've       increased our sampling of source water to every hour but seen       nothing impacting our water quality.''        According to Joe Donovan, a geologist at West Virginia       University who studies abandoned mine discharges in the Mon       Valley, the abandoned Boston Gas mine is a large  [[Page S630]]       mining complex that has approximately eight outcrop       discharges along the river between Donora and Monongahela.       The one on Sunfish Run that created the orange plume in the       river is the largest, he said.        ``Nothing new here,'' he said. ``(The) flow may be up this       time of year, especially right after a precip event.''     The discharge from the long-abandoned Boston Gas Mine  in Pennsylvania turned a 4-mile stretch of the Monongahela River  orange. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said  the plume likely contained iron, aluminum, and manganese. A geologist  at West Virginia University who studies abandoned mine discharges said  the abandoned mine is a large mining complex that has approximately  eight outcrop discharges and created this large plume.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an AP story dated January 28, 2017.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Associated Press, Jan. 28, 2017]         Underground Fires, Toxins in Unfunded Cleanup of Old Mines                           (By Michael Virtanen)         Preston County, W.Va. (AP).--An underground coal mine fire       burns beneath a sprawling hillside in West Virginia, the       pale, acrid smoke rising from gashes in the scarred, muddy       earth only a stone's throw from some houses.        The fire, which may have started with arson, lightning or a       forest fire, smoldered for several years before bursting into       flames last July in rural Preston County. The growing blaze       moved the mine to the top of a list of thousands of problem       decades-old coal sites in West Virginia awaiting cleanup and       vying for limited federal funds.        State officials say $4.5 billion worth of work remains at       more than 3,300 sites abandoned by coal companies before       1977, when Congress passed a law establishing a national fund       for old cleanups. That program was part of an effort to heal       the state from the ravages of an industry that once dominated       its economy but has fallen on hard times.        ``West Virginia is right at the top for needs,'' said Chuck       Williams, head of Alabama's efforts and past president of the       National Association of Abandoned Mine Lands Programs. He       said Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia--all states       with a mining history that extends back two centuries--      account for the lion's share of unfinished work among the 28       states and Indian tribes in the program.        Despite being one of the most affected, federal officials       have only one-third of West Virginia's proposed cleanup costs       on their $7 billion national list of high-priority work. The       sites include old mines that leak acidic water into streams       and kill wildlife and dangerous holes that attract children.       Tunnels and caverns beneath homes also need to be shored up       and new water lines are needed where wells are polluted.        ``Our program exists to abate health and safety hazards,''       said Rob Rice, chief of the West Virginia Office of Abandoned       Mine Lands and Reclamation, which is handling the mine fire.       ``We have so much need. It's frustrating for us.''        Environmental improvements are a secondary but major       benefit, he said.        ``This whole area has been extensively mined,'' said       Jonathan Knight, riding recently through the exurbs east of       Morgantown. A planner for the state office, he said housing       developments have been built above old mines that many       homeowners don't even know about.        The state will get $23.3 million from the federal       reclamation fund this year, which is replenished by fees on       mining companies. The mines pay 12 cents per ton of       underground coal mined and 28 cents per ton from surface       mining, but the funding has dropped the past three years with       a downturn in coal production.        It will cost about $1 billion just to extinguish all of       West Virginia's 43 fires in abandoned mines, according to the       state office. They could have been caused by forest fires,       arson, lightning strikes or even old underground explosions       that never went completely out.        About $5 million will be spent to extinguish the Preston       County fire, smoldering a stone's throw from houses in a       mostly rural area near the hamlet of Newburg. In October, the       office spent $209,400 to cut trees and plug holes feeding the       fire with oxygen.        The state office, with about 50 staff, is paid from the       federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund along with the       contractors it hires. Together they close mine portals,       extinguish fires, support collapsing hillsides and sinking       houses, and treat acidic water leaking out along with       dissolved metals. The need for drainage work won't end for       centuries. The grants also fund water lines to replace       polluted wells.        ``There's more water within mine pools in West Virginia       than there is in the lakes of West Virginia,'' Rice said.       ``More than 2,500 miles of streams are severely degraded       because of mine drainage in West Virginia.''        The state program has brought several back to life with new       treatment systems.        The federal program is scheduled by law to expire in 2021,       leaving behind about $2.5 billion in a trust fund expected to       pay for any ongoing work needed by 25 states and three Indian       tribes to address problems from pre-1977 abandoned coal       mines. West Virginia has set aside about $55 million of its       grant money received already for continuing water treatment       funded by the interest.        The federal program has collected more than $10.5 billion       in fees from coal production and distributed more than $8       billion in grants to states and tribes, according to the       federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.       It will provide nearly $181 million in fiscal 2017.        ``We continue to discover threats from left-behind mine       pits, dangerous highwalls, acid mine drainage that pollutes       our water supplies, and hazardous mine openings,'' federal       director Joe Pizarchik said earlier this year. An Obama       administration appointee, he resigned effective last week.        Pollution and lurking underground dangers from mining since       1977 fall into a different category because the federal       government made them the responsibility of the companies.       They were required to post bonds before opening mines, with       the state taking over if they default.     The article talked about Preston, WV, and a fire in an  abandoned coal mine that smoldered for several years. This mine is one  of ``thousands of problem decades-old coal sites in West Virginia  awaiting cleanup.''   These abandoned sites include old mines that leak acidic water into  streams and killing wildlife. Tunnels and caverns beneath homes  threaten water sources where wells are polluted.   All of these are examples of the kind of damage that is being done by  these mines.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  another article from the Columbus Dispatch.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Columbus Dispatch, July 20, 2014]      In West Virginia, Mountaintop Mining Is Causing Fish Species To                                 Disappear         Washington.--In West Virginia's Appalachian Mountains, fish       are vanishing. The number of species has fallen, the       populations of those that remain are down, and some fish look       a little skinny.        A new government study traces the decline in abundance to       mountaintop removal, the controversial coal-mining practice       of clear-cutting trees from mountains before blowing off       their tops with explosives.        When the resulting rain of shattered rock hits the rivers       and streams that snake along the base of the mountains,       minerals released from within the stone change the water's       chemistry, the study said, lowering its quality and causing       tiny prey such as insects, worms and invertebrates to die.        ``We're seeing significant reductions in the number of fish       species and total abundance of fish downstream from mining       operations,'' said Nathaniel Hitt, a research fish biologist       for the U.S. Geological Survey's office in Kearneysville,       W.Va., and one of the study's two authors.        Hitt and his co-author, Doug Chambers, a biologist and       water-quality specialist in the Charleston, W.Va., office of       the USGS, took a 1999 study of the Guyandotte River basin's       fish populations by Penn State researchers to compare them       over time.        For two years starting in 2010, they sampled the       populations in waters downstream from an active mountaintop       coal-mining operation. In one of the sample areas, the Mud       River watershed, which contains the largest tributary of the       Guyandotte River, at least ``100 point-source pollution-      discharge permits associated with surface mining have been       issued,'' the study said.        North America's central Appalachian Mountains, where the       basin lies, are considered a global hot spot of freshwater-      fish biodiversity, but few researchers have investigated the       impact of mountain strip mining on stream fish, and the       effects ``are poorly understood,'' the study said.        Hitt and Chambers found that the number of species was cut       in half and the abundance of fish fell by a third. The       silverjaw minnow, rosyface shiner, silver shiner, bluntnose       minnow, spotted bass and largemouth bass, plus at least two       other species detected before their study, were no longer       there.        Another fish species--the small and wormlike least brook       lamprey, never before detected--had moved in.        In areas of the river basin where there was no mountaintop       mining, fish flourished. In addition to species that had been       in those waters previously, seven new ones were found,       including the spotfin shiner, the spottail shiner and the       golden redhorse.        ``I think if we only focus on the fact that it's fish . . .       some people will say, `So what?'??'' Chambers said. But fish       and the invertebrates they eat are canaries in a coal mine       for researchers, ``indicators of the water quality,'' he       said.        The USGS looks ``at the nation's water resources . . .       their significance to the nation, and tries to understand       processes that are degrading water quality. Tainted water may       not be suitable for additional uses.''        Research such as the USGS' study of mountaintop mining,       published online this month by the Society for Freshwater  [[Page S631]]       Science, is viewed with suspicion in coal country, where       mining operations provide thousands of jobs.        ``The people opposed to the coal industry are trying to       pile on with more studies,'' said Bill Raney, president of       the West Virginia Coal Association. ``It sounds like this is       one of those studies that sets out to show there's harm done.       It sounds like perhaps more of the same.''        Raney said he has not seen the USGS study and cannot       strongly criticize its methods or conclusions, but people       ``don't just wake up in the morning and decide they are going       to do mountaintop mining,'' he said. ``It takes three to four       years to get a permit. Every aspect of the operation is       analyzed.''        Mountaintop removal as a way of extracting coal has been in       practice since the 1960s, but its use has expanded in the       past two decades, and it now takes place in the Appalachian       regions of Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia in addition to West       Virginia.        The coal that the process produces provides power to       hundreds of thousands of homes, industry advocates say, and       creates about 14,000 jobs that pay middle-income salaries in       regions where work is hard to find.        ``The average mining wage is more than $66,000 per year . .       . 57 percent higher than the average for industrial jobs,''       according to the National Mining Association. ``Mountaintop       mining accounts for approximately 45 percent of the entire       state's coal production in West Virginia.''        Raney's association disputes allegations that mining       destroys streams and mountains, saying that state permits and       government regulations require the land to be restored after       use.        But the Sierra Club Eastern Missouri Group called the       practice ``quite possibly the worst environmental assault       yet'' because of the amount of landscape it removes and the       effects on people and animals.        Homeowners in one West Virginia community, Lindytown, were       bought out by a company before the town essentially       disappeared after mountaintop removal. Homes and a grave site       were left behind. Cascading debris has buried streams,       affecting a diversity of wildlife, a major concern raised by       the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.        Often, companies are granted exemptions that ease       requirements to restore land. Conservationists call the       practice a plunder, and protesters, including Quakers in       Appalachia and demonstrators at the White House, have called       on the government to end it and banks to stop funding it.        ``Mountaintop-removal mining is one of the fastest-changing       land-use forms in the region,'' Hitt said. ``One of the main       questions for our research lab is how biological communities       respond to land-use changes.''        In the case of the fish, they seemingly do not respond       well, Chambers said. ``To sum up, 10 fish species were       apparently extirpated from the mined sites,'' meaning they       were wiped out, he said.        Fish with a more diverse diet appeared to fare well, but       those that relied primarily on invertebrates, such as small       aquatic insects, tended to fare poorly.        ``It's telling us that the water quality is changing,''       Chambers said. Water in that area is not used for drinking,       he said, but ``if you look at it from a regulatory       perspective, you have to determine if the water is fishable,       swimmable, drinkable--all of these are benchmarks.''     The article states: ``The report found that the number  of species was cut in half and the abundance of fish fell by a third,  downstream from these mining operations.''   I wish to talk about a mine now owned by Murray Energy that in 2009  spewed pollution in Pennsylvania, killing 43,000 fish and 15,000  mussels. Seven years later, the fish and mussels are still missing and  not returning. They have paid a fine, but we are still living with the  damage.   As my colleagues can see, this issue is about overriding a rule that  helps protect our streams and rivers and makes sure that the wildlife  there has safe drinking water and to make sure that we enjoy these  natural areas. As I have pointed out through this debate, there are  many jobs in the outdoor industry, and that is why sportsmen such as  Trout Unlimited and the wildlife federations that are coalitions of  hunters and fishermen all support this rule and don't want it  overturned.   I know that the coal industry has spent $160 million over the last  dozen-plus years trying to defeat regulation of its industry. Actually,  the 0.1 percent they would have to pay was a lot lower than what they  were spending on their lobbying issues. Instead, they should help us  all get to the bottom.   But why have we done this by trying to fight today? That is because  the science has told us that since 1983, we have a lot more information  about the toxic level in the streams because of these products. We  simply want a rule that reflects that the mining industry must measure  and mitigate that impact. What is wrong with allowing science to lead  the way?   I know our colleagues like to say that States should be left to do  this, but you do have to have a Federal standard. You do have to have a  Federal standard that they adhered to. It would be as if today I said:  Let's override what we have done in this Nation in setting a miles per  gallon for automobiles and just leave it up to the States instead.   Well, we are saying we should have fuel efficiency but let's just  leave it up to the States about how many miles per gallon we really  should have in automobiles.   If we did that, how many regulations do you think we would have? Do  you think we would have the same fuel efficiency we have today?   What is happening is these coal companies are going into States,  going into their areas, and lobbying lawmakers there against  regulation, and in a couple of cases I have discussed today they were  successful in getting Kentucky to fall asleep at the switch so the  citizens brought the lawsuits to clean up the mines. They were  successful because they finally caught the attention of people who  should have been doing their job.   This rule, as it has been put in place, does give States flexibility.  Its key definition says States get discretion to establish an objective  criteria for measuring standards and restoring the streams. It  basically says the final rule has several options to demonstrate  compliance on the area of fish-and-wildlife. States can use their  judgment about the types, scope, and location of enhancements. It says  on groundwater, States can choose their sampling, protocol, subsequent  analysis, and baseline. On rain measurements, States can choose whether  to require mines to prepare a hydrologic model about the mine, and  States can choose to allow mining companies to change their drainage  patterns as they look at rebuilding ephemeral streams.   There is a lot of flexibility for the States. A lot of them haven't  been doing as good a job as we would like, but you have to have a  Federal standard. Your Federal standard is decades old. Science is  telling us we have a problem. Please, please, do not pass this override  of an important clean water law. Instead, if we want to fix it, let's  sit down and do that legislatively. Let's not allow the polluters to  get away with having their way on so many streams across America.   Mr. President, my comments here reflect my understanding as ranking  member of the Senate committee of jurisdiction over the Surface Mining  Control and Reclamation Act, SMCRA.   I am strongly opposed to disapproving the Office of Surface Mining  Reclamation and Enforcement's stream protection rule because I both  support the substance of the rule and I believe the Congressional  Review Act is an inappropriate and extreme legislative tool.   While my opposition to H.J. Res. 38 and its Senate companion, S.J.  Res. 10, is clear, in the event that either resolution is enacted, I  would look forward to a timely reissuance of a new rule.  Notwithstanding the delay resulting from enactment of either  disapproval resolution, the authority SMCRA grants to OSMRE through the  Secretary of the Interior will persist--so will the clear obligations  in the statute.   The provision in the Congressional Review Act that prohibits  reissuance of a future rule ``in substantially the same form'' as the  rule being disapproved, unless specifically authorized by another  future law, does not diminish my confidence. Under the ample authority  granted to the Secretary of the Interior under SMCRA, a large variety  of forms of implementing its obligations under SMCRA remain available  to the Agency.   The resolution represents a major setback for many communities  affected by coal mining that had participated in an extensive 8-year  rulemaking process. But it does not limit OSMRE's ability or obligation  to implement SMCRA's statutory requirements fully, including but not  limited to regulations that define material damage to the hydrologic  balance outside the permit area; give effect to the SMCRA's  prohibitions against material damage to the hydrologic balance outside  the permit area; prohibit harmful mining activity within a certain  perimeter, including the stream buffer zone as under the 1983  regulations; require permitting decisions to be based on full and  complete information; ensure protections  [[Page S632]]  for fish and wildlife; and guarantee that adequate financial assurances  are put into place to provide for full and complete reclamation.   I expect any Secretary of the Interior to follow the law and fully  implement the ongoing obligations under SMCRA.   I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.
