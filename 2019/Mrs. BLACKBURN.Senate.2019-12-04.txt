 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the past few months we have all  watched as the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong turned the tables  on Beijing, and, indeed, we have passed legislation in this Chamber and  the President has signed that, addressing the issue.   Hong Kong's recent elections really were a stunning rebuke to  Beijing.   Seven in 10 eligible voters risked persecution to speak out at the  ballot box, and the government's allies' political control over Hong  Kong collapsed. Hong Kong wants their freedom. We are proud of those  freedom fighters. We continue to support them. But we also must  recognize that Beijing's crimes spread far beyond the world of  cellphone cameras and fearless journalism.   In the far west Xinjiang region, Chinese officials are perpetrating a  different and even more horrific human rights violation. Xinjiang is  home to 11 million Uighurs, an indigenous Turkic Muslim ethnic minority  that the Chinese Government has tormented for decades. Although the  Uighurs built their lives and a booming economy in China, they feel  more culturally and ethnically close to their neighbors living in  Central Asian nations.   Much like Tibet, Xinjiang is an autonomous region that, after the  Communists subjugated the area in 1949, the central government  increased its control over the lives of Uighurs by oppressing  commercial, religious, and cultural activity deemed inconsistent with  state doctrine. Think about that; the Chinese Communists said these  activities are inconsistent with state doctrine.   In the wake of 9/11, China seized on the actions of Uighur  separatists to create a propaganda campaign comparing the separatists  to Al Qaeda. They use these accusations to blame the Uighur population  at large for unrest and crack down mercilessly on even peaceful  protest. In 2016, the government further ramped up persecution of  Uighurs under the guise of repressing antigovernment activity.   Their current playbook really looks familiar: arbitrary detention of  over a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in concentration  camps that they have labeled ``political re-education centers;''  torture for those who fail to tell the Communist Party what the  Communist Party wants to hear; compulsory digital and physical  surveillance and the merciless eradication of free expression, freedom  of religion, and basic expectations of privacy.   The camps have garnered widespread international attention, in spite  of Chinese officials' uncompromising repression of foreign journalists,  but the government's pervasive digital surveillance programs are  putting the Communist Party in a position to racially profile and  persecute those who threaten China's plans for dominance.   Yesterday's New York Times featured a story detailing how Chinese  Government officials are forcibly collecting blood samples from the  Uighurs with the ultimate goal of using DNA to improve facial  recognition capabilities. Although the government claims that these  capabilities will place a new tool in law enforcement's tool box, human  rights watchdogs rightfully fear that Beijing will use it to justify  even more intense racial profiling and persecution.   These violations are all committed by a member of the United Nations  Human Rights Council. These are going almost completely ignored by the  international community. The EU and the European academic institutions  have supported China's research and development of facial recognition  technology, often without verifying that the necessary DNA samples were  not forcibly obtained.   Unfortunately, American technology companies have supported and  profited from China's increasingly sophisticated surveillance  capabilities. Tourists and corporate partners will once again flock to  Beijing for the 2022 Olympic Games, even though they are fully aware-- fully aware--that the Chinese Government will track them, record them,  surveil them, and analyze their every move.   The Trump administration's crackdown on tech exports to Huawei and  other Chinese entities, that sent a strong message to Beijing. Just  last month, I joined my colleagues in a letter to Secretaries Pompeo,  Mnuchin, and Ross urging them to sanction individual Chinese officials  responsible for ordering and coordinating mass internment and forced  labor in Xinjiang.   But most leaders and executives even in the West fail to realize that  China's bad behavior is an indication of their global ambitions. China  thinks power and the almighty dollar--not freedom--rule the day.  Everything China does, from their military activity in the South China  Sea and the Horn of Africa, to the flood of Chinese-made products into  the global market, is done with the goal of exporting their  destructive, repressive ideology.  [[Page S6849]]    What they are doing to the Uighurs, to the Hong Kong people, and even  to their own supposedly loyal comrades, they intend to do to you. The  Chinese surveillance state is an essential means to their end game of  absolute control of the thought, movement, and relationships with other  global powers.   How far must China go before we reject the notion that their  influence will stop at our border? I ask my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to consider their answer carefully, as questions will  inevitably rise about the relevance of free speech and the Constitution  or the importance of a strong national defense.   We are in the midst of great power competition, and we do not have a  National Defense Authorization Act. It would be the first time in 58  years. I encourage my colleagues to work with us. Let's get this  complete because the threats are real, and the more we compromise our  own values, the easier it will become for foreign influence to take  hold in our society.
