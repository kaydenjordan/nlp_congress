 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3101, the  Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our  Ports Act of 2017.  [[Page H8107]]    I thank Congresswoman Torres for introducing this important piece of  legislation that addresses security at our nation's ports.   H.R. 3101 requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to  facilitate increased information sharing about cybersecurity among  maritime interests.   The bill requires DHS to:   Develop, implement, and continually review a maritime cybersecurity  risk assessment model to evaluate current and future cybersecurity  risks;   Seek input from at least one information sharing and analysis  organization representing maritime interests in the National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center;   Establish voluntary reporting guidelines for maritime-related  cybersecurity risks and incidents;   Request that the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee report  and make recommendations to DHS about methods to enhance cybersecurity  and information sharing among security stakeholders from federal,  state, local, and tribal governments; public safety and emergency  response agencies; law enforcement and security organizations; maritime  industry participants; port owners and operators; and maritime terminal  owners and operators; and   Ensure that maritime security risk assessments include cybersecurity  risks to ports and the maritime border of the United States.   As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and  former Ranking Member of the Committee's Subcommittee on Border and  Maritime Security, I am well aware of the hard work that the Houston  Port Authority, and the Department of Homeland Security has done to  secure the port, its workers, and the millions of tons of imports and  exports that traverse the waters of the Port of Houston each week.   According to the U.S. Department of Transportation the U.S. maritime  border covers 95,000 miles of shoreline with 361 seaports.   Ocean transportation accounts for 95 percent of cargo tonnage that  moves in and out of the country, with 8,588 commercial vessels making  82,044 port calls in 2015.   The Port of Houston is a 25-mile-long complex of diversified public  and private facilities located just a few hours' sailing time from the  Gulf of Mexico.   In 2012, ship channel-related businesses contributed 1,026,820 jobs  and generated more than $178.5 billion in statewide economic activity.   In 2014, among U.S. ports the Port of Houston was ranked:   1st in foreign tonnage;   Largest Texas port with 46 percemt of market share by tonnage and 95  percent market share in containers by total TEUS in 2014;   Largest Gulf Coast container port, handling 67 percent of U.S. Gulf  Coast container traffic in 2014;   2nd in total foreign cargo value (based on U.S. Dept. of Commerce,  Bureau of Census).   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that the Port of  Houston port, and its waterways, and vessels are part of an economic  engine handling more than $700 billion in merchandise annually.   The Port of Houston houses approximately 100 steamship lines offering  services that link Houston with 1,053 ports in 203 countries.   The Port of Houston is a $15 billion petrochemical complex, the  largest in the nation and second largest worldwide.   These statistics clearly communicate the potential for a terrorist  attack using nuclear or radiological material may in some estimations  be low, but should an attack occur the consequences would be  catastrophic, and for this reason we cannot be lax in our efforts to  deter, detect and defeat attempts by terrorists to perpetrate such a  heinous act of terrorism.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays an essential role in  domestic defense against the potential smuggling of a weapon of mass  destruction in a shipping container or the use of a bomb-laden small  vessel to carry out an attack at a port.   Earlier this year, a global malware attack occurred that caused  significant harm to international shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk.   That attack revealed serious vulnerabilities in our nation's maritime  security, which is still being assessed.   The only way port operations were able to resume following the attack  at one of our nation's busiest ports was to revert to a manual system  to process cargo and ships.   This was not the first time that cyber criminals used technology  against port operations.   Approximately $1.3 trillion in cargo passes through our nation's 360  commercial ports.   The convenience, precision and accuracy provided by digital  technology in processing cargo through our nation's ports adds to their  capacity to manage tonnage.   Securing cyber technology to manage port operations, ranging from  communication and navigation to engineering, safety, and cargo, is  critical to protect our nation's maritime cyber infrastructure.   Government leaders and security experts are concerned that the  maritime transportation system could be used by terrorists to smuggle  personnel, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous materials  into the United States.   They are also concerned that ships in U.S. ports, particularly large  commercial cargo ships or cruise ships, could be attacked by  terrorists.    A large-scale terrorist attack at a U.S. port, experts warn, could  not only cause local death and damage, but also paralyze global  maritime commerce.   This is of particular concern at the Port of Houston, which is the  busiest port in the nited States in terms of foreign tonnage, second- busiest in the United States in terms of overall tonnage, and  fifteenth-busiest in the world.   DHS, through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation  Security Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard, administers several  essential programs that secure our Nation's ports and waterways.   I include in the Record a letter dated March 30, 2017, that I sent to  the Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security  requesting a field hearing on the topic of port security.   I ask my colleagues join me in voting to pass H.R. 3101, the  Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our  Ports Act of 2017.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chair, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Homeland Security, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: Your       leadership to secure the homeland from terrorist attacks by       putting the needs of the nation first in matters before the       Committee is commendable. I am writing to request that as       Chair and Ranking Member that you invite senior members of       the Committee to join you for a meeting with Houston Port       facility security and industrial manufacturing professionals       to discuss the work and industry that takes place at that       port.        The issue of port security remains integral to our       Committee's work, and this opportunity for you, and senior       members of the committee to learn more about modern ports is       appreciated. Ports are indispensable to our nation's economic       health as engines of commercial transportation as well as the       gateway for food and essential goods to the nation's       interior. The evolution of major ports, like the Port of       Houston into co-location sites for manufacturing means port       security challenges have expanded.        Thank you for your work to secure our nation from terrorist       threats by keeping the committee abreast of the most critical       security issues facing our nation. I look forward to your       positive reply to this request.            Very truly yours,                                                Sheila Jackson Lee,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Chair, I would only offer to say that there is  not one Judiciary Committee Democrat on this so-called bipartisan bill.  That is where you first start the bipartisanship: you work with members  who may, in fact, believe that some of the issues that have been raised  by my  [[Page H8115]]  good friend from California may have merit.   Maybe this bill could have been drafted in a way that would have  responded to some of the failures, if there are some, such as evidenced  by our good friend from New Jersey, who recalled a lot of failures not  by Democrats but by Republicans. But when you start off with a bill  talking about slush funds, then you negate the good work of so many  organizations that have benefited to do the very good that the consent  decree was intended to do.   Today, I stood with the Latinas Against Domestic Violence. They came  here to stand against the violence against women that goes on and on  and on. Some of them may be in the gallery.   But what I would say, Mr. Chairman, is: Why would we not want to give  that organization funds if they were in line to get dollars to help  prevent or intervene in the vileness of domestic violence?   So the idea that our friends on the other side are missing is the  value some of these entities have been given.   The only word that I have heard over and over again, as I have heard  from the administration, I have heard from the Attorney General, the  former Secretary of Health and Human Services, is one word. In fact, I  think the English language has been limited to one word on the floor of  the House: Obama. I like to call him President Barack Obama. That is  the respect I give him.   Every legislative initiative has come forward on the shoulders of a  man who finishes 8 years, might I say, with a great deal of respect.   So here is what the bill the people are opposed to will do:   This bill would not give dollars to those victims who are harmed and  could engage in workplace monitoring, as well as other payments to  remedy generalized harm, including remedies designed to prevent the  recurrence of sexual violence or discrimination in the workplace.   They wouldn't give it to an environmental remedy project, such as  needed cleanup efforts following the hazardous toxic pollutant spills  that spoil protected areas, preventing families and children from  enjoying recreation on State lands designed for public use.    They wouldn't give it to federally certified housing counseling  intermediaries by preventing housing counseling, relief to communities  that have been preyed upon by financial institutions that have broken  the law.   I even hate to use the term ``slush.'' They are dollars out of a  consent decree that are managed and monitored by career professionals  to those in need.   So I am opposed to the underlying bill, and I will offer an  amendment.    I will also be on this floor offering letters  opposing, again, not only this dastardly named legislation--who would  want to see this in the Congressional Record: slush fund--undermining,  as I said, the professionalism of our career employees in the DOJ and  undermining American citizens and nonprofits who are working every day  to make the life of America and America's children better.   This is a bad bill. Vote it down. It is not bipartisan. No Judiciary  Committee Democrat saw fit for it to be legitimate.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 732, the ``Stop  Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017.''   The proposed legislation, as currently drafted, is intended to  preclude all third-party payments in settlement agreements, other than  restitution to identifiable victims.   Specifically, this legislation seeks to block federal law from  including payments that provide relief in negotiated settlements to  victims, such as in cases of predatory lending, employment  discrimination and pollution through environmental hazardous.   For the average American, this harmful bill translates as thwarting  settlement donations to legitimately harmed victims for:   1. Workplace monitoring, as well as, other payments to remedy  generalized harm, including remedies designed to prevent the recurrence  of sexual violence or discrimination in the workplace;   2. Environmental remedy projects, such as needed clean-up efforts  following the hazardous, toxic pollutant spills that spoil protected  areas, preventing families and children from enjoying recreation time  on state lands designed for public use; or   3. Federally-certified housing counseling intermediaries by  preventing housing counseling relief to communities that have been  preyed upon by financial institutions that have broken the law.   This legislation fails to recognize the critical role and positive  benefits that housing counseling organizations now play in addressing  and ensuring that the discriminatory practices and abuses, like those  that led to the housing and financial crisis, never happen again.   The Republican narrative suggests that this bill attempts to make  technical changes to the way that courts operate; but in reality, for  the everyday hard working American, this legislation along with its  companion bills (H.R. 720, the ``Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act,'' and  H.R. 725, the ``Innocent Party Protection Act,'') is merely a concerted  effort to chip away at Americans' ability to seek justice and,  therefore, must be opposed.   This legislation is intended to cut off proceeds from government  settlements to ``third-party'' entities, which would stop a critical  source of funding for the nonprofit sector--including public interest  community organizations, foundations or trusts and other similar  groups.   Oftentimes, allowing these monies to be available to third-parties is  the best way to assure harmed persons will be made whole.   By barring government settlements from directing payments to non- profit organizations, this legislation would thereby hamstring the  parties' ability to fully remedy the wrongdoing underlying the lawsuit.   Congress lacks the time, expertise, and resources to properly review  and make enforcement decisions on behalf of Federal agencies.   The cost of delays associated with this scheme would have devastating  consequences for the public health, environment, and local communities.   H.R. 732 would greatly strain Congress' already limited legislative  resources and scarce time, while opening the doors to industry  influence and obstruction in routine enforcement matters.   This legislation pushes the everyday hard working American to the  margins of the justice system by requiring restitution only in cases  with a showing of actual harm directly and proximately caused by the  party making the payment.   The bill's definition excludes any payment by a party to provide  restitution for, or otherwise, remedy the actual harm, directly and  proximately caused by the alleged conduct of the party that is the  basis for the settlement agreement, including payments requiring  monitoring and other payments for generalized harm.   This exception is too narrowly drawn to allow for numerous beneficial  uses of settlement monies, especially for vulnerable plaintiffs trying  to access the courts in search of restitution from legitimate harm.   As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S. Department of  Justice pursued lawsuits against mortgage lenders and banks that  engaged in discriminatory lending practices, such as those targeted by  this legislation.   Research shows that African Americans and Latinos were discriminated  against and steered into subprime loans even when they qualified for  conventional loans.   Moreover, African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more  likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which resulted  in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional loans.   Pursuant to the settlement agreements, available under current law,  the Justice Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a  portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) certified housing counseling intermediaries to  provide consumer relief in the communities that were hit hardest.   HUD has approved thirty-seven housing counseling intermediaries that  financial institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party  providers of consumer relief under the terms of the Justice Department  settlement agreements.   Additionally, these HUD-certified housing counseling providers  deliver financial education and coaching to individuals to inform them  of their home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and  remain homeowners.   In fact, since 2008, 40 affiliates have provided housing counseling  services--to date serving more than 200,000 clients in mostly  underserved areas.   The success of housing counseling programs is undisputed.   Borrowers who have used housing counseling are one-third less likely  to be seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who are in  default are 60 percent more likely to save their homes.   The benefits of these programs are tangible and must continue to be  made available to the public.  [[Page H8116]]    This example is particularly pertinent as Houston recovers from  hurricane Harvey, a tragedy that displaced tens of thousands of my  constituents.   There are still over 61 thousand people living in hotels throughout  Texas.   The public has found itself in need of protection form environmental  harms caused by absconding deep pocket defendants.   To ensure these protections, the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) may request Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in  settlement agreements to offset the harms of unlawful conduct by  requiring parties to undertake an environmentally beneficial project or  activity that ``is not required by law,'' but that a defendant agrees  to undertake as part of the settlement of an enforcement action.   In workplace discrimination cases, victims are guarded by the Civil  Rights Act passed by Congress in 1964 to remove discriminatory barriers  and to promote equality in employment opportunities.   Cases, nonetheless, involving workplace discrimination claims often  occur without identifiable victims and tend to affect the interests of  persons who are not likely to receive compensation for unlawful conduct  (e.g., unidentifiable victims such as former and future employees).   In these cases, a settling party that violated antidiscrimination  laws may seek to resolve its civil liability through workplace  monitoring or training programs that seek to remedy systemic unlawful  conduct.   Furthermore, the claim that the funding received by organizations to  provide home counseling services to harmed individuals amount to a  ``slush fund,'' is an egregious and shameless attempt to smear and  impugn the integrity of longstanding and trusted nonprofits and civil  rights organizations.   As the Justice Department has observed, remedies can correct both  noncompliance and recidivism through settlement terms that require a  party to undertake activity to prevent future misconduct.   Not only is this legislation an unnecessary intrusion into the  province of the federal courts, it is a part of a larger push to limit  Americans' ability to seek justice in a court of law.   An innocent-sounding name aside, this bill poses a grave threat to  our court system--the nation's stronghold for protecting our democracy.   In the current political climate, where the justice system is the  last line of defense for our nation's values, I urge my colleagues not  to cede that ground.   Congress should applaud and elevate the benefits of housing  counseling, and the good work of frontline organizations, in righting  the injustices of the past and present.   The working men and women of America, as well as their families  deserve fair and impartial access to real justice when major  corporations, inadvertently as it may be, inflict harm.   It is our duty as guardians of the judicial system to ensure real  restitution is available to all, including the most vulnerable.   For these reasons, I urge all Members to vote against H.R. 732.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from National Urban  League and a letter from Public Citizen.                                           National Urban League,                                     New York, NY, February 1, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 732--The Stop Settlement Slush Funds           Act of 2017.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers,      Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: As       President and CEO of the National Urban League, the nation's       largest historic civil rights organization dedicated to       economic empowerment of African Americans and other       underserved urban communities, I write to urge you to oppose       H.R. 732, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017. This       legislation seeks to block federal law enforcement from       including in negotiated settlements payments that provide       relief to victims of predatory lending. Specifically, the       bill targets federally certified housing counseling       intermediaries such as the National Urban League by       preventing these organizations from providing housing       counseling relief to communities that have been preyed upon       by financial institutions that have broken the law. H.R. 732       fails to recognize the critical role and positive benefits       that housing counseling organizations now play in addressing       and ensuring that the discriminatory practices and abuses,       like those that led to the housing and financial crisis,       never happen again.        As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S.       Department of Justice pursued law suits against mortgage       lenders and banks that engaged in discriminatory lending       practices. Research shows that African Americans and Latinos       were discriminated against and steered into subprime loans       even when they qualified for conventional loans. Moreover,       African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more       likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which       resulted in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional       loans. Pursuant to the settlement agreements, the Justice       Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a       portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of       Housing and Urban Development (HUD) certified housing       counseling intermediaries to provide consumer relief in the       communities that were hit hardest.        The National Urban League is one of thirty-seven HUD-      approved housing counseling intermediaries that financial       institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party       providers of consumer relief under the terms of the Justice       Department settlement agreements. The National Urban League       is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has a 4-star       rating from Charity Navigator, placing it in the top 10       percent of all U.S. charities for adhering to good       governance, fiscal responsibility and other best practices.        As a HUD-certified housing counseling provider, the       National Urban League successfully delivers financial       education and coaching to individuals to inform them of their       home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and       remain homeowners. In fact, since 2008, 40 of our affiliates       have provided housing counseling services--to date serving       more than 200,000 clients in mostly underserved areas.        The success of housing counseling programs provided by       National Urban League and others is undisputed. Borrowers who       have used housing counseling are one-third less likely to be       seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who       are in default are 60 percent more likely to save their       homes. The benefits of these programs are tangible and must       continue to be made available to the public.        On a separate note, it has come to my attention the       National Urban League and National Council of La Raza have       been singled out during recent hearings on this legislation.       The claims made during congressional testimony that the       funding received by our organizations to provide home       counseling services amounts to a ``slush fund,'' is an       egregious and shameless attempt to smear and impugn the       integrity of longstanding and trusted nonprofits and civil       rights organizations. Congress should applaud and elevate the       benefits of housing counseling, and the good work of       frontline organizations, like the National Urban League, in       righting the injustices of the past and present.        Therefore, I respectfully urge you to oppose H.R. 732 and       any efforts to include similar provisions in legislation       moving through Congress.            Sincerely,                                                    Marc H. Morial,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                   Public Citizen,                                   Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.      Re Oppose the assault on civil justice.       House of Representatives,      Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Members of the U.S. House Judiciary       Committee: On behalf of Public Citizen, a non-profit       membership organization with more than 400,000 members and       supporters nationwide, we express extreme opposition to a       slate of three harmful bills scheduled to be marked-up in       Committee tomorrow: the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2017       (H.R. 720), the Innocent Party Protection Party Act of 2017       (H.R. 725), and the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017       (H.R. 732). Seen separately, these bills attempt to make       technical changes to the way that courts operate; taken       together they are a concerted effort chip away at Americans'       ability to seek justice and, therefore, must be opposed.                Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2017 (H.R. 720)         The proposed Rule 11 changes in H.R. 720 will make federal       litigation more complicated, costly, and inaccessible to       consumers and employees. We urge you to reject this       legislation.        Currently, judges have discretion to impose sanctions on a       lawyer or a party in litigation to deter sanctionable conduct       in pleadings, motions, and other court papers. The so-called       Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, or LARA, would revise Rule 11 of       the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require sanctions,       rather than leaving the decision whether to impose sanctions       to the discretion of federal judges. This proposal would make       litigation longer and more expensive.        The problems with this bill are not theoretical, but       proven. In 1983, changes to Federal Rule 11 removed judicial       discretion for issuing sanctions. Those changes were       overturned a decade later, because the 1983 Rule caused a       marked increase in business-to-business litigation and       abusive Rule 11 motion practice by lawyers arguing more about       sanctions than about the merits of the cases. Because 1983       changes proved to discourage lawyers from cooperating with       each other, the changes prolonged litigation, rather than       advancing the goal of coming to a just conclusion. We must       not repeat this failed experiment.        Additionally, LARA would obstruct Americans' access to       justice, especially in cases such as those alleging civil       rights violations, as those types of cases can be based on       novel legal theories. In those cases, LARA would chill the       filing of meritorious suits, and justice for some will go       unserved.  [[Page H8117]]                 Innocent Party Protection Party Act of 2017 (H.R. 725)         H.R. 725, the Innocent Party Protection Act (called the       Fraudulent Joinder Protection Act in previous Congresses) is       a supposed fix for an imagined problem. It addresses a       federal district court's consideration of a plaintiff's       motion to remand a case to state court, after a defendant has       removed the case from the state court in which it was filed       to federal district court on the theory that the plaintiff       had fraudulently joined a non-diverse defendant for the       purpose of defeating federal-court jurisdiction. The purpose       of the bill is to assist defendants in keeping cases in       federal court after removal. The bill purports to achieve       this purpose by specifying that the federal court consider       evidence, such as affidavits, and by specifying four findings       that would require a federal district court to deny a       plaintiff's motion to remand.        Congress should not get into the business of micro-managing       the motion practice of the federal courts without strong       evidence that current court procedures are not serving their       purpose: facilitating justice. In this instance, there is no       evidence to support the assumption that the district courts       are not denying motions to remand in appropriate cases.       Congress has no basis to revise the courts' procedures when       the current standards are not producing unjust results. The       Committee should hesitate before taking the step into       micromanagement of the federal courts' consideration of one       specific type of motion, where that motion has existed for       more than a century and there are only the flimsiest of       arguments in favor of changing it.              Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732)         This legislation is intended to cut off proceeds from       government settlements to ``third-party'' entities, which       would stop a critical source of funding for the nonprofit       sector--including public interest community organizations,       foundations or trusts and other similar groups.        The bill would bar government settlements from directing       payment to non-profit organizations, thereby hamstringing the       parties' ability to fully remedy the wrongdoing underlying       the lawsuit. Oftentimes, allowing these monies to be       available to third-parties is the best way to assure harmed       persons will be made whole.        Not only are these three bills unnecessary intrusions into       the province of the federal courts, they are part of a larger       push to limit Americans' ability to seek justice in a court       of law. Their innocent-sounding names aside, these bills pose       a grave threat to our court system--the nation's stronghold       for protecting our democracy. In the current political       climate, where the justice system is the last line of defense       for our nation's values, we urge you not to cede that ground.            Sincerely,      Lisa Gilbert,        Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.      Susan Harley,        Deputy Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I think, when we come to the floor, we  are obligated to as much educate our colleagues who may be back in  their offices or in meetings as it is to educate the general public.                                time  1630    The name of this bill is distorted and incorrect. I think it is  important to note what happens when the Department of Justice engages  in lawsuits on behalf of the American people, and they are the American  people's lawyer, or they are sued.   In many instances, there is something called a consent decree and a  settlement that generates funds that can be utilized for the betterment  of the American people.   So why don't you view this side of the aisle with the betterment of  the American people because we are questioning legislation that would  eliminate the opportunity for those who are doing good work to be  funded by career professionals in the Justice Department.   So the basis of this bill is to throw this money over into the  Congress, of which I have great respect in terms of its Article I  powers, requiring a congressional appropriation for each beneficiary  fund established as relief in a lawfully negotiated settlement to  victims, such as in the case of predatory lending, employment  discrimination, pollution, environmental hazards, and would greatly  strain Congress' already limited legislative resources and scarce time.   They want us to now, line by line, disseminate these funds that can  be done by career professionals dealing with improving on the issue  upon which the government was sued. It opens the doors to industry  influence and obstruction.   I don't believe we have earmarks anymore. I happen to be a supporter  of getting moneys to the community. We don't have an appropriations  bill now, we don't have a budget now. So it is almost November, and the  Congress has not yet appropriated funds to run the government nor have  they passed a budget. That would be the maze of which you would throw a  very proficient process of allowing these funds to be distributed.   The Jackson Lee amendment would exempt from this confused bill  settlement agreements that would provide restitution to States that are  not parties to the litigation. That means, for example, after Hurricane  Harvey, there was an explosion at the Arkema chemical plant. Nine  trailers exploded and several first responders went to the hospital. I  would want to seek funds to be able to help them.   We also understand that there are many organizations representing the  people. Public Citizen, a nonprofit membership organization, they are  against it. The Urban League is against it. The counties have issued a  resolution, local counties. They are against it.   I think there is no clearer evidence to vote this particular bill  down, but to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is my very point. My very point  is a transparent and clear system of distribution of funds, and the  career professionals determining what entities need those funds is a  clearer system than what would occur if moneys were dumped onto  Congress outside of the normal budgetary and appropriations process, of  which we are having a very difficult time as we speak.   The process that we have now, my amendment says that these settlement  agreements that provide restitution to States that are not parties to  the litigation, they shouldn't be covered by the elimination of the  right for the career professionals to distribute these funds.   It also acknowledges the respect for the Congress and the work that  it has to do, but it also acknowledges counties like Jefferson County,  Texas, the resolution to the National Association of Counties. They are  against this bill because it would disallow funds derived from court  settlements for injuries to the environment from being distributed to  States, counties, and parishes, borrowers in proximity to the pollution  event. These are real people representing real people right on the  ground asking for us to not pass this legislation.   I would say to my good friend, why don't we use our Article I powers  to begin investigations on the separation of powers relevant to the  administration and its actions. Why don't we begin looking at whether  there are high crimes and misdemeanors.   I mean, there are many things that our Article I powers can do, but,  in this instance, I think that this has not proven to be a failure, and  the only failure in it is the obsession that my friends have with the  past administration.   I want to have something that has worked for the county governments,  people who live in counties and cities and States. If they were harmed  during Hurricane Harvey, for example, by an explosion and 23 first  responders went to the hospital and many houses were evacuated, I  believe it would be appropriate to leave the system in which those  dollars can go directly to those counties and cities and States and to  improve the quality of life.   Mr. Chair, I ask my friends to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, the proposed legislation, as currently drafted, could be  construed to preclude all third-party payments in settlement  agreements, other than restitution to identifiable victims.   Requiring a congressional appropriation for each beneficiary fund  established as relief in a lawfully negotiated settlement to victims,  such as in cases of predatory lending, employment discrimination and  pollution through environmental hazardous, would greatly strain  Congress' already limited legislative resources and scarce time, while  opening the doors to industry influence and obstruction in routine  enforcement matters.   Congress lacks the time, expertise, and resources to properly review  and make enforcement decisions on behalf of Federal agencies.   The cost of delays associated with this scheme would have devastating  consequences for the public health, environment, and local communities.   Accordingly, the Jackson Lee Amendment would excecpt cases where  funds are directed to states to remediate the generalized harm of  unlawful conduct beyond harms to identifiable victims.   Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment would exempt from H.R. 732  settlement agreements that provide restitution to states that are not  parties to litigation.   As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S. Department of  Justice pursued lawsuits against mortgage lenders and banks that  engaged in discriminatory lending practices, such as those targeted by  this legislation.   Research shows that African Americans and Latinos were discriminated  against and steered into subprime loans even when they qualified for  conventional loans.   Moreover, African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more  likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which resulted  in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional loans.   Pursuant to the settlement agreements, available under current law,  the Justice Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a  portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) certified housing counseling intermediaries to  provide consumer relief in the communities that were hit hardest.   HUD has approved 37 housing counseling intermediaries that financial  institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party providers of  consumer relief under the terms of the Justice Department settlement  agreements.   Additionally, these HUD-certified housing counseling providers  deliver financial education and coaching to individuals to inform them  of their home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and  remain homeowners.   In fact, since 2008, 40 affiliates have provided housing counseling  services--to date serving more than 200,000 clients in mostly  underserved areas.   The success of housing counseling programs is undisputed.   Borrowers who have used housing counseling are one-third less likely  to be seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who are in  default are 60 percent more likely to save their homes.   The benefits of these programs are tangible and must continue to be  made available to the public.   This example is particularly pertinent as Houston recovers from  hurricane Harvey, a tragedy that displaced tens of thousands of my  constituents.   There are still over 61 thousand people living in hotels throughout  Texas.   Under current law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may  include Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in settlement  agreements to offset the harms of unlawful conduct by requiring parties  to undertake an environmentally beneficial project or activity that  ``is not required by law,'' but that a defendant agrees to undertake as  part of the settlement of an enforcement action.   In 2012, the EPA and Justice Department resolved the civil liability  of MOEX Offshore through a settlement agreement resulting from the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that included funds to several Gulf  states, including Texas, where Texas was not a party to the complaint,  but received $3.25 million for SEPs and other responsive actions.   H.R. 732, would prohibit these agreements and many of the important  benefits now provided by EPA.   The bill's definition excludes, ``any payment by a party to provide  restitution for or otherwise remedy the actual harm (including to the  environment), directly and proximately caused by the alleged conduct of  the party that is the basis for the settlement agreement.''   This exception is too narrowly drawn to allow for numerous beneficial  uses of settlement monies.   Thus, for example, the bill would appear to ban the following  entirely legitimate, appropriate uses of settlement funds that are  currently permitted by EPA:   (1) Pollution prevention projects that improve plant procedures and  technologies, and/or operation and maintenance practices, that will  prevent additional pollution at its source;   (2) Environmental restoration projects including activities that  protect local ecosystems from actual or potential harm resulting from  the violation;   (3) Facility assessments and audits, including investigations of  local environmental quality, environmental compliance audits, and  investigations into opportunities to reduce the use, production, and  generation of toxic materials;   (4) Programs that promote environmental compliance by promoting  training or technical support to other members of the regulated  community; and   (5) Projects that provide technical assistance or equipment to a  responsible state or local emergency response entity for purposes of  emergency planning or preparedness.   Each of these programs provide important protections of human health  and the environment in communities that have been harmed by  environmental violations.   However, because they are unlikely to be construed as redressing  ``actual (environmental) harm, directly and proximately caused'' by the  alleged violator, the bill before this committee would prohibit every  one of them.   On August 31, 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, dangerous  chemicals at the Arkema chemical facility in Crosby, Texas, exploded  and burned.   Nine trailers at the plant contained organic peroxides that first  exploded and burned, sending 23 first responders to the hospital. In  addition, despite a 1\1/2\ mile radius evacuation from the chemical  releases, dozens of residents were effected for days by the noxious  fumes, including headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and burning eyes.   This recent incident is a prime example of how restitution to a  community under an enforcement settlement should work. EPA should (not  sure if they are) engage in enforcement activities against Arkema,  including civil fines and restitution to the community. There were  [[Page H8123]]  clear health impacts on many in the community and a settlement could,  as an example, fund health care assistance short term, or even long  term monitoring of lung health. However, if H.R. 732 were law, only  first responders would likely have the ability to seek restitution.  This is not okay. It utterly fails to help make a community whole after  such a terrible event.   Background facts:   23 first responders were sent to the hospital due to exposure to  chemical fumes.   Residents within a 1\1/2\ mile radius were asked to evacuate, though  in this low-income neighborhood in the aftermath of the storm, many  were unable to.   Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), and original cosponsor of H.R. 732 and  representative of the district that plant and affected community are  located in, at the time told ABC News as events were unfolding that the  situation was ``very dangerous . . . (and) . . . the worst-case  scenario is that this chemical plant could explode.''   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the  Jackson Lee Amendment.         Proposed Resolution on the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act         A resolution from Jefferson County, Texas to the National       Association of Counties seeking to maintain the status quo       for states, counties, parishes and boroughs being able to       receive damages payments for environmental crimes in       proximity to them (e.g., Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon).        Issue: H.R. 732, a bill that may restrict or disallow       Department of Justice Supplemental Environmental Plans from       benefiting states, counties, parishes and boroughs in       proximity to pollution events that result in court       settlements for environmental damages.        Proposed Policy: The National Association of Counties       (NACo) opposes any provisions within the final version of       H.R. 732 that would disallow funds derived from court       settlements for injuries to the environment from being       distributed to states, counties, parishes and boroughs in       proximity to the pollution event.        Background: On Jan 30, 2017, Representative Goodlatte,       along with 34 other cosponsors, introduced the Stop       Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732) which could ban       or restrict the current practice involving Supplemental       Environmental Projects' distribution of court settlement       proceeds to states, counties, parishes and boroughs.        H.R. 732 has been referred to the U.S. House of       Representatives Judiciary Committee and assigned to the       Regulatory Reform, Commercial & Antitrust Law Subcommittee.        Members of the Committee are unclear about H.R. 732's       provisions relating to payments to remediate direct harm,       including environmental harm, done by defendant's wrongful       activity.        This is particularly important in the environmental       context, in which the injury to the environment may be       diffuse and there may be no identifiable victims.        Currently, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Congress       may both have roles in determining eligibility for states,       counties, parishes and boroughs in proximity to a pollution       event for receiving funds from a settlement agreement.        H.R. 732 is unclear on this issue, prompting dissenting       opinions about whether the bill prevents states, counties,       parishes and boroughs in proximity to pollution events (e.g.,       the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills) from       receiving funds derived from court settlements.        NACo should oppose any provision in H.R. 732 that modifies       or restricts current practice in distributing proceeds from       court settlement agreements for environmental damage events.        Fiscal/Urban/Rural Impact: Congressional concurrence with       this NACo resolution upholds the status quo practice in court       settlement agreements for environmental events.        Sponsor: Jeff R. Branick, Judge, Jefferson County, Texas     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, citing from The New York Times,  ``Outside Rachel Roberts' house, a skeleton sits on a chair next to a  driveway, a skeleton child on its lap, an empty cup in its hand, and a  sign at its feet reads, `Waiting on FEMA.' ''   I want to acknowledge that FEMA workers from around the country have  worked without ceasing, but we have got to do a better job. My  constituents in Houston, Harris County, Texas, after Harvey, are  waiting on those inspectors.   That is the only way, Mr. Speaker, that they can begin the repair of  their homes. Many people are there without coverage and truly need to  have their homes repaired.   I have given suggestions. I am sorry that we didn't stand up enough  Federal FEMA inspectors. But what about college students, people who  are unemployed, using a FEMA app, dividing the area in sectors,  finishing one sector then going to another sector? This includes the  State of Florida as well. People are on hold for hours at a time.   I have spoken to those who are now looking at it. I want them to know  that I appreciate them taking my call and reviewing this, but reach out  for help. We have got to have more inspectors. If we do not have  inspectors, they will not be able to repair their homes. If they cannot  repair their homes, they are living in dangerous conditions. If they  are living in dangerous conditions, the quality of life deteriorates.   Help us in Texas. We need more FEMA inspectors. We need them now.                            ____________________
