 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Lee McMillan, of Ashe  County, who will be celebrating his 90th birthday this Saturday.   I have been blessed to know Lee for many years, and I know that he  has helped build the foundation that the North Carolina Republican  Party stands upon today.   His 23 years of service to the United States Navy, after his  graduation from the Naval Academy, and his tireless work in promoting  conservative values on the local and State level are nothing short of  admirable.   Lee is also the proud owner of Shatley Springs Inn and Restaurant  located in the high country, a local landmark that has received  national recognition since 1958.   To me, Lee is a perfect representation of the best that Ashe County  and western North Carolina have to offer.   Thank you, Lee, and happy birthday.                            ____________________
