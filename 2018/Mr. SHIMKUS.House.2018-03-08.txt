 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 762, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1119) to establish the bases by which the Administrator  of the Environmental Protection Agency shall issue, implement, and  enforce certain emission limitations and allocations for existing  electric utility steam generating units that convert coal refuse into  energy, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  [[Page H1481]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1119.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, coal-fired electric generation has been the subject of  many costly regulations, and we are already seeing an economic impact  on conventional coal facilities. But, today, we are focusing on a  relatively small number of very unconventional facilities that take  environmentally damaging waste coal, burn it to produce electricity,  and then use the resulting ash to remediate the land.   The more you learn about H.R. 1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and  Saving the Environment, the SENSE, Act, the more you will agree that  these facilities are worth saving, which is what this bill does. I  thank my colleague, Keith Rothfus from Pennsylvania, for sponsoring  this innovative measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania, and other States, have led to  a legacy of massive piles of waste coal that contributes to water and  air pollution in communities where they are located.                                time  0915    The cost of eliminating this waste coal has been estimated at $2  billion for Pennsylvania alone, so absent a massive new program, it  almost certainly won't get done.   Fortunately, coal refuse-to-energy plants have been developed and  built in several communities with waste coal. These plants burn waste  coal to produce electricity, and the resulting ash is then used to  remediate the land. Thus far, these plants have eliminated 214 million  tons of waste coal and restored thousands of acres and 1,200 miles of  rivers and streams.   The electricity and the jobs created by these plants are really just  a bonus compared to the tremendous environmental benefits; nonetheless,  coal refuse-to-energy plants are now under threat. Although these  plants utilize a specialized process, EPA has decided to treat them no  differently than conventional coal-fired power plants. As a result, the  Agency has jeopardized the continued operation of these facilities by  setting standards that are not appropriate for them.   The SENSE Act addresses the problem by providing an alternative  compliance mechanism for the compounds regulated under the Mercury and  Air Toxic Standards, which is commonly known as the MATS. The bill  still requires stringent emission reductions at these waste coal-to- energy plants, but ones that are achievable at these facilities.   I should note that earlier versions of the SENSE Act also included  changes to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR, but those  provisions have been taken out of the version we are voting on today.   The result of this bill would be that these coal refuse-to-energy  plants can continue operating, which would be a big win for the  environment as well as for jobs in the communities in Pennsylvania and  other States where they are located.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  before I yield to Mr. Rothfus just to get things straight here.   Let's see. We can remediate environmental hazards by private sector  dollars. I think that is good, saving the AML for other sites that  can't use private sector dollars. We have a revenue stream to pay for  that remediation. We have good-paying jobs and, as my colleague said,  union jobs.   I am from a coal-producing State everyone knows, deep southern  Illinois. We have a local tax base to protect. Again, it protects the  abandoned mine funds.   When I was a young boy, I had a motorbike, and one of the places to  ride which kind of scared me--I did it a couple of times--was on what  we would call a slag hill.   What is a slag hill?   A slag hill is an abandoned mine refuse pile.   So many of us have lived in and around these sites.   This opportunity to take this and turn it into this, without taxpayer  dollars, is a win. And the gentleman stole my line. The SENSE Act does  make sense for jobs, for a tax base, for remediation, both in land and  water, and protecting the abandoned mine funds to go to those sites  that don't have a reclamation facility that can produce power and put  it on the grid. So I am pleased to be down here and fighting with my  colleague, Congressman Rothfus.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The EPA quote that Congressman Rothfus mentioned about they should  deserve special consideration was not this EPA. In fact, it was  authored by, in 2011, an EPA under the Obama administration, and the  Administrator at that time was Lisa Jackson.   So we are not, in today's world, saying these plants should have  special considerations. We are in the last administration's world. And  we just believe that that is correct. We believe that we have got to  consider the benefits, and the benefits are remediation of these slag  mounds, restoration of land, sometimes for recreational activities,  protecting our water supply.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of the  language.    Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   This has been a great debate. We don't have debates on the floor too  much. I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. He is a good  friend. I think it was well conducted.   Just to close, these are specialized plants for twofold purposes. The  first purpose is to clean up coal refuge sites, which are all over,  again, and it keeps them from having the piles on the ground. And if  they catch on fire, there is no controlling technology for that.   It keeps them from leaching into our streams, as Congressman Rothfus  said numerous times, which is why EPA, again, has said these units  warrant special consideration. That is what this legislation does.   Again, not a Trump EPA, but an Obama EPA made that statement.                                time  1000    If that 200 acres is in your backyard, that is an important 200 acres  to clean up.   Mr. Rothfus brought this down.   If those 200 acres are here, you want this? This is a pretty good  deal--paid for not by the taxpayers, but paid for by this industry that  is using this technology to take the coal refuse and create  electricity.   As I said once before in this debate, if you have remediation of  environmental hazards, if you have a revenue stream to pay for it, if  you have good-paying jobs, you create a local tax base, and you protect  the Abandoned Mine Land fund, this SENSE Act makes sense.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is really a great debate, and I  appreciate my colleague coming down here to offer this.   I am not sure he was here for the whole debate, but these coal refuse  sites sometimes catch on fire. And you want to talk about pollution and  hazards? These power plants clean those up.   Some of these coal refuse sites leach into the groundwater, the  streams, the tributaries, so that the water is yellow. These power  plants clean them up.   The Obama administration, under Lisa Jackson, said that these units  ``warrant special consideration.''   Why?   Because they are remediating all of these environmental hazards. They  are not like a typical power plant. They are meeting environmental  standards, as the author has said.   This bill is supported by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Council, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine  Reclamation. Actually, the abandoned mine reclamation is not on the  taxpayers' dollar, it  [[Page H1488]]  is on the power plants' dollar. We are saving money in the Abandoned  Mine Land Fund. And the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned  Mine Reclamation. So, you see, the eastern and the western side of  Pennsylvania.    It is like the Phillies and the Steelers. Right? There is always  going to be a divide there in Pennsylvania.   Cambria County Conservation District, the Blacklick Creek Watershed  Association. Here is a watershed association supporting this piece of  legislation. The Anthracite Region Independent Power Producers  Association.   As I have said a couple of times during this debate, this is what  this is about: You remediate environmental hazards, and you take land  like this and turn it into land like this at no government cost.   That is why this is the step forward. This is the reasonable  approach. The revenue stream is paid for by corporate America. You have  got good-paying jobs. You have got a local tax base.   Some of these power plants, if this power plant leaves a county, that  is their major employer. That is their major tax base. What are they  going to do? Raise local taxes to meet their schools', counties', and  municipal's obligations?   The SENSE Act makes sense. This motion to recommit is trying to  obviously defeat this bill. This is a sensible bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against the motion to  recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.
