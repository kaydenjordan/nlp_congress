 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the  amendment, which is the product of hard work from my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.   The administration does not have authorization to take military  action in or against Iran and must come to Congress for that authority,  and this amendment makes that crystal clear.   Many members of the administration have been trying to make a case  for a war with Iran for months, if not years, going so far as to try to  speciously tie Iran to al-Qaida and claim the 2001 AUMF passed in the  aftermath of the attack on 9/11 might authorize war against Iran.   Congress must reassert our constitutional authority.   There is no question that Iran is a bad actor and they have been for  a long time, but if the administration believes that armed conflict is  the way to keep us safe, then the administration must make the case to  Congress and the American people, because it will be their sons and  daughters who will be on the front lines of that brutal war.   We cannot be a Congress or a nation that accepts going to war on a  whim as the status quo. I firmly believe it is time for Congress to  repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF, but until we can do that, we must  pass this amendment now.
