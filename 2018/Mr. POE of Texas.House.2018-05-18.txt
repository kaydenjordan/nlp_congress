 Mr. Speaker, on May 16, 2017, as Turkish President  Erdogan visited the Nation's Capital, his gestapo security forces  unleashed a brutal assault on peaceful American demonstrators. Many of  them were Armenian Americans who were exercising their constitutional  right of free speech.   As Erdogan looked on, his thugs demonstrated their intolerance for  free expression and contempt for America. This illegal behavior is  absolutely intolerable by any security force, especially on U.S. soil  against Americans.   Fifteen members of the Turkish security detail were originally  charged for this unprovoked attack, but now there are only four. Why?  It is clear from video recordings and witness accounts that more than  four Turks participated on this assault on free speech.   I contacted the Justice Department and asked why charges were dropped  against 11 guards, but they refused to give an explanation. The DOJ  should not be complicit in Erdogan's assault on democracy. The DOJ must  enforce American law. It must not make backroom deals with want-to-be  dictators.    And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
