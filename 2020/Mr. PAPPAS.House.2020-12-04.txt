 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our country is in  trouble. We are facing a devastating pandemic, an economic crisis, and  things will continue to get worse if Congress fails to act.   I can't imagine there is a Member of this body who has not had the  same conversations I have had with small business owners, healthcare  professionals, local leaders, educators, and workers out of a job.   People are exasperated. They are hurting and they are tired. They  feel like Washington isn't coming through for them, and they are right.   We have a job to do, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as  Representatives who are here to serve the people in our districts and  secure the future of this Nation.   This week, Members of the House and Senate announced a framework for  COVID relief legislation. It is not everything everyone wants, no  compromise is, but it will fundamentally save lives and keep our  economy moving forward.   Heading home for the holidays without addressing this crisis will  have disastrous consequences, so let's all commit ourselves to this  process of finding a way forward and getting to ``yes.''                            ____________________
