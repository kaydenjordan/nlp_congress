 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the vice chair, for  hosting this Special Order with me here tonight.   I appreciate you and others standing here to highlight House  Republicans' wins and to advocate for our conservative values.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the problems America is facing  and what Congress must do to get this country back on track.   Our grandchildren deserve to live in a country that still stands for  freedom, and I serve in Congress to work toward building that future.   Freedom tomorrow means upholding the constitutional rights of all  Americans today. That is the lens through which I view my job in  Congress and the measuring stick I use for every piece of legislation I  consider.   I have highlighted the path forward in my four-part commitment to the  big first and House Republicans' commitment to Americans.   Number one, Congress needs to create an economy that is strong.  According to the congressional budget report, America is $33.5 trillion  in debt, and the Federal Government is deficit spending more than $1  trillion every year.   Our energy independence has eroded, small businesses are laboring  under burdensome regulations and taxes, and rampant inflation is a tax  on everyone.   We need to end Washington's spending addiction by balancing the  budget, growing the economy, curbing inflation, and decreasing Federal  spending.   We need to cut red tape and burdensome regulations for agriculture  producers, businessowners, and for all Americans. We also need to  preserve the family-owned farms and small businesses throughout our  country.   Earlier this year, the house passed The Limit, Save, Grow Act to  reduce government spending, reclaim unspent COVID relief money, and  promote pro-growth economic policies.   The House and Senate passed my resolution to prohibit the listing of  the lesser prairie-chicken as endangered or threatened.   The House and Senate also passed a joint resolution to prohibit  President Biden's Waters of the U.S. rule from having the force of law.   A strong economy is good for everyone: the whole supply chain,  businesses, parents, students, everyone. Ensuring a strong economy  remains our commitment.   Number two, this Congress needs to create a Nation that is safe.  Violent crime is on the rise, drug addiction is spiking, and many parts  of our country are in chaos.   Meanwhile, we are still hearing calls from Washington Democrats to  defund the police, and the Biden administration is failing to address  our open southern border where fentanyl, criminals, and people caught  up in human trafficking rings flood into our country.   We need to defend America's national security and food security. We  need to support our troops and invest in an efficient, effective  military. We need to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, end  the fentanyl crisis, and support the police.                                time  1915    We also need to reauthorize strong agricultural trade legislation,  negotiate new international trade agreements, support global food  security legislation, promote U.S. goods, and stop wars before they  start.   This year, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act  and the Department of Defense appropriations act to support our troops.   House Republicans passed the Secure the Border Act to finish  construction of the wall at the southern border and the Schools Not  Shelters Act to prohibit the use of public schools for housing illegal  immigrants.   We passed the HALT Fentanyl Act and a resolution expressing support  for local law enforcement officers and condemning efforts to defund and  dismantle local law enforcement agencies.   We all want to live in a country where we can lay our heads on a  pillow at night knowing we live in the safest, best country in the  world.   Number three, Congress needs to create a future that is built on  freedom. As I meet with Kansans, I hear concerns about Big Government,  sweeping executive orders, and infringements on the basic rights  enshrined in our Constitution.   We must preserve America's constitutional freedoms that protect the  lives of unborn children and their mothers. We need to educate students  in American history and civic engagement. We also need to improve  access to rural healthcare, including access to telehealth services.   We must support those who fought to defend our freedoms by improving  accountability and transparency at the Department of Veterans Affairs  and working to reinvigorate civilian life after military service.   House Republicans passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act to penalize healthcare practitioners who fail to provide care for  an infant that is born alive from an attempted abortion.   I sponsored three pieces of legislation that would modify the Biden  administration's rulemaking to prohibit funds for abortions and  abortion referrals.   The House passed the Parents Bill of Rights Act to ensure that rights  of parents are honored and protected in America's public schools.   I sponsored the States Handling Access to Reciprocity for Employment  Act, or SHARE Act, which would improve the current licensing process  for healthcare providers and increase the number of licensed providers  able to serve communities across State lines.   We passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act and the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training  Act, which would codify the Boots to Business program, a training  course administered by the Small Business Administration through which  veterans and their families learn the fundamentals of business  management.   America is the strongest, most free nation in the world because our  Founders declared that our freedoms do not flow from the government or  a king but from God, who created us all with inalienable rights.   Number four, Congress needs to create a government that is  accountable. Congress has the responsibility to conduct both rigorous  oversight of the executive branch and investigation into possible  corruption and criminal activity within the Federal Government.   We need to rein in the White House's abuse of power, hold Washington  accountable, end the President's war on fossil fuels, and empower  domestic producers to restore American energy independence.   The House passed the Reduce Exacerbated Inflation Negatively  Impacting the Nation Act, or the REIN IN Act, which would require the  President to provide an inflation impact estimate with respect to  executive orders.   I also sponsored the More Accountability is Necessary Now Act, or the  MANN Act, six pieces of legislation that I do every Congress which  would require the President to report to Congress on executive orders.   The House passed the Lower Energy Costs Act, which would increase the  production and export of American energy and reduce the regulatory  burdens that make it harder to build American infrastructure and grow  our economy.   Through the legislation we all support, I have worked to unleash  American energy, cut taxes and red tape, secure the border, and  investigate the scandal and corruption surrounding President Biden and  Hunter Biden.   I will always stand for freedom in the face of government overreach  because whether you are a parent, a child, born or unborn, a student, a  farmer, or a  [[Page H6200]]  small business owner, you don't need the Federal Government trying to  control your life.   Serving as the Representative for the Big First District in Kansas  continues to be the honor of a lifetime. There is a lot of work left to  do, but with prayer and hard work, I really believe that the greatest  days in this Nation are yet to come.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), who represents the 36th District of Texas. Congressman Babin  serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee with  me. I am grateful for his presence here tonight and for his friendship.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his very  true remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members for participating  tonight.   When government grows, freedom shrinks. As conservatives in Congress,  we must not compromise on freedom. Our sworn duty is to uphold the  constitutional rights of all Americans, and I encourage all of my  colleagues to remember the solemn oath that we all took to do so and  support legislation that will aid us in that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), from the  First Congressional District and the cohost of this Special Order, for  his closing remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
