 Mr. Speaker, over half the States in America have had a  large spike in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Sadly, my own State of  Texas has had one of the highest increases in the past week.   There are lots of factors why. Most blame is laid upon youngsters age  18 to 30 because they know they have a small chance of dying, so they  don't really care about social distancing.   I spent about an hour last Thursday with three amazing Pearland High  School students, twins Isaiah and Stephan Torres and Jasmine Saenz.  These kids care with spider webs and bracelets of submission.   On their own, they set up a nonprofit called Drive By Heroes. They  dress up as Spider Man and Wonder Woman, and they have kids out of  school prod their parents to drop by to see their superheroes.   The price? Food supplies for victims of COVID-19. In less than 2  weeks, these three youngsters raised 1 ton of food for the Pearland  Neighborhood Center.   So, people of Pearland, southeast Texas, if you want to meet a real  superhero, go to Facebook and find out where they are, or invite them  to come to your home. Enjoy the pride of Texans being Texans.  [[Page H3100]]                                ____________________
