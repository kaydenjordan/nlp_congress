 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Cole, for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.   Unfortunately, we have seen, since the day that President Trump was  inaugurated, some people who made it public that they wanted to impeach  him--not because there are high crimes and misdemeanors, which is the  constitutional standard, but just because they don't agree with the  results of the 2016 election.   That, Madam Speaker, is not why you impeach a president. There is  precedent.   This has only happened three times in the history of our country.  Every time, it not only started with a full vote of the House, but it  also started with actual fairness. We are not getting that fairness  today.   When you look through this resolution, in multiple places, it gives  veto authority by the chair to literally reject any witness who is  brought forward by the minority. So no rights for the minority unless  the chair so designates.   In fact, in this resolution, it allows the chair to veto even the  ability for the President to have legal counsel in the room. If the  chair chooses, at his whim, they can literally kick out the President's  legal counsel.   This is unprecedented. It is not only unprecedented, this is Soviet- style rules.   Maybe in the Soviet Union you do things like this: where only you  make the rules, where you reject the ability for the person you are  accusing to even be in the room to question what is going on, for  anybody else to call witnesses, when only one person has the right to  call witnesses.   And as we saw just the other day, the chairman was literally  directing the witness to not answer certain questions by the  Republicans. What kind of fairness is that?   Maybe you think it is fairness if you can run roughshod over somebody  because you have got the votes, but that is not how impeachment was  supposed to go. In fact, Alexander Hamilton himself, during the debate  on the Constitution, in the Federalist Papers, warned of days like  this, that the greatest danger is that the decision on impeachment  ``will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by  the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.'' Alexander Hamilton  warned about days like today.   This is not what we should be doing, clearly, when you ask the  American people, who know that they are paying higher drug prices and  they see that there is legislation, bipartisan legislation, to lower  drug prices that won't come to this floor because of the infatuation  with impeachment.   We don't even have a bill to formally pay our troops and make sure  they have the tools they need to defend this country because there is  such an infatuation with impeachment.                                time  1030    Madam Speaker, when you look through this resolution, you see how  one-sided, how Soviet-style this is running. This is the United States  of America. Don't run a sham process, a tainted process like this  resolution ensures.   It ought to be rejected, and I think you will see bipartisan  rejection of this resolution.
