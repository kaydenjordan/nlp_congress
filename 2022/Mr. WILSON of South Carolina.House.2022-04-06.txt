 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to report  that the total export sales from the State of South Carolina topped  nearly $30 billion last year.   Increasing their influence, State exporters reached over 195  countries, with Germany and Canada tops. Korean investments are  monumental by Samsung, and I praise today the Korean delegation of Dr.  Jin Park and Tae-yong Cho.   Most notably, the Palmetto State leads the Nation in export sales of  tires produced by Michelin, Bridgestone, Giti Tire, Continental, and  Trelleborg Wheel Systems.   South Carolina also leads in passenger motor vehicle exports,  including BMW, Volvo Cars, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz Vans.   In order to further support this vital market, South Carolina ports  have invested over $2 billion in infrastructure, according to South  Carolina Port Authority President Jim Newsome, soon to be succeeded by  COO Barbara Melvin, backed up by Governor Henry McMaster.   In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. God bless  Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he fights to maintain his freedom for all the  people of the world.                            ____________________
