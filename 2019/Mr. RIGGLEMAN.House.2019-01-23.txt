 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commend the work of our  hardworking FEMA employees and the fantastic job they do with disaster  relief.   In October, my district, and many on the East Coast, were hit by  Hurricane Florence and Tropical Storm Michael. I visited the town of  Drakes Branch in Charlotte County to offer support after those storms.  The damage was devastating, and there was work to be done all over the  East Coast.   In my district alone, FEMA applications were filed in Charlotte  County, Danville city, Franklin County, Halifax County, Lunenburg  County, Mecklenburg County, Prince Edward County, and many others.   I commend the hard work done by FEMA in helping these areas recover,  because we are recovering and are continuing to work to rebuild these  areas.   I also commend the brave fire and rescue workers in all these areas,  especially Meherrin Volunteer Fire and Rescue and the Drakes Branch  VFD.   This is not an easy task, but for our work so far, we have been a  success, and I thank the brave men and women of FEMA for their efforts.                            ____________________
