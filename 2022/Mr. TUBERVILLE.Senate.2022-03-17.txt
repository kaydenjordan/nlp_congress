 Madam President, today I want to talk about the real  March madness that we are having this month, moments about basketball  and the tournament, but I want to talk about the madness of attacking  title IX, attacking women's sports, and attacking women in general.   Last night marked the beginning of the 2022 NCAA Women's Swimming and  Diving Championship. Instead of celebrating the many hard-working women  who earned their spot in the championship, I expect much of the media  attention to be around a singular competitor--a transgender athlete who  competed as a male as recently as 2019.   But the discussion should not be about inclusivity; it should be  about fairness. I have spoken about this issue before and, last March,  actually forced a vote on the amendment that would have prevented  Federal funds from going to educational institutions that allowed  biological males to compete in women's athletics.   Unfortunately, colleagues on the left were more interested in  pandering to the far left than they were in protecting the ability for  girls and women to participate in fair--and I repeat, fair-- competition. They refused to support my amendment.   And I would argue that by allowing biological males to complete in  women's athletics, Democrats have set serious efforts for women's  equality back by decades. And, ultimately, this will have the effect of  discouraging many, many, many young women from participating in sports.   In a recent article, two parents of a current collegiate athlete  said:         I think the NCAA needs to change its policies, and find a       way to include transgender women without trampling all over       biological women.    I agree.   Well, the NCAA has been silent. They have failed to take decisive  action in ensuring a level playing field for all of women.   And so now Congress must act to do so. This is why I joined Senator  Mike Lee and 16 fellow colleagues in introducing the Protection of  Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2021. This is critical legislation  that would make it a violation--a violation--of title IX for a  recipient of related Federal funds to permit a biological male from  participating in an athletic program or activity designated for women  and girls.   The bill would also establish the definition of ``sex'' in title IX  as based ``solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at  birth.''   It is imperative for Congress to act so that an entire generation of  women aren't discouraged from pursuing their athletic dreams, whether  on the field, whether on the court, or whether in the swimming pool.   As some of the most talented female swimmers in the country prepare  to compete over the next few days, it would be wrong not to call out  the inherent unfairness in allowing a biological male to participate in  several women's events.    Penn's transgender athlete will compete in the women's 100-, 200-,  and 500-yard freestyle events. Just a few short years ago, this athlete  was competing in men's collegiate swimming events.   Since being allowed to switch, this swimmer has shattered--and I mean  completely shattered--records in women's events.   In December, at the Zippy Invitational, this athlete set new national  and school records in the 1,650-, the  [[Page S1234]]  500-, and the 200-yard freestyle events and continues to dominate the  competition.   At the invitational, this swimmer won the 1,650-yard freestyle with a  new record time of 15:59.71. The second-place swimmer finished 38  seconds later.   At the Ivy League Championships last month, this swimmer broke the  200-yard freestyle record of 1 minute and 43 seconds, beating out the  last record by over a half a second, and the pool record was beat by 2  seconds.   Having been a coach for 40 years, I can attest more so than anyone in  Congress that there are fundamental differences between men and women  when it comes to sports. But you don't have to take my word for it. A  recent study concludes that ``on average, males have (1) 40-50 percent  greater upper limb strength, (2) 20-40 percent greater lower limb  strength, and (3) an average of 12 pounds more skeletal muscle mass  than age-matched females at any given body weight.''   Lungs are bigger; heart is bigger. Competing in swimming, in the  women's swimming division, has given this Penn athlete an unfair  advantage that no one else in the field can overcome.   Some have been too afraid to speak up, fearing they will be  sacrificed at the altar of political correctness, or that they will be  canceled if they say it is unfair for a biological male to compete  against a biological female, or that they will be shunned if they don't  embrace inclusivity over fairness.   But some have already bravely voiced their opinion.   The advocacy organizations Champion Women and Women's Sports Policy  Working Group released dual petitions on Tuesday with over 5,000  signatures, asking for policymakers to prioritize ``fairness and safety  for females'' instead of ``blanket transgender inclusion or exclusion''  in women's sports.   The petitions were organized by three-time Olympic gold medalist, and  the founder of Champion Women, Nancy Hogshead. According to Champion  Women, the petitions were signed by nearly 300 Olympians, Paralympians,  and U.S. national team members, as well as over 2,500 athletes who have  competed at the high school, club, or collegiate levels.   This is why Congress must act to pass the Protection of Women and  Girls in Sports Act of 2021.   Allowing biological males to compete in women's athletics threatens-- threatens--to undo all progress that has been made under title IX.   Title IX has provided women and girls the long-denied platform that  had always been afforded just to men and boys. It ensures female  athletes had the same access to funding, facilities, and athletic  scholarships. Before title IX, female athletes received less than 2  percent of the college athletic budget--only 2 percent--and athletic  scholarships for women were virtually nonexistent.   And since the 1970s, when I first started coaching, female  participation at the college level has risen by more than 600 percent.   So this week, the NCAA championship will once again emphasize that  the debate is not limited just to the Halls of Congress, but one that  we are seeing play out across the country.   It is an undeniable fact that biological males have a physiological  advantage over females--a fact. So let me be clear: The question here  is not should we be inclusive and supportive of all athletes; it is  how.   The first step the Senate can take to address the wrong that the NCAA  has allowed to happen is to pass S. 251.   There is an attack on women's sports. In the long run, there is an  attack on women in this country. It has to stop, and it has to stop  now.   So I ask my colleagues to stand up for America's female athletes and  women all throughout this country and support these efforts to preserve  women's sports.   I yield the floor.
