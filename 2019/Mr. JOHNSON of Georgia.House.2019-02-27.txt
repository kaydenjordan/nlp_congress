 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R.  8. I commend the efforts of Congressman   Mike Thompson from California  for introducing this commonsense legislation.   What it simply does is require that all sales of firearms go through  a licensed firearms dealer who has to run a background check. Current  law mandates that all licensed gun dealers, before transferring a  weapon, have to perform a background check.   The problem we have in this country is the law allows unlicensed  firearms dealers competing with licensed firearms dealers to sell just  as many firearms as a licensed gun dealer, but without doing the  background check. That enables criminals and people who should not have  weapons to have firearms, and that contributes to the proliferation of  weaponry on our streets in the hands of those who should not have them.   It produces violence, and we are looking to stop the violence with  this legislation, and so I ask my colleagues to support it.
