 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), my good friend, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.   We, Madam Speaker, are here today on three very different pieces of  legislation, which, unfortunately, makes this a complicated rule. One  of our bills concerns civil rights, one concerns healthcare, and one  concerns Native Americans. I will move through each of these bills  relatively quickly, and then I want to address the process we followed  to get here today.   The first bill, Madam Speaker, H.R. 5, is a complicated and complex  piece of legislation that would make sweeping changes to our Nation's  civil rights laws, if enacted. In general, the bill adds the terms  ``sexual orientation'' and ``gender identity'' to the list of protected  classes under the Civil Rights Act, joining classes like race, gender,  religion, and national origin.   As I noted in our hearing yesterday, most Republicans in the House  will oppose this bill not because we do not believe that all people  should receive equal treatment under the law but because we have real  concerns about how this bill will work in practice. A term like  ``gender identity'' has such a vague definition that even proponents of  the bill do not agree on exactly what the term means.   That should cause legislators to be especially thoughtful and provide  clarity about what the term means and how the law will be applied. But  we have not done so here.   Republicans have raised numerous questions about how this bill will  work in practice. Will female athletes in junior high, high school, and  college be forced to compete in women's athletics against competitors  who were born biologically male? Will female sexual assault victims be  forced to share vulnerable same-sex spaces like locker rooms and  dressing rooms with other individuals who were born biologically male?  And since the legislation appears to allow people to define their own  gender identity, will it allow people to shift back and forth between  gender as it suits them?   These are not rhetorical questions. They are real concerns that we  have raised, with good reason, throughout the process.   H.R. 5 is known as the Equality Act, and I know every Member of the  House, Republican and Democrat, agrees with the principle that all  people should be treated equally under the law. But even as we strive  toward that goal, when we are dealing with legislation of this  magnitude, we must consider how the bill will work in practice.   Unfortunately, I don't think my friends in the majority have clear  answers to very legitimate questions. Last night, during debate at the  Rules Committee, our concerns were dismissed as we were told that the  courts and administrative bureaucrats would sort out these unanswered  issues. That is simply unacceptable.   Why would we want any ambiguity when it comes to a person's civil  rights? We should be very clear about congressional intent, and the  only way to do that is to write a law the way you intend for it to be  carried out. Sadly, this bill falls well short of that certainty.   The second bill, H.R. 987, is actually seven bills: three genuinely  bipartisan bills addressing prescription drug costs and four partisan  and controversial bills addressing ObamaCare.   As I pointed out last night in our hearing, I don't particularly  understand what the majority is trying to accomplish here. There are  three bills that are all bipartisan that could easily progress to  becoming law. I am even a cosponsor of one of those bills. Yet, I have  to vote against the entire package because I do not support the  partisan and controversial bills attached by Democrats.   Madam Speaker, at some point, the majority needs to decide if they  are here to score political points or if they are here to govern. If  they want to continue scoring rhetorical victories, then by all means,  they should keep doing what they are doing, keep putting up partisan  bills that won't go anywhere in the Senate and won't be signed into  law, keep putting up messaging bills for the purpose of signaling to  their primary voters, and keep spending their days engaged in show  votes that won't ever improve the lives of those they were elected to  represent.   If they want to govern for the American people, then the majority  must move forward with real legislation that can get real support here,  in the Senate, and at the White House.   We had the chance to do that with this package. The majority chose  not to do so. I think that is a real missed opportunity for us, both as  an institution and as a country.   Finally, the third bill, H.R. 312, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe  Reservation Reaffirmation Act, is a matter I want to discuss at some  length because I think there has been, frankly, a lot of misinformation  put out about this particular piece of legislation.   The Mashpee Wampanoag is a federally recognized Tribe based in  Mashpee,  Madam Speaker, I yield myself a few seconds to respond to  my friend from Pennsylvania.   We don't consider the markup in committee a very good markup. Only  four amendments were considered, none were accepted, and, frankly, a  number of Members seeking recognition for amendments were not  recognized. So to think that this was anything other a train moving  through a station, I think, is to mischaracterize how that particular  markup worked.   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my very good friend, fellow member of the Rules  Committee, and also a leading member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for just a few minutes to respond to my good friend, the chairman. I  want to tell you, there is nobody I hold in higher regard in the House  of Representatives than Chairman McGovern, nobody I consider a better  personal friend, nobody I consider a more responsible Member.   On this, we disagree. The gentleman is right, neither side is  perfect. In this case, we are going to bring attention to this  amendment issue until we see results. That is precisely what my friend  did when he was in the minority, and there are some times we should  have listened to him and we did not.   In this case, I think the imbalance is so egregious that we are going  to continue to make that case until we see a change. Maybe we won't.  Hopefully we will, because I know my friend approaches this with good  intentions.   Secondly, I would say this bill was so important, the Equality Act,  it ought to have amendments. That is the point. That is how you build  consensus. I think they are missing the opportunity to get a lot of  people who would support the basic concept that they are trying to  advance.   And, finally, on the drug bill, I have just got to be honest with  you. When they had a chance to pass something that would work and chose  to bundle it with something that they knew couldn't pass, that makes me  wonder how serious they are about dealing with that problem.   But, hopefully, we will get an opportunity to deal with that again.  And that is an area we know we can work together on. We have proved it  in committee.   So, with that, I look forward to continuing to work with my good  friend, the chairman. I know that we will occasionally have  differences. That is what this is all about. We will work those  differences out.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), my very good friend, who also is a  distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Missouri.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to inform the House  that if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to immediately bring up H.R. 336, the Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act of 2019.   This bill includes four titles, three of which passed the House last  Congress, and one of which has already passed the House this Congress  on suspension.   My amendment will also include three additional provisions agreed to  by the Senate when they considered their version of this bill, so that  what we will debate will be identical to what the Senate passed with an  overwhelming majority vote in February.   The most critical title of H.R. 336, in my opinion, is the Combating  BDS Act of 2019, which will allow a State or local government to adopt  measures to divest assets from entities using boycotts, disbursements,  or sanctions to influence Israel's policy.   Madam Speaker, yesterday was the 71st anniversary of the founding of  the State of Israel. I can think of no better way to celebrate Israel's  independence, reaffirm our support for Israel, and indicate our ongoing  commitment to a peaceful and more secure Middle East than to consider  and pass H.R. 336 immediately.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to urge opposition to the rule. The  majority has proposed three different measures today, and while I am a  supporter of the bill concerning Tribal rights, I am opposed to H.R. 5  and H.R. 987, and I regret that.   Quite frankly, had the process on these bills been different, I think  the vote that we would see in this Chamber would be very different  today. I think, literally, a more fulsome and more open process and  amendments on H.R. 5 might have unlocked dozens of additional votes for  that legislation.   I think with H.R. 987 we don't have to speculate. We know three of  those bills passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee with  unanimous, bipartisan support, all of them dealing with drug prices.  That would have been an easy vote. We could have moved that through.   My friends could have still brought the other four matters that they  cared about under a rule, brought it to the floor. They have got the  votes to move it. It would have precisely the same prospects of success  it is going to have in the United States Senate.   The President has already made it clear, since he issued a statement,  that he is very likely to veto it if it were to make it to his desk. So  why in the world we threw away an opportunity to do some good for the  American people in an area where we agree, in order to advance  something that we know cannot become law, is mystifying to me, to say  the least.   Again, H.R. 5 is well-intentioned and designed to expand civil  rights, but it also adds a term with no clear definition to our civil  rights laws without regard for how it will work in practice.   H.R. 987 has four bills that are unacceptable, three bills that are  eminently acceptable. I do want to close though on a positive note.   Madam Speaker, I do applaud my friends for bringing the Native  American issue to fruition today. I am going to be opposing them on the  rule but supporting them on that legislation. I think it was a very  wise decision to put it under a rule, quite frankly, and I applaud my  good friend Chairman Grijalva for working with my good friend Chairman  McGovern and making sure that that happened. This important piece of  legislation, which, quite frankly, is important not just to the Tribe  in question, but establishes the principle that we won't let land going  into trust be taken out of trust, is very important.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished ranking  member, for yielding time.   I want to thank both my friends, the chairman and the ranking member,  for their help in bringing this legislation to the floor. It could not  have happened without both of their assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 375, legislation that  would amend the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and reaffirm the  authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for  Indian Tribes.   Between the passage of the Dawes Act in 1887 and the passage of the  Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, the Indian landmass in the United  States shrank by 86 million acres.                                time  1400    Since the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act, the Department  of the Interior has taken back approximately 9 million acres of land  into trust status. Tribes have used their trust lands to build  community facilities such as schools, health centers, and housing that  serve their Tribal members. This land is also used for Tribal  enterprises and promotes economic development in communities that are  often underserved and poverty-stricken.   In 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned long- existing precedent in its decision on the Carcieri v. Salazar case. The  Supreme Court ruled specifically that the Secretary's authority to hold  land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act was limited only to  recognized Tribes ``now under Federal jurisdiction,'' with the word  ``now'' meaning June 18, 1934, the date of the enactment of the Indian  Reorganization Act.   Previously, lower courts have viewed the word ``now'' as the instant  when the Secretary invoked trust acquisition authority. However, the  Supreme Court reversed the lower court ruling on the interpretation  that the term ``now under Federal jurisdiction'' in section 19 of the  Indian Reorganization Act was to be interpreted. It found that the  phrase refers only to those Tribes that were under Federal jurisdiction  of the United States when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in  1934.   As a result of the Carcieri decision, the Secretary of the Interior  may no longer use the Indian Reorganization Act to acquire trust land  for any post-1934 Tribe without specific authorization from Congress.  Because the Secretary has acquired lands in trust for dozens of Tribes  recognized after 1934, the Carcieri ruling calls into question the  validity of the trust status of such lands and jeopardizes their  immunity from State and local taxation and regulatory jurisdiction.   Many Tribes have been forced into court to defend the status of their  trust land, costing them millions of dollars and compromising their  investments and jurisdiction.   H.R. 375 would amend the Indian Reorganization Act and clarify the  language the Supreme Court ruled against by striking ``the term,''  which I have previously referenced, and inserting the words ``effective  beginning on June 18, 1934, the term.'' It would also amend the statute  language from ``any recognized Indian Tribe now under Federal  jurisdiction'' to ``any federally recognized Indian Tribe.''   The modest changes clarify that the Secretary does have authority to  take land into trust for any Tribe that the Federal Government has  recognized.   As a member of the Chickasaw Nation and co-chair of the Native  American Caucus, I commend the Natural Resources Committee for  favorably marking up this legislation and this body for moving forward  with the passage of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 375.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. It is a very  generous gesture when we have a different point of view on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 312, the Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act.   Mashpee Wampanoag people have lived in the Massachusetts area for  thousands of years. In fact, our shared Thanksgiving tradition  highlights a celebration of Pilgrims and Indians breaking bread  together over the first colonial holiday, and it is the Mashpee who sat  at the table.   In 2007, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe was federally recognized. Mr.  Speaker, 8 years later, the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the  decision to take land into trust on behalf of the Mashpee for a  reservation. The Tribe was then able to provide services directly to  its citizens, become eligible for Federal programs, and explore  economic opportunities.   Shortly after, in 2016, the Mashpee's reservation decision was  challenged in court by plaintiffs stating that, because the Tribe was  federally recognized after 1934, the Department of the Interior could  not take land into trust on behalf of a Tribe. This decision stems from  the 2009 Supreme Court decision, Carcieri v. Salazar. It is an example  of why that law needs to be fixed.   In 2018, the administration issued a decision that would take the  Mashpees' reservation out of trust. This marked the first time since  the termination era that a Tribe has lost their trust land.   Frankly, from my standpoint, Mr. Speaker, an attack on trust land  anywhere threatens trust land everywhere, so I am very happy to be  working with my good friend, Mr. Keating, on H.R. 312. It is a  bipartisan bill, and it is necessary. It will reaffirm the trust status  of the Mashpee reservation.   The local elected officials with jurisdiction over the land are  supportive of the bill, as is the State's entire congressional  delegation, as is the Republican Governor of the State.   Mr. Speaker, a ``yes'' vote on this bill will right a wrong. It is a  vote for local control. It is a vote for Tribal sovereignty, and it  brings the Mashpee land back into trust. It marks another important  step in our shared American journey.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.                                time  1445
