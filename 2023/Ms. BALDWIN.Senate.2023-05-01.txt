 Madam President, today I rise to honor Matt  Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, on  his retirement. Over the span of Matt's 43-year career, he has been a  tireless advocate for democracy, social and economic justice, and civil  rights and liberties.   After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard in 1980, Matt went to  work as an editor for the Multinational Monitor, working for Ralph  Nader in Washington, DC. In 1983, he moved to Wisconsin to take a job  as staff writer with The Progressive Magazine. In 1994, he advanced to  senior editor and chairman of the board of directors for the magazine.  While with The Progressive, Matt was also the director of The  Progressive Media Project and published the book, ``You Have No Rights:  Stories of America in an Age of Repression.'' While at The Progressive,  Matt wrote hundreds of stories on issues ranging from threats to civil  liberties, to social justice, to peace, to environmental concerns. He  interviewed notable figures in the arts, politics, and economics  including Wendell Berry, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, Robert Redford,  Alice Walker, Allen Ginsberg, and Joseph Stiglitz.   In 2015, Matt joined the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign where he  focused the efforts of the organization on banning gerrymandering,  protecting and expanding the freedom to vote, getting rid of dark money  in politics, and opposing anti-democracy efforts. Matt has the  distinguishing quality of being everywhere, all at once, and has taken  his vital messages about protecting democracy to hundreds of radio and  television broadcasts, newspaper articles, opinion columns, social  media and, in person, doing talks to good government groups in nearly  every community in Wisconsin, letting citizens know what is at stake  and how to get involved to redirect Wisconsin's future. While at the  Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, he also wrote ``Twelve Ways to Save  Democracy in Wisconsin,'' which tells the story of what a once- progressive State lost after Act 10 was enacted in 2010 and the  Republicans, through the creation of unfair maps, held a lock on  government.   Matt has been a leading voice in Wisconsin for over 40 years. He has  advocated tirelessly, doing so with kindness and good humor, always  willing to engage with those who disagreed with him as much as those  who did. Today, as Matt moves into retirement, he will step aside to  leave space for others to fill because that is what Matt is about:  paving the way for the next generation to continue the good fight. I  feel honored to call Matt my friend and will be forever grateful for  all he has done for the citizens in our State and for the voice he has  given to democracy in these perilous times.                            ____________________
