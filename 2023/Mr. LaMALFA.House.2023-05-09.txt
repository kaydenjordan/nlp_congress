 Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, President Biden will be  removing a critical border enforcement mechanism from our Border Patrol  agents' arsenal.   Title 42 is a Trump-era public health order that allows us to quickly  deport illegal immigrants that are abusing our asylum system. Without  this order in place, the crisis at our southern and northern border  would be even worse than it is now.   This impending end of title 42 is public knowledge. Already, border  towns are experiencing yet another surge of illegal immigrants as the  end gets closer.   Allowing title 42 to expire is allowing an already catastrophic  situation to get even worse. It is unconscionable that neither the  President nor Secretary Mayorkas is treating the border crisis with  anything close to seriousness.   Thousands of people violate our Nation's laws and our sovereignty  every day by illegally entering the United States. Drug smuggling and  human trafficking are rampant, and Mexican drug cartels are growing  richer and more powerful.   Only America's foes benefit from the utter chaos at our border. It is  time for the administration to get busy and do the work that needs to  be done. Finish building the border fence.   Sending your press agents out to tell us this is fine? Well, we are  not falling for the Jedi mind trick.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson) yielding me time and for having this event on a  very special day for our great ally and friend, the nation of Israel.   Of course, as acknowledged, this is the 75th anniversary of its  reformation back in 1948, but we know Israel's history goes much, much  further into the past than those 75 years, to the early times in the  Biblical days, and how important that is to all of us. Indeed, God's  chosen people.   They have overcome a lot in their 75 years of existence currently,  including the day after they were formed, to be attacked in war by five  neighboring Arab countries trying to eradicate them.   They fought them off.   Allies around the world came in to help, with their own fierce  determination to exist is what prevailed. Then in 1967, the 6-day war,  as they were attacked, once again, while trying to peacefully exist.   Six years later, 1973--I remember that one--attacked once again.   They are constantly under threat from hostile territory. Thank  goodness under the leadership of Israel and surrounding countries, with  a lot of help from President Trump, we have the Abraham Accords in  order to help promote more understanding and partnerships in that world  with their neighbors, building upon that, a more positive relationship  with Saudi Arabia, and a good relationship with their neighbor, Jordan.   Israel has bent over backwards to be that positive force in the area.  They wish to peacefully coexist.   When I had the chance to visit Israel, three times now, and visit  with the people and listen to their testimony, all they seek is  solutions for peace to exist with their neighbors. When you get a  chance to get feedback from Arab Israelis, people of Arabic descent  that live in Israel, they don't want to leave. They know it is better  there under that style of government and that kind of freedom than any  other that they could live in. That speaks a lot to who the people of  Israel are and what their goals are as a nation.   Of course, they are constantly under threat. Indeed, when they have  bent over backwards with Land For Peace, giving back the Sinai and then  giving back the Gaza Strip, what did they meet up with? Immediately  after deeding over the Gaza Strip, rockets were installed there.  Rockets rained down on Israel constantly.   If you talk to the people there in Israel, many of them that were in  the zones of those rockets, know they have 15 seconds from alert to  take cover.   What an existence.   Our alliance with them is very important because they are indeed a  neighbor and a friend for all of us in the United States. Their  innovation in areas of agriculture and water and drip irrigation, in  the medical field, in aerospace, in missile defense, they are an  important partner for us as they are an extremely industrial and  innovative people. So we benefit greatly from that partnership.   I think those that would criticize what we do to help them, are in  error for looking at it that way.   It is still the only truly free nation in the Middle East. It is the  most tolerant and religious minority in the region by far; indeed a  beacon of hope in the Middle East.   When political and economic freedom are possible, it can produce  lasting success even in the most unlikely of places, but they always  have that feeling of being attacked.    Hamas attacking Israel. Iran nearby wants to continue to sponsor  terror groups while it pursues its own nuclear weapons program.   Hamas has, on many occasions, fired rockets into Israel, as I  mentioned, with the aim of targeting civilian populations.   When Israel strikes back, it is very focused on being sure it hits  only military targets and does not harm civilians. So there is a big  difference between how they operate and what their neighbors, their  hostile neighbors are trying to do to them.   It is important we have this alliance and that we maintain that and  be strong for them because they are indeed the beacon of hope for the  Middle East. They seek peaceful coexistence with their neighbors, and  we should reward that with our continued backing and our continued  friendship, because  [[Page H2169]]  the United States benefits from it as well, as well as those that  believe that we have a longstanding tie that goes back to our founding  in Israel's first existence on this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time here to commemorate not only the  75th, but the greatness of Israel and the partnership we have.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson)  for allowing me the time tonight.
