 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for yielding. She is a true leader in this country on Middle East  issues. I also thank the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, Mr. McCaul, for his steady hand and dedication to leading  the Foreign Affairs Committee during this pivotal moment in world  history and for moving this resolution forward alongside the ranking  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the indefatigable former  Chairman Meeks.   Congressman French Hill and I chair the Congressional Task Force on  American Hostages and Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad, and I thank  him for being my lead sponsor on this bill. It is an honor to work with  him in that capacity. This resolution speaks to our collaboration and  dedication to the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7.   On October 7, a day that will live in infamy, 1,200 were killed in a  surprise attack during a Jewish holiday. The attack didn't stop there  because over 200 were taken hostage in one of the greatest hostage  takings in world history.   We are now in a moment when the House of Representatives is called to  speak, to demand on behalf of our government the return of all the  hostages held in Gaza.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the hundreds of cosponsors and supporters of  this resolution. It is worth noting that fellow Members of Congress who  span the country and the political spectrum have joined together to  call out Hamas.   Mr. Speaker, the time is more than now. We have seen some hostages in  the last handful of days being returned, and now we have learned of  their harrowing time held in tunnels, nearly starved, with no beds.  Right now, too many are left in those tunnels injured, uncared for, and  victimized at the hands of those who killed their fellow countrymen and  -women.   Introduced on October 17, a week-and-a-half into this hostage  nightmare, this resolution, H. Res. 793, called out Hamas and demanded  the return of the innocents--women, elderly, children, infants. Over  the weekend, Israel and her allies secured the release of 58 hostages  at 7 weeks into captivity. On Monday, 11 more hostages were released.  Just moments ago, we have learned of more, for a total of 85. Among  those are Aviv Asher, age 2; her sister Raz, age 4; Emma Cunio, age 3;  Yuli Cunio, age 3; Avigail Idan, age 4; and Oria Brodutch, age 4-- toddlers, children, preschoolers, the most innocent people on planet  Earth. Those freed also included senior citizens: Yafa Adar, age 85;  Elma Avraham, age 84; and Channa Peri, age 79.   Why on Earth did Hamas take these people? Why did they force them to  watch the murder of their loved ones? This is absolutely  unconscionable, and it is an attack on all humanity.   These people have been used as pawns. We are relieved that some are  home, but we must condemn those who have kidnapped. We must condemn the  terrorists who seek to attack the Jewish state. They have brutally  killed relatives, neighbors, and fellow Israelis. We must continue to  push to return the remaining hostages.   Let us not forget that over 150 remain in Gaza, and many of those  released still have family members held--nearly 200 people held for 52  days at gunpoint. Nine Americans continue to be held.   Hundreds of families are waiting with bated breath for the return of  their precious loved ones, waiting for relief and joy or the worst pain  known to humankind. We cannot even imagine their anguish. It is  unfathomable. What Hamas did was evil, and it was an attack on the  Jewish state.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I cannot in my allotted time name those who  are remaining in Gaza, but we are making progress, and we will come  together united as a House of Representatives to condemn this evil.
