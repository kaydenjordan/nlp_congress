 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act would prohibit the  Federal Government from entering into or enforcing any settlement  agreement requiring donations to remediate harms that are not  ``directly and proximately'' caused by a wrongdoer's unlawful conduct.   I, regretfully, oppose this measure for several reasons. To begin  with, the bill would prohibit these types of settlement agreements even  though they have been successfully used to remedy various harms,  particularly those caused by reckless corporate actors.   For example, these settlement agreements helped facilitate an  effective and comprehensive response to the predatory and fraudulent  mortgage lending activities of financial institutions that nearly  caused the economic collapse of our Nation, and that led to the Great  Recession.   In fact, settlement agreements with two of these culpable financial  institutions, Bank of America and Citigroup, required a donation of  less than 1 percent of the overall settlement amount to fund  foreclosure prevention and remediation programs to help harmed  consumers.   Now, contrary to the majority's claim, the Justice Department did not  use any of these settlement agreements to fund active groups.  Notwithstanding the production of hundreds of pages of documents by the  Justice Department, along with hundreds of pages of documents produced  by private parties, we have not seen a shred of evidence that the  government included unlawful or politically motivated terms in its  settlement agreements with Bank of America or Citigroup.   The majority also asserts that these settlement agreements are used  by the Justice Department and other agencies to circumvent the  congressional appropriations process. But existing law already prevents  agencies from augmenting their own funds.   By law, donations included in settlement agreements must have a clear  nexus to the prosecutorial objectives of the enforcement agency. And  both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional  Research Service have concluded that settlement agreements providing  for secondary remediation do not violate Congress' constitutional power  of the purse.   Finally, H.R. 732 would prevent the remediation of systemic harms in  civil and criminal enforcement actions.   These settlement agreements allow parties to resolve their civil or  criminal liability by voluntarily remediating the harms caused by their  unlawful conduct. For some types of unlawful conduct, such as  discrimination based on race or religion, secondary remediation of  harms may be the only remedy available for systemic violations of the  law.                                time  1515    The victims of such conduct are typically not themselves parties to  the underlying action. Therefore, secondary remediation in the form of  voluntary compliance and training programs serves as an important tool  in these cases to protect victims of discrimination. Yet H.R. 732 would  effectively prohibit such relief.   Given these serious problems and some others presented by the bill, I  strongly am led to oppose H.R. 732.  [[Page H8109]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the House  Judiciary Committee, who is ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee of the Judiciary  Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I would only offer to say that there is  not one Judiciary Committee Democrat on this so-called bipartisan bill.  That is where you first start the bipartisanship: you work with members  who may, in fact, believe that some of the issues that have been raised  by my  [[Page H8115]]  good friend from California may have merit.   Maybe this bill could have been drafted in a way that would have  responded to some of the failures, if there are some, such as evidenced  by our good friend from New Jersey, who recalled a lot of failures not  by Democrats but by Republicans. But when you start off with a bill  talking about slush funds, then you negate the good work of so many  organizations that have benefited to do the very good that the consent  decree was intended to do.   Today, I stood with the Latinas Against Domestic Violence. They came  here to stand against the violence against women that goes on and on  and on. Some of them may be in the gallery.   But what I would say, Mr. Chairman, is: Why would we not want to give  that organization funds if they were in line to get dollars to help  prevent or intervene in the vileness of domestic violence?   So the idea that our friends on the other side are missing is the  value some of these entities have been given.   The only word that I have heard over and over again, as I have heard  from the administration, I have heard from the Attorney General, the  former Secretary of Health and Human Services, is one word. In fact, I  think the English language has been limited to one word on the floor of  the House: Obama. I like to call him President Barack Obama. That is  the respect I give him.   Every legislative initiative has come forward on the shoulders of a  man who finishes 8 years, might I say, with a great deal of respect.   So here is what the bill the people are opposed to will do:   This bill would not give dollars to those victims who are harmed and  could engage in workplace monitoring, as well as other payments to  remedy generalized harm, including remedies designed to prevent the  recurrence of sexual violence or discrimination in the workplace.   They wouldn't give it to an environmental remedy project, such as  needed cleanup efforts following the hazardous toxic pollutant spills  that spoil protected areas, preventing families and children from  enjoying recreation on State lands designed for public use.    They wouldn't give it to federally certified housing counseling  intermediaries by preventing housing counseling, relief to communities  that have been preyed upon by financial institutions that have broken  the law.   I even hate to use the term ``slush.'' They are dollars out of a  consent decree that are managed and monitored by career professionals  to those in need.   So I am opposed to the underlying bill, and I will offer an  amendment.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I will also be on this floor offering letters  opposing, again, not only this dastardly named legislation--who would  want to see this in the Congressional Record: slush fund--undermining,  as I said, the professionalism of our career employees in the DOJ and  undermining American citizens and nonprofits who are working every day  to make the life of America and America's children better.   This is a bad bill. Vote it down. It is not bipartisan. No Judiciary  Committee Democrat saw fit for it to be legitimate.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 732, the ``Stop  Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017.''   The proposed legislation, as currently drafted, is intended to  preclude all third-party payments in settlement agreements, other than  restitution to identifiable victims.   Specifically, this legislation seeks to block federal law from  including payments that provide relief in negotiated settlements to  victims, such as in cases of predatory lending, employment  discrimination and pollution through environmental hazardous.   For the average American, this harmful bill translates as thwarting  settlement donations to legitimately harmed victims for:   1. Workplace monitoring, as well as, other payments to remedy  generalized harm, including remedies designed to prevent the recurrence  of sexual violence or discrimination in the workplace;   2. Environmental remedy projects, such as needed clean-up efforts  following the hazardous, toxic pollutant spills that spoil protected  areas, preventing families and children from enjoying recreation time  on state lands designed for public use; or   3. Federally-certified housing counseling intermediaries by  preventing housing counseling relief to communities that have been  preyed upon by financial institutions that have broken the law.   This legislation fails to recognize the critical role and positive  benefits that housing counseling organizations now play in addressing  and ensuring that the discriminatory practices and abuses, like those  that led to the housing and financial crisis, never happen again.   The Republican narrative suggests that this bill attempts to make  technical changes to the way that courts operate; but in reality, for  the everyday hard working American, this legislation along with its  companion bills (H.R. 720, the ``Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act,'' and  H.R. 725, the ``Innocent Party Protection Act,'') is merely a concerted  effort to chip away at Americans' ability to seek justice and,  therefore, must be opposed.   This legislation is intended to cut off proceeds from government  settlements to ``third-party'' entities, which would stop a critical  source of funding for the nonprofit sector--including public interest  community organizations, foundations or trusts and other similar  groups.   Oftentimes, allowing these monies to be available to third-parties is  the best way to assure harmed persons will be made whole.   By barring government settlements from directing payments to non- profit organizations, this legislation would thereby hamstring the  parties' ability to fully remedy the wrongdoing underlying the lawsuit.   Congress lacks the time, expertise, and resources to properly review  and make enforcement decisions on behalf of Federal agencies.   The cost of delays associated with this scheme would have devastating  consequences for the public health, environment, and local communities.   H.R. 732 would greatly strain Congress' already limited legislative  resources and scarce time, while opening the doors to industry  influence and obstruction in routine enforcement matters.   This legislation pushes the everyday hard working American to the  margins of the justice system by requiring restitution only in cases  with a showing of actual harm directly and proximately caused by the  party making the payment.   The bill's definition excludes any payment by a party to provide  restitution for, or otherwise, remedy the actual harm, directly and  proximately caused by the alleged conduct of the party that is the  basis for the settlement agreement, including payments requiring  monitoring and other payments for generalized harm.   This exception is too narrowly drawn to allow for numerous beneficial  uses of settlement monies, especially for vulnerable plaintiffs trying  to access the courts in search of restitution from legitimate harm.   As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S. Department of  Justice pursued lawsuits against mortgage lenders and banks that  engaged in discriminatory lending practices, such as those targeted by  this legislation.   Research shows that African Americans and Latinos were discriminated  against and steered into subprime loans even when they qualified for  conventional loans.   Moreover, African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more  likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which resulted  in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional loans.   Pursuant to the settlement agreements, available under current law,  the Justice Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a  portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) certified housing counseling intermediaries to  provide consumer relief in the communities that were hit hardest.   HUD has approved thirty-seven housing counseling intermediaries that  financial institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party  providers of consumer relief under the terms of the Justice Department  settlement agreements.   Additionally, these HUD-certified housing counseling providers  deliver financial education and coaching to individuals to inform them  of their home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and  remain homeowners.   In fact, since 2008, 40 affiliates have provided housing counseling  services--to date serving more than 200,000 clients in mostly  underserved areas.   The success of housing counseling programs is undisputed.   Borrowers who have used housing counseling are one-third less likely  to be seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who are in  default are 60 percent more likely to save their homes.   The benefits of these programs are tangible and must continue to be  made available to the public.  [[Page H8116]]    This example is particularly pertinent as Houston recovers from  hurricane Harvey, a tragedy that displaced tens of thousands of my  constituents.   There are still over 61 thousand people living in hotels throughout  Texas.   The public has found itself in need of protection form environmental  harms caused by absconding deep pocket defendants.   To ensure these protections, the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) may request Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in  settlement agreements to offset the harms of unlawful conduct by  requiring parties to undertake an environmentally beneficial project or  activity that ``is not required by law,'' but that a defendant agrees  to undertake as part of the settlement of an enforcement action.   In workplace discrimination cases, victims are guarded by the Civil  Rights Act passed by Congress in 1964 to remove discriminatory barriers  and to promote equality in employment opportunities.   Cases, nonetheless, involving workplace discrimination claims often  occur without identifiable victims and tend to affect the interests of  persons who are not likely to receive compensation for unlawful conduct  (e.g., unidentifiable victims such as former and future employees).   In these cases, a settling party that violated antidiscrimination  laws may seek to resolve its civil liability through workplace  monitoring or training programs that seek to remedy systemic unlawful  conduct.   Furthermore, the claim that the funding received by organizations to  provide home counseling services to harmed individuals amount to a  ``slush fund,'' is an egregious and shameless attempt to smear and  impugn the integrity of longstanding and trusted nonprofits and civil  rights organizations.   As the Justice Department has observed, remedies can correct both  noncompliance and recidivism through settlement terms that require a  party to undertake activity to prevent future misconduct.   Not only is this legislation an unnecessary intrusion into the  province of the federal courts, it is a part of a larger push to limit  Americans' ability to seek justice in a court of law.   An innocent-sounding name aside, this bill poses a grave threat to  our court system--the nation's stronghold for protecting our democracy.   In the current political climate, where the justice system is the  last line of defense for our nation's values, I urge my colleagues not  to cede that ground.   Congress should applaud and elevate the benefits of housing  counseling, and the good work of frontline organizations, in righting  the injustices of the past and present.   The working men and women of America, as well as their families  deserve fair and impartial access to real justice when major  corporations, inadvertently as it may be, inflict harm.   It is our duty as guardians of the judicial system to ensure real  restitution is available to all, including the most vulnerable.   For these reasons, I urge all Members to vote against H.R. 732.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from National Urban  League and a letter from Public Citizen.                                           National Urban League,                                     New York, NY, February 1, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 732--The Stop Settlement Slush Funds           Act of 2017.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers,      Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: As       President and CEO of the National Urban League, the nation's       largest historic civil rights organization dedicated to       economic empowerment of African Americans and other       underserved urban communities, I write to urge you to oppose       H.R. 732, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017. This       legislation seeks to block federal law enforcement from       including in negotiated settlements payments that provide       relief to victims of predatory lending. Specifically, the       bill targets federally certified housing counseling       intermediaries such as the National Urban League by       preventing these organizations from providing housing       counseling relief to communities that have been preyed upon       by financial institutions that have broken the law. H.R. 732       fails to recognize the critical role and positive benefits       that housing counseling organizations now play in addressing       and ensuring that the discriminatory practices and abuses,       like those that led to the housing and financial crisis,       never happen again.        As you know, following the subprime meltdown, the U.S.       Department of Justice pursued law suits against mortgage       lenders and banks that engaged in discriminatory lending       practices. Research shows that African Americans and Latinos       were discriminated against and steered into subprime loans       even when they qualified for conventional loans. Moreover,       African Americans and Latinos were two to three times more       likely than white homebuyers to receive subprime loans which       resulted in foreclosure rates 10 times that of conventional       loans. Pursuant to the settlement agreements, the Justice       Department ordered that financial institutions dedicate a       portion of their settlement payments to U.S. Department of       Housing and Urban Development (HUD) certified housing       counseling intermediaries to provide consumer relief in the       communities that were hit hardest.        The National Urban League is one of thirty-seven HUD-      approved housing counseling intermediaries that financial       institutions have the discretion to choose as third-party       providers of consumer relief under the terms of the Justice       Department settlement agreements. The National Urban League       is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has a 4-star       rating from Charity Navigator, placing it in the top 10       percent of all U.S. charities for adhering to good       governance, fiscal responsibility and other best practices.        As a HUD-certified housing counseling provider, the       National Urban League successfully delivers financial       education and coaching to individuals to inform them of their       home-buying options and rights, and to ensure they become and       remain homeowners. In fact, since 2008, 40 of our affiliates       have provided housing counseling services--to date serving       more than 200,000 clients in mostly underserved areas.        The success of housing counseling programs provided by       National Urban League and others is undisputed. Borrowers who       have used housing counseling are one-third less likely to be       seriously delinquent on their loan payments, and those who       are in default are 60 percent more likely to save their       homes. The benefits of these programs are tangible and must       continue to be made available to the public.        On a separate note, it has come to my attention the       National Urban League and National Council of La Raza have       been singled out during recent hearings on this legislation.       The claims made during congressional testimony that the       funding received by our organizations to provide home       counseling services amounts to a ``slush fund,'' is an       egregious and shameless attempt to smear and impugn the       integrity of longstanding and trusted nonprofits and civil       rights organizations. Congress should applaud and elevate the       benefits of housing counseling, and the good work of       frontline organizations, like the National Urban League, in       righting the injustices of the past and present.        Therefore, I respectfully urge you to oppose H.R. 732 and       any efforts to include similar provisions in legislation       moving through Congress.            Sincerely,                                                    Marc H. Morial,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                   Public Citizen,                                   Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.      Re Oppose the assault on civil justice.       House of Representatives,      Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Members of the U.S. House Judiciary       Committee: On behalf of Public Citizen, a non-profit       membership organization with more than 400,000 members and       supporters nationwide, we express extreme opposition to a       slate of three harmful bills scheduled to be marked-up in       Committee tomorrow: the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2017       (H.R. 720), the Innocent Party Protection Party Act of 2017       (H.R. 725), and the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017       (H.R. 732). Seen separately, these bills attempt to make       technical changes to the way that courts operate; taken       together they are a concerted effort chip away at Americans'       ability to seek justice and, therefore, must be opposed.                Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2017 (H.R. 720)         The proposed Rule 11 changes in H.R. 720 will make federal       litigation more complicated, costly, and inaccessible to       consumers and employees. We urge you to reject this       legislation.        Currently, judges have discretion to impose sanctions on a       lawyer or a party in litigation to deter sanctionable conduct       in pleadings, motions, and other court papers. The so-called       Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, or LARA, would revise Rule 11 of       the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require sanctions,       rather than leaving the decision whether to impose sanctions       to the discretion of federal judges. This proposal would make       litigation longer and more expensive.        The problems with this bill are not theoretical, but       proven. In 1983, changes to Federal Rule 11 removed judicial       discretion for issuing sanctions. Those changes were       overturned a decade later, because the 1983 Rule caused a       marked increase in business-to-business litigation and       abusive Rule 11 motion practice by lawyers arguing more about       sanctions than about the merits of the cases. Because 1983       changes proved to discourage lawyers from cooperating with       each other, the changes prolonged litigation, rather than       advancing the goal of coming to a just conclusion. We must       not repeat this failed experiment.        Additionally, LARA would obstruct Americans' access to       justice, especially in cases such as those alleging civil       rights violations, as those types of cases can be based on       novel legal theories. In those cases, LARA would chill the       filing of meritorious suits, and justice for some will go       unserved.  [[Page H8117]]                 Innocent Party Protection Party Act of 2017 (H.R. 725)         H.R. 725, the Innocent Party Protection Act (called the       Fraudulent Joinder Protection Act in previous Congresses) is       a supposed fix for an imagined problem. It addresses a       federal district court's consideration of a plaintiff's       motion to remand a case to state court, after a defendant has       removed the case from the state court in which it was filed       to federal district court on the theory that the plaintiff       had fraudulently joined a non-diverse defendant for the       purpose of defeating federal-court jurisdiction. The purpose       of the bill is to assist defendants in keeping cases in       federal court after removal. The bill purports to achieve       this purpose by specifying that the federal court consider       evidence, such as affidavits, and by specifying four findings       that would require a federal district court to deny a       plaintiff's motion to remand.        Congress should not get into the business of micro-managing       the motion practice of the federal courts without strong       evidence that current court procedures are not serving their       purpose: facilitating justice. In this instance, there is no       evidence to support the assumption that the district courts       are not denying motions to remand in appropriate cases.       Congress has no basis to revise the courts' procedures when       the current standards are not producing unjust results. The       Committee should hesitate before taking the step into       micromanagement of the federal courts' consideration of one       specific type of motion, where that motion has existed for       more than a century and there are only the flimsiest of       arguments in favor of changing it.              Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732)         This legislation is intended to cut off proceeds from       government settlements to ``third-party'' entities, which       would stop a critical source of funding for the nonprofit       sector--including public interest community organizations,       foundations or trusts and other similar groups.        The bill would bar government settlements from directing       payment to non-profit organizations, thereby hamstringing the       parties' ability to fully remedy the wrongdoing underlying       the lawsuit. Oftentimes, allowing these monies to be       available to third-parties is the best way to assure harmed       persons will be made whole.        Not only are these three bills unnecessary intrusions into       the province of the federal courts, they are part of a larger       push to limit Americans' ability to seek justice in a court       of law. Their innocent-sounding names aside, these bills pose       a grave threat to our court system--the nation's stronghold       for protecting our democracy. In the current political       climate, where the justice system is the last line of defense       for our nation's values, we urge you not to cede that ground.            Sincerely,      Lisa Gilbert,        Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.      Susan Harley,        Deputy Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I note that a broad coalition  of public interest organizations, including Public Citizen, Americans  for Financial Reform, the National Urban League, among others, strongly  oppose H.R. 732. They warn: ``This measure would undermine law  enforcement goals by reducing the availability of suitable remedies to  address these kind of injuries to the public caused by illegal  conduct.''   This bill is, in effect, a gift to lawbreakers that comes at the  expense of families and communities impacted by injuries that cannot be  addressed by direct restitution, and so I have to ask: Why are we  giving a gift to lawbreakers in the guise of H.R. 732?   If you value, as I do, upholding the rule of law, then you will join  me and many others in opposing this seriously flawed measure.   I thank everyone who has participated in this discussion, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, Members of the House, this amendment makes a  bad bill even worse. To begin with, it would prohibit cy-pres  distributions pursuant to which parties attempt to find the next best  use of funds that remain after a class action settlement has been  finally administered. Cy-pres is especially important in actions where  the recovery is so small for an individual class member that he or she  may not bother to make a claim or where a distribution is not  practical.   For example, courts under cy-pres may permit unclaimed settlement  funds to provide indirect compensation to the class, such as future  price reductions or remediation efforts. As a result of this amendment,  however, the unclaimed settlement funds would be returned to the very  entities that caused the injury in the first place. Simply put, this  amendment would benefit the wrongdoers to the detriment of the victims  they harmed.   In addition, this amendment would restrict the amount of compensation  a victim could receive under a settlement agreement to the extent the  victim was actually harmed by the wrongdoer. The amendment completely  ignores the pragmatic realities of systemic harms, such as widespread  long-term or latent environmental damage like lead-contaminated public  water drinking systems--think of Flint, Michigan--where the extent of a  victim's exposure to such harms may be difficult and, perhaps, even  impossible to quantify.   In a letter opposed to this amendment, a group of public interest  organizations, including Earthjustice, Public Citizen, Alliance for  Justice, the Center for Justice & Democracy, and the American  Association for Justice, said it is terrible public policy because  wrongdoers would benefit from a windfall for cheating and harming  consumers, undoing the accountability or deterrence function of the  entire settlement. This is absolutely the wrong result, and so I urge  that this amendment be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 11, insert after ``settlement agreement'' the       following: ``(except as provided in subsection (g))''.        Add at the end of the bill the following:        (g) Exception.--The provisions of this Act do not apply in       the case of a settlement agreement that directs funds to       remediate the indirect harms caused by unlawful conduct       resulting in an increase in the amount of lead in public       drinking water.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.R. 732  settlement agreements that direct funds to remediate the indirect but  catastrophic effects of unlawful conduct resulting in lead  contamination in public drinking water.   Lead contamination in public drinking water is potentially a national  public health crisis as older cities continue to rely on aging lead  pipes for the delivery of public drinking water.   A report from the American Water Works Association estimates that  this problem could potentially affect millions of water service lines.  For example, Highland Park, located in my district, has been dealing  with issues resulting from aging lead pipes. Just last month, officials  closed public water fountains and fixtures due to unsafe samples of  lead in public drinking water.   The well-publicized Flint water crisis is another painful example of  the disastrous consequences of lead contamination in public drinking  water.  [[Page H8125]]    The director of the pediatric residents at Hurley Children's Hospital  in Flint wrote: ``To understand the contamination of this city, think  about drinking water through a straw coated in lead. As you sip, lead  particles flake off into the water and are ingested. Flint's children  have been drinking water through lead-coated straws.''   The Flint water crisis has generated numerous lawsuits by  individuals, local and State agencies, and public interest  organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the  American Civil Liberties Union.   While these cases tend to involve numerous victims directly affected  by unlawful conduct, they can also affect the interests of persons who  are not parties to the case or are likely to receive compensation for  unlawful conduct.   Given the systemic nature of lead contamination in drinking water,  settlement agreements resolving civil and criminal liability related to  the Flint water crisis may require setting aside funds for  unidentifiable victims, directing payments to address generalized harm,  or establishing an environmental compliance program to avoid lead  contamination in the future.   Unfortunately, these entirely legitimate forms of indirect  remediation of environmental harms would be prohibited by H.R. 732.   Mr. Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan  will be postponed.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR.
