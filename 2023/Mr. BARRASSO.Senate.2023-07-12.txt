 I come to the floor to join my colleague from Kansas,  Senator Marshall, in talking about the economy. President Biden has  spent the last 2 weeks trying to define and then redefine what has been  come to be known as Bidenomics. The President now wants to talk about  his economic record. Well, I would say, let us have that conversation.   Here is what Bidenomics means to working families in my home State of  Wyoming. It means record inflation. It means hollowed out savings. And  it means crushing interest rates.   Bidenomics is a radical recipe causing more and more Americans to  fall further and further behind. It means families are faced with tough  decisions every single day--decisions about how they are going to make  ends meet; decisions about what they can afford at the grocery store,  how much gas they could put in the vehicle; decisions as they are  trying to pay their bills sitting at the kitchen table. Bidenomics is  spelling a summer of suffering for every single American.   Before the President took office, inflation was practically  nonexistent, 1.4 percent. But under the Biden-Harris administration,  prices have risen 16.6 percent. American households are spending $900  more per month just to keep up. The average household has spent over  $2,300 more on energy alone since Joe Biden came to the White House-- that is to fill a tank of gas, to keep the lights on, to heat the house  in the winter and cool it in the summer.   Wyoming families are worried about our Nation and our Nation's  future, and they believe this country is on the wrong track. It is what  I heard all over the Fourth of July recess from families from Cody to  Gillette, Casper to Pinedale. That is what they shared with me. They  are so much in agreement with families all across this country because  the high cost of everything is the top issue that people are talking  about and thinking about nationally. That is the impact of Bidenomics.  That is what Joe Biden has done to this country. The pain and suffering  that the American families are feeling was nothing to celebrate over  the Fourth of July, but that is what the White House is trying to do.   You wonder how we got here. Let me tell you. This agenda by the  Democrats and Joe Biden and his colleagues in the House and in the  Senate, the Democrats have an agenda of runaway spending, of government  overreach, and of reckless tax hikes. We warned our Democratic  colleagues that the Biden-Harris spending would send prices soaring.  That is exactly what happened.   The spending also drove interest rates higher. Sky-high interest  rates are sapping savings. They are putting an additional burden on  working families. People are actually dipping into their savings  account or taking on additional credit card debt just to pay current- day bills.   Credit card debt recently hit a record of nearly $1 trillion. That is  roughly $10,000 per household in this country. These are drastic  measures that people are being forced to take because inflation has  outpaced wages for 26 months in a row.   Adding to the pain of record-high prices and more debt is the  administration's excessive and continued government overreach. The  Biden-Harris administration's regulatory agenda is the most expensive  of any administration in modern history. The administration is  surrendering America's energy and economic dominance and they are doing  it to adversaries like China. And they are doing it right now as John  Kerry prepares to go to China and continue this American surrender. The  President wants all Americans driving electric cars no matter what it  costs. Here is the catch. The electric cars are going to be slapped  with ``Made in China'' stickers.   What happened last week? China choked off supply of critical minerals  that are used for solar panels that Joe Biden wants us to make here.  [[Page S2341]]    China controls the supply chain for the minerals needed to build the  electric cars and the batteries. But we are not allowed to mine for it  here--no. His Department of Interior shut down mining in Minnesota for  critical minerals. He is making China richer and America poorer.   Joe Biden is turning to China, not American workers, for the critical  minerals needed for these cars. Bidenomics is selling out to communist  China.   America isn't blind to the blunder of Bidenomics. Here is a quote  from a recent CNN story. It says:         Most Americans are convinced the economy is in bad shape,       and they blame the president.    A new poll from the Associated Press and the National Opinion  Research Center found that 64 percent of Americans--almost two-thirds  of Americans--disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling the economy.  A Harvard-Harris poll said that 74 percent of Americans say their  financial situation is not improving under this administration. Yet you  see Joe Biden touring the country, and Democrats giving victory  speeches. Bidenomics is ravaging our wallets, wrecking our savings, and  ruining our economy, and the Democrats are saying: Great.   Senate Republicans have solutions to get America back on track, and  it starts with spending less and reducing redtape and unleashing  American energy.   As the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, I will tell you that unleashing American energy is my top  priority. To accomplish that, we need to pass true permitting reform.  Our plan is going to make life more affordable by making it easier to  produce every type of American energy.   We will need traditional, reliable forms of energy like oil, coal,  and natural gas for years and years to come in spite of what the  President may foolishly believe. We also need to produce more energy  from resources like nuclear, wind, and solar. We need it all.   Unleashing American energy with permitting reform is the key that  unlocks American dominance again. This is what we need to do to reverse  the damage, the destruction, and the devastation of Joe Biden and  Bidenomics.   Bidenomics is a grim reality for too many people in Wyoming and  across the country. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Washington Democrats  cannot keep ignoring the pain they are causing. Nobody can afford  another bad day of bad Bidenomics.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, it is a privilege to be here today,  joined by my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Cynthia Lummis, and my  colleague from Delaware, the chairman of the Committee on Environment  and Public Works, Senator Tom Carper, to honor this incredible woman,  Dessie Bebout.   Senator Lummis is absolutely right. I attended the funeral of this  102-year-old just a couple of weeks ago. We were in Riverton, WY, for  the services as she was laid to rest with military honors in Hudson,  WY, and thought what an opportunity to name a post office after someone  who has given so much to their country, as well as to the Postal  Service.   It is wonderful to be working with Senator Tom Carper again on an  issue of great interest to both of us because he was a senior partner  when, a few years ago, we named a post office in Thermopolis, WY, after  Bob Brown, a World War II hero who then was awarded the Purple Heart  for his service in Korea and served 41 years at the Thermopolis Post  Office before he retired as the postmaster. So I come to the floor  today, along with our colleagues, to introduce a bill to honor the  legacy of this remarkable woman, Dessie A. Bebout of Shoshoni, WY.   She was really a trailblazer for women in Wyoming because she was a  patriot. She honorably served our  [[Page S2365]]  country during World War II. She was one of the first to raise her  hand, take the oath, and volunteer as she did for this remarkable group  of individuals who volunteered: the Women Accepted for Volunteer  Emergency Service in World War II, the WAVES.   She was born in Hudson, WY--a very small community--in 1920. If you  haven't ever been to Hudson, there is a small Main Street. And since  Hudson didn't have a doctor, Dessie was born with the help of a  midwife. She was the fourth of nine children. They worked very hard  supporting the family business that was the Svilar family. Her maiden  name was Svilar. They had the Svilar's bar and restaurant, the Svilars'  Light and Power company--they provided libations as well as  electricity--and the Svilars' derby bar. It is a small town, but two  bars make for a smalltown charm. The Svilars' bar and restaurant is  still open today. So, if you ever get to Hudson, stop in because they  have the best steaks you are going to ever find anywhere.   Her life experience is one, really, that highlighted her legendary  work ethic. After graduating from Fremont County Vocational High School  in Lander, she worked for the Fremont County Extension service and at  the F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in  1941 changed the United States and the world forever, and it certainly  changed her. Being willing to serve the country, to step forward, is  part of the Wyoming bloodstream.   When she joined and went to New York City for basic training and was  then stationed in Seattle, WA, she reconnected with a young man who she  had met previously in Hudson, Herbert ``Hugh'' Bebout. After a few  months of writing letters, they were married in 1943. He was an  enlisted man in the U.S. Air Force.   After World War II ended, he was discharged; and, along with Dessie,  they came home to Wyoming. They started a family and had four children:  Eli, Ruby, Nick, and David. Eli was speaker of the house in the Wyoming  Legislature. Ruby runs the Wyoming public television. Nick played  football for the University of Wyoming and then for the NFL.   Dessie's life and family and giving just continued to grow. She  started her career in the Postal Service in 1962. She rose to  postmaster for Shoshoni, WY, where she served for 13 years. In 1975,  Dessie retired as the Shoshoni postmaster, where she had earned the  Order of the Vest. It is the highest award given to postmasters.   Although she had retired from the Postal Service, her work and  community service didn't stop. She served as a Fremont County election  judge, for the Shoshoni Chamber of Commerce, on the Shoshoni PTA, on  the Wyoming women's commission, on the Veterans of Foreign Wars Women's  Auxiliary, and on the Riverton hospital board, among many  organizations.   As a result of her military and civic service, she was awarded with  the Wyoming Woman of Distinction award from the Wyoming women's  commission, and she received the Medal of Honor from the Daughters of  the American Revolution. Her accolades and awards didn't stop there.  She even had her own holiday because, in 2022, the mayor of Hudson,  Mike Anderson, declared May 30 as Dessie Bebout Day.   Now, she had--I think the Senator from Wyoming said--13  grandchildren. As they spoke at the funeral--as a number of them did-- there were those who claimed to be the favorite grandchild, but since  Kara Calvert is here today, the granddaughter of Dessie Bebout, I think  we will let Kara put upon herself that accolade.   Dessie Bebout truly exemplifies the Code of the West, which is, in  Wyoming, you live each day with courage; you take pride in your work;  and you do what needs to be done. Cowboys never complain. Cowboys never  quit. If somebody were hungry, she would feed them--a remarkable woman.  If they were sick, she would care from them.   I am proud to be joined by both Senator Carper and Senator Lummis  today in introducing this legislation to rename the post office in  Shoshoni, WY, as the ``Dessie A. Bebout Post Office.'' Naming it after  Dessie is going to ensure her legacy carries on for future generations  of Wyoming's men and women.   I yield the floor.
