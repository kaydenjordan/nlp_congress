 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for  his terrific explanation, 60 days hence, of voting for the tax reform  bill and the effects it is having in his great State. I would like to  join him today to talk about what I think are the positive effects of  tax reform, not just across the country but particularly in my small  State of West Virginia.   Last Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence and Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross came to West Virginia to talk about this at a small  business, Worldwide Equipment, which employs 1,100 people across the  country, 200 or so of which are in West Virginia at 7 different  locations. We learned from owner Terry Dotson how he feels about tax  reform and the effect it has had on his business, his employees, his  ability to grow his business. What we learned is that Mr. Dotson is  going to be investing $8 million more in the operations and in his  workforce, whether it is through bonuses, expanding the facilities,  buying new equipment. But particularly for the men and women working  for Worldwide Equipment, it is the bonuses that are going to have  people seeing the immediate effect. He attributes this all to tax  reform.   The men and women of Worldwide Equipment join hundreds of thousands  of workers all across this country at companies like Walmart, AT&T,  Comcast, Fiat Chrysler, and many others who will receive bonuses or  salary increases because of this bill. The good news doesn't stop  there, and that is good.   Those of us who voted for this bill--and I did, very proudly--said  that the effects of this tax reform are going to be felt in many  different ways. Mr. Dotson has a relatively small business. He  mentioned how he is feeling it. But many workers will see their take- home pay increase in the coming weeks, as employers are adjusting the  tax withholding based on the new law.   People like Robert from Berkley Springs, WV, wrote me last week:         Thank you for helping my family by voting yes on the tax       bill. My family saw a significant increase in our take-home       pay today.    Edward from Hurricane, WV, said:         I really want to thank you and the President for the tax       breaks! Please keep working to help the American workers.    Dennie from Charleston wrote:         The recent tax bill that was passed will provide a great       boost to our economy in many ways including more employment       opportunities and money in people's pockets.    And Robert, who is a small business owner from Huntington, wrote:         I want to thank you for your yes vote on the Tax Cuts and       Jobs Act. This legislation recognizes the importance of small       business.    In a State like ours, 95 percent of the businesses are small  businesses. Many of them are family-owned. Other West Virginians will  soon see the benefits.   I would like to tip my hat and congratulate our State auditor, J.B.  McCuskey, because he took the time and made the effort to figure out  what kind of impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on State  workers and the workers from West Virginia University or Marshall  University--the three largest workforces the State of West Virginia  does payroll for. He announced that, in total, all three of those  entities will have $50 million more in their pockets throughout the  year--an average for a State worker of $1,000 or $1,200 more per year.  These are significant amounts of dollars for young families trying to  buy new shoes, buy books and school supplies, use the gas to go visit  or go on a vacation. We could go on and on. It seems that the coldest  day--a wet day like today--is always the day the furnace breaks down.  How nice it would be to not have to borrow or worry or put more credit  on the credit card and have the cash to be able to do these things.   I would say, $50 million more for West Virginia workers is $50  million more going into the local economy, into the State economy.  Better yet, people are making their own decisions on how they are going  to spend it.   Just 2 months after the bill became law, Americans are already seeing  the benefits. The jobs report that was released last Friday showed over  200,000 jobs that were created just in the month of January. The report  showed--and I think this might be even more significant than job  growth--that wage growth is accelerating at the fastest rate in the  last 8 years.   People talk about stagnated wages and how they haven't had a raise or  how their dollars are not going as far. By increasing the standard  deduction and the child tax credit for middle-class families, we are  making life better for the people we represent. By making our Tax Code  more competitive, we are allowing American companies to bring home  money that had previously been left overseas.   There was a big controversy on this when we began discussing it: Are  they really going to bring their money home?   Apple announced plans to return as much as $250 billion in cash that  it had kept overseas. That is billion with a ``b.'' That move is  expected to create 20,000 new American jobs and a tax payment of $38  billion on the repatriated cash. I think that is, obviously, one of the  largest examples but also one of the best examples of an American  company.   Under our previous, outdated Tax Code, corporations were faced with a  35-percent tax if they brought their foreign earnings home. Because the  U.S. corporate rate was the highest in the developed world, American  companies often made the financial choice to leave their foreign  profits overseas, which meant that under the old system, the Federal  Treasury was frequently left to collect 35 percent of nothing because  people weren't bringing the money back. Jobs that could have been done  in America were being done elsewhere. That was a big problem. In  December we fixed it with this bill. We said that a more competitive  tax code would allow our companies to bring their money back and  provide more opportunities for Americans all across this country. That  is exactly what we are starting to see.   Today I want to highlight another part of the tax reform effort. I  thank my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Tim Scott, who  spearheaded this. He was the sponsor of the Investing in Opportunity  Act, and I was a cosponsor. This bill, which became part  [[Page S679]]  of the law in the tax reform bill, will help spur growth in  economically distressed areas. Under the bill, investors can defer  their capital gains tax if they invest in opportunity funds.   In rural areas, particularly those that have difficult economic  conditions, such as many of the areas of my State, it is hard to spur  investment, to get more people back to work, to create new  opportunities. These funds must be invested in distressed areas and  census tracts that are designated by Governors--who knows best but the  Governors where these distressed census tracts are--and create  opportunity zones. That will provide capital to help grow new  businesses and also create jobs in parts of our country that really  need them the most. If those parts of our country rise, the rest of the  country will continue to rise.   According to the Economic Innovation Group, one in six Americans  lives in an economically distressed community. These distressed areas  lost 6 percent of their jobs between the years 2011 and 2015.   The New York Times recently highlighted the benefits of the Investing  in Opportunity Act, writing that rural areas accounted for just 3  percent--only 3 percent--of the job growth in the years 2010 to 2014.  Rural communities saw more businesses close than open over that time  period.   Many West Virginia communities are continuing to suffer the  consequences of the previous administration's anti-coal policies. Their  economies could use this boost, and this is exactly what tax reform and  the Investing in Opportunity Act, in particular, will provide. Passing  tax reform fulfilled a promise that we made to the American people to  make jobs and economic growth our top priority.   Two weeks ago, the Senate fulfilled another major promise by passing  the longest extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program. In  West Virginia, approximately 22,000 children rely on CHIP for access to  their healthcare. It has been a successful program. It has been one  that really helps a lot of families, a lot of working families. Over  the years, it has helped improve the health of our State's children.  These working families deserve the long-term certainty that the CHIP  program will be there to provide access to critical services, and I am  proud we provided that certainty. I have been a strong supporter of the  CHIP program for over 20 years. I was on the conference committee in  the State house in the late nineties when we forged and implemented the  program in our State, and I have been dedicated to it ever since.   When I came to the Senate 3 years ago, in my maiden speech, I made  long-term funding for the CHIP program one of my main priorities.  Passage of this bipartisan legislation to extend it for the next 6  years was a big win for the children of this country and across West  Virginia too. Hard-working Americans are the beneficiaries of both tax  reform and the CHIP reauthorization.   I am confident the benefits will keep coming. It seems that every day  something good is happening in the American economy with businesses and  raises and bonuses and lower tax bills. People are beginning to see  this in their withholding. Struggling communities in West Virginia  welcome this. Cities and suburbs in rural areas across the country will  see greater economic growth, all because of the tax reform bill. It has  been presented to us as that. Many of the companies making  announcements are not making these announcements in a vacuum. They are  saying, very exclusively, that because of the tax reform bill that the  Congress passed and the President signed, we are able to do these  things we have been wanting to do for our employees: Give them a bonus,  put more money in their pensions, help give more charitable  contributions in the communities where they live, provide more long- term certainty.   Have no doubt, we will continue to work to add to the list of  accomplishments, and I will probably be on the Senate floor talking  about them.   I yield the floor.   I see my colleague from Indiana is here to talk about tax reform.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.
