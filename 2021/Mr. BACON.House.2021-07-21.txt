 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work and  success of Timothy J. Burke, who retired from the Omaha Public Power  District on July 2 after serving the company for 24 years. He began his  career with OPPD in 1997 as vice president and in 2015 took over as the  company's 12th President and CEO.   During his time with OPPD, Tim faced some tough challenges, but with  his tenacity and great leadership skills, he overcame them all.   Burke's tenure as CEO will be remembered as one of transition. He  made several decisions early on that set the future for OPPD. When he  became the CEO, OPPD initiated utility-wide lean financial work to make  the utility financially efficient and strong. Burke also made what he  called the most difficult decision he ever made or had been involved  with, recommending the closure of Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating  Station due to financial concerns and economies of scale at the  country's smallest nuclear plant.   In addition, under Burke, the company continued to achieve financial  stability and 5 straight years of no general rate increase--which is  amazing--which is now in its fifth year of no rate increases. Further,  Burke's time at OPPD included a transition to more renewable energy and  the commitment to be a net zero-carbon emitter by 2050.  [[Page H3765]]    Throughout his career, Burke has remained active in local and  industry organizations. His recent involvement includes the American  Public Power Association, Large Public Power Council, Nebraska Power  Association, the Business Ethics Alliance trustee, and the past chair  and executive committee of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and  United Way of the Midlands. He has also been heavily involved with  Offutt Air Force Base and STRATCOM and has served as chair of the  STRATCOM Consultation Committee. He is on the executive committee of  the Offutt Air Force Base Advisory Council, and he has been a civic  leader with the Air Force Chief of Staff and the Air Force Global  Strike Command Civic Leader program.   I had 16 assignments in the Air Force and found the local community  around Offutt to be the most supportive and welcoming of all, and Tim  embodies that patriotic welcoming spirit to the fullest.   Family is extremely important to Tim. He and his wife, Terri, have  three sons, five grandchildren, and a sixth grandbaby on the way.   Post retirement, Tim is looking forward to first spending more time  with his family and then finding ways to keep himself busy in the local  area. He has been heavily involved in the local area, and I am sure he  will continue to do so, and we need him.   On top of all of this, one of Tim's passions is music, especially  playing with his Irish pub band, the Shenanigans, with two of his sons.  Burke is an exceptional leader and a skilled communicator and has  served the Omaha area with honor and distinction.   We thank Tim for his time with OPPD and for keeping the power on for  those living in southeast Nebraska.                            ____________________
