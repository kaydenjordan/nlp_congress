 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, as we heard in the debate  today, we all agree keeping children safe and healthy is our top  priority.   For people to get back to work, parents need childcare; they need  safe options and more flexibility for the care of their children. That  is why Republicans have introduced sensible legislation that supports  all childcare providers so that we can expand access to childcare to  pre-COVID levels and beyond.   However, unlike our solution, there are problems with the majority's  underlying bill that limits parents' ability to find care.   The underlying bill won't help businesses start up new childcare  options; it won't help smaller childcare providers, often women- and  minority-owned businesses, reopen or finally accomplish their dream of  starting their own business.   As a result, this bill will prevent more providers from opening. That  is a serious problem, especially in places where shutdowns and stay- home orders force providers to permanently close. That means parents  will have nowhere to turn if new options aren't available, if they want  a smaller setting for childcare, or if large childcare centers hit caps  on enrollment.   To fix this, my motion helps a new childcare business start and  increases the number of available childcare slots for children. It  would amend the underlying text to ensure that all providers are able  to access funding, including those that have recently opened to support  working parents.   Republicans weren't provided the chance to debate adding these  provisions to the bill because the majority seems to be more interested  in scoring political points these days than actually working together  to solve problems.   Another issue they didn't address today is child safety. While we  talked about adhering to new recommended sanitation and social  distancing requirements--all critical--there was no discussion of  keeping children safe from abuse, neglect, and violence. My motion will  ensure we are focused on recognizing and addressing child abuse and  neglect.   Many of us in this Chamber have raised the alarm that the stress, the  isolation, the fear caused by COVID-19 has increased the threat of  abuse and domestic violence. The numbers are alarming.                                time  1230    This amendment to the underlying bill requires anyone receiving  funding in this program to provide an assurance that all their  employees have completed education on safety protocols and know how to  recognize child abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I am a mom of three school-aged kids, and this spring  was difficult for them and their mom and dad. I am speaking every day  with hardworking men and women who want to keep their families healthy,  who are eager to get back to work and eager to get their kids back in  school and in daycare.   There is a lot of fear about children losing an entire year of their  education if we don't get back on track. There are concerns about  parents, parents in Pend Oreille County in my district, where 14,000  people live and work in industries like mining, timber, tourism, and  healthcare. Even before coronavirus hit, there was only one childcare  provider in the entire county--just one.   While there have been less than 40 cases of coronavirus in Pend  Oreille, they have been hit hard by economic shutdowns and stay-at-home  orders. This community deserves every chance to come back stronger than  before.   For counties like Pend Oreille, and for places that have been hit  hardest by the virus, we can't afford to be limiting parents' choices.  We need to give parents more control and the ability to navigate this  new future, a future where we have the confidence to provide for our  families and the courage to dream again because our kids are safe,  healthy, and learning.   For more options in child safety, this amendment should have been  part of the underlying bill. I ask the majority to recognize that they  missed this critical issue. Now is the time to correct them.   I urge bipartisan support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
