 Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to  honor a great force in our community in Houston, Texas, in Acres Homes.  This coming Sunday, he will celebrate 90 years of age, but decades in  the ministry, Reverend Dr. F.N. Williams, whose father preceded him in  the ministry, whose sons have gone on into the ministry.   He is a pastor of the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Acres  Homes, one of the oldest churches in our State.   He is a warrior. He is a fighter for civil rights and civil justice.  He was there on the front lines when the Honorable Barbara Jordan was  elected and Mickey Leland. But even before that, he was one who would  lead the community on addressing their rights and the right to stand  against inequality.   He was a friend of President George H.W. Bush, who happened to  represent Acres Homes before we had the 18th Congressional District,  which I represent. They had a relationship. They fought against drugs  in that community.   And, as well, he believes in education. He believes in young people.  He has a church that reaches those who are in need.   So tonight, this evening, I am delighted to honor his beloved wife  and his family members, but to say to him: I salute you on your 90th  birthday. Reverend Dr. F.N. Williams, you are deserving and, yes, you  are a great American.                            ____________________
