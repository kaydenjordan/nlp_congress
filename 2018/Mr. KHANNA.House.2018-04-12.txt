 Mr. Speaker, I am here on behalf of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, and I want to just state our opposition to the  balanced budget amendment.   It is worth reviewing the history on this topic. When President Bill  Clinton left office, he left this country with surpluses. He had  reversed the policy of Reagan economics, which had some of  [[Page H3205]]  the largest structural deficits in the 1980s and during the first  President Bush's term.   And then we went from record surpluses back to deficits. And what was  the reason for those deficits? There were two very simple reasons. One,  we made a strategic mistake in Iraq and spent trillions of dollars,  which even President Trump has acknowledged was a blunder, and that  ballooned the deficit. And secondly, we made a decision to provide tax  cuts for the very wealthiest Americans.   Now, the Democrats supported the tax cut for the middle class, for  folks making $50- to $75,000, but we said you don't need to provide tax  cuts for people making $1 million, $500,000; you don't need to provide  tax cuts for those who are already paying capital gains tax rates at 20  percent and don't need additional tax breaks.   So those two decisions, the intervention overseas and our continued  interventions overseas and these extraordinary tax breaks for the very  wealthy, have led us to the deficits that we have today, have led us to  the $20 trillion debt.   No one wants that kind of debt. We don't want to see interest rates  continue to go up and crowd out private investment. We don't want to  see people's savings lose value. But the solution to that is not a  gimmick of a balanced budget amendment where the Republicans have  doubled down on more tax cuts for the very wealthy, where they haven't  stopped our interventionism abroad. We still actually have escalation  in Afghanistan, escalation in Iraq, escalation around the world, in  contradiction to what this President promised on the campaign where he  said that he would focus on developing our domestic economy and stop  the interventionism, and we just have symbolic votes for a balanced  budget amendment.   The question is how? How can you vote for extraordinary tax cuts? How  can you vote for more overseas interventionism? How can you vote for  huge spending bills and then just say you are for a balanced budget  amendment? The math just doesn't work.    And so what Democrats have said is, instead of having a balanced  budget amendment, instead of constraining our policy or economic policy  to spend more at times of war or times of recession--which, by the way,  Roosevelt did, which Woodrow Wilson did, what many of our Presidents  did--that what we ought to do is have sensible government, that we  ought to stop the foreign interventionism, we ought to repeal these tax  breaks and giveaways to the very wealthy, and instead we ought to  invest in the middle class, invest in our education, invest in our  infrastructure, invest in our schools, invest in new technology that  will grow the economy.   That is how you reduce the structural deficits. But, by the way, this  is not a theoretical debate, because Bill Clinton showed that when you  have that kind of ``people's first'' economic policy, you left this  country with surpluses, and the trickle-down Reaganomics has always  left this country with deficits.   It is not enough to just vote for balanced budget amendments while  piling on debt. A far more responsible policy would be to end the  foreign interventionism, to repeal these massive giveaways to the  wealthy, and to invest in the middle class.   That is why my colleagues and I opposed the balanced budget  amendment. That is why we have offered the Congressional Progressive  People's Budget that will lead to greater economic growth than anything  that the President has proposed, and that will also reduce our Nation's  debt.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
