 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to  speak for one minute.    Mr. President, I rise today to recommend and urge my  colleagues to vote for  Jim Bridenstine as Administrator of NASA. We  will be voting on his nomination momentarily.    Jim Bridenstine has incredible experience, an incredible resume, and  an incredible understanding of the mission before NASA. We need  somebody with a vision. We need somebody who actually has an idea of  where we should take our great space mission--somebody who has  commercial experience, somebody who has government experience, somebody  who has management experience, and, yes, somebody who has experience  within the industry itself, and that person is  Jim Bridenstine.   Jim has bipartisan support and support from the House. My fellow  colleague, Democratic Congressman Ed Perlmutter from Colorado, along  with a dozen other Democratic Members from the House of  Representatives, said that  Jim Bridenstine will be an excellent NASA  Administrator. He has the understanding, background, capability, and,  more importantly, the drive and desire to do an excellent and  outstanding job at NASA. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.   You just heard our colleague Richard Burr talk about Director  Pompeo's nomination as Secretary of State. Blind bipartisanship cannot  be the only reason that drives votes in this Chamber. Whether it is for  the Secretary of State or the Director of NASA, I urge my colleagues to  vote yes, put partisanship aside, and start moving these nominations  and doing what is right for this country. I urge my colleagues to vote  yes on  Jim Bridenstine.   I yield back my time.    Mr. President, Ambassador Ware was a true light of poise  and patriotism, strength and dignity, her presence firm and her  personality embracing, warm, and loving. Her politics she did well, but  the policy achievements delivered through her politics and philanthropy  will be her lasting legacy.   Starting at the grassroots, she began her political career in  Pennsylvania serving as a county chairperson eventually rising to chair  Governor Tom Ridge's two successful gubernatorial campaigns. In 2002,  President George Bush asked her to serve on the National Critical  Infrastructure Advisory Council, a position she held until she was  named the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Finland in 2005. She was  an outstanding diplomat and a great representative of the United  States.   I recall telling Ambassador Ware about one of my favorite duties as a  Member of Congress--the opportunity to call students to tell them they  had received an appointment to a service academy. She smiled fondly as  I told  [[Page S2316]]  my story, and then she told me her own. As ambassador, she was deeply  impressed with an officer in the U.S. military with whom she had been  working. She asked if she could call the officer's parents to express,  as ambassador, her gratitude and that of the Nation, for the  outstanding work the officer had been doing. Ambassador Ware reached  the officer's father. During the discussion, the father asked again  what the ambassador's name was and if Marilyn was the daughter of  Congressman John Ware. Ambassador Ware replied yes. The father went on  to explain how it was Congressman Ware who had given his son his  academy nomination many years before. Her story highlighted the full  circle of a family committed to public service--a cherished trait that  continues in her family today.   There are so many causes that Ambassador Ware championed, so many to  talk about: AEI, her work with sustainable clean water, caring for  children with learning disabilities at the Janus School, and the Clinic  for Special Children, and of course, The Phoenix, which you can't think  about without seeing that twinkle in her eye, along with countless  others.   She made our country a better, stronger place. Ambassador Ware will  not only be remembered by her friends and family but by those whose  lives she bettered along the way. I will miss her leadership and  guidance and will always remember the amazing work Ambassador Ware did  for our community and our country.   Ambassador Ware, and to her family, we are forever grateful.                            ____________________
