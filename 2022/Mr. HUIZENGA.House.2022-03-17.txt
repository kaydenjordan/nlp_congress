 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand a vote on H.J.  Res. 72, a Congressional Review Act resolution that would end the CDC's  mask mandate for airlines, trains, buses, and other public  transportation hubs.   Tuesday night, the Senate voted in a rare bipartisan manner to end  these mandates in what even CNN called a ``bipartisan rebuke of Biden  administration policy.''   States and cities, big and small, across the country have ended or  are in the process of ending their mask mandates at schools, basketball  games, and even crowded restaurants.   Thousands of fans will pack arenas in the coming days to cheer on  their teams during March Madness. At these games, they rightly won't be  required to wear a mask. But as soon as they step onto a plane, a bus,  a train, or even a metro, unelected bureaucrats, at the direction of  President Biden, have decreed that masks must be put on and must be  worn.   It is past time for this unscientific mask mandate to end. I am  calling on Speaker Pelosi to hold a vote on repealing this mask  mandate. Americans want their lives back, and it is time to vote.                            ____________________
