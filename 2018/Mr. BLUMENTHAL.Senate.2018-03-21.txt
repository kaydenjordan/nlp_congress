 Mr. President, I am proud to be here as a former U.S.  attorney and the chief Federal prosecutor in Connecticut.   I have been involved in law enforcement for most of my career, and I  am proud to stand here now in this Chamber, following the chairman of  the Commerce Committee, whose dedication to this cause has brought us  to the finish line, and my colleague Senator Portman, whose leadership  on this bill is invaluable.   I wish to second a number of points that have been made by Senator  Portman and Senator Thune, most especially about the very collaborative  effort involved in this bill--a bipartisan championing of a cause whose  time has come--and, particularly, about our colleague John McCain and  his wife Cindy McCain, whose energy, spirit, courage, and strength have  really been an inspiration to all of us. I also want to thank Senators  McCaskill, Heitkamp, and Cornyn, because their contributions have been  enormously valuable as well.   There is a face to human trafficking in this country. Here is one of  the faces. Desiree Robinson, whose story you just heard from Senator  Thune, is one such face. Her voice is still. Her voice could not be  heard directly, but her mother, Yvonne Ambrose, came to our committee  and talked about her  [[Page S1851]]  beautiful daughter, whose life was lost as a result of sex trafficking.  She was killed after she was raped and after she was sold. Her story  alone helped us to achieve unanimous approval in the Commerce Committee  for this bill, and I hope it will lead us to an overwhelming vote today  on the bill before us.   I hope, as well, that it will lead us to defeat amendments that  would, in effect, kill this bill--amendments that may be well  intentioned, but, in fact, have an effect contrary to their stated  purpose.   This bill is completely bipartisan from beginning to end. It is the  result of tireless work of advocates, sex trafficking survivors, and a  bipartisan coalition of our colleagues. It now has 68 cosponsors. Its  companion legislation passed in the House 388 to 25.   It is the product of stakeholder consensus. It has the support of  every major human trafficking organization, every major law enforcement  group, and every part of the tech community--if not unanimous, at least  of many of its leaders.   This bill would clarify section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act, which was never intended to give websites a free pass to aid and  abet sex trafficking. It was never intended to immunize completely  those websites so they could knowingly facilitate sex trafficking.  Those words are in the bill--``knowingly facilitate.''   The purpose of our measure, very simply, is to give survivors their  day in court. Right now, the courtroom doors are barred to them, as a  recent court of appeals opinion remarked, outrageously so. It would  also open avenues of prosecution to law enforcement where they are  currently roadblocked.   My experience combating sex trafficking at the State level led me to  colaunch and cochair the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking with  Senator Portman, seeking to find solutions to this problem. As a State  prosecutor, I was told that I could not pursue actions again craigslist  or other sites nearly a decade ago because of that section and the  interpretation.   Clearly, the websites that facilitate this, knowingly encouraging and  profiting from sex trafficking, must face repercussions in the  courtroom. For law enforcement to succeed in combating sex trafficking,  there have to be consequences. The National Center for Missing &  Exploited Children reported an 840-percent increase in reports of  suspected child and sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015 alone. It found  that spike ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet  to sell children for sex.''   Those numbers fail to tell the full story. In fact, this picture is  worth a thousand words. This picture of Desiree shows her as a young  girl, smiling. In fact, her mom told us that her smile could light up a  room. She was a successful student who dreamed of becoming a physician  in the Air Force.   When she was in high school, a series of men reached out to her on  social media. They pressured and manipulated her into letting them sell  her for sex and then advertise her on backpage.com. Her mom, Yvonne,  told us what happened next:         On December 23, 2016, a 32-year-old man by the name of       Antonio Rosales was looking through Backpage.com for a child       to have sex with, just like countless others before him. . .       . He knew Backpage.com was a site to go to in order to find       young underaged girls to have sex with. During his search, he       came upon a picture of my 16-year-old daughter under the       posting, ``New girl in town looking to have fun,'' which was       posted by her pimp. Desiree was driven to Antonio's residence       by the pimp with the intent of having sex with this 32-year-      old man, a man twice her age.        This was the last night of my daughter's life. . . . On       Christmas Eve, December 24, 2016, Desiree, my baby, was       brutally murdered, and now my life has changed forever. She       had been beaten, raped, strangled, and if that wasn't bad       enough, he slit her throat, all because she said, no, she       didn't want to do this again. She screamed for help, and       there was no one around to help her.    Yvonne Ambrose had the courage to come testify before us, and I have  repeated this part of her testimony not because it is ennobling or  pleasant, but because it is the hard, ugly truth about sex trafficking.  It is the reason that we must pass this measure. It is also the reason  why we need to defeat the amendments that would send this measure back  to the House and its possible demise.   Every one of the groups I mentioned earlier, including Desiree's  lawyer, have urged us to defeat these amendments. I will read just one  or two sentences from a letter that I received today from Desiree's  lawyer about the so-called moderation amendment:         At first glance, it appears that the Moderation Amendment       is disguising itself as a good Samaritan amendment. However,       in a nutshell, its effect is a really bad faith Samaritan       immunity.    This measure is narrowly tailored. It would ensure that State and  local law enforcement can join the fight against these criminal  websites. It provides survivors a right of action that would not only  be a source of relief for them but also a means of remedy. The Good  Samaritan amendment, unfortunately--perhaps, unintentionally--would  simply protect the websites.   The people who complain and take action certainly deserve protection.  It is in the current law. One of the reasons why we want to defeat this  amendment is that it would probably have unintended consequences in  protecting websites that identify sex trafficking ads and then leave  them up in order to continue profiting from them.   I think the letter from the attorney for Desiree Robinson's estate,  Gina DeBoni, objecting to this amendment is a powerful reminder that we  need to stick to what we have and what we know will work.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Senator Blumenthal: At first glance, it appears that the       Moderation Amendment is disguising itself as a good Samaritan       amendment. However, in a nutshell, its effect is really a bad       faith Samaritan immunity.        Not only does the amendment strip the ``good faith''       requirement (that is already accounted for in the current       CDA), it creates a new and very expansive immunity for       companies charged with all crimes--not just sex trafficking.       This is in sharp contrast to CDA's original intent and does       nothing but immunize bad actors.        I significantly limits evidence that could be used in any       federal criminal action against a website. Because almost       every company uses some form of moderation system, the       immunity would apply in every case brought under Section 230       going forward.        The CDA has already been crafted to provide immunity to       those that are truly using good faith in their screening.       This amendment undoes that and instead, creates a new bar to       liability.        Moreover, it does not make sense in the real world and has       the potential to create devastating consequences. As you       know, we represent Yvonne Ambrose, the mother of Desiree       Robinson, who was just 16 years old when she was murdered on       Christmas Eve 2016. Desiree was not much different than any       other 16 year old girl. She was loved by all, and had dreams       like all. Like all children, Desiree was vulnerable. It did       not take long for her to fall victim to a man who preyed upon       her and sold her for a finder's fee to her pimp, Joseph       Hazely. Hazely sold Desiree for sex on Backpage.com to       Antonio Rosales--her killer. Desiree's case has both a       criminal and civil component--Desiree's traffickers and       killer have been charged criminally and are awaiting trial.       We are pursuing a civil wrongful death action against all       that played a part in her death, including Backpage.com.        You heard from Yvonne who testified before the Senate       Commerce Committee. There is no better advocate for the       passage of SESTA than a mother who lost her child. Desiree       represents hundreds of 1000s of children who are knowingly       trafficked on Backpage.com. The proposed Wyden amendment cuts       Desiree's claim off at its knees, giving bad actors, who are       not acting in good faith, a way out--giving them a clearly       defined immunity to hang their hat on. It is such a drastic       departure from that of the Good Samaritan, taking good faith       out of the equation entirely. It will create an       insurmountable challenge for lawyers who are fighting on       behalf of victims of sex trafficking, not to mention, any       victims of any other crime, whether criminal or civil,       brought under Section 230.        In practical application, in a case such as Desiree       Robinson, this is how it plays out:        We know that Backpage makes an effort to identify and flag       ads that are objectionable through its strip word feature. It       then affirmatively edits ad that it knows are selling       children for sex on its website. Under this amendment, even       though Backpage knowingly facilitated trafficking of children       when it edited the ads, it would be immunized because it took       steps to identify this content, even though it didn't remove       it. Surely, immunizing bad actors such as Backpage cannot be       the intent of this Congress and all the co-sponsors of this       bill.        We know from the Senate report and information obtained via       our subpoena to Co-Star Group that Backpage's moderation is       relevant and intrinsically connected to their knowing       facilitation of sex trafficking. This  [[Page S1852]]       amendment removes the consideration of the direct evidence of       criminal activity because the amendment broadly excludes all       evidence of this nature. In fact, it broadly excludes this       type of evidence for ALL civil and criminal matters       regardless of the type of crime.        Companies such as Facebook, etc, that have the largest risk       or burden are supportive of the SESTA language as is. This       amendment is not geared towards good actors but rather       companies that are not acting in good faith. The Commerce       Committee report clearly provides for good faith moderation--      ``an ICS would not have their good faith efforts to restrict       access to objectionable content used against them.'' Good       faith moderation is already protected by the CDA and the       passage of SESTA does not negate that.        For the above reasons, we respectfully encourage Senator       Blumenthal to vote NO on the Wyden Amendment. I am available       any time this weekend or on Monday to discuss further.        Thank you for your consideration.            Regards,      Gina Arquilla DeBoni,        Attorney for the Estate of Desiree Robinson Managing       Attorney, Romanucci & Blandin LLC.     Finally, there is a funding amendment that has been  offered. While well-intentioned, it would, in effect, derail this  legislation. It would provide money through Attorney General Sessions  to investigate and prosecute websites that criminally facilitate human  trafficking.   This amendment, too, is opposed by law enforcement agencies.  Yesterday, I put their letters into the Record. Every major law  enforcement representative agency opposes it because ``the funding  amendment is a poison pill that is dead on arrival if sent back to the  House.''   I will conclude simply by saying that I believe this measure  accomplishes some powerfully important purposes. It would not  criminalize the so-called harm reduction communication--information  designed to ensure that women and men wrapped up in commercial sex  trade can avoid violence, prevent HIV, and access community and support  services.   H.R. 1865 was not designed to target websites that spread harm  reduction information, and the language of the bill makes that clear.  The purpose of this bill is much more narrowly focused: A website user  or operator must intend to facilitate prostitution. If their goal is to  save lives by providing lifesaving information, they have not violated  the law.   Finally, I want to make absolutely clear, this legislation is not  intended to prejudice the rights of anyone who has been victimized by a  crime online other than sex trafficking. For example, I disagree with  the courts that have held that the Communications Decency Act immunizes  online firearm sales--like Armslist--for facilitating illegal gun  sales. While this legislation does not address those cases, nobody  should infer that Congress believes they were rightly decided.    Again, my thanks to all of my colleagues and most especially to  Senator Portman for his hard work, his leadership, and his courage in  tackling this tough problem, which should bring all of us together.  Making SESTA the law of the land will help save lives. It will spare  others the fate of Desiree Robinson. It will make sure that more  parents see justice, that survivors have their day in court, and that  law enforcement has the right to pursue these wrongdoers.   Mr. President, I yield back to Senator Portman.    Mr. President, I say thank you to my colleague  Senator Portman for his hard work. When we began this legislation, no  one gave us a chance because of the entrenched and powerful interests  against us. This measure will unlock the courthouse doors to survivors  and to law enforcement who can stop sex trafficking--a scourge, modern- day slavery in this country. I thank so many of my colleagues for  cosponsoring it and for helping to lead this effort that will make a  difference in the lives of countless young girls and women and men who  are victims and survivors.
