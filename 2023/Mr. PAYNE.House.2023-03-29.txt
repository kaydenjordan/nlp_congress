 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of the Benevolent Protective Order of Reindeer.   This organization is one of New Jersey's oldest African-American  fraternal organizations. It was founded in 1923 in response to the  prejudice in other animal lodges.   Early organizations named after animals would not let African  Americans become members, so the Benevolent Protective Order of  Reindeer was formed and invited everyone to join.   Today, the organization's principles of service, unity, and charity  are represented in its exceptional social work. In addition, it  provides scholarships for worthy students and engages in community  activism to fight for social justice.   The Benevolent Protective Order of Reindeer is an outstanding  organization in my district, and I am proud to celebrate its 100th  anniversary on the House floor today.                            ____________________
