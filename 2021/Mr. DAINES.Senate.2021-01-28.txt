 Mr. President, tomorrow is the 48th annual March for  Life. Although this year's march will primarily be virtual, the  importance of standing together to protect the unborn, the most  vulnerable, and all life, is as important now as it has ever been.   Forty-eight years ago, our country started down a dark path. Forty- eight years ago, the Supreme Court tragically ruled in Roe v. Wade, and  since then, we have lost the lives of 62 million people--62 million and  counting--unborn babies, precious lives, by abortion.   I believe every human being is born with God-given dignity and  potential. No court, no legislature, no law can take that away.  Nevertheless, today, babies with Down syndrome are the most endangered  on Earth.   For me, this is very personal. Just under 3 years ago, our world was  blessed with a sweet baby boy named Andrew. He has Down's. His parents  are very close friends. Andrew is a true joy, and his family celebrates  his life every single day. Our world truly would not be the same  without him.   But in the United States, 67 percent--67 percent--of babies diagnosed  with Down syndrome are aborted, two out of three. For every person with  Down syndrome alive today that you know or you meet--our friends, our  family members, loved ones--two more are gone from this world because  of abortion. This is chilling.   In Europe, the numbers are even worse. In fact, in Iceland, because  of abortion, the population of individuals with Down syndrome is  virtually being eradicated. As prenatal screenings increase in  availability, mothers frequently learn before birth if their baby has  Down syndrome. Rather than giving supportive resources, these  vulnerable moms are often pressured to abort the baby. We all too often  hear of a false compassion that it would be better for unborn babies  with Down Syndrome or other disabilities to not be brought into this  world rather than live a life that might be different from other  children. But that is not who we are as Americans.   I am deeply concerned that for babies born with Down syndrome,  abortion has become ``a tool of modern day eugenics,'' as Supreme Court  Justice Clarence Thomas has said. It pains me to think about it.   But we can't just think about this pain and the pain that it causes.  We have to do something. We have to protect those precious lives at all  costs. It is the duty of this body to end this injustice. That is why I  am joining my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, in introducing  the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, which will prohibit  abortions that are sought because of a diagnosis that an unborn child  has or may have Down syndrome.   This effort has the overwhelming support of the American public. In  fact, just yesterday, a new Knights of Columbus-Marist poll found that  70 percent of Americans oppose aborting a child on the basis that the  child will be born with Down syndrome--70 percent. In fact, that  includes over half of those who identify as pro-choice.   This issue also sadly exposes a terrible hypocrisy we are seeing  among supporters of abortion on demand. In fact, today, most  Republicans and Democrats here in Congress are unified in their support  for the Special Olympics and for protecting individuals with  disabilities. Yet many of my colleagues across the aisle will oppose  this commonsense legislation to stop the most lethal kind of  discrimination imaginable, and that is being singled out and brutally  killed because of a Down syndrome diagnosis. It is shameful.   As Henry Hyde famously said: ``The promise of America is not just for  the privileged, the planned and the perfect.''   It is our duty to protect every innocent life, no matter how small,  no matter how many chromosomes they may have.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Dale Hankins of Chouteau County for volunteering countless  hours to support his fellow veterans.   When Dale was 10 years old, a friend of his father, a WWII vet,  carried a diamond willow cane. Dale was so intrigued by the way the  diamonds stood out, he couldn't take his eyes off of it. At the age of  17, he made his first attempt at carving a cane, and soon realized and  appreciated the effort it took to create such beautiful craftsmanship.  By the time he finished, his hands were so full of blisters he decided  to pursue other hobbies.   Dale later joined the U.S. Army and served in Charlie Company, 160th  Special Operations Aviation Regiment, as an airborne infantry soldier.  After receiving his honorable discharge, he returned to Montana and  joined the Montana Army National Guard. Having a  [[Page S195]]  renewed appreciation for the sacrifices veterans give, he picked up his  hobby again in 2007 and began making diamond willow canes for disabled  veterans. Each one is unique and personalized for the veteran, and an  American flag is included on the handle of each cane.   Dale hasn't stopped since. He invests 80 hours or more to make each  cane beautiful and durable, all at no cost to the veteran. Veterans  across the Nation from Florida to Washington are proudly using his gift  which has aided in their quality of life.   It is my honor to recognize Dale for his efforts to support and  appreciate our heroes for the sacrifices they have made for our great  Nation. The compassion and commitment of these extraordinary veterans  are an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
