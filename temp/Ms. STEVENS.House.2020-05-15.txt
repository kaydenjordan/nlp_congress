 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the activity of the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, as we work through  extraordinary circumstances to deliver for the American people.   The Science Committee, under the leadership of Chairwoman Johnson and  Ranking Member Lucas, has been holding briefings on topics such as  infrastructure, energy jobs, vaccine developments, through the great  technologies available to us over the worldwide web. Each has been  bipartisan.   One important focus has been our domestic manufacturing role,  retooling production lines to make the medical supplies needed to  respond to the ongoing health crisis. This has been of particular  importance for the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, which I  chair, along with Ranking Member Baird.   How do we open platforms and utilize digital technologies for  industrial collaboration to solve big problems and streamline our  supply chain to get the medical supplies to those who need them now?   The Science Committee will continue to do the work it has always done  to meet the needs of the American people, to propel American  manufacturing innovation forward.   I urge my colleagues to support this fabulous resolution that will  enable us to continue to do our work under great and trying  circumstances.
