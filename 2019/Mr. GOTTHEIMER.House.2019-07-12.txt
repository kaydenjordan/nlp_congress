 Madam Speaker, we are here today to have the backs of  our first responders, especially those who stood up to terrorists that  morning and ran directly into the burning buildings on 9/11 and stayed  for the weeks and months that followed. They are our heroes, and they  need our help.   Hundreds of New Jersey and New York law enforcement, firefighters,  EMTs, and others answered the call and rushed toward the pile as others  ran out.   If you ask how they were able to summon the courage, they will tell  you they were simply doing their job that day. And Congress now has the  opportunity to do ours.   Too many first responders are still suffering from illnesses and  cancers from 9/11 exposure to toxins, smoke, debris, including too many  people who are still suffering in my district.   Congress set up the Victim Compensation Fund to help cover 9/11  injuries and medical expenses. Those who were exposed back in 2011 are,  sadly, first developing symptoms now.   More than 47,000 claims have been filed with the fund, and more than  11,000 district claims are expected by 2020, when the fund is set to  expire. We must act today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the  bipartisan H.R. 1327, Never Forget the Heroes.   I thank Chairman Nadler, Representative Carolyn Maloney, and  Representative Peter King for their leadership and the Problem Solvers  Caucus for strongly supporting it.   We have an obligation to do everything we can to stand by our first  responders and survivors of those horrific attacks.
