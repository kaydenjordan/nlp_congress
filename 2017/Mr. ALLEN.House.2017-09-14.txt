 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Monday next and that  the order of the House of January 3, 2017, regarding morning-hour  debate not apply on that day.    Mr. Speaker, this week, Hurricane Irma brought devastation  to south Florida and many parts of the Southeastern United States,  including the 12th District of Georgia.   In times of disaster, Americans come together and show their love and  support for one another, and I thank all of our first responders, law  enforcement, our military, and Good Samaritans for their extraordinary  service in this time of need. Your selflessness saved countless lives  in this unprecedented storm.   I thank Governor Deal, President Trump, and FEMA, and all 19 counties  in the 12th District of Georgia that were included in the Federal  emergency declaration authorizing FEMA to provide direct Federal  resources to our district.   Visit disasterassistance.gov to learn about the options available to  you. It is the greatest honor of my life to represent the people of  Georgia's 12th Congressional District, and my office is here to help in  any way we can. If you need any help in the aftermath of Hurricane  Irma, please do not hesitate to reach out. America is resilient.   The American people are resilient when we come together as one, and  now we must assess the damage and help each other rebuild our  communities.                            ____________________
