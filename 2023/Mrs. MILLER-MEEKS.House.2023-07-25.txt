 Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans will  introduce H.R. 4366, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, to fully fund our Department  of Veterans Affairs.   As a 24-year Army veteran and chairwoman of the Veterans' Affairs  Subcommittee on Health, I understand how crucial it is to have a fully  funded VA Department. These appropriations bills will ensure that the  VA has the resources needed to continue their vital operations.   Current armed services members will also see a more than $17 billion  investment that will go entirely toward improving the quality of life  in their barracks and family housing.   These commonsense policies will help improve the VA and the military  as a whole, and I urge all of my colleagues to support them.                               Lead by Example     Mr. Speaker, Iowans are experiencing one of the  hottest summers in history. In weather  [[Page H3901]]  like this, ensuring your home stays cool and comfortable is top of mind  for many, but it is also lifesaving.   Unfortunately for us, the Biden administration is telling Americans  that their thermostats should be at 78 degrees when they are home  during the day and even higher when sleeping. How can anyone be  comfortable in their home with the thermostat set so high?   That is why I, along with my good friend Senator Ernst, introduced  the Lead by Example Act. This bill would require the Department of  Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency office buildings to be  set to the Department of Energy's recommendation of at least 78  degrees, to set their thermostat where they are recommending it be set  for you.   Currently, with so many DOE officials working from home, taxpayers  are paying to cool empty office buildings. Once again, do as I say, not  as I do.   It is outrageous that Biden's executive agencies are the exception to  the rule, yet the Department of Energy is urging hardworking Americans  to change their lifestyles without any consideration for varying  climates or health concerns. That is why I am proud to join Senator  Ernst on the Lead by Example Act, and I encourage all of my colleagues  to support it.                                time  1215     Honoring the Life and Memory of Former Hawkeye Football Player Cody                                    Ince     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of former Hawkeye football player Cody Ince, who passed away  unexpectedly at the age of 23.   Before Cody became a Hawkeye, he grew up in Wisconsin playing  football and he graduated from Unity High School in Balsam Lake. In  2018, Cody came to Iowa City to be an offensive lineman for Hawkeye  football and helped the team earn a winning record all three seasons he  played.   Cody also received the All-Big Ten honorable mention in 2020, an  honor given to standout players for their accomplishments on the field.  After graduating in 2022, Cody moved back to Wisconsin and got engaged  to his fiancee, Olivia, where they were preparing to start their life  together before his sudden passing.   My prayers go out to Olivia and his parents Tammy and Marty. I cannot  imagine the pain of losing a child. I will continue to pray for their  family in this time of mourning.                       Congratulations to Annelise Bell     Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to congratulate  Annelise Bell, a student at Pella Christian High School on her recent  Team USA placement at the world championships. She placed second among  the Female Solo Junior 1 Division at the International Dance  Organization's World Acrobatic Dance Championships in Mexico this past  week.   The International Dance Organization is a nonprofit dance federation  with over 90 member nations representing dancers from all continents.  Annelise is such a talented young lady. I thank her for representing  the United States and Iowa well.   Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy anniversary to my district representative  John Kaufmann and his wife Rachel on their second wedding anniversary  on July 31. Happy anniversary, John and Rachel.   Happy 40th wedding anniversary to my very good friends Kurt and Kathy  Haller on August 13.   Happy 44th wedding anniversary to Mary and Kirk Ferentz this August.   I especially wish a very happy 40th anniversary on September 4 to my  husband, Curt.
