 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Is this Groundhog Day, Madam Speaker? Back again once more to debate  a rule for bills that were considered and failed to make it to the  floor.   You can't make this stuff up.   So what changed? Not the bill text, not the fact that we have less  than a week before the government shuts down. Maybe the minds of a few  of our colleagues across the aisle? I guess we will see later today.   Look, none of my remarks are directed to the gentleman from Oklahoma.  I respect him personally and professionally. I think the world of him.  I don't envy the task he has of trying to defend these bills or this  process, but what the hell is going on in his Conference?   The truth is that under Speaker McCarthy's weak leadership, this  Republican majority is a total failure; an unmitigated disaster.   Those aren't even my words. That is what one of your own Members said  on TV a few nights ago about the process playing out in this Chamber  right now.   First, we have this absurd nonbinding resolution condemning the  Governor of New Mexico for trying to keep her constituents safe from  gun violence.   Just to explain to folks who may be watching, this resolution does  nothing--not a thing.   It is a press release. It doesn't go to the Senate. It doesn't go to  the President. It does nothing.   So we are doing that, and we are doing nothing right now to avert a  government shutdown. This place is becoming a Chamber where we debate  trivial issues passionately and important ones not at all.   Then we have a ridiculous bill about liquified natural gas. The House  has already passed this bill not once, but twice. Of course, it makes  sense to waste more time passing it again when a shutdown is looming  and Republicans have no plan to keep the government running, right?   This rule will also bring to the floor the Republicans' Department of  Defense appropriations bill. Yes, this bill  [[Page H4445]]  has horrible, harmful policy riders that strip people's rights and push  MAGA culture wars. It also reaffirms the Pentagon's bloated budget at a  time when the far-right wing nuts are holding up all other  appropriation bills because they feel they don't cut enough money for  programs that help everyday Americans. We still don't have a plan to  fund the government.   Madam Speaker, I know if some of my Republican colleagues had their  way, we would pass their continuing resolution that contains mindless,  across-the-board spending cuts.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to cut funding for  cancer research, for our Head Start programs, for air traffic safety,  for border security, and a 65-percent cut to heating assistance for  families just as it is starting to get cold. Talk about cruel.   Now, these cuts aren't just cuts, they cost us. Do people realize  what Head Start does? It invests in kids from low-income families so  they can have more opportunity in life. The return on investment is  almost $10 for every $1 spent.   Cancer research. Do Republicans realize that investing in cancer  research saves us healthcare costs not just now but down the road, and  it saves lives.   Their appropriation agenda cuts all this and more.   Madam Speaker, you know where Republicans refuse to cut from? This  bill, the Pentagon, the biggest, most expensive bureaucracy in our  Federal Government: the Department of Defense.   So for whatever reason, it is okay to cut programs like WIC that help  feed pregnant moms, but they can't find a single weapon system where  there is any waste? I am happy to provide numerous articles and reports  from my colleagues about the cost overruns in so many of these wasteful  missile systems.   The Defense spending bill, which is the most extravagant Defense  spending bill ever, failed a rule vote on Tuesday because the  Republican Conference is in absolute chaos. Best I can tell, no one on  the other side of the aisle has any objection to the top-line number in  the Pentagon bill, but yet they voted down the rule just the other day.   I know that whipping votes can be difficult, but the number of  backroom secret deals and late-night seances Republicans have had to  hold this year to revive bills from the dead is astounding, and I am  afraid things will only get worse as we near September 30.   Republicans are acting like the end of the fiscal year just snuck up  on them.   News flash: The deadline to fund the government isn't some big  secret. They have had months to prevent a government shutdown. The  reality is that not once--not once--have Republicans given us a bill  that could keep the government open.   Republicans barely control one-half of one branch of government. Yet,  they act like they are king of the hill, like it is their way or the  highway, that nothing else matters.    The only way this slim House Republican majority can keep the lights  on is if they get Senate Democrats and the President to agree, but they  haven't even begun to reach across the aisle to negotiate because they  are busy negotiating amongst themselves.   Hell, at this rate, they might not even be able to get Senate  Republicans to agree given how extreme their Conference has become.   Madam Speaker, this majority is a failure. The clowns are running the  circus. The day Speaker McCarthy handed his gavel over to the clown  show, this was the inevitable outcome. There is a different path that  we can choose right here and right now: Work with Democrats to prevent  a shutdown; work with us to keep the government open; work with us to  honor the deal you made earlier this year.   It is time for the ringmaster of this circus, Kevin McCarthy, to  stand up to the clowns and say enough with the extremism and the  blackmail. Stop wasting time and work with us to get this done in a  bipartisan way.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Before I yield to my next speaker, I want to clarify for the record  because I don't want to be misunderstood or mischaracterized because I  have great respect for the gentleman. I never said the Defense  appropriations bill was trivial. I said the Defense appropriations bill  was bloated and filled with the kitchen sink of MAGA culture wars.   On the second bill, the LNG bill, I said it was repetitive because we  have passed it twice already. It is going nowhere. We are going to pass  it a third time, and that is going nowhere at a time when our  government is about to shut down. To take up a bill that is repetitive  and that is going nowhere seems like not a good use of our time.   I did say that the nonbinding resolution on guns was trivial because  it doesn't do a damn thing. We are living in a country where we have  massacres occur on a regular basis, and we can't get any legislation to  the floor. The only bill we get to the floor on guns is a nonbinding  resolution that does nothing and that doesn't even go anywhere. It  doesn't go to the Senate. It doesn't go to the President.   I want to be clear on what I said because I think it is important. I  do believe that this bill, this nonbinding resolution, is an example of  how trivial issues get debated passionately here and important ones not  at all.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Boyle), the ranking member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, the concern we have over here on this side  of the aisle is that there are Members on the Republican side who seem  to be cheering on a shutdown.   The other day, in an interview with ``PBS NewsHour,'' a fellow  colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. Norman of South Carolina, was  asked how likely a shutdown is, and his response was: It is 100  percent.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a Truth  Social post from yesterday by Donald Trump opposing the GOP's  continuing resolution.    Mr. Speaker, the twice-impeached, four-times-indicted  former President is weighing in on the funding fights within his party,  and ultimately he is endorsing actions that will shut down the  government.   Now, I have a strange feeling my Republican counterparts will gladly  comply at the expense of the American people because everybody on that  side of the aisle is so frightened of him.   The gentleman from Oklahoma was talking about a shutdown in 2018. I  don't disagree with my friend that there was a brief shutdown in early  2018 that a lot of people don't remember because it was so short. I  should point out that Republicans were in charge of the House and in  charge of the Senate at the time. I know some Democrats were pushing to  help Dreamers as part of a funding deal, but that brief, symbolic  shutdown lasted less than 72 hours, mostly over the weekend and, if I  remember correctly, had no lasting impact.   Now, compare that to the 5-week Republican shutdown in 2018 which  reduced economic output by $11 billion in the following 2 quarters,  including $3 billion that the United States economy never regained.  That was a partial shutdown. Then the 2013 full Republican shutdown  reduced GDP growth by $20 billion, according to Moody's Analytics. $20  billion. I think it is a little more than unfair to play both sides of  the card here, because it doesn't apply.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim that they are trying to save money but  continually weaken the United States Government's creditworthiness at a  cost to the United States taxpayers.   In August, Fitch cited a decline in governance as a key reason for  the United States' downgrade due to repeated battles over the past two  decades that have led to government shutdowns or even taken the  government to the brink of a debt default. Republicans need to get  serious about governing and protect the United States'  creditworthiness.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from the AP titled: ``The U.S. government's debt has been  downgraded. Here's what to know.''    Mr. Speaker, there are consequences to these games that  people on the right are playing, and the consequences are detrimental  to our economy, which in turn are detrimental to the American people.   The gentleman from Oklahoma also talked about the Senate. I wish we  were behaving more like the Senate than behaving like we are here in  the House.   In the Senate, the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator  Murray, is actually working with the Republican Vice Chair, Senator  Collins. There is a statement from Senator Murray saying: ``Vice Chair  Collins and I have discussed how best to address these concerns, and we  have agreed to make use of additional emergency appropriations--just as  we do every year, and is fully allowed under the debt ceiling deal--to  address in a bipartisan way some of the pressing challenges our Nation  faces.   ``In order to take these concerns regarding our defense and  nondefense needs seriously, and to ensure we deliver the strongest  bills possible with the broadest bipartisan support possible, Vice  Chair Collins''--a Republican--``and I agreed to add $13.7 billion in  additional emergency appropriations, including $8 billion for defense,  and $5.7 billion for nondefense spread across four subcommittees,  including the State/Foreign Ops bill we are considering today.''   This is in response to that.   The bottom line is what they are doing in the Senate is what we  should be doing here. Even though Democrats control the Senate, they  are sitting down with Republicans and they are having conversations.  They are trying to come to deals. They are trying to not only get a  short-term bill done to keep our government from shutting down, they  are trying to figure out a long-term way forward.   The Senate has used the Fiscal Responsibility Act as a starting point  for meaningful bipartisan dialogue and compromise. They reached an  agreement to stay within the 1 percent of the Fiscal Responsibility Act  and collaborated to report out 12 bills with near bipartisan unanimity.   Meanwhile, House Republicans haven't taken a single meaningful step  to engage Democrats on necessary compromise. They failed to garner a  single Democratic vote for their bills in committee and haven't been  able to bring two of their bills to the full committee for  consideration because the cuts were too deep.   Even moderates on your side don't want to vote for those things.   This is about the Senate following a bipartisan, collaborative  process versus House Republicans turning their backs on that process  and negotiating amongst themselves to make their bills more partisan.   There is a way to do this, but, unfortunately, you have a small group  of the most extreme of the extreme calling all the shots. They are  moving this place in the wrong direction. These are the people cheering  for a government shutdown. These are the people who don't care how much  they hurt the American people with across-the-board, mindless cuts in  programs like Head Start and WIC and medical research and LIHEAP,  cutting it by 65 percent.   I come from a State up north, Massachusetts. Tell my constituents,  who depend on LIHEAP to heat their homes, the thinking behind gutting  LIHEAP by 65 percent.   Talk about cruel. There are consequences to your actions. There are  consequences to your words, the downgrading of our credit. If you  succeed in getting some of these cuts, people are going to lose  benefits that they not only rely on to do things like heat their homes,  they need them to survive.   Enough of the nonsense. Let's come together and let's stop wasting  time bringing another extreme CR to the House Rules Committee to bring  on this floor that makes the crummy bill you brought the other night  look like it is reasonable. Come on. We are running out of time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am not going to engage in the frivolous part of what this rule  provides. I think Mr. Cole and I were having a serious debate about  things that really matter here in terms of our economy and whether or  not we can fund our government. I am not going to waste time talking  about a nonbinding resolution that is nothing more than a press  release.    Mr. Speaker, let's be honest with each other. We are only a few days  away from a shutdown, and we are in chaos because the Republican Party  is in the middle of a civil war. That is just a fact.   Speaker McCarthy cut a deal on spending levels back in May. That is  what the Senate has acted on in a bipartisan way. The only people not  holding up the bargain are House Republicans.   Speaker McCarthy is breaking his word, and I get it. I mean, he  handed over the gavel to the most extreme in his party. He put the  patients in charge of the hospital, and now he is getting blackmailed.  Good luck to him getting out of the mess that he has made.   The American people deserve better, and they deserve to know that  there is a difference here, a very clear difference. We may not always  agree on every single issue, but Democrats come to this place every  single day and we worry. We worry about making sure that people get  better jobs. We worry because we want people to have better healthcare  and we want people to have higher wages. We worry because we  [[Page H4450]]  want to make sure that people have clean air and water and great  schools where we know our kids will make it home from school that day,  they will be safe, and we want to make sure that everybody has access  to affordable housing.   Republicans worry, too, but it seems that this Republican majority  worries mostly about their own power. They worry about fighting with  each other, trying to shut down the government, impeach the President,  and remove their own Speaker.   The Republican majority in this House is a joke. They wasted weeks  talking about gas stoves, weeks arguing about book bans, weeks telling  kids what soccer team they can play on, and now we are on the eve of a  shutdown and they are doing nothing to stop it. In fact, they are  moving in the wrong direction.   We have Members on the other side of the aisle who go on network news  and say ``shut it down,'' telling people that it is 100 percent certain  that there will be a government shutdown. Who cares, they say.   Really?   Earlier, I talked about a seance. After looking at what is happening  on the other side of the aisle, I think what this place needs is an  exorcism. The Republican Party has gone to war with itself, and it  doesn't matter which side wins because either way, they are not worried  about anybody but themselves.   This is a serious consequential moment for this Congress. There are  real impacts if there is a government shutdown. There are impacts to  our credit rating. There are impacts to job creation. There are impacts  to a whole bunch of things. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, there are  negative impacts for the people of this country. We have seen this  movie before. It doesn't have a good ending.   In these last few days that we have, rather than fighting amongst  yourselves, why don't you try something radical, and that is sitting  down in a bipartisan way and coming to a deal that will get a majority  of votes in this House. It requires the Speaker of the House to stand  up to the extremists. It requires him to demonstrate some leadership.  That is what is needed.   The Speaker of the House must lead. It is the obligation of everybody  in this Chamber to, at a minimum, keep the lights on. This is the  moment where we need some leadership, where the Speaker needs to stand  up and tell the extremists no.   I said before, it is like the clowns are running the circus, and  there is no ringmaster. Enough of this. This is a bad movie.   By the way, it is not just Democrats who are expressing concern about  what is going on, and it is not just independents as well that are  expressing concern, but I hear it from Members of their own Conference  who have been on TV basically sounding the alarm bells saying, this is  dysfunction, this is an unmitigated disaster. These are the words of  Republican Members who are warning your leadership to get their act  together.   We will see how things work out this weekend, but if the reports that  we are reading are true, we are going to see a CR come to the Rules  Committee that is even more extreme than the extreme CR that we dealt  with and that was pulled the other day.                                time  1015     I mean, at the end of the day, I think people need to  know that, when you cut some of these programs, when you cut LIHEAP,  that means there are people who will not be able to heat their homes in  the wintertime.   When you cut Head Start, that means there are countless kids who will  not have an opportunity to succeed in the future.   When you cut programs like WIC, it means that there are pregnant  mothers and newborn babies that will not have access to good nutrition.   When you cut medical research, you are not only putting farther off  the day where we find a cure to some of these dreaded diseases that  kill people, but you are also making it certain that the costs of  healthcare will continue to rise.   None of this makes any sense. I know that there are adults on the  other side of the aisle that want to do the right thing. Again, I plead  with my colleagues. We will go through this, whatever we are going to  do, a bill that is nonbinding that means nothing, an LNG bill that we  have done twice before that is going nowhere fast, and then we will do  this Defense appropriations bill, again, that represents the kitchen  sink of MAGA culture wars.   We will go through all of that, but, while we are doing that, I hope  that people are sitting down and getting serious to avoid a government  shutdown, and then let's get together and do what the American people  elected us to do.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
