 Mr. Speaker, this is not a crisis caused by a specific  industry or weak economy. This is a voluntary shutdown of our economy  in order to save lives. As a result, our government needs to support  the families and businesses that are directly feeling the pain of this  national emergency.   The CARES Act will buy the needed resources for our hospitals and  healthcare providers to safely care for the sick, ensure that  hardworking Americans receive income and increased unemployment  benefits during the crisis, extend emergency loans to small businesses  which are forgivable for retaining their employees during this crisis,  and establish a stabilization fund for other stressed businesses and to  maintain liquidity in our economy.   This bill is not perfect, but it is a necessary response to an  unprecedented crisis. With these policies, coupled with the efforts of  the private sector and the American people, we will defeat the virus  and be ready for what will truly be a great American comeback.
