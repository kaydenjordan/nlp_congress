 Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the selfless  work that the Austin Habitat for Humanity is doing in the 25th District  of Texas that I proudly represent.   Over the past 30 years, they have built more than 425 homes, repaired  another 280, and provided financial advice to over 10,000 Texans. Just  last month, I had the opportunity to visit this organization and meet  with the great folks who operate it. The work they do here is so  important, and I was inspired by their spirits and selfless attitudes.   Hearing about the remarkable work they do day in and day out was  extraordinary. They put God's love into action by bringing people  together to build homes and communities and to give hope to those who  need it the most.   Those who work and volunteer for Habitat for Humanity are superb  people. They are compassionate and kind, and, frankly, we need more  Americans just like them.   Every single person deserves a decent and affordable place to live,  and this organization is there to help those who are less fortunate. I  encourage each and every person listening to get out there and do  something for your local community. Together, we can really make this  world a better place.   With that being said, God bless Texas, God bless Habitat for  Humanity, and God bless the United States of America.   ``In God We Trust.''                            ____________________
