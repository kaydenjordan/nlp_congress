 Mr. President, over the past 2 years, something profound  has taken place on this Senate floor. We have been building one of the  most important accomplishments of the Biden era's administration: the  confirmation of highly qualified, independent, evenhanded judges to the  Federal bench.   This week, the Senate will confirm the 150th lifetime judge since  President Biden took office. This is a historic slate of judges who I  believe will rule with reason and restraint. These judges respect the  rule of law, adhere to precedent, and, above all, answer only to the  U.S. Constitution.   Some Senate Republicans, including their leader, have not been shy in  criticizing these nominees. According to the minority leader's  retelling of history, under the former President, Senate Republicans  ``spent 4 years confirming staggeringly qualified and incredibly  brilliant men and women to the courts.'' I would like to set the record  straight.   For each judicial nominee who comes before the Senate, the American  Bar Association conducts a nonpartisan peer review and ranks their  qualifications. Those rankings are based on integrity, professional  competence, and judicial temperament.   During the Trump administration, Senate Republicans confirmed eight-- eight--Trump nominees who were  [[Page S5410]]  found unqualified to serve on the Federal bench by the American Bar  Association. Compare that to President Biden's record.   During the Biden administration, not one--not one--of the 150 judges  we have confirmed had an unqualified rating--not one. So when I hear  some Senate Republicans waxing about the glory days of judicial  nominees under President Trump, I can't help but wonder what they are  talking about.   Are they talking about that district court nominee who had never  tried a case but had instead worked as a ghost hunter and written blog  posts defending the Ku Klux Klan?   What about another Trump trial court nominee who had never tried a  case, never examined a witness, never taken a deposition, never argued  a motion?   Or the Sixth Circuit nominee who likened abortion to slavery?   How about the Ninth Circuit nominee whose colleagues called him  ``arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of the day-to- day practice'' of law?   In addition, Senate Republicans relied on increasingly absurd  criticism in an attempt to undermine President Biden's nominees. Some  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee criticized one of Biden's  nominees as soft on crime because she had dedicated her career to  exonerating wrongfully imprisoned individuals, mainly using DNA  evidence. That is right. Senate Republicans argued that releasing  people from prison who did not actually commit the crime is somehow  dangerous for society.   Just last week, one of my Republican colleagues criticized a nominee  who had served as a Federal prosecutor for 16 years because he did not  ask a judge to impose a sentence that was higher than the maximum  sentence allowed by law in one case.   Let me be clear. This nominee would have been asking a Federal judge  to violate the law if he had made such a request. Those types of  attacks are simply not credible.   President Biden's nominees are qualified, and they have demonstrated  impeccable temperament.   Something that stands out about these nominees, aside from their  exceptional qualifications and loyalty to the rule of law, is the  professional and demographic diversity they bring to the bench. When  you go into a Federal courthouse today and look at the judges who are  likely to be trying or deciding a case, you are going to find more  diversity than ever before.   Under President Biden, in fact, we have made history, confirming more  Black women to the Federal circuit courts than all prior Presidents  combined. Of course, we also confirmed the first-ever Black woman to  serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and we have  confirmed historic numbers of Asian-American judges, Latino judges, and  LGBTQ judges.   It is not just demographic diversity that we have seen under  President Biden. It is also professional diversity. In the past 2  years, we have confirmed more circuit judges with experience as public  defenders than all prior Presidents combined.   For the record, I voted over and over again for former prosecutors-- White males. The bench is made up of a lot of people whom I have voted  for in the past, and I believe that they were ready for the job and  competent to handle it. But we believe now that there should be more  diversity, and this President is making sure the nominees sent our way  meet that standard.   We have confirmed State court judges, Federal magistrates, bankruptcy  judges, and prosecutors who have made significant and critical  contributions to this country's justice system. One of President  Biden's nominees served as a special prosecutor in the trial of Derek  Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. And we have confirmed jurists  with experience protecting the rights of voters, the rights of workers,  civil rights, women's rights, and LGBTQ rights.    Another notable aspect of this record--and this, I am very happy to  report--is that the vast majority, nearly 90 percent, of all these  judicial confirmations have been bipartisan. Even on the appellate  courts, over three-quarters of President Biden's nominees have received  support from both sides of the aisle. This focus on qualified,  consensus nominees goes a long way toward restoring trust and faith in  our judiciary.   Let me also remind you that, in the first 2 years of the Biden  administration, we had a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 Judiciary Committee.  We needed bipartisanship for anything to work.   The American people deserve Federal judges who not only look like  America but understand what it means to be an American. That is an  important part of our work that we began under President Biden. It is a  work we must finish.   We celebrate these 150 judges, and we will continue elevating jurists  who are qualified, principled, and committed, above all, to protecting  our constitutional rights. The American people deserve nothing less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Ramon Reyes to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New  York.   Judge Reyes received his B.S. from Cornell University, his J.D. from  Brooklyn Law School, and his LL.M. from NYU Law School.   Judge Reyes began his legal career with the New York City Council as  a legislative attorney. After taking a year to clerk for Judge David  Trager on the Eastern District, he spent 3 years in private practice  before joining the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of  New York as an assistant U.S. attorney. While in the U.S. attorney's  office, Judge Reyes handled a wide range of civil and criminal matters,  including cases involving civil rights violations, healthcare fraud,  false claims, and environmental issues. In 2004, he was appointed  deputy chief of appeals.   In recognition of his broad experience and legal acumen, including  three jury trials and three bench trials as an AUSA, Judge Reyes was  appointed in 2006 to serve as a Federal magistrate judge in the Eastern  District of New York. Since taking the bench, he has presided over 33  trials that cover a range of issues including criminal matters,  employment suits, and civil rights cases.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Reyes as ``well  qualified,'' and he has the strong support of Senators Schumer and  Gillibrand.   I will be supporting his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do  so, as well.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3251         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
