 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  man in Iowa's Second Congressional District with an incredibly bright  future.   On June 28, Pella High School senior Tony Schmitz will enroll as a  cadet at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.   Everyone knows just how tough it is to get into West Point, with its  12 percent acceptance rate, but getting in is only the beginning. As a  24-year veteran of the Army myself, I can speak firsthand of the  challenging, fulfilling, and exciting journey Tony is about to begin.   As the school year starts to wind down, I also want to remind all  rising seniors in the Second District to reach out to my office if you  have an interest in applying to any or attending one of our four  amazing service academies.   Once again, congratulations to Tony, and always remember: Go Army,  beat Navy.                            ____________________
