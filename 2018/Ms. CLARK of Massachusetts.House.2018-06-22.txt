 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member  for yielding and for all his work on this issue and continuing to  underscore the need to actually fund access to healthcare so that we  can curb this horrible epidemic in a meaningful way.   One of the many factors that contributes to the opioid crisis is the  sheer volume of opioids in circulation. According to the CDC, over 214  million prescriptions were written for opioids in 2016, and we can see  that in our own Federal programs.   A 2016 study showed that one in three Medicare part D recipients  received opioids. That is almost 80 million prescriptions for a cost of  $4.1 billion. The sheer volume makes it hard to prevent abuse,  addiction, waste, and fraud. Almost 90,000 beneficiaries of Medicare  are at serious risk for abuse and overdose, receiving over 2\1/2\ times  the recommended dosing. This study eliminated anyone who is on hospice  care. Additionally, 70,000 recipients receive an extreme amount of  opioids. That is the equivalent of 24 Vicodin every single day.   That is why I, along with my colleague, Markwayne Mullin, have  introduced the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act. This bill will  require that every prescription written for a Medicare part D  beneficiary be prescribed electronically by 2021. We know this  technology will save lives by making it harder to forge prescriptions,  easier for doctors to know if a patient is doctor shopping, and be able  to prevent fraud and save the government money.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense bill that can help fight the  opioid crisis. I am very grateful to Chairman Walden and the ranking  member for including it in this package.
