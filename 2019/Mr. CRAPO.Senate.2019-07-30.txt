 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator  James Risch and Representative Mike Simpson, I congratulate the city of  Carey, ID, on its centennial anniversary.   In 1884, just a few years after the first settlers arrived in the  area, a school was built next to James Carey's Post Office. Homes,  roads, and churches soon joined the landscape, demonstrating early on  the characteristics that are readily associated with Carey today:  selflessness, hard work, and determination to make their slice of Idaho  neighborly and productive. By the time the residents of Carey got  around to incorporating the town in 1919, a sense of community was  already deeply rooted.   On July 20, 2019, the city of Carey celebrated its 100-year  anniversary of its establishment with special events, including a  parade, music, rodeo, and other activities. This picturesque community  in Blaine County, ID, is in a beautiful area rich in history and  extraordinary people. The area has a deep legacy of sheep herding and  cattle ranching and has been home to remarkable Idahoans, including  pioneers, ranchers, producers, conservationists, writers, and leaders.  Among them was the late, former Idaho secretary of state Pete  Cenarrusa, a beloved public servant and veteran, who ran a successful  sheep operation with his wife of 66 years, Freda.   Pete is Carey's most famous son. In Idaho, Pete's legendary  achievements are well known. He was a member of the 1940 University of  Idaho NCAA national champion boxing team, served as a World War II  fighter pilot, and he holds the record for Idaho's longest serving  elected official at 52 years. One validating experience exemplifying  Pete's political will and influence occurred in 1948 when he convinced  President Harry Truman to visit his hometown of Carey and dedicate the  Carey Airport, which, according to some accounts, was built in a single  day--a story that is reflective of a proud and dedicated public servant  and committed townspeople. Pete Cenarrusa and Carey, ID, are synonymous  among most in Idaho, each possessing their own distinct legacy, despite  being deeply-entwined, that has contributed mightily to our State's  history and success.   The residents of Carey have much to celebrate. In addition to  building a welcoming community settled in an amazing part of our great  State, recreational opportunities abound, including skiing, fishing,  hiking, biking, and hunting. Past and present-day Carey residents have  developed Carey into a community built on a foundation of  resourcefulness and good will with an eye toward how to further grow  and make progress for the betterment of its residents.   Congratulations to the residents of Carey on 100 years of  accomplishments, principal among them building a lovely town where  people can live full lives. If this is a suitable, primary measure of a  successful community, you have more than succeeded. We wish you well  for centuries to come.                            ____________________
