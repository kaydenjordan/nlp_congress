 Mr. President, community banks, credit unions, and  other small-scale lenders play a vital role in the U.S. economy.   Research from Harvard indicates that community banks provide more  than half of all small business loans. Let me repeat that. A majority  of small business loans is handled by community banks. This is even  more pronounced in rural areas and farming communities, like those I  represent in Kentucky. A whopping 77 percent of agricultural loans come  from community banks--77 percent.   In this era of online banking and multinational corporations, smaller  institutions remain uniquely able to build community connections.  Community bankers get to know their residents and business owners on a  personal level. That perspective lets them extend credit to small-scale  entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers, and other Americans who might not  have access otherwise. So when small lenders close their doors, the  effects on communities are very real.   In 2014, an economist at MIT found that, on average, the closing of a  single bank cut the number of new small business loans in the immediate  area by more than 10 percent for several years. The problem was  extremely pronounced in low-income areas, where a local perspective and  personal relationships matter even more. In low-income America, a  physical bank closure cuts lending to local small businesses by nearly  40 percent.   Long story short, the more vulnerable a community, the more they need  local lenders, but since the Federal Government implemented massive new  regulations under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, our community banks and  credit unions have been getting squeezed. Dodd-Frank's imprecise,  inefficient, one-size-fits-all framework dropped these small  institutions into the regulatory maze that was intended for Wall  Street. For 8 years, they have faced a staggering compliance burden  that now consumes, on average, 24 percent of their net income. This has  forced many to pare down their offerings or close their doors for good.  That leaves out to dry would-be entrepreneurs, job creators, and  existing small businesses that want to expand.   Fortunately, we have an opportunity this week to begin putting things  right. Today, the Senate continues considering a sensible solution that  would streamline regulations and give  [[Page S1406]]  smaller lenders a fighting chance. Senator Crapo's Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is the product of  thorough committee work. It is an important step toward unwinding the  harm caused by the Obama administration's knee-jerk reaction to the  2008 financial crisis.   Importantly, this bill has strong bipartisan support. On both sides  of the aisle, Members with a diversity of views on Dodd-Frank itself  have recognized that this set of commonsense fixes deserves all of our  support. I encourage all Senators to join them.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on another matter, just 2 months in, the effects of  tax reform are percolating through every corner of our economy. It has  made bonuses, raises, and benefits for working families daily news in  communities all across our country.   Thanks to tax reform, automakers are planting deeper roots in  America. Innovators like Apple are bringing billions back to invest  here at home. Retailers, from corner stores to national chains, are  rewarding their hard-working teams. There is another sector in which  the benefits of tax reform are flowing freely--America's growing craft  beverage industry. That is because the new 21st-century Tax Code  included a provision known as the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax  Reform Act, spearheaded by Senator Portman and Senator Blunt. Among  other achievements, that piece of tax reform significantly cut the  excise taxes the Federal Government imposes on beer, wine, and spirits.   This was originally a bipartisan bill, with early support from my  friend, the senior Senator from Oregon. It is too bad he and every  other Democrat in Congress ended up voting against this historic tax  reform that included that measure, because it is proving to be good  news for a host of American small businesses, including the fine  distilleries that contribute thousands of jobs and tourism in Kentucky.   One recent wave of headlines has detailed how tax reform is helping  entrepreneurs in the craft brewing industry as well. Across the  country, job creators in this popular and growing line of business are  making big plans for their savings under this new 21st-century Tax  Code.   Matt Matthiesen, a brewery owner in West Okoboji, IA, said: ``I am  very excited. . . . As a small local business, those breaks help us  tremendously.''   Donn Martens, who owns another brewery just down the road, said: ``We  hope to expand with this money. We would like to double our  production.''   Remember Matt and Donn when my colleagues across the aisle tell you  tax reform is only helping the big guys. Together, their two businesses  employ 15 people. They expect tax reform will save them about $15,000  this year. Just try telling any small business owner that is no big  deal.    Larry Horwitz owns Four String Brewing Company in Columbus, OH. He  expects tax reform will save his business $40,000 this year. ``We  invest where we live and work,'' he said. ``We are the blue collar  workers in the neighborhood.''   In Kentucky, tax reform has a number of craft breweries excited about  the year ahead. At Country Boy Brewing in Georgetown, production  manager Daniel Sinkhorn says the new law is helping them plan a new  canning line, which will ``add jobs, add equipment . . . and keep  Country Boy growing.''   It has been reported that later today my friends across the aisle  will unveil a $1 trillion spending plan and propose repealing tax  reform to pay for it.   Repeal all these bonuses, pay raises, new jobs, and new investments?  Talk about a nonstarter.   At the same time, Vice President Pence will be in Central Kentucky  today to hear from small business owners and community leaders about  how tax reform is helping them. Daniel Harrison, the cofounder of  Country Boy Brewing, will be on hand to meet with the Vice President. I  am glad he will be able to share how his business, like so many around  the country, is tapping into tax reform savings.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
