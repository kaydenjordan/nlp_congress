 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Kathie Bailey. Kathie passed away on May 14, 2021, in  Lewistown, MT. Kathie was an amazing woman. She and her husband, Rod,  were married for 43 years and had two sons, C.J. and Justin. She was  active in supporting them in rodeo, 4-H, and FFA events. Kathie was a  caring wife, mother, and grandmother.   Kathie also was active in public service. She served on many State  boards, as well as the administrator of the City of Colstrip for 7  years and a Fergus County commissioner for 5 years. She served as a 4-H  Extension staff member for several years and was on the national board  for 6 years.   Kathie was the driving force for the creation and development of the  Snowy Mountain Development Center, SMDC. This organization has been the  impetus for business development, homeownership, and health services in  the area. Her staff lovingly called her ``Barracuda Bailey'' and the  ``Tasmanian Devil'' when describing her intensity and dedication to  projects that were important to her and her community. Kathie left an  endowment to ensure the long-term viability of SMDC, which she founded  in 2001 and initially operated from the trunk of her car. As a result  of her efforts, she built SMDC into a multimillion-dollar organization,  recently recognized as an EnVision Center, a State-sanctioned Certified  Regional Development Corporation, and helped establish a federally  designated Economic Development District. She had a highly proficient  team of professional women that she hand-picked, trained, coached,  mentored, and trusted to carry forth her legacy. Central Montana's  community and economic landscape reflects the thousands of hours and  dollars she invested passionately, selflessly, and honorably in her  community and with the people she loved so deeply.   But most importantly, Kathie's life was shaped by God. She knew that  God was guiding her to something new and even more rewarding and was  eagerly awaiting God's calling. She was secure in knowing where she  would spend eternity.   We lost an accomplished person when Kathie passed. Her life was  indicative of the true Montana spirit of selfless giving and dedication  to making the world a better place. She will be missed.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing ``Piano Pat'' Sponheim, an iconic entertainer and a Montana  treasure. Pat passed away peacefully at the age of 85 on May 4, 2021.   Piano Pat was a Great Falls staple. She had been singing, playing the  piano, and lighting up the room at the world-renowned Sip 'N Dip Lounge  since 1963. Montanans and tourists from every corner of the world would  swarm the Great Falls Tiki Bar to hear Pat belt out her rendition of  some of the greatest classics. Her vast repertoire of songs would  always amaze people as they made requests that soon became her next  tune. Her performances brought joy to everyone who listened. For over  five decades, Piano Pat entertained folks of all ages and backgrounds.   Pat was not only a Montana celebrity; she was also a strong follower  of Christ. Her faith was a guiding force in her life, and she was known  for her love and compassion for others. As a single mom, Pat worked  hard to raise her three children. She continued her dedication to her  family by caring for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Her passion for music and her love of life was infectious. Pat was a  Montana legend who will be dearly missed by her family, friends, and  fans from Montana and around the world. She has joined her heavenly  choir now.                            ____________________
