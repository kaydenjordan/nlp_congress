 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2131, the DHS FIRM  Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2131, or the DHS FIRM Act, seeks to ensure greater  consistency and transparency in how discipline is administered across  the Department of Homeland Security. Discipline administered in a fair  and equitable manner has a huge implication on job satisfaction.   Since 2003, DHS, a diverse, multimission Federal Department, has  struggled with low morale. At the end of the prior administration,  there was evidence that the DHS workforce was starting to feel a more  fair and cooperative and supportive DHS. In 2016, the Office of  Personnel Management reported a 3 percent increase in the annual  Employee Viewpoint Survey, which indicated that DHS supported fairness  and protection of employees from arbitrary action.   While the OPM survey results are positive indicators, more must be  done by the current DHS leadership. This bill seeks to give the  Department's Chief Human Capital Officer a more prominent role in  ensuring that discipline is handled in an equitable and fair manner.  Specifically, this bill charges the Chief Human Capital Officer with  oversight of how employee misconduct is managed across all components.   To ensure fairness and transparency, the bill requires each component  to accomplish a matrix of offenses and penalties that is tailored to  the needs of that organization, and upon approval by the Department's  Chief Human Capital Officer, such information to be shared with the  workforce.   While it is essential that senior-level human capital personnel at  DHS have a structure to address discipline, it is equally important  that such discipline be administered in a fair and equitable manner.  This is what this bill actually does.   Mr. Speaker, the implementation of a Departmentwide discipline and  adverse action policy should improve employer and employee relations  and communication. Enacting this legislation will send a message of  support for the Department's workforce who, every day, do things big  and small to guard our country against terrorists and other bad actors.  These Department personnel are entrusted with the security of our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2131, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1282, the DHS  Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the Department of Homeland Security has  strengthened the management of its major acquisition programs, which  historically has been weak.   H.R. 1282 authorizes the key mechanisms from the previous  administration to ensure acquisitions valued at more than $300 million,  which account for over $7 billion of DHS' annual budget, receive  ongoing scrutiny--let me repeat, receive ongoing scrutiny.   Since 2008, the Acquisition Review Board has brought leaders together  from across the Department to validate foundational acquisition  documents such as cost and schedule estimates and performance  requirements. The Department has had to learn the hard way about the  importance of adhering to its acquisition best practices, including the  establishment of realistic requirements in cost estimates that take  into account the life cycle of costs.   An example is the SBInet program, started in 2006, that was supposed  to bring together integration of systems of infrastructure and  technology to secure the border. This program was terminated in 2011  only after $1 billion had been spent. Let me repeat that. This program  was terminated in 2011, but only after $1 billion had been spent.   The acquisition went wrong because CBP bypassed required processes  and awarded a multimillion-dollar contract without having laid the  foundation to oversee contractor performance, cost controls, and  scheduling.   Just last week, the Department was forced to cancel its $1.5 billion  Agile Services contract, or the FLASH contract, due to significant  errors and missteps in the procurement process.   Many of us are concerned that, in the Department's haste to deliver  the President's campaign promise to build a wall, critical steps in the  acquisition process will be short-circuited, leaving Americans with a  bill for a bad investment.                                time  1500    At this time, a centralized oversight body for DHS major acquisitions  is more important than ever.   This bill provides for the board to convene when a major acquisition  program requires authorization to proceed from one decision event to  another, or is in breach of its approved requirements, or requires  additional review.   Efficiency and effectiveness in the acquisition process is imperative  for the DHS mission of procuring goods, services, and supplies in  support of its national security efforts. The Committee on Homeland  Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this Congress, and  similar language was approved by the House in October 2015.   By establishing this board into law and laying out its  responsibilities, Congress can ensure that this vital oversight will  continue and that DHS will continue to show progress in its management  of acquisitions.   I urge passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague from Virginia for  bringing forth this most important accountability measure.   This bill enhances the Department's accountability and provides  greater acquisition oversight to intercede before programs fail to meet  important cost and schedule milestones.   Given DHS's limited budgetary resources and the importance of its  mission, it is critical that DHS improves its management of major  acquisition programs. Although the Department has made some progress in  its major acquisition programs, DHS cannot afford to neglect the day- to-day management of the agency and how it procures essential goods and  services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
