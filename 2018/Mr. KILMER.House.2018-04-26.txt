 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment, which would modify the  Airport Improvement Program to require the FAA to explicitly consider  the emergency preparedness needs of the communities served when  reviewing an airport's master plan.   Currently, the FAA relies primarily on a number of enplanements when  making their funding determinations under the AIP. That disadvantages  rural airports like William R. Fairchild International Airport in my  district, which serves as a critical component of the State's and  FEMA's emergency response plan for the region, but has relatively few  enplanements.   This commonsense improvement would help ensure that Fairchild and  other airports like it will be able to secure the funding necessary to  maintain their runway and other critical infrastructure so that the  resources are available when disaster strikes.   This matters to folks in my neck of the woods who live in the shadow  of the Cascadia subduction zone. When the big one hits, the Fairchild  Airport will be essential to deploying emergency supplies, as well as  for evacuating people to safety.   I would like to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for  their support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on it.
