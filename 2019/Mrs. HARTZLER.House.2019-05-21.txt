 Madam Speaker, going door to door in my first  campaign, a sweet, elderly lady invited me in for iced tea. As she  discussed my race, she shared that she had never missed a chance to  vote since she was a young girl.   One day, her mother had hitched the horses to the wagon, pulled up in  front of the house, told her to get in, flicked the reins, and they  were on their way to town. With determination and pride, her mother  announced, ``Today, for the first time in our country, we get to vote.  We must always exercise this privilege.'' And that girl did, every  election, for over 74 years.   As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of this Chamber passing the  19th Amendment to our Constitution, giving women the right to vote, we  must all reflect on what this right to vote truly means. I am grateful  for this privilege not only to vote on election day but also to stand  here and represent the good people of Missouri's Fourth District and  cast their vote here in Congress.   We live in the greatest country in the world. Let us always remember  those who secured our freedoms and honor their legacy by exercising the  right to vote.                            ____________________
