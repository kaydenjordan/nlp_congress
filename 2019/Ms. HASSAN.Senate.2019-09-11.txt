 Mr. President, I start my remarks tonight by thanking my  colleague from Wyoming for his remarks concerning the anniversary of  the horror that was September 11, 2001. I join him and all of my  colleagues here in recognizing that in the midst of that horror, the  American people came together, and we demonstrated the strength,  kindness, bravery, and resilience that we have throughout our history.   I, too, remember the victims, their loved ones, as well as all of the  brave first responders. I thank all of the men and women of our  military who continue to fight against terrorism and who keep us safe,  and I remember the lives lost on the battlefield.
