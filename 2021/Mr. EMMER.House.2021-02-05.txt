 Mr. Speaker, as we begin this new session of Congress, I  rise today to honor the memory and legacy of my friend, Minnesota  Congressman Jim Ramstad.   For nearly two decades, Jim represented the people of Minnesota's  Third Congressional District. Sadly, after so many years of service to  his country and community, Jim lost his fight with Parkinson's just a  few months ago.   Jim was a true public servant, a lawmaker whose passion for his work  only made him more effective. He was a tireless champion for any person  who needed his help, even if they were a stranger. He was truly a  leader guided by his compassion for others.   Although Jim and I never served together, he was a personal friend of  my wife, Jacquie, and me for 40 years. And today, his legacy shapes my  work.   As a fellow Minnesotan, I am proud to continue his monumental work on  addiction and mental healthcare by introducing legislation that will  bring care to those who need it most.   I am also happy to support a bill to name the Wayzata Post Office  after Jim, a physical memorial to his work and legacy in the State and  the town that he loved so much. The monument is a fitting tribute, but  his lasting legacy will always be the impact he made on millions of  Americans.   Thank you, Jim. You will be missed, but you will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
