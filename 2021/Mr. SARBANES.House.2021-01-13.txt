 Madam Speaker, this beautiful Capitol dome is a symbol  of freedom and democracy, not just for Americans but for people the  world over. The action we take today, this impeachment, is a  declaration to the world that when there is an attack on our democracy,  whether it comes from without or whether, tragically, in this instance,  it comes from within, we will respond to that threat and attack, and we  will do what is necessary to strengthen our democracy.
