 Mr. Speaker, the ambulances, the emergency  medical technicians, and the paramedics that we all rely on each and  every day have come a long way since Ernest Hemingway and the first  casualty transports of World War I.   From highway crashes to heart attacks and falls, we call on our EMTs  to be the first medical care a patient receives, regardless of their  circumstance.   During National Emergency Medical Services Week, we recognize and  thank the men and women willing to respond at a moment's notice. More  and more, we rely on these first responders to address significant  instances, instances like a diabetic coma, a fractured limb, or a  patient who has overdosed.   We in Congress owe it to our EMTs and the communities that they serve  to ensure that they have the tools and resources necessary to arrive  quickly and to treat these patients.   So often, we forget the toll that these jobs take on first responders  and their families. This week, let's remain grateful for the care and  the professionalism of our frontline healthcare workers and pledge to  support the EMTs and paramedics--volunteers and paid alike--who support  our communities and, ultimately, care for our families.                            ____________________
