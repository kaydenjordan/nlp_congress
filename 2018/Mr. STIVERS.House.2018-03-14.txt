 Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the House Civility and  Respect Caucus, I want to talk about something that people aren't  talking about today.   There is a movement called the walk up movement, where a lot of kids  around this country are taking action. They are walking up to the kid  who sits alone and asking him to join their group. They are walking up  to the kid who never has a voluntary partner and asking them to be the  partner. They are walking up to teachers and saying, ``thank you.''  They are walking up to people and just being nice.   Civility and respect is for everyone. It makes a difference in our  lives. There are a lot of people recognizing a lot of things today, but  I just want to recognize, today, that the walk up movement is  constructive, it is helpful, and it is going to change people for the  better.                            ____________________
