 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the more  than 10,000 United Auto Workers in my district as they negotiate a fair  contract with the Nation's auto industry employers.   Let's remember, it was workers who built this country, and their  high-quality union jobs gave people a pathway to the middle class, not  just in Illinois but across this great Nation.   The current negotiations have implications not just for workers, but  for the future of the auto industry and our economic competitiveness.   While companies report record profits and the CEOs take home tens of  millions of dollars in compensation, the salary of the average  autoworker has declined by 40 percent over the past 20 years. Our UAW  neighbors are simply asking for their fair share.   To the UAW workers in central and northwestern Illinois and across  the country, I have got your back.                            ____________________
