 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  continue to work with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to  find agreement on the USMCA soon.   I visit each of the 16 counties in my district every month, and  whether it is touring manufacturers, visiting with farmers, or stopping  into small businesses, everywhere I go the message is loud and clear:  Uncertainty is hurting our bottom line.   Agriculture is the backbone of Iowa's economy. One out of every $5 is  produced from Iowa agriculture in our State. Supporting farmers is  neither a partisan nor a political issue; it is simply the right thing  to do.   Between devastating weather events, ongoing trade wars, and the EPA's  unprecedented abuse of biofuel waivers, our farmers have been put  through enough. They are asking for our help. As elected  Representatives, we owe them the right answer. We must answer their  call and get this deal done right and without unnecessary delay.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the work they have done, and  I urge them to expedite negotiations and finalize this agreement soon  to make sure that we can make lives whole for the people suffering in  the State of Iowa and across this country.                            ____________________
