 Mr. President, President Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC,  last week to ask for the United States' continued support for Ukraine  as it defends itself against Russia.   As someone who strongly believes that it is in our national security  interest to aid Ukraine as well as our allies Israel and Taiwan, I am  disappointed that we have not already passed the aid Ukraine needs. But  let's be very clear: The reason the Senate has not already passed a  national security supplemental is that Democrats, so far, have chosen  to prioritize an open border over aid for our allies.   Democrats have known for months that border security was going to be  a part of the national security supplemental. After all, the President  himself requested border funding in his supplemental request.  Republicans have had a border security proposal on the table literally  since the beginning of November, but Democrats wasted weeks, refusing  to engage in substantive negotiations even though they were well aware  that border security was going to be a requirement for getting this  supplemental through both Houses of Congress. Now the supplemental will  be pushed to January because Democrats have run out the clock to the  point where getting a substantive border security deal passed before  Christmas is impossible.   Last week, President Biden said that failing to pass the national  security supplemental before the holidays would be a Christmas gift to  Putin. Well, I would like to point out, once again, that the only  reason we haven't passed the national security supplemental already is  because of the Democrats and President Biden. Only one of the two  parties has been dragging its feet on negotiations, and it has not been  the Republicans. A lot of us Republicans are eager to get Ukraine the  aid that it needs, but we cannot--and I say we cannot--tend to our  national security interests abroad while ignoring the national security  crisis right here on our doorstep.   President Biden wants to talk about a gift to Putin? Well, let's talk  about the gift the President has been giving to terrorists and  criminals and cartels for 3 years now with the chaos we have at our  southern border. We have had three successive, record-breaking years of  illegal immigration at our southern border on President Biden's watch;  and the President is no closer to getting this crisis under control  than when it first started.   During October, the latest month for which we have data, U.S. Customs  and Border Protection encountered 240,988 migrants at our southern  border, which is the highest October number ever recorded. I might add  that among those numbers in October, there were almost 1,600 convicted  criminals, 50 gang members, 90 people who have warrants out for their  arrests, and 12 people on the Terrorist Watchlist. That was just in  [[Page S6037]]  the month of October. The past 24 hours alone saw a record-breaking  12,000-plus migrant encounters at the southern border and, I would say,  the highest--highest--daily total ever recorded. And those numbers  don't count the ``got-aways,'' the individuals the Border Patrol saw  but was unable to apprehend.   Let's be very clear: While many of these individuals may simply have  headed to the United States in search of a better life, there is no  question that there are dangerous individuals who are trying to make  their way into our country.   During fiscal year 2023, the Border Patrol arrested 169 individuals  on the Terrorist Watchlist at the southern border--169. That was a  substantial increase over fiscal year 2022, which was itself a  substantial increase over fiscal year 2021. Needless to say, that is  not a good trajectory. Again, these numbers only refer to individuals  the Border Patrol has actually apprehended. There were 670,000 known  ``got-aways'' during fiscal year 2023.   How many of them were terrorists, criminals, or other dangerous  individuals?   Well, the answer is, we really don't know. We really don't know.   One thing we do know is that the chaotic southern border and the  chaos that we have experienced there cannot continue. Our country  cannot be secure while we have 10,000 people a day pouring across our  southern border and hundreds of thousands of unknown individuals taking  up residence in our country. Think about it. With the record that we  had yesterday--as I mentioned, well over 12,000, which is the single  highest--single highest--day that we have ever had on record in terms  of people being apprehended illegally at the southern border, if you  analyze that number, you are talking about more than 4.5 million people  a year--4.5 million a year. That is way more people than the majority  of the States in this country, in the entire United States of America.    The Federal Government is charged with the responsibility for our  Nation's security, and we owe the American people nothing less than a  secure border. So while I believe it is essential that we get aid to  our allies, any supplemental must include measures to address our  national security here at home at the border as well as our national  security interests abroad.   I want to thank Senator Lankford for his patience and tenacity in  working to bring Democrats to the table. After weeks of Democrat  intransigence, it is encouraging that the White House is finally--and I  say ``finally'' because, as I said, we had a proposal on the table at  the beginning of November, and the White House finally engaged last  Tuesday--finally has stepped up to take on a role in the negotiations.  It is just too bad that they didn't do it weeks ago.   But I hope that the President and Democrats understand that the only  acceptable outcome of negotiations is a solution that meets the  challenge at our southern border. Cosmetic measures and superficial  tweaks are not going to cut it. So the ball is in the Democrats' court.   We need to get aid to allies like Ukraine, but we cannot pass  legislation to do that without addressing the situation at our southern  border. I would like to think that Democrats would see the necessity of  addressing our border crisis irrespective of what is needed to get this  bill through Congress, but at the very least, I hope that Democrats'  concern for our national security interests abroad will lead them to  finally--and again I say ``finally''--get serious about working with  Republicans to address the national security crisis here at home.
