 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have to tell you, when I am back  home, I am struck by one of the things I am hearing in Tennessee, and  it is this odd mix of optimism and also of concern.   And Tennesseans are very concerned that we are not going to pass  another round of COVID relief in time to help save their businesses and  in time to help people who lost their job through no fault of their  own. And, on the other hand, they are excited about the fact that we  finally have vaccines that are going through the process, that are  getting to communities, and there are vaccinations taking place. And I  have thought, you know, this is really an interesting mix of emotions,  especially with Christmas right around the corner.   And Sunday, after I had visited with some folks, I thought, you know,  this, I think, is where people are going to be for a while. Some are  very optimistic. Some are incredibly worried. But there is one thing  that is a constant--and I have really watched this grow over the last  several months. It is the confusion and the anger that is directed at  the Chinese Communist Party. And, quite frankly, this is something that  I fully believe has reached a boiling point with Tennesseans and with  the American public.   Tennesseans were familiar with the tense relationship between China  and the United States well before they found themselves in the middle  of this pandemic. Here is a good example. At this point, most everyone  is familiar with China's notorious disregard for intellectual property  rights, but when I first started working on this issue in the House  with songwriters back in Tennessee--and it was in the early 2000s--we  felt like we were fighting that battle all alone. We had to fight with  Chinese officials and eventually were able to establish some initial  royalty rates payable to U.S. copyright owners whose sound recordings  are broadcast in China. That was a solid win, but the fact that we had  to fight so hard for something so simple really was frustrating, and  people in Tennessee have not forgotten that frustration.   Before this year, they were painfully familiar with the Chinese  Government's abysmal human rights record. That initial footage of  massive protests in Hong Kong had resurrected memories of Tiananmen  Square and reminded everyone that the Chinese Government still uses  political violence, speech suppression, and torture to silence dissent.   The people I talked to had read about diplomatic tensions and trade  deals, and they could sense that in spite of all those optimistic  perspectives on the nightly news, our biggest rival in Asia had become  our adversary.   So they weren't at all shocked when news reports started rolling in  that the Chinese Communist Party officials in Hebei Province and  Beijing had done nothing--not one thing--to stop the spread of the  novel coronavirus.   Since then, Tennesseans and, indeed, most Americans have received a  valuable education, courtesy of Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist  Party. We learned that the Chinese Government's failure to sound the  alarm wasn't an anomaly. It was intentional. Neither was there strong- arming of the World Health Organization or the incarceration and  torture of doctors and journalists who defied gag orders to blast out  warnings to anyone who would listen. They tried to tell us this was  reaching a pandemic, and they were punished.   And as they look around at the economic ruin in their communities, as  small businesses are shuttered and independent music venues are boarded  up for the long haul, all those puzzle pieces are falling into place,  and, quite frankly, they are justifiably upset. I would venture to say  many of them are absolutely furious with what the Chinese Government  has done.   By now, we understand this is what the Chinese Communist Party does  as a government, as an all-powerful political organization, and as a  group of rabid ideologues from whom acts of genocide flow as easily as  the propaganda posted to their many official Twitter accounts. This is  all a part of their quest for global dominance, and their success  depends on gaining complete control over speech, thought, resources,  and their relationships with other nations.   This is the Chinese Communist Party's master plan.   When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, there were a lot of optimistic  pundits out there who thought that he would embrace transparency and  liberal economic policies, but oh my goodness, have they ever been  wrong. In fact, he styled himself in the image of Mao, creating a  personality cult that equates attacks on Xi with challenges to the  legitimacy of party rule. It is all about him.   Anyone who has opened a history book knows this doesn't bode well for  diplomatic efforts to rebalance power. This isn't my political opinion;  this is the reality that diplomats, members of the defense community,  and policy experts accept as a matter of fact. The Senate Armed  Services Committee accepted this reality when we drafted the bipartisan  2021 NDAA. This year's bill contains the most substantial action we  have ever taken to counter Chinese aggression and great power  competition. It establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which  will help the military enhance defense capabilities in the region and  reaffirms our commitments to Taiwan, India, Vietnam, Japan, and other  allies and partners geographically near China.   We drafted numerous provisions to keep U.S. intellectual property,  technology, and data out of Beijing's grasp by limiting funding for  universities that host Confucius Institutes and restricting defense  industrial base employees from working for Chinese-owned companies. Why  did we do this? Because we have learned that not only is this part of  China's propaganda, this is where they are embedding their spies.   In 2021, we will take major steps to secure our supply chain and  invest in American innovation to maintain our technological advantage.  We paid particular attention to accelerating the development of 5G  networks that are needed by our troops in the field and, to complement  that expansion, enhancing our Nation's cyber security strategy.   The Chinese Communist Party isn't just playing politics on Twitter;  their tactics pose a very real threat to our Nation's security and that  of our allies and our partners.   I have spoken at length about how badly we need to unravel our  relationship with China. I have examined problems related to our  medical supply chains, security issues in the building blocks of  popular technology, and sourcing for rare earth elements. Reclaiming  these critical resources will take time and investment, but it can be  done, and I will continue to fight for this as we move into the next  Congress. But I want to consider just for a moment a few examples of  this entanglement that hit particularly close to home and really give a  sense of how much private companies and organizations compromise just  to maintain access to the Chinese marketplace.   Earlier this year, the PR professionals at the NBA worked some  serious overtime after an investigative report published by ESPN showed  that the Chinese Communist Party-affiliated coaches at the league's  training facilities in Xinjiang were abusing players. That is correct-- abusing players. Initial reports of this abuse were ignored by NBA  officials.   Keep in mind that these training facilities existed in the same  region as those concentration camps used to imprison the Uighur Muslims  and others guilty of thought crimes against the  [[Page S7569]]  Chinese Communist Party. So what was the NBA doing there in the first  place? How could something like this actually happen? Here is the  reason: Communist China plays host to an estimated $4 billion NBA  market. They say that China is ``basketball obsessed,'' and NBA execs  have used every avenue they can to take advantage of that $4 billion  market. They jealously protect those relationships even if it means  using skyrocketing sales numbers to explain away the blind eye they  have turned to the CCP's crimes against humanity.   They are not alone. This fall, Walt Disney released their live-action  version of ``Mulan'' and caught some well-deserved hell after sharp- eyed rights activists combed through the credits and discovered that  filmmakers chose to shoot scenes for the movie--where? Xinjiang,  knowing that they would have to cooperate--with whom? The Chinese  Communist Party's propaganda flacks to get the kind of footage they  wanted to play to their desired Chinese audience.   Netflix also ran afoul of human rights activists when they inked an  adaptation deal with an author who parrots Chinese Communist Party  propaganda and made racist comments about the persecuted Uighur Muslims  in Xinjiang.   None--none of these scenarios involved high-stakes diplomatic  negotiations. No one involved was on a mission to balance the  geopolitical scales at all cost. They did, however, stand to net a tidy  profit by maintaining friendly relations with the Chinese Communist  Party. But did they ever stand up and defend the Uighur Muslim  minority? No, they did not.   When faced with such manipulation on a global scale, Tennesseans  expect accountability. They want news reports and hearings and absolute  condemnation. But that is not what they get. Instead, they get  regurgitated propaganda transmitted directly from the CCP, peppered  with media buzz words and distilled into sound bites.   Our attempts to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for  covering up the origins of the pandemic were met with baseless  accusations of xenophobia and of racism. I have met similar resistance  when speaking truth to power about the CCP's aggression in Tibet,  Mongolia, the concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the arbitrary  detention of the Hong Kong freedom fighters. Prominent members of the  press, pundits, and even Members of Congress who have access to more  than enough information to know better--all provide cover for the  Chinese Communist Party at the expense of American lives and  livelihoods. It is all there in black and white. They are failing an  open-book test because they are refusing--refusing to admit that their  coziness with China does not serve the American people or our allies  well.   This situation will not evaporate with the start of the new Congress.  Vaccines and defense funding and new technology will solve some  immediate problems, but they are not a strategy. Those are action  items.   We must all commit right now to an aggressive strategy that leads a  whole-of-government approach to protecting American intellectual  property, securing our critical supply chains, and bringing our  manufacturing back home.   We must assert our role as a leader on the global stage and stand  between the Chinese Government and leadership roles in international  organizations. How is it that China could have a seat on the Human  Rights Council of the United Nations? Look at what they are doing to  the Tibetans, to the Taiwanese, to the Hong Kong freedom fighters, and  to the Uighur Muslims.   We should continue to provide support for Hong Kong and for Taiwan,  build a strong network of allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific,  and we should increase our defense investment in the Indo-Pacific  Command.   I laid out more items in a white paper I released earlier this year.  It is online at Blackburn.Senate.gov. It is time to pay attention to  everything the CCP is doing.   In today's New York Post, I have an op-ed that lays out how they are  using Twitter to troll and intimidate the rest of the world into  staying silent. Do you know what? They are, unfortunately, having some  success with that. World leaders, powerful corporations, and  celebrities are all scared into silence by online propaganda campaigns.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my op-ed be  printed in the Record with these remarks   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Post, Dec. 16, 2020]       How China Uses Internet Trolls to Help Cover Up Its Atrocities                           (By Marsha Blackburn)         The greatest benefit to Big Tech's otherwise dubious       influence over our lives is that it's impossible for the       world's human-rights violators to hide their crimes.       Information that years ago would have been filtered by       official, sanitized sources now flows from anyone with the       guts to tweet about it.        But social media's power to disseminate ideas means the       tyrants themselves are better equipped than ever to       obfuscate, lie and troll their way out of crises--      capitalizing on the moral confusion and greed of the modern       West.        Last December, freedom fighters a world away were busy       tweeting about the Chinese Communist Party's aggression in       Hong Kong. Much to the chagrin of party bosses in Beijing,       guerrilla coverage of mass protests spread rapidly, prompting       digital activists worldwide to condemn the CCP's latest       horror show.        Civil-society groups seized the moment to spotlight the       CCP's colonialism in Tibet and Inner Mongolia, the regime's       cruelty--toward Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and the horrifying       plight of Falun Gong practitioners. Shock turned into       revulsion that manifested in demands for change. It was a       shining moment of international unity that vowed an end to       totalitarianism in Asia.        Today, hundreds of dissenters, including Hong Kong       activists Joshua Wong and Jimmy Lai, sit in jail for the sin       of criticizing their government. Tibetan language, culture       and religion are so repressed that more than 150 Tibetans       have self-immolated since 2009. Communist officials terrorize       Uighurs under the guise of cultural re-education, locking       dissenters in concentration camps and perpetrating mass       violence on a scale that has prompted many lawmakers like me       to support legislation labeling the violence in Xinjiang a       genocide.        Yet fashionable concern soon gave way to a parade of       appalling statements from world leaders, multinational       corporations and celebrities desperate to preserve their       interests in China's economy. Beijing breathed a sigh of       relief and ramped up its own disinformation campaign--about       the origins of COVID-19 and the Hong Kong crisis--by taking a       page from the freedom fighters' playbook.        Between March and September, the CCP violated its own ban       against Twitter and amassed nearly 1.5 million followers       stretched across dozens of official accounts. Using a mix of       typical viral content, weird propaganda and COVID-19       misinformation to attract attention, diplomats and other       political leaders used their mainstream clout to lob insults       at Western leaders and dismiss the global outcry over       Beijing's atrocities as the product of ``racism.''        Beijing's propaganda doesn't generally pass even a minimal       smell test, of course. Its play at ``wolf-warrior       diplomacy,'' named after a patriotic film franchise, is a       trollish p.r. campaign that relies on sheer numbers and       whataboutism to intimidate critics.        The Chinese diplomats have even learned to tap into the       rhetoric of wokeness. And sadly, it's working. China's ``wolf       warriors'' can sink their teeth into the impressionable, the       contrarian and, terrifyingly, the complicit among Western       influencers and audiences.        The CCP is counting on our fear of retaliation, not to       mention the undying tendency of our own elites to first blame       America and the West, to mislead us.        We have no excuse for ignoring reality, however. If you       need proof, it's sitting in your hand. Google phrases like       ``Uighur forced sterilization'' and ``Mongol ethnic       assimilation,'' then brace yourself.        Millions of victims of Xi Jinping's ``China Dream''--a       nightmarish blend of ideological conformity and behavior       controls--regularly risk their lives speaking truth to power.       Meanwhile, in the safe confines of the West, powerhouse       personalities and companies agonize over the financial risks       of criticizing Beijing.        In 50 or 100 years, when historians ask how such things       could have happened, I hope someone invokes the cowardice       inherent in that cost-benefit analysis as the answer to their       question.     If they can do that with a hashtag--all of that  suppression, all of that intimidation--then think about what they will  do in the real world.   If we stand down, the Chinese Government is going to keep pushing to  stand up. They will fill a power vacuum because their determination is  to be the leader, the global dominator. They want the 21st century to  be the China century. It is their strategy. It is what they do. So now  is the time to act. I would encourage my colleagues to remember this as  we begin a new Congress.  [[Page S7570]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
