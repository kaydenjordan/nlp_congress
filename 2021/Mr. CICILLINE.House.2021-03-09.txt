 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the PRO Act.  Union membership is at historic lows while inequality is at historic  highs. The tremendous income inequality in our country is due, in large  part, to antiunion policies that have stripped workers of the freedom  to negotiate collectively for higher wages, better benefits, and safer  working conditions.   Strong unions are essential to rebuilding the middle class and  improving the lives of millions of Americans.   The PRO Act ensures workers have the freedom to decide for  themselves, without retaliation, whether to form a union. It  strengthens safeguards to ensure workers can hold free and fair union  elections and it imposes penalties on companies and executives that  violate workers' collective bargaining rights.   Passing the PRO Act will not only strengthen Rhode Island's workers'  ability to join a union, it will help rebuild the middle class and  create an economy where everyone can succeed.   I urge all my colleagues to support the PRO Act.                            ____________________
