 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my alma mater,  Hillside High School, class of 1976, in Hillside, New Jersey. The  Hillside Comets football team won their State championship against the  Point Pleasant Boro Panthers on Saturday.   The Hillside Comets finished their season with a 9-3 record. They  beat the top-seeded Panthers to bring home Hillside's first State title  since 1985. The Comets are only the second football team from Union  County to win a State title in central Jersey in 15 years.   Mr. Speaker, the Hillside Comets football team are winners both on  and off the field. Sixteen players are on the honor roll, and five of  them are members of the National Honor Society. The team's successes  are, no doubt, a testament to the high expectations set by their head  coach, Barris Grant.   I was honored to join the Comets at their celebration on Sunday, and  I am proud to have such outstanding students in my district. I ask my  colleagues to join me in congratulating the Hillside High School  Comets, winners on and off the field.                            ____________________
