 Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is, an honor and a  privilege, to serve with Mr. Sam Johnson, a true American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act,  which will provide significant reforms and improvements to the Veterans  Choice Program.   Since its implementation, the Veterans Choice Program has served over  1.7 million unique veterans seeking timely and high-quality healthcare  for their physical and invisible wounds. Although progress has been  made, there is more work to be done to ensure we balance resources from  community care and the VA healthcare system.   The VA MISSION Act will streamline and consolidate the Veterans  Choice Program with the other duplicative VA community care programs to  create one new cohesive Veterans Community Care Program. This new  program allows eligible veterans to seek care from non-VA providers in  the community if the VA is not providing the quality care the veterans  deserve, and timely care. It also requires access to community  providers if the veteran and doctor believe it is in the veteran's best  medical interest to seek such care.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe, who did an outstanding job with  this bill, for his hard work on this bicameral, bipartisan piece of  legislation, which is the result of a long negotiation process, where  both sides of the aisle put aside differences and compromised to strike  a balance between each stakeholder. This is how Congress should work. I  am proud of the work that we have done on this committee.   I want to thank the staff, as well. The committee ensured that we  have a great work product for our true American heroes. Again, I want  to thank the sponsors of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, let's have a great vote for our true American heroes.  Let's pass this VA MISSION Act and get it to the Senate as soon as  possible.
