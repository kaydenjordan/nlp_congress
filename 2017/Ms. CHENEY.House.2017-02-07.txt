 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 91, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 44) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of the Interior relating to Bureau of Land Management  regulations that establish the procedures used to prepare, revise, or  amend land use plans pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management  Act of 1976, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 44         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land       Management of the Department of the Interior relating to       ``Resource Management Planning'' (published at 81 Fed. Reg.       89580 (December 12, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force       or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney)  and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.J. Res. 44.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.J. Res. 44.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, BLM Planning 2.0 is yet one more example of Obama-era  Federal Government overreach. It takes authority away from people in  local communities, in my home State of Wyoming, and all across the  West. It takes authority away from our elected representatives at a  local level, and it puts Washington bureaucrats in charge of decisions  that influence and impact our lives.   It significantly dilutes cooperating agency status, and it discounts  input from those who are closest to our land and our resources. BLM 2.0  is an example of the midnight rulemaking that we saw that was so  rampant in the Obama administration. In fact, it is an abuse of that  rulemaking process.   By statute, Mr. Speaker, the BLM is supposed to manage our public  lands for multiple use and for sustained yield, but instead we have  seen consistently throughout the last 8 years the Obama administration  doing everything possible to deny all human use of our public lands.   This rulemaking isn't based on the language of the statute that  underlies it. It is based, rather, on policy preferences that have been  expressed in memos and in various studies. The rulemaking takes another  step in imposing a brand new mitigation formula that essentially is a  land grab by a Federal agency that would put even more land under the  control of Washington bureaucrats.   Despite the fact that these agencies are required to consider costs  as they impose regulations, BLM 2.0 was imposed not only using cost  estimates that are clearly wrong, but, in fact, it removed all  reference to looking at the devastating impact that this rule has on  our local economies across the West.   This rule takes away authority and power from those who know best how  to manage our lands and how to manage our resources. In fact, it opens  up our planning process to such an extent that we could have foreign,  nongovernmental organizations having just as much say in how we manage  our land and resources as the very stakeholders--the ranchers, the  farmers across Wyoming and the West, and the people that they have  elected to speak for them.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this rule takes authority away from those who  know best what we need to do to manage and sustain our resources, and  it puts it in the hands of the Federal Government and bureaucrats here  in Washington, D.C.   Repealing 2.0 using the Congressional Review Act will help to restore  the voices and input. It will help to restore democracy and help to  restore authority to our local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, of all of the stifling, bureaucratic,  pettifogging regulations that Congress is now repealing from the  previous administration, none is more deserving of repeal than the  BLM's Planning 2.0 rule.   This rule governs the process for creating resource management plans.  If they are done wrong, they can devastate the economies of the  communities that are impacted by those lands. A new RMP can crush an  industry, and it can destroy a community, which is why States and  counties across the West have been anxiously watching this process  unfold.   Despite serious concerns being raised by State and local  governments--by farming, livestock, and energy production groups, and  even by Congress during the rulemaking process--the Bureau of Land  Management charged full steam ahead and finalized this rule. The BLM  assured stakeholders that the final rule governing this process would  not undercut State and local voices. But, when the BLM realized that  the election of President Trump endangered the environmental left's  stranglehold on this agency, the Planning 2.0 rule was hastily  finalized in contradiction of almost all of the promises that the BLM  made.   The Planning 2.0 rule is a gross expansion of BLM's power, and the  power of well-funded political groups that use the veneer of  environmentalism at the expense of local communities. Under BLM's  current RMP procedures, our Western counties already complain of having  their voices ignored and their interests disregarded.   Last year, the Federal Lands Subcommittee held a field hearing in St.  George, Utah. We heard how the city of St. George was experiencing  economic growth, pushing the limits of its infrastructure, and how the  city had tried over and over to engage the BLM in the development of a  new RMP to address the needs of the local community. The city was  desperate for the new RMP to include a transportation corridor for a  new road to meet the needs of their growing economy. In their testimony  before the subcommittee, the city relayed that they were unable to  secure regular meetings with their local BLM office, despite the BLM  office holding frequent meetings with local environmental groups.   In the end, the RMP was released and there was nothing to account for  the transportation needs of the people of St. George. In a State that  is two-thirds owned by the Federal Government, I find it hard to  believe that the BLM could not have worked with the city of St. George  to accommodate a simple road.   With these kind of results under BLM's current planning regime, it is  no wonder that counties across the West are weary of a new planning  rule.  [[Page H1034]]  BLM should be focused on improving their collaboration and coordination  with counties and local governments. Instead, this rule enshrines that  disregard into formal Federal regulation.   I urge adoption of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Virginia may not be  completely aware of the implementation and the effect of this rule in  Western States like Wyoming where, for example, the process that has  been described as an open process is, in fact, one where, in my State,  our Department of Environmental Quality on another BLM rule was in a  position where they agreed to be a cooperating agency and then did not  hear from the BLM for 4 years.   When you are talking about our very livelihood, you are in a  situation where we simply can't run that risk. We cannot adopt a rule  or let a rule stand that expands that kind of authority in Washington,  no matter who is in charge in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, thank you to my colleague from Wyoming for  the time and ability to weigh in on this.   Today, I rise in support of the measure for congressional disapproval  under the Congressional Review Act for disapproving of the BLM's 2.0  rule.   It is another midnight regulation passed in the final days of the  previous administration which undercuts the resource management  planning process on public lands by stripping local community input and  centralizing, again, in Washington, D.C., the decisionmaking.   California holds some of the largest amounts of public land in the  U.S. The Federal Government has approximately 46 percent of the total  land in California, amounting to about 46 million acres. BLM oversees  about 15 million acres of those public lands, or about 15 percent of  the State's total land mass.   The abundance of natural resources and diversity of landscapes within  California creates unique challenges for BLM to even fulfill its  multiple-use mandate. It is essential that development of these  resource management plans include close coordination with local, State,  and tribal governments--the people who actually grew up and know those  lands the best for all of the potential these lands could bring,  whether it is for development of potential energy or timber management.  Whatever those ideas are that they would have, let the locals have the  input on it. These decisions need to be made with that local input so  that everyone's voice is heard.                                time  1415    In strong rural areas like my own, the First District of California,  close coordination between the Federal Government and local groups is  vital to have good decisions be made regarding public land management.  Unfortunately, what we have is nonmanagement, and we suffer for that  each summer and fall with a forestry that is not managed and the  inability to have an economic opportunity for those people in those  areas.   The 2.0 rule does just the opposite with that collaboration. It  strengthens BLM's power once again in Washington, marginalizing Western  counties and districts, eliminating their ability to coordinate or  challenge BLM's proposed plans in an open setting.   Under the pretext of climate change and landscape scale management,  the agency's rule undermines federalism and allows for the  implementation of a previous era environmental agenda. No wonder Modoc  County, in my own district, as well as other counties from Western  States have sued BLM for its failure to properly engage and coordinate  with the public and fulfill what the law requires for the BLM in  managing these lands.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Webster of Florida). The time of the  gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.   Mr. LaMALFA. It is time to put an end to the previous  administration's legacy to shut out local input by forcing through a  rule abrogating for public lands decisions based on unelected  bureaucrats in D.C.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague for yielding me time, and I  ask for support of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), who is the majority leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for her  hard work on this bill and bringing it here today. Most people don't  realize just how much land the Federal Government controls, and it is  just a fact that someone thousands of miles away in an office in D.C.  won't understand those land issues as much as the people who live on  the land do.   Now, the sponsor of this bill, Ms. Cheney, knows that in her great  State of Wyoming, they constantly struggle with the Federal Government  over land policies, just as California and many Western States do.  Federal regulators restrict how we can build, what our farmers can  grow, where our ranchers can graze, and how our people can enjoy the  beauty of our land.   The Bureau of Land Management's new rule, the innocently named  Planning 2.0 rule, imposes Washington's vision on land management over  vast areas of the West. This was devised by people who don't live on  our land and who don't know our land, and they just try to dictate how  to use our land. They are undermining the very idea of multiple use of  Federal lands by making the lands entirely off limits for any type of  economic purposes.   Under this rule, the Bureau will cut out local and county officials  even more. They will consolidate control over 175 million acres of land  in 11 States out West, and that is not a small amount of land. Just to  put that in perspective, that is over 261 times the size of Rhode  Island.   Using the Congressional Review Act today, we will be able to overturn  this last-minute power grab from the Obama administration and bring  some power back to the people. The American people should have the  power back again to write their own future.   I want to thank Congresswoman Cheney for keeping her word and for  standing with Wyoming and all those out west who care for their land  and want those locals to be able to control and to understand where it  is best to graze, to care, and to build, not somebody in Washington to  dictate what to do with it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have nearly 100 State and local groups supporting  repeal of BLM 2.0. These are groups like the National Association of  Counties, National Association of Conservation Districts, National  Cattlemen's Beef Association, Public Lands Council, Western Energy  Alliance, National Mining Association, Petroleum Association of  Wyoming, as well as a number of Governors and local officials,  including my home State Governor, Matt Mead.   Mr. Speaker, I include a letter from Governor Mead in support of this  joint resolution and a joint letter from numerous other governmental  and association groups in support of this joint resolution.                                               The State of Wyoming,                                          Office of the Governor,                                          Wyoming, January 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      House Majority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority       Whip Scalise: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recently       published a final rule amending regulations that establish       procedures for Resource Management Planning (RMP) (43 CFR       Part 1600). The final rule decreases the BLM's accountability       for cooperating with state and local  [[Page H1041]]       governments. Specifically, it minimizes state and local       government plans, programs and policies and the important       role these entities should play in final RMP decisions.        This rule is a prime candidate for Congressional analysis       under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). I ask that you       bring this rule to the full House for consideration under the       CRA for a floor debate. The BLM can and must involve state       and local governments in RMP decisions and it must respect       the role of state and local governments.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                   Matthew H. Mead,      Governor.                                   ____                                                   January 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As representatives       of state and local governments and public lands stakeholders       from across the United States, we encourage Congress to use       its legislative authority to review the Bureau of Land       Management's (BLM) Planning 2.0 rule. As partners with the       federal government, we continue to encourage the BLM to       engage in meaningful collaboration with local stakeholders       during the development of policies and guidelines. And       despite representations by the BLM to do just that, we remain       unconvinced that Planning 2.0 in its final form does much to       satisfy the objective of meaningful collaboration and       consultation with non-federal governmental entities.        Robust coordination and cooperation between states and       local governments and the BLM allows federal decision-makers       to be responsive to the concerns of state and local       government officials during policy development and sets the       stage for more effective and efficient implementation of       federal policies by involving multi-jurisdictional resources       and expertise. Simply put, gathering meaningful, on the       ground, input from the states and localities that will be       most impacted by BLM's planning regulations is critical to       ensuring a practical federal policy that works at the local       level.        For years to come, the proposed Planning 2.0 rule will have       a substantial impact on how the BLM engages with state and       local government and manages its 245 million acres of public       lands and 700 million acres of subsurface minerals. We       encourage Congress to act to ensure BLM's Planning 2.0 rule       does not go into effect and instruct the agency to work with       intergovernmental partners to ensure the policy has benefited       from meaningful, on the ground, collaboration with state and       local governments.            Sincerely,          Alaska Municipal League; American Sheep Industry             Association; Arizona Association of Counties; Arizona             County Supervisors Association; Association of Oregon             Counties; Eureka County, Nevada; National Association             of Conservation Districts; National Association of             Counties; National Association of State Departments of             Agriculture; National Cattlemen's Beef Association;             Nevada Association of Conservation Districts.          Nevada Association of Counties; Oregon Association of             Conservation Districts; Public Lands Council; Rural             County Representatives of California; Utah Association             of Conservation Districts; Utah Association of             Counties; Western Interstate Region of NACo; Wyoming             Association of Conservation Districts; Wyoming County             Commissioners Association; Wyoming Stock Growers             Association; Wyoming Wool Growers Association.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, we know that government that is closest to  the people is best. What we have seen over the last 8 years,  unfortunately, in Washington, D.C., has been a massive expansion of the  authority and the overreach of the Federal Government under the Obama  administration. We have seen a number of instances where agencies have  acted outside of the law, in some instances outside of the  Constitution.   BLM 2.0 is an example of where this agency is acting completely  outside of the law. There is absolutely no legal authority, no  statutory language on which they can base this rulemaking, on which  they can base the fundamental changes that they are making and the  fundamental power grab that they are making.   It is hugely important for us, as we go forward here, to make sure  that we have done everything we can to roll back regulations that are  really killing our jobs, that are preventing people in our local  communities from being able to make a living, from being able to  consistently graze, for example, on these public lands. It is  absolutely outside of the law to have a situation, as 2.0 would create,  where people who have never been to these lands, people who, frankly,  may not even be in the United States, have just as much a say in how we  manage our lands as a rancher who has got to graze on those lands or as  the county commissioners who are charged with making decisions about  those lands.   A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  mentioned today the thousands of comments that the BLM sought as they  were going through this rulemaking process. The problem is that there  is very little evidence that any of those comments were taken into  account in the final rulemaking. As I mentioned earlier, the track  record with respect to the BLM listening to and being willing to take  into account local concerns is a very bad one in which you have got  State agencies that are led to believe they will have an impact and  then find themselves having radio silence, essentially, from the BLM.   Mr. Speaker, Planning 2.0 is a dangerous and damaging rule.  Overturning it today, through the Congressional Review Act, through  this joint resolution, will enable us to begin to restore authority  where it belongs: with our local communities, with our local elected  officials. Those who are closest to the land, those who have to work on  the land, those who make a living on the land are the absolute best  stewards of our land and of our resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure to repeal BLM  Planning 2.0.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the previous question is ordered on  the joint resolution.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
