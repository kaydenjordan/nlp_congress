 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of an  entrepreneur, innovator, and philanthropist who truly lived the  American Dream.   In 1975, Nikos Mouyiaris received a $6,000 grant from his brother. He  turned that small loan into a company that would become one of the  world's most prestigious cosmetic manufacturers and developers.   A proud Greek American, Nikos dedicated his life to giving back to  his community, and his spirit demonstrates that we all benefit when we  open our doors to hardworking immigrants who believe in the promise of  America.   Nikos said: ``We are successful not because we are smart; not because  we worked hard; not because we were lucky; but because we had the good  fortune of being able to stand on the shoulders of others.''   As his loved ones mourn this devastating loss, we can take comfort in  knowing that an entire community will be standing on his shoulders.                            ____________________
