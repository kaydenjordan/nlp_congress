 Madam Speaker, I rise today with profound  sadness to mourn the loss and celebrate the life of Ms. Mary Bishop,  director of constituent services for the Ninth District of New York and  my dear friend.   Mary has been with our office and me for more than 15 years. She was  extraordinary and compassionate, with a heart of gold. She embodied  what it meant to be an advocate for the people, and her passing has  been felt across our district.   On a personal note, I will dearly miss Mary. We celebrated together,  laughed together, and shared a passion for the people of the Ninth  District together. Mary Bishop worked hard, played hard, and was a God- fearing Caribbean American woman who loved her family immensely.   On behalf of the people of the Ninth District and the Clarke family,  I want to extend my thoughts and prayers to the family, loved ones,  friends who were touched by the life and legacy of the incomparable  Mary Bishop.   In closing, when I think of Mary, I am reminded of Mahalia Jackson's  ``If I Can Help Somebody.''       If I can help somebody as I travel along,      If I can help someone with a word or a song,      If I can help somebody from doing wrong,      Then my living shall not be in vain.    My dear friend Mary, your living was not in vain. You will be dearly  missed.                            ____________________
