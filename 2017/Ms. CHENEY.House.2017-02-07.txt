 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 91, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 44) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of the Interior relating to Bureau of Land Management  regulations that establish the procedures used to prepare, revise, or  amend land use plans pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management  Act of 1976, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.J. Res. 44.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, BLM Planning 2.0 is yet one more example of Obama-era  Federal Government overreach. It takes authority away from people in  local communities, in my home State of Wyoming, and all across the  West. It takes authority away from our elected representatives at a  local level, and it puts Washington bureaucrats in charge of decisions  that influence and impact our lives.   It significantly dilutes cooperating agency status, and it discounts  input from those who are closest to our land and our resources. BLM 2.0  is an example of the midnight rulemaking that we saw that was so  rampant in the Obama administration. In fact, it is an abuse of that  rulemaking process.   By statute, Mr. Speaker, the BLM is supposed to manage our public  lands for multiple use and for sustained yield, but instead we have  seen consistently throughout the last 8 years the Obama administration  doing everything possible to deny all human use of our public lands.   This rulemaking isn't based on the language of the statute that  underlies it. It is based, rather, on policy preferences that have been  expressed in memos and in various studies. The rulemaking takes another  step in imposing a brand new mitigation formula that essentially is a  land grab by a Federal agency that would put even more land under the  control of Washington bureaucrats.   Despite the fact that these agencies are required to consider costs  as they impose regulations, BLM 2.0 was imposed not only using cost  estimates that are clearly wrong, but, in fact, it removed all  reference to looking at the devastating impact that this rule has on  our local economies across the West.   This rule takes away authority and power from those who know best how  to manage our lands and how to manage our resources. In fact, it opens  up our planning process to such an extent that we could have foreign,  nongovernmental organizations having just as much say in how we manage  our land and resources as the very stakeholders--the ranchers, the  farmers across Wyoming and the West, and the people that they have  elected to speak for them.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this rule takes authority away from those who  know best what we need to do to manage and sustain our resources, and  it puts it in the hands of the Federal Government and bureaucrats here  in Washington, D.C.   Repealing 2.0 using the Congressional Review Act will help to restore  the voices and input. It will help to restore democracy and help to  restore authority to our local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Virginia may not be  completely aware of the implementation and the effect of this rule in  Western States like Wyoming where, for example, the process that has  been described as an open process is, in fact, one where, in my State,  our Department of Environmental Quality on another BLM rule was in a  position where they agreed to be a cooperating agency and then did not  hear from the BLM for 4 years.   When you are talking about our very livelihood, you are in a  situation where we simply can't run that risk. We cannot adopt a rule  or let a rule stand that expands that kind of authority in Washington,  no matter who is in charge in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), who is the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have nearly 100 State and local groups supporting  repeal of BLM 2.0. These are groups like the National Association of  Counties, National Association of Conservation Districts, National  Cattlemen's Beef Association, Public Lands Council, Western Energy  Alliance, National Mining Association, Petroleum Association of  Wyoming, as well as a number of Governors and local officials,  including my home State Governor, Matt Mead.   Mr. Speaker, I include a letter from Governor Mead in support of this  joint resolution and a joint letter from numerous other governmental  and association groups in support of this joint resolution.                                               The State of Wyoming,                                          Office of the Governor,                                          Wyoming, January 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      House Majority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority       Whip Scalise: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recently       published a final rule amending regulations that establish       procedures for Resource Management Planning (RMP) (43 CFR       Part 1600). The final rule decreases the BLM's accountability       for cooperating with state and local  [[Page H1041]]       governments. Specifically, it minimizes state and local       government plans, programs and policies and the important       role these entities should play in final RMP decisions.        This rule is a prime candidate for Congressional analysis       under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). I ask that you       bring this rule to the full House for consideration under the       CRA for a floor debate. The BLM can and must involve state       and local governments in RMP decisions and it must respect       the role of state and local governments.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                   Matthew H. Mead,      Governor.                                   ____                                                   January 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As representatives       of state and local governments and public lands stakeholders       from across the United States, we encourage Congress to use       its legislative authority to review the Bureau of Land       Management's (BLM) Planning 2.0 rule. As partners with the       federal government, we continue to encourage the BLM to       engage in meaningful collaboration with local stakeholders       during the development of policies and guidelines. And       despite representations by the BLM to do just that, we remain       unconvinced that Planning 2.0 in its final form does much to       satisfy the objective of meaningful collaboration and       consultation with non-federal governmental entities.        Robust coordination and cooperation between states and       local governments and the BLM allows federal decision-makers       to be responsive to the concerns of state and local       government officials during policy development and sets the       stage for more effective and efficient implementation of       federal policies by involving multi-jurisdictional resources       and expertise. Simply put, gathering meaningful, on the       ground, input from the states and localities that will be       most impacted by BLM's planning regulations is critical to       ensuring a practical federal policy that works at the local       level.        For years to come, the proposed Planning 2.0 rule will have       a substantial impact on how the BLM engages with state and       local government and manages its 245 million acres of public       lands and 700 million acres of subsurface minerals. We       encourage Congress to act to ensure BLM's Planning 2.0 rule       does not go into effect and instruct the agency to work with       intergovernmental partners to ensure the policy has benefited       from meaningful, on the ground, collaboration with state and       local governments.            Sincerely,          Alaska Municipal League; American Sheep Industry             Association; Arizona Association of Counties; Arizona             County Supervisors Association; Association of Oregon             Counties; Eureka County, Nevada; National Association             of Conservation Districts; National Association of             Counties; National Association of State Departments of             Agriculture; National Cattlemen's Beef Association;             Nevada Association of Conservation Districts.          Nevada Association of Counties; Oregon Association of             Conservation Districts; Public Lands Council; Rural             County Representatives of California; Utah Association             of Conservation Districts; Utah Association of             Counties; Western Interstate Region of NACo; Wyoming             Association of Conservation Districts; Wyoming County             Commissioners Association; Wyoming Stock Growers             Association; Wyoming Wool Growers Association.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, we know that government that is closest to  the people is best. What we have seen over the last 8 years,  unfortunately, in Washington, D.C., has been a massive expansion of the  authority and the overreach of the Federal Government under the Obama  administration. We have seen a number of instances where agencies have  acted outside of the law, in some instances outside of the  Constitution.   BLM 2.0 is an example of where this agency is acting completely  outside of the law. There is absolutely no legal authority, no  statutory language on which they can base this rulemaking, on which  they can base the fundamental changes that they are making and the  fundamental power grab that they are making.   It is hugely important for us, as we go forward here, to make sure  that we have done everything we can to roll back regulations that are  really killing our jobs, that are preventing people in our local  communities from being able to make a living, from being able to  consistently graze, for example, on these public lands. It is  absolutely outside of the law to have a situation, as 2.0 would create,  where people who have never been to these lands, people who, frankly,  may not even be in the United States, have just as much a say in how we  manage our lands as a rancher who has got to graze on those lands or as  the county commissioners who are charged with making decisions about  those lands.   A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  mentioned today the thousands of comments that the BLM sought as they  were going through this rulemaking process. The problem is that there  is very little evidence that any of those comments were taken into  account in the final rulemaking. As I mentioned earlier, the track  record with respect to the BLM listening to and being willing to take  into account local concerns is a very bad one in which you have got  State agencies that are led to believe they will have an impact and  then find themselves having radio silence, essentially, from the BLM.   Mr. Speaker, Planning 2.0 is a dangerous and damaging rule.  Overturning it today, through the Congressional Review Act, through  this joint resolution, will enable us to begin to restore authority  where it belongs: with our local communities, with our local elected  officials. Those who are closest to the land, those who have to work on  the land, those who make a living on the land are the absolute best  stewards of our land and of our resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure to repeal BLM  Planning 2.0.   I yield back the balance of my time.
