 Mr. Speaker, Members, I also want to join my  colleague from Houston in prayers for Houston police officer Nestor  Garcia and his family, but I rise today in support of the 68,000  DREAMers that are in Houston, Harris County, Texas, and throughout our  country, and call on congressional leaders to bring up the Dream Act  for immediate vote.   DREAMers and young men and women who were raised in America know no  other country and are an integral part of our schools, our colleges,  our workforce, and our communities.   During the worst days of Hurricane Harvey, DREAMers helped rescue  neighbors and save lives throughout Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast.  DREAMers are now and will continue to be serving a key role in  rebuilding our city.   President Trump's announcement this month to end the DACA program was  a gut punch to DREAMers who are helping their families and communities  recover from Harvey's destruction.   Congress has a moral obligation to honor the hard work and  aspirations of the current and earlier generations of immigrants and  DREAMers, and bring up the Dream Act for our immediate consideration.                            ____________________
