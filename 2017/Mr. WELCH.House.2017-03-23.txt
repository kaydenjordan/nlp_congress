 Mr. Speaker, and to my friends on the Republican side, you  have got the perfect bill. It cuts taxes, $800 billion, largely at the  high end. It cuts 24 million people off of health care. And it ends the  Medicaid entitlement.   What is the problem?   Bring your bill up here. Now, what you have is not a healthcare bill.  You have a tax-cut bill masquerading as a healthcare bill, and your  hesitation is the collateral damage that you are going to do to the  people who voted for you will become clear. To the hospitals in rural  America we need, that damage will become clear. To the people age 50 to  64, who are going to get hammered, hammered at a point in their life  when, more than ever, they need health care, you are going to stick it  to them. The people who supported you, the people who believed in you  are the people you are turning your back on.   I say, bring your bill up here. Vote it. Take ownership of what it is  you are doing. I welcome your courage in telling rural America that  they don't matter.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to direct their remarks  to the Chair.
