 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak.   I just want to point out the position we are in. We hear that  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can't come together because  Democrats are holding up this bill in the Senate. Well, let's just  examine that for a moment.   Why is it that Leader McConnell can't even get a simple majority in  the Senate for the legislation that this body sent over there with 5  Democratic votes?   It is because the legislation that was passed here was not  constituted of a majority position who support DACA, who support  helping those DREAMers; not constituted of a majority of this body who  want to see not only community health centers funded, but also see CHIP  continued, and who want to see pension protection come to this floor.    I believe that there is a majority in this body that is not  constituted of just 218 Republicans that can come together around these  issues. And as long as the leadership continues to not seek a majority  that could deliver legislation through this body but also has the  chance to gain support in the Senate, we are going to continue to find  ourselves unable to govern.   There is a majority that can work together on these issues. We ought  to seek that majority.
