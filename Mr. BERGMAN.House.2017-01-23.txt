 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The premise of this bill is clear:  American taxpayer dollars will not be used to fund abortion in this  country.  [[Page H594]]    I stand here today as a husband, father, grandfather, and, most  importantly, as someone who cherishes the God-given right to life. In a  country founded on life and liberty, the act of abortion should not be  condoned, and it certainly should not be subsidized.   It is fitting that the House consider this legislation this week as  we prepare for millions of people to come to Washington, D.C., for the  annual March for Life rally where they will give a voice to the unborn.  We must work together to move the pro-life message and pro-life  policies forward to protect those who cannot yet speak for themselves.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion Act, and stand up for the principles of life and liberty.                            ____________________
