 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  Kristen Clarke to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil  Rights Division.   As I have said multiple times, I am not here to call into question  Ms. Clarke's motives, nor am I here to call into question whether she  is a good person. In fact, I am willing to assume and even concede, for  purposes of our conversation today, that she is a good person and that  her motives are good. It is not my job as a Member of the Senate to go  beyond that, but I do have some very serious concerns reflected in  [[Page S2563]]  Ms. Clark's record, concerns that, regrettably, she has failed to  rebut.   First, given the importance of the Civil Rights Division to the  enforcement of our Nation's anti-discrimination laws, I am concerned  about past instances in which she has publicly pushed the Department of  Justice to not pursue egregious instances of voter intimidation.   Ms. Clarke criticized the Department of Justice's decision to  prosecute Ike Brown for voter intimidation and suppression. As a  reminder, in that case, the case involving Ike Brown, a Mississippi  Democratic official engaged in rampant vote manipulation and absentee  ballot fraud.   Rather than praising the Justice Department's successful prosecution  of the case, she criticized the decision, stating that some of the  claims were ``weak.'' When asked point-blank whether she agreed with  DOJ's decision to prosecute two members of the New Black Panther Party  who, by the way, showed up to a polling place wielding a billy club,  she demurred, saying:         I believe the leadership of the Justice Department had the       prerogative to bring the cases that it deemed appropriate to       bring.    Well, that is a completely nonresponsive answer. It is a little like  saying Congress has the prerogative to pass the legislation that it  deems appropriate to pass.   In short, Ms. Clarke was unwilling to decry outrageous voter  suppression and intimidation when Democrats were implicated. She showed  no corresponding hesitancy in challenging commonsense election security  laws, like voter identification requirements, passed by Republican  State legislatures.   Indeed, she has frequently challenged State election laws attempting  to paint ballot security measures as categorically racially  discriminatory, which raises the question: Does Ms. Clarke, in fact,  oppose all voter intimidation or just voter intimidation against  certain groups? When the position the nominee is applying for involves  being the head of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of  Justice--the very division that is responsible for overseeing voter  rights laws--that is not a question that you want to have to ask.   Second, Ms. Clarke has shown a troubling disregard toward certain  constitutional rights. A few years ago, she decried the Trump  administration's creation of a Religious Liberty Task Force, saying  that the goal was ``to make it easier for people to use religion to  mask their discriminatory goals. Shameful.''   I would remind Ms. Clarke that the very first sentence of the Bill of  Rights safeguards the very religious freedoms that she accuses of  ``masking discriminatory goals.''   Again, late last year, Ms. Clarke attacked the Supreme Court's  decision in Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, saying the Court's ruling  wrongly privileged ``religious freedom above all else.''   Now, by way of reference here, just to set the context straight, that  decision in the Supreme Court's ruling in Roman Catholic Diocese v.  Cuomo simply stated that commonsense proposition--one that is, in my  view, unremarkable--that the government must treat mosques and  synagogues and churches the same way that it treats liquor stores and  acupuncture clinics   Statements like these give religious Americans like myself pause. Why  should we believe that she will defend the civil rights, including the  religious rights of all Americans, not just those with whom she happens  to agree?   Finally, I am worried about Ms. Clarke's failure adequately to  address her troubling history of inflammatory statements and  irresponsible activism.   In college, she wrote an article stating that ``Melanin endows Blacks  with greater mental, physical, and spiritual abilities--something which  cannot be measured based on Eurocentric standards.''   Not surprisingly, she was asked about this at the Senate Judiciary  Committee hearing. And when she was asked about it at her hearing, she  claimed this statement was meant to be satirical. But at no point--not  during the hearing, not in connection with followup questions for the  record--did Ms. Clarke ever acknowledge the obvious; that these  statements were unacceptable, regardless of whether she intended them  to be satirical.   Likewise, rather than express regret for her decision to participate  and assist in a conference defending cop killers and domestic  terrorists in law school, she merely said that she ``provided  logistical support.'' That contradicts the statements made by numerous  speakers at the conference who personally thanked her for her efforts.   In preparation for that same conference, Ms. Clarke recommended that  an article entitled ``Mumia, `Lynch Law,' and Imperialism'' be included  in the conference newspaper and discussed in connection with one of the  panels.   That article contains some of the most inflammatory anti-police  rhetoric I have ever seen. Here is a quote from it, an actual quote:  ``The Klan is now the Police, with Blue uniforms replacing the sheets  and hoods. The corrupt racist Judges, are petty Klan administrators.''   When asked about her promotion of this article in her questions for  the record before the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Clarke stated that she  ``ha[d] no independent recollection of that email.''   Now, once again, we have here a complete nonanswer. Ms. Clarke  declined to explain, much less take responsibility for, associating  herself with extraordinarily, obscenely dangerous rhetoric.   Moreover, if Ms. Clarke were to be confirmed, she would be  responsible for overseeing pattern and practice investigations of law  enforcement agencies, which makes her unexplained, inexcusable  involvement with anti-law enforcement activities all the more  troubling.   I would also point out that the article's author, Amiri Baraka, was-- like Professor Martin mentioned a moment ago--famously anti-Semitic. On  one occasion, he wrote, in reference to Jews, that he had ``the  extermination blues.'' So, again, we have Ms. Clarke casually  associating herself with a virulently anti-Semitic thinker.   Ms. Clarke also denied on the record that she had served on the  editorial staff of a college journal with Amiri Baraka. But a simple  Google search of ``Kristen Clarke'' and ``Amiri Baraka'' shows that  when she was an assistant editor of that journal, Amiri Baraka was a  contributing editor. Her denial of this easily verifiable fact is hard  to understand.   Now, let's be perfectly clear. I don't bring any of this up to  suggest that all of it is unforgivable. Look, everyone has, from time  to time, said or done things that they later come to regret, but let's  keep in mind what we are looking at here. Ms. Clarke, herself, is  asking us to apply a very different standard to her than we have  applied to others--a different standard, in many ways, than she has  asked be applied to others.   In 2019, her name appeared on a letter sent by the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, where she sat on the board of  directors of that organization, opposing the nomination of a lawyer  named Ryan Bounds, who had been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That letter stated that, ``[w]hile  [Bounds] recently apologized for those comments''--comments that had  come up in connection with his confirmation proceedings--``the timing  of that apology suggests it is one of convenience rather than remorse,  offered in a last-ditch effort to salvage his nomination.''   In her hearing testimony, Ms. Clarke provided no explanation for why  we should overlook her extraordinarily controversial activities and  statements while she was a student. Rather, she attempted to minimize  or, in some cases, even evade her actions.   Ms. Clarke's history of irresponsible actions and words didn't end  with law school. In 2019, she signed a letter defending Tamika Mallory,  a woman who stated that ``white Jews'' ``uphold white supremacy'' and  associated herself with Louis Farrakhan.   When pressed on this point, she gave no explanation for her statement  of support, other than saying that the letter ``denounce[d] . . .  antisemitism.''   Now, I am confused. How can a letter defending a woman accused of  making anti-Semitic statements actually be a letter that is denouncing  anti-Semitism? Either anti-Semitism is bad or it is not. You can't have  your cake and eat it too. The way I read that letter, I don't see the  letter as saying, yes,  [[Page S2564]]  that statement was bad, but there are other circumstances that should  be considered. Instead, I see a wholehearted defense of the individual  herself.   Likewise, just last year, Ms. Clarke wrote an article titled ``I  Prosecuted Police Killings, Defund the Police--But Be Strategic.''   When pressed about this by my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee,  Ms. Clarke, once again, sought to evade responsibility, saying that she  has ``developed a practice of being deferential to editors on title  selection.'' But I don't think that is how this works. The article  does, in fact, have her name on it. Even if she were deferential, the  fact that she is describing herself as deferential here suggests that  she did, in fact, make a conscious decision to defer. She didn't say: I  had absolutely no choice in it. I didn't see the title. She just said  that she adopted a practice of being deferential.   In any event, you can hardly blame the editor for the title that he  or she chose. Ms. Clarke wrote three times in that piece--three times-- ``We must invest less in police.''   In short, Ms. Clarke's record reflects a consistent pattern of  inflammatory statements and actions, followed by a disclaimer of  responsibility and a lack of candor and remorse. Moreover, her record  gives us reason to doubt that she will defend the civil rights of all  Americans, not just her political allies.   For these reasons, I regretfully cannot support her nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
