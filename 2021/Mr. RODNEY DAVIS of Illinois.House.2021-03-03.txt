 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), another great friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a mediocre friend, not a great  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), another mediocre friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the en bloc. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed), a good friend and a problem solver.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who can take you on  a tour of the best Philly cheesesteak places in the world.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Naples, Florida, (Mr. Donalds), my good friend, who  represents many of my former constituents from Illinois who have left  Illinois because of overtaxation.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15  seconds to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, before I reserve, can I  make a parliamentary inquiry?   When a mask falls down unintentionally from a speaker, what is the  rule?    Is this being enforced equally on the  majority and minority?    So I should ask the second-rate  parliamentarian off the floor?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew), my good friend and best- dressed member of our conference.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record  a summary of letters submitted yesterday by the Institute for Free  Speech and others opposing  H.R. 1.                                       Institute for Free Speech,                                                      March 3, 2021.      Re H.R. 1 Would Greatly Harm Free Speech.         Dear Representative: The Institute for Free Speech strongly       opposes H.R. 1, the Orwellian For the People Act. More       appropriately known as the For the Politicians Act, this       radical bill would, in fact, greatly harm the ability of the       people to freely speak, publish, organize into groups, and       petition their elected representatives in pursuit of a better       government.        In particular, H.R. 1 would impose onerous and unworkable       standards on the ability of Americans and groups of Americans       to discuss the policy issues of the day with elected       officials and the public. Certain sections of the bill would       violate the privacy of advocacy groups and their supporters,       limit political speech on the internet, and compel speakers       to recite lengthy government-mandated messages identifying       some of their supporters by name in their communications.        Importantly, these restrictions would reach far beyond       campaign speech to regulate discussion of legislative issues       and public affairs. For advocacy groups, unions, and trade       associations, several of the limits proposed in H.R. 1 would       operate as a total ban on speech        If signed into law, all of these provisions would be       interpreted and enforced by a newly partisan Federal Election       Commission. Under H.R. 1, the Commission would be radically       transformed from its historic and deliberately bipartisan       structure to one under partisan control of the president. As       nine former members of the Federal Election Commission with a       combined 60 plus years of service warned in a recent letter       to Congress, the likely impact would be to shrink public       confidence in the impartial enforcement of campaign finance       laws, weaponize these regulations for partisan gain, and       silence much political speech through new rules on groups       that speak about public affairs        H.R. 1 would also force Americans to pay for speech they       oppose. This new financing system is a riverboat gamble on an       untested--and costly--scheme that would have many unforeseen       effects. Existing research has proven that similar schemes       elsewhere have failed to achieve proponents' stated goals.       Instead, the program will likely incentivize--and subsidize--      candidates with hateful messages, create new avenues for       corruption, increase polarization, give government greater       control over campaigns, waste tax dollars, and fail markedly       at improving the quality of governance or the diversity of       those who are elected to higher office        At its core, H.R. 1 would greatly increase the already high       legal and administrative compliance costs, liability risk,       and costs to donor and associational privacy for civic groups       that speak about policy issues. Organizations will be further       deterred from speaking or will have to divert additional       resources away from their advocacy activities to pay for       compliance staff and lawyers. Some groups will not be able to       afford these costs or will violate the law unwittingly. The       effect will be less speech by Americans and organizations,       allowing politicians to act with less accountability to       public opinion and criticism.        Few bills are more antithetical to the text of and       principles underlying the First Amendment than H.R. 1. The       numerous, overlapping, and interrelated provisions in this       legislation combine to impose and tighten severe government       controls on speech about campaigns, judicial nominees, and       policy issues in truly shocking ways. Any American lacking       expertise in campaign finance law would have little to no       hope of understanding this bill or the voluminous       restrictions it proposes on political speech and association.       The sad result will be a political discourse dominated by       Washington, DC insiders. Far from being For the People, H.R.       1 is truly For the Politicians.        The best way to give the American people a voice and to       safeguard democracy is to protect and enhance the right to       free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. While the       Institute takes no position on the myriad provisions in H.R.       1 that deal with election administration, voting rights, and       redistricting, the portions of H.R. 1 that trample on free       speech are sufficient to warrant our firm opposition to this       measure. For the above reasons, the Institute for Free Speech       strongly opposes passage of H.R. 1.            Sincerely,                                                     David Keating,      President.                                   ____                                Illinois House of Representatives,                                 Springfield, IL, February 19, 2021.      To: Illinois Federal Delegation      Fr: Illinois Representative Joe Sosnowski, 69th District,           Illinois House of Representatives        To the Illinois Federal Delegation: As a state legislator       elected to be a voice for the people of Illinois, I write to       express my opposition to H.R. 1/S. 1, an unconstitutional       takeover of citizens' right to free speech and association.        As elected officials, we both have a duty to represent our       constituents best interests and a responsibility to defend       the United States Constitution. Therefore, it is my       obligation to urge you to oppose the deceptively named For       the People Act. The legislation is ill-considered and deeply       unconstitutional, and I have seen firsthand the chilling       effects of the donor disclosure provisions that it would       enact.        As a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a       membership organization of state legislators dedicated to       principles of limited government, free markets and       federalism. In 2013, activists launched a campaign to reveal,       then harass and shame, the ALEC donor base. Their goal was       simple: Harassing ALEC donors and corporate members would       chill their participation with and support for the       organization, ultimately cutting off a funding source for       ALEC.        Worse, public elected officials used their platform to       heighten this threat of donor disclosure in order to further       intimidate ALEC supporters. In 2013, every company       tangentially associated with ALEC received an official letter       from US Senator Richard Durbin, demanding to know whether it       had served as a member of ALEC or provided any funding to       ALEC, with the intent of intimidating them. Durbin wrote that       he would read their responses into the official Congressional       record, forever memorializing their support and creating a       public target list for activists opposed to the organization.       Even the Chicago Tribune, the Senator's hometown newspaper       that had endorsed his candidacy, rebuked Durbin's attempt at       creating an enemies list by using his high federal office as       a cudgel against his enemies.        H.R. 1/S. 1 would institutionalize this harassment and       intimidation and extend it to all nonprofits, regardless of       their issue area or political persuasion. Whatever issues you  [[Page H1035]]       support or oppose, this should be of serious concern to you.       If this legislation is enacted, passionate activists on both       sides of the aisle would have access to a government-run       database of donors who give to every organization from ALEC       and the Family Research Council to the ACLU and Planned       Parenthood. Does anyone doubt that the blunt instrument of       donor disclosure in H.R. 1/S. 1 would put millions of       Americans' peace and livelihoods at risk of significant,       material harm?        These tactics are flimsy bureaucratic structures designed       to harass nonprofits and chill speech, despite fundamental       violations of the First Amendment. In keeping with today's       cancel culture, H.R. 1/S. 1 is a government-sanctioned       attempt to chill speech and participation. Good governance       watchdogs argue this measure increases transparency.       Transparency is good when applied to government, but when it       strips away Constitutionally protected privacy for       individuals, it is exceedingly dangerous. For the federal       government to expose our constituents as supporters of any       nonprofit's cause would be an enormous overreach of       centralized power.        If passed, the donor disclosure provisions in H.R. 1/S. 1       would bludgeon our democratic institutions and threaten the       safety and peace of our everyday constituents. It would       further normalize the darkness of cancel culture and       intimidation through overregulation in American society.       Therefore, we call on you to oppose H.R. 1/S. 1.            Sincerely,      Representative Joe Sosnowski,        69th District, Illinois House of Representatives, Illinois       ALEC State Chair.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, over the last couple of days, I have spoken a lot  about my opposition to this bill's creation of a public fund filled  with dollars from corporate fines to directly fund the campaign coffers  of every Member of this institution and candidates.   And my Democrat colleagues have continued to say this isn't public  funding or corporate donations because it is corporate fines.   So what is the truth?   I think my chart here tells the story. So we have corporate fines.  That is corporate dollars, something that we, as Members of Congress in  our campaigns, cannot accept right now. Those corporate dollars that  pay these corporate fines that we set the levels of in this  institution, they then go to the U.S. Government in this new--that H.R.  1 creates--the Freedom From Influence Fund.   It is really a laundering machine. So they launder that corporate  money that we cannot accept right now into the Treasury and it comes  out clean as public money. It is money that used to be used for things  like the Crime Victims Fund. Instead, this new laundered money, this  taxpayer money--because it is public, it is under the control of us-- then goes out exponentially to all of us, to our campaigns to pay for  attack ads, fundraisers, mailers, phone calls, whatever you want.   But either way, it is government spending--government sending  corporate dollars directly to us. This is, and should be, prohibited,  but H.R. 1 changes that and it puts more money into politics and not  less.   How about the Crime Victims Fund or victims of domestic violence get  these dollars?   Let's make sure that we address programs that deal with sexual  assault, child abuse, and other crimes. This money will not go into the  Crime Victims Fund because it is going to all of us. All 50 State  attorneys general have told us that this vital Crime Victims Fund is  nearly depleted. But instead of plussing it up, here we are today,  funding our own campaigns with a ``yes'' vote.   Madam Speaker, this bill isn't for the people. It is for the  politicians. This is why I am offering a motion to recommit so that we  can put forward a bill that works for the American people.   Madam Speaker, if we adopt this motion to recommit, we will instruct  the Committee on House Administration to consider an amendment to  remove all public financing from this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, it is one reason I am  opposed to H.R. 1, and giving Democrats another chance to join me,  stopping this charade, stopping enriching themselves in their own  campaign. This is one last chance before you do it again.   Madam Speaker, another reason I oppose H.R. 1 is because the election  mandates on States in this bill go against what our Founding Fathers  intended and essentially nationalizes our election system.   If signed into law, H.R. 1 would be the greatest expansion of the  Federal Government's role in our elections than we have ever seen. By  moving these decisions to D.C., we are further removing people from the  laws that govern their elections. People should have more say in how  their elections are run, not less. Our goal is to always ensure all  eligible voters are able to vote and all lawful votes are counted. That  is not what H.R. 1 does. And the only witness who has run an election  before said during the single House Administration hearing held on this  bill that H.R. 1 will undermine many of the election laws States have  put into place to make it easier for people to vote and improve their  election process for their voters.   One-size-fits-all mandates from Washington will not fix the problems  we have seen in elections across the country. They will just cause more  chaos and confusion. These issues need to be solved at the local and  State level. Instead of dictating to States, we should be working with  them and localities to address these issues. And I stand ready and  willing to work with my Democrat colleagues to do just that, but I will  not vote for a Federal takeover of elections and I will not vote to use  the Federal Government to put more money into my campaign. It is bad  policy and it is bad for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for the motion to recommit at the  appropriate time, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1130     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to request a meeting with the  Parliamentarian. I personally witnessed one of my Democratic colleagues  immediately remove his mask and was never told to put it back on from  the Chair at the time. So all we ask for is consistency.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. I urge support for  the motion to recommit. I urge my Democratic colleagues: Don't vote to  put money into your own campaigns.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
