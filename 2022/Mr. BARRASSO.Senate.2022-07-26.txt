 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the Biden energy crisis that is affecting our country.   Now, Joe Biden has been threatening to declare a climate emergency.  Democrats from New England, Members of this body, have been practically  begging him to do so. They actually went to Massachusetts with him last  week to try to twist his arm.   Democrats say this would give Joe Biden even more legal authority to  restrict American energy. So that is what the Democrats want these  days: less American energy--more expensive American energy, less  American energy, and more power for Joe Biden.   Well, I have got bad news for the Democrats. The Supreme Court has  ruled very recently, less than a month ago, that energy regulation  requires ``clear congressional authorization.''   Congress writes the laws. It is the President who is just supposed to  carry out the laws that are written by Congress. The President doesn't  have the authority to just do whatever he wants by saying we have a  climate crisis and then calling it an emergency. But Democrats are far  too eager to give more and more of the Senate's power to the least  popular President in the last 70 years.   Democrats say we have a crisis right now. Well, they are right about  the fact that we have a crisis. We have a lot of crises in this  country, and they are crises because of Joe Biden and because of the  Democrats and the policies of this administration. We have an energy  crisis. We have an inflation crisis. We have a crisis at the southern  border. We have a crisis of crime in the cities. And as we come to the  end of another month, millions of families are facing a crisis at home  trying to pay their bills. The result is that Democrats have a crisis  too. It is a crisis in the White House and in the party, a crisis of  competence and a crisis of credibility.   Two-thirds of Americans say that this President and the Democrats are  focusing on the wrong things. There was a poll last week in the New  York Times. It showed that only 1 percent of Americans--1 percent--say  climate change is their No. 1 priority. Now, that is of all people.  What about Democrats? Only 3 percent of Democrats say that the idea of  what the President is focusing on and trying to declare an emergency  on, a national emergency--only 3 percent of Democrats say it is their  top priority. What about the young people, the people who the Democrats  always say: We appeal to the young people? Only 3 percent of people  under the age of 30, voters under the age of 30, say that climate is  their No. 1 concern.   The numbers are astonishing, and the President continues to ignore  it. Working families aren't thinking about what the White House is  calling the liberal world order, which is why the President wants to  declare a climate crisis. Working families are trying to balance their  checkbooks, trying to make it to the end of the month with some money  left over to pay the bills.   People say: What do families want? I know, in my home State of  Wyoming, I talk to families at the grocery on Sunday, traveling the  State Saturday. We had folks all around the State coming together for  Frontier Days in Cheyenne. People want to be able to pay for a full  tank of gas. They want to be able to go to the grocery store and buy  groceries for a week. And they want to have money left over at the end  of the month--and the end of the month is coming--to pay their bills.  That is all they are asking. Under this administration, they have been  falling further and further behind, and it is becoming almost  impossible to do those three simple things.    A survey from Bloomberg last week found that 60 percent of workers  say they are worried that they can't support their family. They were  doing it beforehand, but they can't do it now.  [[Page S3666]]  You read stories of people losing sleep over the economy and their own  financial well-being--or not-so-well-being.   People are putting off their dreams; they are giving up on their  dreams and their hopes for themselves and their kids. The Joint Tax  Committee has looked into this and said the average American family has  already paid $1,500 extra for energy under Joe Biden as President.  People are paying about $100 a week extra, more than they were when Joe  Biden came into office, just to buy the things that they were buying  last year.   So now here we are about halfway through this year, and it is really  adding up. As a result, the savings rate is the lowest it has been  since the great recession in 2009. No wonder consumer confidence has  dropped again. The numbers are out this morning, and you look at the  headlines. Here is one. It says, in July, consumer confidence slipped  for the third month in a row, nearing pandemic lows. It goes on to say  confidence is down 24 percent since last July. Inflation continues to  bite. Inflation continues to bite.   That is why credit card debt is at a record high. This year, American  people have opened millions of new credit card accounts just to pay for  the daily issues of life struggles.   So my question is: Who are the 3 percent of Democrats who think  climate change is their top priority? I know some are Members of this  body. Well, they all seem to work here in Washington.   One of them is John Kerry, clearly. Last week, we found out that John  Kerry--who I think is a climate czar or whatever his title is at the  White House--has now taken 48 official trips on a private jet, his  private jet as Joe Biden's climate czar. In total, those 48 trips have  put 325 metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere.   Thank you, John Kerry. You know better than we do, though.   Now, this is what a vehicle would emit in 20 years. So John Kerry is  flying around lecturing the rest of us from his position of smug  superiority, and he emits more carbon and a lot more hot air than  almost anyone on the face of the Earth.   If Democrats cared about our climate, they would tell John Kerry to  park the plane and go home to one of your mansions. Even for Democrats,  the hypocrisy is astonishing.   What about another one of these people who are focused on such a  small amount of the 3 percent as well? How about Pete Buttigieg,  Secretary of Transportation, Mayor Pete? Last week, he said this:         The more pain that we are all experiencing from the high       price of gas, the more benefit there is--    The more pain you are suffering, men and women and families all  around America, the more benefit there is--       for those who can access electric vehicles.    How tone deaf. And this guy wants to be President. I would remind  Mayor Pete that the wealthy who can afford electric vehicles will be  just fine; it is everybody else who is suffering right now. Mayor Pete  seems to think pain at the pump is a good thing for America--not the  America that I live in, not the America that the people of Wyoming live  in. The great majority of the American people don't feel that pain at  the pump is a good thing, but probably a number of Members of this  Senate body do.   Mayor Pete seems to like these high prices. He testified before the  House last week and was asked about the cost of electric vehicles.  Well, the average cost of electric vehicles is about $55,000. Oh, the  price of electric vehicles, you may have noted, Mr. President, is up 18  percent this year due to Joe Biden inflation. Inflation is hitting  everything and everyone. Even the electric vehicles are much more  expensive now.   Does Mayor Pete think people have that kind of money sitting around?  Do Members of this body, the Democrats, think that people have that  kind of money available? People can't afford to eat. They can't afford  to drive their cars. They can't afford to buy a full tank of gasoline.   PBS ran a story last week about senior citizens moving in together.  Why? Because they couldn't afford their rent expenses. That is what  people are experiencing under Joe Biden's Presidency.   And where does Mayor Pete think electricity comes from? He was a  mayor; he should know. Right now in Texas, people with electric  vehicles are being told not to plug in their electric vehicles between  3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Don't plug them in. Well, why? To avoid overtaxing  the grid, to avoid a brownout in communities.   This is at a point where you don't have that many electric vehicles  in the economy and in the country. What if Biden got his way and more  and more people were driving electric vehicles? We would have a  blackout every day in the Joe Biden economy.   Now, electric vehicles can take hours and hours and hours to fully  charge. Not everybody can wait that long. Not everybody has a job where  they can email it in. A lot of people have to show up in person. They  certainly have to in Wyoming. They have to work with their hands.   There is still a big gap in this country between renewable energy and  reliable energy, and we need reliable energy. We need it all. Two- thirds of our energy grid still comes from traditional forms of energy.   Higher cost for energy? What does it mean? It means higher costs for  everything else. And that is what people are seeing all around the  country in Joe Biden's economy. For 15 months in a row now, prices have  gone up faster than wages. So for 15 months in a row--that means for  each of those months, people can afford less than they could the month  before. Right now for the American people, as you saw from the consumer  confidence numbers that are out today, there is no end in sight.   Later this week, we are going to find out a couple of things about  the economy. Tomorrow, we are going to find out how much the Federal  Reserve is going to raise rates. In the last 4 months, we have seen the  largest increase in 40 years, and they are likely to go up again this  week. Mortgage rates have doubled in the last 7 months.   Why is the Federal Reserve doing this? Well, they are taking  desperate measures to try to fix the inflation that Joe Biden and the  Democrats have forced onto the country. If there had been no inflation  crisis, the Fed wouldn't be raising rates like this. So the blame for  the rate increase is not on the Fed; it is on the Democrats. They are  the ones whose policies--the Democrats in this body and the Democrats  in the White House and the Democrats in the House--made the rate hikes  necessary. The Federal Reserve is just trying to throw on the emergency  brake because of inflation.   Joe Biden--and his spending, and he wants to spend more--is the guy  who is fueling the inflation in a car that we just cannot afford to see  crash. On Thursday, we are going to find out if maybe the car has  already crashed because on Thursday, we will find out if we are  officially in a recession. But it doesn't really matter if it is  official or not because the American people can already feel the pain  of a recession.   Two-thirds of the public has already made a decision in their own  mind that we are in a recession right now. That is how they are feeling  the impact on their lives. Four out of five Americans think that this  country is on the wrong track under the Democrats and under Joe Biden.  Yet the Democrats, with their desire to do more and more spending, and  Joe Biden trying to do his Build Back Better routine--they want to keep  us going right over the cliff. The Biden administration has to be the  most out-of-touch administration since at least Herbert Hoover.   It is time to reverse course. Stop the attacks on American energy. We  have some of the largest energy reserves in the world here in the  United States. We have plenty of it in my home State of Wyoming. We  ought to be using it. We have the best energy workers. We have the  highest environmental standards of anywhere on planet Earth.   So the crisis facing our Nation right now is a crisis of choice: an  energy crisis, an inflation crisis, a border crisis, a crime crisis-- all chosen by the Democrats and their policies.   Elections are coming. Midterm elections are a report card of the  President halfway through a 4-year term. People are going to send a  message that they are eager to change direction from the many crises  that have been brought upon this Nation by Joe Biden and his liberal  Democrat enablers--a crisis that the President and the Democrats are  unwilling and unable to correct.
