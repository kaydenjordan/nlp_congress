 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for this time and  opportunity to speak in support of H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right  to Organize Act.   Unions are the backbone of northwest Indiana's economy, and we must  do all we can to strengthen the ability for all workers to form unions.  For far too long, State and Federal policies have targeted union  workers and their ability to position themselves and leverage.   Today, we change that. Today, we have the backs of working families.  When workers can stand together and form a union, they have the ability  to use their collective voice for fair wages, safe working conditions,  improved health benefits, and a more secure retirement.   Organized labor is essential to creating opportunities for all  individuals to have a good-paying career where they can take care of  themselves and their families.   I believe that the divide in our Nation is by workers believing they  will be left behind. The PRO Act will lift up workers and unite  workers.   I thank Chairman Scott for this time, and I urge all of my colleagues  to support the PRO Act so that we can move forward in creating an  economy that works for everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International  Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers.                   International Union of Bricklayers and Allied                                                   Craftworkers,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.        Dear House Members: On behalf of the International Union of       Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC), I am writing to       express our strong support for the Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 842. The PRO Act is historic       legislation that will help level the playing field and       provide workers the opportunity to freely exercise their       right to organize a union. President Biden captured this       fundamental principle clearly and succinctly when he told       America's workers and companies that ``The choice to join a       union is up to the workers--full stop.''        BAC is proud of the relationship that we share with our       signatory employers across the United States to provide vital       building and construction services to the communities we live       in. However, our members, and just as importantly the       contractors that hire them, are under assault by unscrupulous       corporations and employers that abuse and deny their workers       from having a meaningful voice in the workplace. The PRO Act       would help address these abuses and provide workers a fair       shot at forming a union of their choice to bargain for better       wages, benefits, and conditions in the workplace.        Too often, employers intentionally violate the law during       organizing campaigns because some of the penalties are so       weak that low road employers just view them as a small cost       of doing the business of union busting. The PRO act       strengthens penalties for such behavior in order to deter       employers from interfering with worker's rights.        The PRO Act also clarifies the definition of independent       contractor and supervisor to help prevent the       misclassification of workers. Misclassification is far too       common in construction and other industries and it prevents       workers from exercising their rights, getting the pay and       benefits they deserve, and deprives communities of much-      needed revenue through tax evasion.        Our economy is out of balance and it is time for Congress       to step up to protect working class families and restore       economic stability. We urge you to support the PRO Act and       oppose any weakening amendments when the House of       Representatives considers the bill.            Sincerely,                                               Timothy J. Driscoll,                                                         President.
