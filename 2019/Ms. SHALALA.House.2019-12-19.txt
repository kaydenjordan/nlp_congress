 Mr. Speaker, today millions of Americans are working to  pay off their student debt. This is already an enormous burden for  those who have graduated from reputable schools, but it is nearly  impossible for those who attend schools that failed to live up to their  responsibilities to their students.   Predatory for-profit institutions recruit students with false  promises and leave them with worthless degrees and thousands of dollars  of debt. These schools are prone to sudden closure, leaving students  stranded, with no recourse to continue their education.   The College Affordability Act works to solve these pressing issues  that plague far too many students. The bill would prevent sudden  closure of colleges by requiring creditors to act on warning signs.  Finally, it would close the GI Bill loophole that allows for-profit  colleges to take advantage of our brave veterans.   I urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation and hold the  schools accountable to their students.                            ____________________
