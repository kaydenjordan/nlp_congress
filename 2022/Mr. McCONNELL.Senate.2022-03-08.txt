 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as I mentioned yesterday, Senators  had the chance to hear directly from Ukraine's President Zelenskyy over  the weekend. He and his constituents--the brave people of Ukraine--have  won the hearts and minds of all of us all across the world.   Their pain, of course, is Putin's fault, but as I and others warned  for weeks before the invasion, that pain has been compounded by the  West's hesitation and sluggishness in helping Ukraine prepare for this  onslaught, which we could all see coming. This crisis was not only  foreseeable; it was, in fact, foreseen.   Republicans spent months urging President Biden to put more lethal  aid in Ukrainian hands before Russian invasion made those deliveries  much more difficult. We urged the administration to reinforce our  eastern flank NATO partners before Putin escalated his war against  Ukraine rather than playing catchup. We called for heavier sanctions  before Putin had fully committed his forces and his pride. We warned  repeatedly that the Biden administration must not let these actions be  slowed down to the speed of bureaucracy. But that is, of course, what  happened.   As President Zelenskyy himself said publicly last week, while he  appreciates all the Western help, much of it is ultimately arriving  ``too late.''   The Biden administration is now finally doing many of the things they  slow-walked months ago as too provocative or too escalatory: providing  Stingers, sharing intelligence, deploying more forces to NATO's eastern  flank, finally, getting out of the way of sanctioning Nord Stream 2.   Now, as supplies dwindle and safe resupply and transit corridors  narrow, friends of Ukraine will have to work even harder to help the  citizens and their government stay in the fight.   It has been obvious for some time that Ukraine would benefit from  receiving Soviet-era aircraft and air defense systems from our eastern  flank NATO partners that still maintain inventories of such weapons.  The United States can help these allies worried about giving up such  capabilities by helping to backfill with American-made and NATO- standard weapons. I understand the administration may be finally coming  around to support this but, again, at the stately pace of bureaucracy.  This needs to get done and get done yesterday.   (Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.)   Meanwhile, the Congress is acting; that includes additional security  assistance funding for Ukraine and for our eastern flank NATO allies in  the supplemental appropriations bill, along with funding for loan  guarantees to help eastern flank countries buy American weapons to  shore up our collective defenses.   I appreciate the Democratic leader working in good faith to  accommodate my request that the funding bill significantly increase the  security assistance drawdown fund available to the President and to  backfill our DOD stockpiles that are helping our friends in harm's way.  I hope we finalize those steps soon.   This supplemental is urgent, but the fact is, the White House has,  thus far, taken steps to limit their own options and made them miss the  window to provide impactful assistance. This administration not only  reportedly refused a request prior to the conflict to increase the  number of U.S. military trainers in the country but moved the advisers  we had to the far west of the country and then pulled them from the  country entirely, like they also pulled out our entire diplomatic  mission.   These noncombat advisers could have helped facilitate more shipments  of weapons to the field and more training to teach Ukrainians how to  use them. They could have laid important logistical groundwork to  ensure weapons could continue to flow through the frontlines after the  conflict began.   In area after area, the record shows the Biden administration pulled  their punches, even though everyone knew--knew--that the war was  coming, and even so, the Ukrainians are mounting an incredible and  brave resistance.   Imagine where these brave people might be now if the administration  had moved at the speed of necessity rather than the snail's pace of  bureaucracy. Now we must commit to keep lethal aid flowing.   We have to continue strengthening NATO and deepening our security  partnerships and interoperability with other European partners. We need  to encourage more commitments like the German Chancellor's recent  announcement that they will massively step up their investment in their  own defense and in NATO. And perhaps most important of all, we cannot  have Washington politicians in the business of shortchanging our own  defense spending at the very time when we are pleading with Western  Europe to increase theirs.   We have to lead by example and make the kind of robust investments  needed for long-term competition with Russia and China.   In the meantime, the sobering reality is that Ukraine is very likely  to see more and escalating brutalities in the days and the weeks ahead.  The world remembers the butchery in Grozny and the cold-blooded  targeting in Aleppo, and the world will remember this moment as Russia  sics conscripts on Ukrainian civilians and arrests its own people when  they object.   For all of the Kremlin's lies about Ukraine, about how it is  supposedly just an extension of Russia and its people are really  Russians, we now know for certain that Russians and Ukrainians do have,  in fact, at least one thing in common: Vladimir Putin considers their  lives equally disposable.                             Biden Administration    Mr. President, now on a related matter, the price of gas jumped more  in the past week than any week on record. This, of course, began long  before Russia invaded Ukraine. Even before that, families across  America were paying dramatically higher gas prices than they faced when  President Biden took office. I expect our Democratic friends will now  try to blame the entire increase in prices on our efforts to punish on  Russia, but don't be fooled. This is more than a year in the making.   Back in November, President Biden's Secretary of Energy was asked  about any efforts--any efforts--to ramp up production of our own  abundant American energy, and she literally laughed at the question.  ``That is hilarious,'' Secretary Granholm said.   The Secretary suggested that increasing domestic production would be  futile because the market for oil is global. Well, it sure is. But  right now the free world is considering making this market a little bit  less global to punish Russia for its brutal conquests in Ukraine.   So it would sure be nice if America had gone into this crisis with  more headroom on supply and on gas prices. Just 3 years ago, under  Republican policies, we had become a net oil exporter for the first  time since World War II.   But Democrats are completely committed to their ideological holy war  on affordable energy. From the campaign trail, then-candidate Biden  promised, ``I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel.'' And in  office, the Biden administration has used its considerable Executive  authority to actively target affordable American-made oil and natural  gas.   On his first day in office, the President canceled the pipeline  project that would have sped the safe transport of reliable fuel. The  very next week, he suspended all new Federal leases on oil and natural  gas exploration.   So Washington Democrats spent months trying to pass policies that  would drive the most affordable, reliable, and abundant forms of  America energy--and the jobs they support--literally into extinction.   Just yesterday, as even our Western European friends are realizing  that green fantasies can't fuel their countries and are trying to turn  back toward nuclear, coal, and domestic natural gas, Biden  administration officials gave a press conference where they repeated  the same--the very same--platitudes about renewables.   You really can't make this stuff up. The Democrats in charge of the  United States of America want us to embrace the same failed strategies  from which our European friends are frantically backpedaling as fast as  they can.  [[Page S1026]]    So while the Ukrainians are fighting Russia, Democrats are trying to  fight a war on the law of supply and demand. They only want to have to  look at solar panel and windmills here at home. So they want to get our  oil and gas from everywhere else, but many of the biggest players in  the global market are countries that don't much care for the United  States. And now the Biden administration's green hostility to domestic  energy production has been going hat in hand begging our antagonists to  increase production. After spending a year hammering America's own  energy producers, the Biden administration appears to be commencing a  world tour to try to buy oil from people who don't like us.   As I mentioned yesterday, the administration appears close to a deal  that would help Iran enrich more nuclear material and enrich its  economy by lifting oil export sanctions.   Reports also suggest U.S. officials have met with the Maduro regime  with the aim of relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil as well. This  administration wants to ramp up energy imports from Iran and Venezuela?  That is the world's largest state sponsor of terror and a thuggish  South American dictator, respectively.   So they would rather buy from these people than buy from Texas,  Alaska, or Pennsylvania. Just let that sink in.   The administration is also apparently making similar overtures to  Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the Saudis are not an adversary like these  other countries, but I doubt the American people are thrilled to see  President Biden trying to increase our dependence on Middle Eastern oil  and OPEC while declaring America's own resources off limits.   A green light for the Arabian Gulf and a red one for the Gulf of  Mexico--what sense does that make? The political left thinks that  affordable energy is dirty and bad so they are happy to export the  dirty work and import the oil. Let's ask our friends in Europe how that  plays out.   Outsourcing even more production to dictators and theocrats is not  the answer. Dumping more subsidies into solar panels and charging  stations, praying everything works out, is not the answer. The answer  is to let Americans produce American energy.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
