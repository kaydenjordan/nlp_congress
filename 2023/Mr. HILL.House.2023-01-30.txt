 Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the chairman of the  Financial Services Committee, and I thank the ranking member in the  118th Congress, Ms. Waters, for her work on this bipartisan bill, H.R.  298, Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act, sponsored  by Alex Mooney, our Member from West Virginia, certainly a very rural  place, mountainous, tough to get around, a lot like Arkansas.   Small businesses, as the chairman said, are the backbone of the  economy in Arkansas, as they are across the country. Almost 50 percent  of jobs in  [[Page H504]]  this Nation are with traditional small businesses. Yet, they face  obstacles in getting the capital they need to grow and create jobs  under the best of circumstances, in Los Angeles or in Charlotte, the  financial capital of the east. These greater challenges are really  tough when you get out in the country. In Arkansas, almost all but two  counties in our State are deeply rural.   I was a bank president in a town of 100 people, in a county of 7,000.  When you talk about capital needs, that was certainly the case. That is  why I can support this wholly bipartisan legislation that would direct  the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of the Advocate for  Small Business Capital Formation to study the problems faced by those  small businesses, entrepreneurs, owners, and family businesses, that  want to access capital to grow.   This bill passed this House last July with bipartisan support, and so  it should do it again today. It sends a message that Congress is  fighting to help our small businesses out in rural areas. It is  critical. We want them to thrive.                                time  1730    Sadly, this Securities and Exchange Commission and its chairman, Gary  Gensler, don't have this as a priority, Mr. Speaker. Their priority is  not helping capital formation or helping small businesses thrive. In  fact, they are trying to choke it off with their regulatory burden.   I am glad to see that Congress is weighing in to say this is  important. Our young people in rural communities are also facing an  additional crisis, which is, how do we create opportunities for high  school students in rural counties that can't afford a 4-year college  degree or don't want to saddle themselves with debt, and that means  creating a path to pursue a skilled trade--something that is in  desperate need in all of our counties, urban and rural.   Workforce education must go hand in hand with helping small capitals  get the capital to grow. Entrepreneurs have to have the investment, but  they have also got to have a skilled workforce to help them grow their  company and expand for other people.   I am fully in support of this bill because I think it speaks to the  heart of the vast majority of our country, which are small companies  working in rural areas.   I agree with the ranking member when she says that they need  investment in healthcare and other things in rural areas, and that is  why in my State there are 172 community health centers, Federal  community health centers, spread across our entire State. We have a  really capable, good local hospital system throughout our rural  counties.   We are blessed by that. We are blessed by good CTE schools, classic  trade workforce schools, but we could use more. Of course, we have got  to have capital to grow, and it can't just come from the banking  sector.   That is why I support so fully our chair's emphasis on crowdsourcing  funding for small businesses. Think how much more straightforward that  is in a rural area to try to do something good by bringing together  people from all over, all works of life to help somebody build a  business.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for his leadership. I thank the  ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all our colleagues to support this bill.
