 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Luetkemeyer and  Chairwoman Velazquez for their leadership on the Small Business  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my legislation, H.R. 6450,  the SCORE for Small Business Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill  reauthorizes the SCORE program for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, and it  will allow SCORE to expand counseling and training through online  [[Page H4473]]  webinars, electronic mentoring platforms, and online toolkits to better  serve small businesses and entrepreneurs across U.S. communities,  including the rural and underserved areas.   Additionally, this bill would better protect taxpayers' dollars  through oversight mechanisms. Since 1964, SCORE has helped over 11  million entrepreneurs to establish, expand, or service a small  business. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began early 2020, SCORE has seen  a 30 percent increase in demand for their services. Despite challenges  faced, 89 percent of SCORE clients stayed in business throughout 2020.   In 2021, the SCORE chapter in Orange County in my district helped  start 269 new small businesses and create nearly 4,000 jobs. In 2019,  prior to the pandemic, Orange County SCORE delivered 11,154 total  services. In 2021, they delivered 25,146 total services. This is a 125  percent increase and over double the rate of pre-pandemic levels.   Thanks to the volunteers and mentors in SCORE, countless small  businesses in my district have been able to keep their businesses  running and keep their employees on their payroll.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Craig, for her  partnership on this. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  6450 and allow SCORE to continue this public-private partnership to  support small businesses across the country.
