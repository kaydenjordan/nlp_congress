 Madam Speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., visited my  district in April of 1967. Almost a year to the day he was killed, Dr.  King told Rhode Islanders:         I haven't lost faith in the future. But I never intend to       adjust myself to the madness of militarism or racial       inequality.    More than 50 years later, we are still fighting the madness of racial  inequality.   I believe that all of us in this Chamber are here for a reason. It is  our solemn duty to acknowledge the sins of the past 400 years and begin  to repair the soul of America.   We can build a better, more just country.   Pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, because Black lives  matter.   Make the critical reforms that we need to do right now.   End the chokehold. End racial profiling. Demilitarize police  departments. Hold bad police officers accountable.   When we do this, we can begin to rebuild trust between the police and  the community.   Colleagues, do not be obstructionists. Stand with us in this historic  moment. Set aside politics. Stop living in fear of the President's  Twitter account. Remember the oath you took to your constituents and to  our country.
