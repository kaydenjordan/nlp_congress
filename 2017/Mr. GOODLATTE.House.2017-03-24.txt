 Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you why I am supporting  this legislation, the American Health Care Act.   Kaye, from Roanoke, contacted me about President Obama's promise that  she could keep her health care. She shared that she received a letter  from her insurer stating that her policy was going to increase by $600  per month--increase by $600 per month. Since she wasn't of age to be on  Medicare but wasn't working because she was at home caring for her sick  husband, she was frustrated with her situation.   Kaye couldn't afford the extra money she owed on top of the bills for  her husband's medical treatment. She told me: ``So I will now have to  pay the fine, drop my insurance, and hope I do not get sick.''   I told Kay I would vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   A nurse from Warren County wrote to me: ``The care that I give my  patients is founded on their ability to choose their course of care. We  advocate every day for our patients to have more choices in their care,  and it will be very painful for us to deny them those options and to  deny them care.'' She asked me to stand against ObamaCare, and I told  her I would.   Susan, from Bedford County, told me her health insurance premium  increased 156 percent and her deductible increased 766 percent in just  2 years. She asked how we could make her pay such high rates. I told  Susan I would vote to repeal ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I told my constituents that I would stand for them to  repeal this law that has hurt their ability to get the affordable care  they want and need. Passing the American Health Care Act is the first  step in repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with solutions that put  patients first. I urge my fellow Members to support this bill.   ObamaCare has failed far too many in the Sixth District of Virginia.  The status quo cannot continue.
