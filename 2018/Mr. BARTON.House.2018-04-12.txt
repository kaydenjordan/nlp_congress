 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, almost 34 years ago, in January 1995, I stood right over  there, held up my right hand with my 2-year-old daughter, Kristin, took  an oath to defend this country and this Constitution against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. And as soon as I had taken the oath of  office to be a Member of the House of Representatives, I walked over to  the hopper and put in the Barton tax limitation balanced budget  amendment. It was H.J. Res. 33, I believe. That was almost 34 years  ago.   At that time, the national debt was less than $2 trillion. Today, it  is over $20 trillion. In the time that I have been in the House, we  have had three or four balanced budgets on a cash flow basis, so that  means we have had 30 unbalanced budgets. We have piled almost $19  trillion on our children and our grandchildren's backs with no hope to  ever repay.   The balanced budget constitutional amendment is not a panacea. It  doesn't solve all of our problems, but it is a step in the right  direction.   I have a few issues with this particular balanced budget amendment.  It is not as strong as I would like it to be, but I commend the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee for bringing it to the floor for a  vote. It is a positive first step.   It is not compassionate, Mr. Speaker, to spend money we don't have  and keep adding deficits that we will never repay. There is always an  inexhaustible demand for more Federal dollars. At some point in time,  we have to start the process of living within our means and, believe it  or not, repaying what we have already borrowed.   This constitutional amendment, again, it is not perfect, but it is a  step in the right direction. I urge its passage by a two-thirds vote to  send it to the Senate, hopefully, for a similar two-thirds vote.
