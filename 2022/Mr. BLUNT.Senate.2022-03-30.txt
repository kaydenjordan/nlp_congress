 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a St. Louis,  MO, resident whose name and family are synonymous with supermarkets  across the Midwest. Todd Schnuck, a dedicated community and business  leader, is being honored with the Glen Woodard Award for Outstanding  Leadership in Public Affairs by the Food Industry Association.   Todd Schnuck is the third family member of the third generation of  Schnucks to be CEO and chairman of Schnucks Markets, Inc., and has been  a community and industry advocate since entering the family business in  the late 1980s. During the next 30 years, his leadership built Schnucks  into the food industry leader it is today.   Todd joined the family business after college in 1987 to help  facilitate new acquisitions for the company. Over the next two decades,  he would help Schnucks build its footprint throughout the Midwest  through acquisitions and expansion. Schnucks has over 100 stores today  and employs 15,000 associates spanning five States. In 2014, Todd was  named CEO and chairman of Schnuck Markets, Inc., holding the same  position his grandfather did when he started the company in 1939.   Along with the terrific work Todd has done for the business of  Schnucks, he has been an even greater community leader. Todd has not  only made Schnucks an employer of choice in the State of Missouri, but  has worked closely with the United Way of Greater St. Louis. He is also  currently chairman of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and  holds board seats with the Opportunity Trust and the Arch to Park  Equity Fund.   I know firsthand what a strong advocate Todd is for the food  industry. He is in a unique position to be a credible voice for the  supermarket industry, spending his career leading and growing the  family business. I congratulate Todd on the Glen Woodard Award for  Outstanding Leadership in Public Affairs.                            ____________________
