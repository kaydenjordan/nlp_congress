 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to three  different individuals who made a difference during their lives who are  no longer with us.   I first rise to pay tribute to the remarkable life of Steven Nicholas  Gomes, otherwise known as Nick, a beloved son of Merced County whose  legacy resonates with kindness, resilience, and an unwavering love.   Nick left an indelible mark on the hearts of his friends, family, and  community, and he made a difference during his life, as short as it  was. His dedication to making positive impacts on the lives of others  was evident through the many roles that he had in life as a student  athlete and a person who did so many different things. He was also my  district representative in Merced County and helped people all the  time.   During the pandemic, when folks were frustrated and angry, they would  call the office. Nick's reassuring voice would always convey to my  constituents that we were there, and we would help and would see them  through this. His ability to engage with constituents exemplified his  commitment to open dialogue and understanding.   His efforts extended beyond the office walls. His advocacy for  community projects, such as securing grants for local water  infrastructure improvements in communities like Dos Palos and Gustine,  showed his ability to get things done.   His compassion extended to his family, where he showed his love  through selfless actions, genuine connections, and a willingness to  always go that extra mile.   To his mom and dad, my dear friends, and his sister, Melissa, I  extend my deepest condolences. They are all missing him every day, but  all were fortunate to share his journey in life. His parents will be  celebrating an anniversary this month and will think fondly of Nick. He  was a giant, literally and figuratively, among men in so many  incredible ways. He will be missed. May he rest in peace.                      Honoring the Life of Diana Marcum     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of Diana Marcum, a beacon of compassion and storytelling  brilliance whose words touched the hearts and unveiled the essence of  the human experience.   Her journey began as a journalist, an editorial assistant, and  blossomed into a remarkable but, again, short career. Her narrative  prowess was on full display in a Pulitzer Prize-winning series,  ``Scenes from California's Dust Bowl,'' which chronicled the impact of  the drought on the people of the San Joaquin Valley. She was a person  who could, with words, express so many different challenges of life.   Through her elegant prose, Diana wove together stories of farmers,  field workers, and others in the California Central Valley that really  originated with the ``Grapes of Wrath,'' painting a vivid picture of  their struggles, their hopes, and their triumphs.   Beyond her writing, her influence extended into her personal  interactions and relationships. For me, a book that she completed  called ``The Tenth Island'' chronicled the diaspora of the Azorean  people who came to settle in the San Joaquin Valley, i.e., the tenth  island. The fondness for those people and those shared experiences,  were my experiences, so we bonded over that love and connection to the  Azores islands.   Finally, in celebrating Diana's life, we also celebrate the timeless  power of the narrative bridge that divides and illuminates the shared  experience of life. She was a writer who could capture the essence of  that, and her talent and her personality will be missed.                        Honoring the Life of Ken Hart     Finally, Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and honor Kenneth  Lee Hart, a friend, a man whose life was marked by dedication, wisdom,  a passion for history and for politics. He was a history teacher at the  community college.   A true patriot, Ken felt a profound sense of duty to his country. He  volunteered to serve in the Army Signal Corps. He was stationed in  Saigon, Vietnam, from 1962 to 1964 during that difficult war, but he  never forgot his commitment to our country.   His involvement in Robert Kennedy's 1968 Presidential campaign marked  his unwavering belief in the power of politics to shape a better future  for America.   Ken and I shared the understanding that George Santayana once said:  ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' We  had many memorable evenings with our friends, Congressman Rick Lehman  and others talking about sports and the future of America.   We remember him for his wisdom, his dedication, and justice to an  unwavering belief in the power of positive change. We will miss Ken.                            ____________________
