 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate Linda  Rushing on her retirement from her leadership role as vice chancellor  at the University of Arkansas at Monticello College of Technology- Crossett.   Linda has worked tirelessly for almost five decades to serve her  community through dedication to teaching, student administration, and  academic leadership.   Linda began her career at Forest Echoes Vocational Technical School  in 1975 where she was hired as a business instructor. She continued to  serve this institution through 1987 when she was named director of the  school.   When Forest Echoes Vocational Technical School merged with UAM to  become UAM-CTC, she was named vice chancellor, where she has served for  20 years. Linda's commitment to excellence and the success of her  faculty, staff, and students at the UAM College of Technology-Crossett  has immensely benefited the greater Arkansas community. Her passion for  serving others in leadership has cultivated a campus environment in  which students can thrive and one that has served the workforce needs  of southeast Arkansas and its communities.   I congratulate Linda on a commendable career of leadership and public  service and thank her for all she has done for the State of Arkansas.                   Congratulating Joe Fox on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to congratulate my good  friend, Mr. Joe Fox, on his retirement.   Joe has had a successful career in forestry in my home State of  Arkansas as State forester, directing the Forestry Division of the  Arkansas Department of Agriculture.   In Arkansas, Joe Fox and forestry are synonymous. He brings to the  table a depth of experience, having served as president of the Arkansas  Forestry Association, chairman of the Arkansas Forestry Commission, and  president of the National Association of State Foresters.   I express my sincere thanks to Joe for his service and dedication to  the State of Arkansas, his knowledge of forestry, and his contributions  to the industry. I am proud to say that Arkansas serves as a blueprint  for forest management for the rest of the country, and that has been  enhanced by the service and leadership of Joe Fox.   Without a doubt, through his work in forestry and conservation, Joe  has left a legacy for future generations, not only in the example that  he set but also a tangible one: Our forests are better off for our kids  and grandkids because of Joe Fox.   Mr. Speaker, I will leave with you a famous Joe Fox quote: ``Trees  are the answer. Now, what is your question?'' I couldn't agree more.                        Arkansas Is a Wonderful State     Mr. Speaker, Arkansas celebrated its statehood last  week. Arkansas became the 25th State of the United States on June 15,  1836.   Arkansas is a wonderful State with a rich history, breathtaking  natural beauty, and vibrant communities. From the gorgeous Ozark  Mountains to the mighty Mississippi River, Arkansas is a State of  limitless opportunities.   Arkansas has changed and flourished since its entry into the Union,  leaving its imprint on the history of our country. Arkansas has  experienced significant events, overcome barriers, and built a strong  and resilient community to be proud of.   From the Delta blues to the world-renowned Hot Springs National Park,  our State provides a diverse range of activities that reflect our  distinct past. Let us continue to honor Arkansas' diverse culture,  customs, and people.             Protecting Our Territories and Friends Is Paramount     Mr. Speaker, the United States stands as a beacon of  freedom with a mission to protect the inalienable rights for which many  have given their lives. This mission rings from the mountains to the  prairies, across our oceans, and across the globe.   This month, the Indo-Pacific Task Force was assembled to evaluate  Chinese attempts to usurp our interests in the Pacific. China is a  threat to our democracy, and they are attempting to  [[Page H2996]]  gain a foothold not only in Cuba but also within our territories across  the Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions.   To combat this hostility, our bipartisan team was assembled to  support our territories and friends in the Freely Associated States to  counter the communist influence.   Protecting our territories and our friends is paramount. I ask  Congress to engage in this effort fully, heed the suggestions of the  Indo-Pacific Task Force, and work together to strengthen our  territories and deter Chinese influence in the Pacific and here at  home.                            ____________________
