When he was 14 years old, his  sister, Rachael, died of cancer. He went on to go to Catholic High, my  high school, and went on to LSU.   In 2018, he got engaged to his wife, Megan. He and Megan got married  just last year.   In order to honor his sister Rachael's death, he said he was going to  run a 100-mile ultramarathon, and he did so earlier this year in Key  West, Florida. Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, that effort to honor his  sister Rachael's life resulted in his death. The day after the  ultramarathon, Michael Willis, at the young age of 27, passed away.   Madam Speaker, I want to honor his life. Our best wishes and thoughts  and prayers to his mother, Cristal; his father, Earl; his brother,  Nicholas; and his wife, Megan.   Madam Speaker, I ask that we have a moment of silence to honor his  life.                            ____________________
