 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, on October 7,  Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on innocents in Israel.   I rise today to draw attention to what really happened: Babies were  murdered. Hospitals were bombed. Families were ripped apart. Many were  kidnapped.   I rise today to share the names of the U.S. citizens who were  kidnapped by these barbarians and remain in their evil ditches: Aviva  Siegel, Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Keith Samuel Siegel, Edan  Alexander, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, and Omer Neutra.   Mr. Speaker, I now ask for a brief moment of silence as we pray for  their safe return.

For nearly a month now, the world has watched the bombardment of  brutal terrorist attacks against Israel. The sheer evil and terror that  have been brought upon the Israeli people by these barbaric savages  cannot be met by silence or inaction. As Hamas continues its heinous  attacks against Israel, we must continue to send a message to the world  and leaders of Hamas that the United States stands with Israel and  supports its absolute right to exist.   In our first action under Speaker Johnson, the House overwhelmingly  passed a resolution reaffirming support for Israel. Following that up,  this supplemental aid to Israel is a necessary step. Such aid will  provide Israel with the critical resources it needs to defend itself  and mount a response that will allow for the elimination of the threat  of Hamas.   As our strong ally in the Middle East, the United States must  continue to stand firmly with Israel and provide support for it to  defend its right to exist against those who wish it would cease to be.   As one of two Jewish House Republicans, I urge all of my colleagues  to support this aid package and to stand firmly behind Israel and the  Israeli people.
