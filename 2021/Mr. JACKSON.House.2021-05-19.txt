 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for one of  our most loyal allies, Israel.   Unlike many of my colleagues across the aisle, I will not waver in my  support for democracy, and I will not turn a blind eye to the ongoing  terrorist attacks against the State of Israel.   The simple fact is, Israel uses weapons to protect its citizens from  terrorism, and Hamas uses its weapons with the goal of murdering  civilians and annihilating the State of Israel as a whole.   There is no moral equivalence between the two, and any attempt to  make Israel out as the aggressor is not rooted in fact. Israel has the  right to defend itself as a sovereign country.   In 2014, Congress unanimously passed a Democrat-led resolution  condemning Hamas attacks on Israel after they had launched  approximately 300 rockets.   This time, Hamas has launched over 4,000 rockets into Israel in just  10 days, yet, it is not clear to me that Democrats in this House would  support a similar resolution today.   That is a sad and problematic shift.   Congress must continue its support for U.S. aid to Israel, and  Congress must confront terrorists and their backers, like Iran.                            ____________________
