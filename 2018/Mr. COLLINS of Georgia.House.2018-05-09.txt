 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  Mt. Vernon Exploratory School's 25th anniversary.   For 25 years, the teachers and faculty members have strived to uphold  their mission of character, competency, and rigor for all by investing  in each student who walks through their halls. The school's commitment  to supporting students and families has helped the Hall County School  District earn the title of ``Most Caring Place on Earth.''   Mt. Vernon Exploratory holds a special place in my family's heart. My  wife, Lisa, has taught at Mt. Vernon since it opened in 1993, and all  three of our children have attended the school.   We have enjoyed watching the school grow with each new academic year.  From acquiring its charter school status to acquiring a new curriculum  that addresses the modern students' needs, Mt. Vernon has cultivated a  constructive environment for its students.   I stand with the Mt. Vernon Trojans in celebrating this new milestone  for the school and wish the faculty and students well as they finish  the school year.   Go Trojans.                            ____________________
