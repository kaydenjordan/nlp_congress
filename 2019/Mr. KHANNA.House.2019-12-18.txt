 Madam Speaker, today, the House is voting to affirm a  conservative principle. What makes America the strongest and most  prosperous nation in the world is our reverence for the rule of law. It  is our love of the law that protects our freedoms, our private  property, and our families from the exercise of arbitrary power.   The real threat to American leadership in the 21st century is  internal decline. We choose not to stand idly by while we see the  corrupting of our body politic with an attitude that might makes right,  that winners don't have to follow the rules.   In voting to impeach, we remember Lincoln's Lyceum Address: ``Let  every  [[Page H12127]]  American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity,  swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least  particular the laws of the country and never to tolerate their  violation by others. . . . Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries,  and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in  almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative  halls, and enforced in the courts of justice. And, in short, let it  become the political religion of the Nation.''
