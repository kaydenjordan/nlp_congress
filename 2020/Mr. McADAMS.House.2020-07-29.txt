 Mr. Speaker, in March, I was infected with COVID-19 and  spent 8 days in the hospital struggling to breathe and too exhausted to  get out of bed. The dedicated doctors, nurses, and hospital staff were  my allies in the fight against the virus, putting their own health at  risk to care for me. It gave me an up-close and personal perspective of  what our healthcare workers have been up against since the start of  this pandemic.   So dedicated are Utah's healthcare heroes that, when the call went  out from New York for help, 100 volunteers responded, giving the  exhausted doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists much-needed  backup. They spent 14 days assisting New York area hospitals, working  day and night to care for desperately sick people, people who were not  even allowed to have family members at their bedside.   Utah healthcare heroes are not just found at hospitals; they are in  our long-term care facilities, our veterans' homes, and in parking  lots, standing in the heat to collect test samples for hours at a time.  They are found in blood banks and laboratories, searching for the  treatments and working on drug trials to offer relief and hope to  patients now and in the future.   No summer vacations or even holiday weekends for these extraordinary  caregivers, their own families must take a backseat. The fight against  the virus and the demand on their skill continues for the months ahead.   They gave me my health back and returned me safely to loved ones. Mr.  Speaker, I thank them for their help.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendments to H.R. 7617. My amendment  would provide additional resources to the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline. The CDC reports that from 2001 to 2017, the Nation saw a 31  percent increase in the suicide rate. It is now the second leading  cause of death among Americans ages 15 to 24 and the leading cause of  death for Utahns in this age group.   The lifeline is a nationally accessible service that supports people  in crisis and connects them to the help that they need. The lifeline  has had great success, but it is also under strain as its funding has  not kept pace with its caseload, particularly amid the pandemic's  effects.   I want my amendment to speak clearly to Americans in crisis: There is  help; there is hope; and we are fighting for you.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in support of two amendments to  protect children's safety and well-being.   First, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has  reported staggering increases in online child sex abuse material,  commonly called child pornography. The Federal Internet Crimes Against  Children Task Force Program supports task forces in every State to  investigate such online exploitation and abuse of children and bring  perpetrators to justice. My amendment enhances this grant program to  support State and locally driven efforts to protect our children.   Second, child advocacy centers are an incredible tool to support  child survivors of abuse. These centers bring together specialized  child welfare and law enforcement professionals to provide holistic  services to children and to seek justice against abusers. COVID-19 has  put many kids at risk, and my amendment provides additional resources  for centers to meet this demand.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments to protect, heal,  and give hope to Americans.
