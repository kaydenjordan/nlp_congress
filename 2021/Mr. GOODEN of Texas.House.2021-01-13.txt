 Madam Speaker, I also want to thank my  Democratic colleagues for finally joining Republicans in condemning mob  violence after 6 months of refusing to acknowledge it.   But I am really tired of sanctimonious sermons on being a sore loser  from some of the same Democrats who opposed accepting results in  elections past. Democrats have objected to certifying every Republican  victory of the 21st century. In 2000, 2004, and in 2016, Democrats  objected every time.   When they objected, it was patriotic. But when Republicans do it, we  are inciting a mob; we are liars; and we are traitors. This is the  double standard we should expect under total Democrat control.   They have called for unrest in the streets. They have called for  harassing Cabinet officials. They have objected to certifying election  results time and time again. Even the Judiciary chairman secured  clemency for a domestic terrorist who detonated a bomb right here in  this building. But we are the extremists? I don't think so.   We have been silenced by Big Tech on social media, by corporate  America. Now the other side wants to silence us on the House floor.   This is a sad day in America. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
