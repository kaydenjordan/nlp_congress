Sec. 10.  House Resolution 485 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 11.

During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 486, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,  under a structured rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and Labor. It self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairman Scott and makes in order five amendments. The  rule provides for en bloc authority to Chairman Scott or his designee  and for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 239, the Equal  Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, under a closed rule. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and  provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ  Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act, under a closed  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial  Services and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of S.J. Res. 13, S.J.  Res. 14, and S.J. Res. 15 under closed rules. It provides the  Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Financial  Services each 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by their  respective chairs and ranking minority members. It also provides each  joint resolution one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule deems passage of H. Res. 485 and provides the  majority leader or his designee the ability to en bloc requested  rollcall votes on suspension bills considered on June 22 or 23. This  authority lasts through June 25.   Madam Speaker, the House is set to take up a number of critical bills  and resolutions in this rule, but I would like to begin by saying a few  words about H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act.   Instances of age discrimination at the workplace, including being  passed up for a promotion or forced to retire early, are far too common  across the country. A recent survey conducted by AARP found that nearly  two out of three workers 45 years and older have seen or experienced  age discrimination while on the job.   Importantly, we can expect this problem to be exacerbated in the  coming years by the continued growth of the number of older workers in  America, which is outpacing the growth of the overall labor force.   Discrimination against workers is not only unfair and morally wrong;  it creates a major drag on the U.S. economy. According to a recent  report, the economy missed out on an additional $850 billion in GDP in  2018 all because older workers aged 50 years and older were not given  the opportunity to remain in or re-enter the labor force, switch jobs,  or be promoted within their existing company. Clearly, age  discrimination not only harms older workers; it harms the country as a  whole.   Despite the enormity of this problem, the Supreme Court in 2009 made  it much more difficult for age discrimination lawsuits to be  successful. The Court's ruling in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.  imposed a much higher burden of proof on plaintiffs alleging  discrimination than previously required under the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act passed by Congress in 1967.   This new standard from Gross requires plaintiffs to prove that age  discrimination was the decisive, determinative but-for cause for any  adverse employment action taken by the employer. The new sole-factor  test replaced decades of precedent allowing that employees need only  show that their age was a key factor, potentially among other factors,  in the employer's adverse employment action.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act simply  restores the pre-2009 evidentiary threshold, allowing individuals to  show a discriminatory motive was merely a key factor for the adverse  employment action, which is consistent with the standard for other  workplace discrimination claims based on race, religion, sex, or  national origin. This legislation ensures that older workers can pursue  their livelihoods and hold employers accountable for age  discrimination.   This rule also sets up consideration of three Congressional Review  Act resolutions, all of which overturn harmful rulemaking implemented  by the Trump administration.   S.J. Res. 13 overturns a rule finalized by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission that provides employers with significant unfair  advantages during the informal conciliation process, which allows  parties to settle a charge of employer discrimination without going to  court.   S.J. Res. 14 overturns efforts by the Trump EPA to gut a 2016 rule  finalized by the Obama administration, which placed critically  important limits on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry  sector.   The last CRA resolution overturns the Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency's true lender rule, which makes it easier for predatory  lenders to launder loans through out-of-State banks that are not  subject to State interest rate caps. Prior to this rule, the ``true  lender'' in partnerships between banks and nonbank financial service  companies was whichever entity had the primary economic interest in the  loan. This harmful OCC action changed the test for the ``true lender''  to be simply whichever bank is listed on the loan origination  documents, making it extraordinarily easy to create a rent-a-bank  relationship between nationally chartered banks and nonbanks, allowing  nonbanks to avoid State interest rate cap laws where they are actually  doing business.    Especially during the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and  economic crisis, it is astounding that the Trump administration chose  to focus on making it easier for predatory lenders to take advantage of  Americans in need.   Finally, the House is also set to consider two additional bills. The  Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, H.R. 239, prohibits the  Department of Veterans Affairs from requiring copayments for  contraception coverage, bringing the policy in line with the Department  of Defense and the private sector. The second bill, LGBTQ Business  Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act, H.R. 1443, requires  financial institutions to collect the sexual orientation and gender  identity of the principal owners of small businesses, in addition to  existing requirements that institutions collect data on sex, race, and  ethnicity.   Both of these bills should be noncontroversial. Although Members of  the House Republican Conference inexplicably blocked these bills from  passing under suspension last week, I am pleased that we will not  further delay passage of this critical legislation.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, three CRAs to overturn  harmful administration actions of the previous administration, and  commonsense legislation to support women veterans and the LGBTQ  business community.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate very much the comments from my friend and  my colleague on the Committee on Rules, Mr. Burgess.   I do want to just note that when it comes to discrimination, the  standard that we use for discrimination in the workplace that relates  to race, religion, sex or national origin, is that  [[Page H3021]]  those factors are a key motivating factor in an employment decision  that allows a claimant to come forward. That is what we wish to make  the standard for age discrimination for older Americans.   What is being suggested by my friends on the other side of the aisle,  however, are two different standards. In this case, when it comes to  age discrimination, that it needs to be the sole factor. Prior to the  2009 Supreme Court case, indeed these were on par. The same standards  would apply, the same criteria that it be a key motivating factor.   And frankly, when you think about it, if you are an older American  and you are being denied a promotion, you are being denied a pay raise,  and your employer suggests, well, you are a little older, and oh, by  the way--and lists a couple other things. Well, because it is not the  sole factor that they articulated, you don't have a cause for a claim.  And we believe that there shouldn't be two different standards when it  comes to discrimination. If it is a key motivating factor, which it was  up until the 2009 opinion, that is how it should stand. And we should  make certain that the law of the land when it relates to employment  discrimination is the same, whether or not it is because of race,  religion, sex, national origin, or age.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Brownley).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to just talk for a moment about H.R. 239, the  Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, which is actually  before us today. Although some might want to make this debate about  other issues, it is not.   Comprehensive healthcare for women, including access to  contraception, is critically important. Access to contraception is an  economic issue. It helps people stay in the workforce, earn wages,  support stronger families. It has even been shown to lift women out of  poverty.   Even relatively small copays have been found to be a barrier to  accessing contraception. Costs associated with contraception result in  women foregoing it completely, choosing less effective methods, or  using it inconsistently.   Congress eliminated copays for contraception as part of the  Affordable Care Act. And, as I said, for members of the Defense  Department, for people in military service, there is no copay. It is  time we did the same for those brave women who entered armed services  and now are veterans.   We also want to make sure that we have equal access. Women represent  the fastest growing subpopulation of veterans in the Nation, yet they  lack access to the basic preventative healthcare needs like  contraception.   So I want to make sure that we focus on what is before us, the bills  before the House, what this conversation is about, and not to be  distracted by things not before us and part of an extreme agenda.   This is a simple issue. It has passed by voice vote in the last  Congress, and it is not clear to me what has changed. This is an  important issue for women all across America, and we owe that to our  veterans to make sure that they don't have additional barriers to  contraception that no one else in American has.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I just note that we have in front of us  two CRAs. We have two important bills: The LGBTQ Business Equal Credit  Enforcement and Investment Act, as well as the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act of 2021.   And we are not talking about any of those. So I am prepared to talk  about those, which are actually before the House, whenever my friends  choose to.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman, Dr. Burgess, a  colleague and friend on the Rules Committee. I always appreciate  hearing from him.   I think there are compelling issues here in this rule and the reasons  that the House should adopt the rule.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act is a critical  tool for so many Americans who are discriminated against in the  workplace. It deserves our support. I am confident that it will pass  the House, but we should remember how important it is, not only to  those workers, but to the U.S. economy.   H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, makes  sure that women who have served and are veterans have the same rights  that every other person in America has to not have to pay copays in  order to receive contraception from their healthcare policy.   We also take up critical legislation regarding LGBTQ businesses, to  make sure they get equal access to credit and equal access to  investments. H.R. 1443 would require lenders to start to gather  information on those businesses that are owned by LGBTQ individuals.   The CRAs, in my judgment, Mr. Speaker, are all well-informed, and  they do focus on the policies, policies which, frankly, we don't agree  with here in the House and which the Senate didn't agree with. The  Senate has passed these on to us in bipartisan fashion, so these aren't  simply questions of whether or not we approve of the previous  President. This is about the policies themselves, and they have found  themselves here to be voted on because our colleagues across the  corridor in the Senate agree with us that these rules ought to be  overturned using the CRA process.   This is an important rule. It affects millions of Americans in so  many ways.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 486    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 18) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 13. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 18.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
