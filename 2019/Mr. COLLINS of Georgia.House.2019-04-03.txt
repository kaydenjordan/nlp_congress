 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1585, the Violence  Against Women Reauthorization Act.   Mr. Chair, I support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women  Act. I believe the intent of this legislation is commendable, and many  of the programs it authorizes are critical.   This is a bill that should be and should have broad bipartisan  support. It is a bill that should transcend the political games which  we see too often in Washington, and we should approach it methodically  and wholistically.   Unfortunately, instead of good faith collaboration, my colleagues  across the aisle have doubled down on partisan politics at the expense  of good policy. They have sought, at every turn, to make this bill into  a political weapon rather than a critical resource for victims and  tools to support law enforcement.   I tried to meet with my Democratic colleagues to negotiate a  meaningful reauthorization of VAWA. We tried to engage with other  Members in bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, although our efforts  were rebuffed, and we were handed the flawed bill that is before us  today. My colleagues across the aisle informed us H.R. 1585 would be  the bill. This is particularly unfortunate because this bill is dead on  arrival in the Senate.   There are areas where both sides can agree, areas where we can  strengthen existing law. Instead of seeking out those areas and  negotiating in good faith, they have decided a highly partisan bill  with zero chance of moving forward in the Senate was the best way to  approach reauthorizing crucial VAWA programs.                                time  1430    Remember, Republicans tried to add a short-term extension of VAWA to  the funding bill in February when Congresswoman Lesko offered it as a  previous question. Democrats blocked this attempt and refused to  include a short-term extension to allow time for meaningful  negotiations to take place.   Mr. Chairman, my colleagues and I want to find a solution that helps  victims, prevents domestic violence, and strengthens programs that  serve vulnerable populations. We stand willing and ready to discuss  ways to do that.   But I cannot and will not support a bill that undermines and  jeopardizes due process; that curtails prosecutorial discretion; that  makes it more difficult for victims in rural areas to find housing;  that could weaken programs for female victims; that could re-victimize  abused women; and that undercuts the Second Amendment rights.   This bill contains a large expansion of unemployment insurance  benefits, which amounts to a new tax on employers. This bill continues  to expand the focus of programs past women and children; and this bill  fails to provide a faith-based exemption for grant recipients, which  could jeopardize these organizations' ability to provide services for  victims.   Mr. Chairman, this legislation was referred to seven committees. The  bill was rushed to markup at the Judiciary Committee, but at least  Judiciary actually had a markup. Even though the rushed markup ended in  a party-line vote, that markup is far more than the Democrats gave the  other committees of jurisdiction.   The Ways and Means Committee is the committee with expertise in  unemployment insurance benefits, but if you are on that committee,  Democrats denied you the chance to weigh in on that issue at committee,  and Americans didn't get to benefit from your expertise there.   The Financial Services Committee is the committee with expertise on  housing issues. But if you are on that committee, you were shut down as  well; this bill moving ahead without the benefit of your consideration.   Democrats also denied the Natural Resources, Education and Labor,  Veterans' Affairs, and Energy and Commerce Committees the chance to  weigh in on a bill with provisions that sit squarely within their  jurisdiction.   I want to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. I want to do it  in a way that meets the fundamental goals and intent of the original  law, and I want to recognize changes that need to be addressed.   Simply put, I want to find a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that  Democrats shunned when they rushed this bill to the floor. This bill  could actually put women at greater risk in some of the programs it  authorizes, and it is not a solution that I can support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    I yield the gentlewoman from Arizona as much  time as she may consume.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, really, in closing, I would just reiterate the points  that I have made.   We are looking forward to a bipartisan, bicameral bill that we do  believe will come back eventually. The Senate has said this.   There are many things, and I think the distinguished majority leader  made it very clear. I think it was interesting that he said, why did  this become a bill that was not--it should be as bipartisan as it  should be. I think it is because of stuff that we did not talk about  that had been added into this, which makes it much larger than what the  bill actually should be about, and focused on those areas.   We can disagree about a lot of things, but I think, in this one, all  of us want to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act is  reauthorized in a way that does promote the very ideals of the original  law, and we would continue to do that.   We look forward to a day in which this body can debate that bill. At  this time, we cannot, because this bill does not feel like many of our  Members may vote for it. They may vote against. But I think, at the end  of the day, there will be a better product coming. I am looking forward  to that.   I appreciate the hard work by both sides, but I do believe there is a  better outcome and alternative, a bipartisan, bicameral bill in the  future.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend from New  York. I have no problem with his amendment. It is already a current,  existing order, introduced by President Clinton, and it is also under  DOJ guidance. This is currently happening, and I think his wanting to  continue this, to put it in this bill, I would have no problem with.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, again, I am not opposed to the  amendment. I appreciate some of the comments by the gentlewoman from  Texas.   Several of these were actually in the FIRST STEP Act, which we passed  last year, on criminal justice reform. I am glad to see that they are  still being discussed.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chairman, I do claim the time in  opposition.    Madam Chair, I understand the gentlewoman's  concern here, and I appreciate that concern.   A bigger concern I have here is concerning the trend of handling  responsibilities on campus and giving those--in a criminal matter and  putting them into campus personnel rather than law enforcement. My  concern is that these are crimes and they need to be treated as crimes.   We need to do everything we possibly can to treat those victims and  give them as much support and help as we possibly can, but I don't want  to give in to the implication that this should be treated as anything  other than a crime, and law enforcement personnel should be involved in  all stages.    I have seen a concerning trend across the country in trying to treat  these differently or even adding in a layer of investigation. This  needs to be treated as a crime.   I understand the gentlewoman's concern here, and expanding this grant  program could result from others in reducing resources that are  available for prosecution. So I understand the gentlewoman's concern. I  just would oppose this for those reasons and no more that.  [[Page H3034]]    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  concern; but, also, I do understand this issue, as someone who has been  in the legal community, been a counselor, also a chaplain in the Air  Force who has had to deal with sexual assault issues, and also served  on the local board of Rape Response.   I do get these issues. I don't disagree with the gentlewoman that  there are concerns here, that we do need to be sensitive and we do need  to do this.   My concern lies simply in the fact that we need to put this funding  and these resources not to a bifurcated process, but we also need to  continue to make sure that this goes to law enforcement, because  someone who mistreats and someone who is a victim of sexual harassment,  sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking--it is  a crime, and it needs to be treated as that.   We need to make sure our law enforcement personnel can have better  resources and better access so that the victims can be taken care of  and the perpetrators can be locked up. That is my concern here, not  that I don't understand what the victims may be going through.   Although I have never personally been a victim, I have counseled on  many occasions people who have been victims. So, I would just caution,  so we understand the differences in our opinions, why someone may hold  an opinion. And mine was simply from a law enforcement perspective, not  that I was ignoring or ambivalent toward the feelings of those who have  been victimized.   Madam Chair, I would just oppose this for those reasons and nothing  more, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although at this point I am not necessarily opposed.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I do think it is interesting,  for a sovereign government, the expansion should come out of the funds  here is the only concern I would have on this, but other than that, I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am not necessarily opposed to  the goal of the amendment. In fact, I understand the amendment. I  appreciate the gentlewoman bringing it.   I have supported similar programs in the FIRST STEP Act. The thing  here is that this amendment is not necessary because, in the underlying  bill, it already provides for parenting classes and resources.   I appreciate the gentlewoman bringing it. I don't necessarily have a  problem with it, except it is already there. So, offering this  amendment is fine, but I just, at this point, would just say it is  already there.   I have supported similar programs before. I appreciate the  gentlewoman's concern in this, and we would agree on that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, understanding the  concerns, all this is already, frankly, covered. It is covered in the  underlying bill, but it is also covered in other programs.   In going through some of these--and I know we have got a couple  more--in some of these amendments, anything that takes funding away  that would go from regular programs would be of concern, but I am happy  to work with my colleagues to address these issues in other areas. I  just don't think VAWA, probably, is the best way, but I appreciate the  gentlewoman's concern.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, again, I have been on this side,  and I would love to see more cooperation, especially since this is one  of the areas I do believe, Mr. Chair, we can actually have agreement  on. The chairman and I have talked about this a great deal, and others,  members of our Judiciary Committee.   The FIRST STEP Act, criminal justice reform is something that I have  been working on for many years. I think the issue of women  incarceration is definitely something that needs to be looked at.   Again, my concern with this program is the diversion of dollars that  go through these programs to programs that already exist, and I am not  sure how we are prioritizing these anymore. Even the numbers given were  based over a number-of-years period, not a single-year period.   When we were doing the FIRST STEP Act and doing some of the  incarceration numbers, these numbers were a lot lower in the Federal  prison of those actually pregnant at the time.   So again, I don't, by any means, demean or try to talk badly about an  amendment in the sense that it is not intended well. I think the  problem is the underlying issues are already there. The underlying  stuff is there. I appreciate her bringing that out. We just disagree  that this would be the place to do this.   There are other places we could work on this, and I think criminal  justice reform is a great place to put this. I do commend the  gentlewoman for bringing it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  but I am not necessarily opposed.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman  [[Page H3049]]  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  the bipartisan amendment presented by my friends Stacey Plaskett and  Amata Radewagen.   As my friend just mentioned, the smaller territories are facing a  challenge in the limited funds they receive to address such a large and  horrific issue. Federal funds to fight violence against women and  support survivors cannot be based on the ZIP Code or where you live. I  do believe that any kind of violence must be addressed, regardless of  the State or the territory the people are living in, giving the  survivors the same access to services, intervention, and assistance.   In the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, these four territories--we are  talking about the Northern Marianas, Virgin Islands, American Samoa,  and Guam--received less than $60,000 to aid victims of domestic  violence; and, simply put, this was not enough.   I am speaking also on behalf of my friend, Amata Radewagen, for  American Samoa. And I do say that, as more women step out of the  shadows to seek the assistance they need, it is our job in the Federal  Government to be able to provide the tools and resources to the  organizations and, more importantly, to the victims themselves.   Congress must rework the formula grant to allow these four  territories access to additional funds. I encourage all my colleagues  to support this amendment, and I am supporting the amendment as well.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, again, I appreciate the  gentleman's concern.   My concern is that the underlying bill already addresses this with  sufficient funding. This amendment or anything like it was not offered  in committee and not brought up in the discussions of this.   I don't doubt the sincerity of the need in this, but we do believe  that the underlying bill would cover it, so for that reason, I would  oppose it.   I appreciate the gentleman's concern, and I am sure there are other  ways that we could work it out, but we do believe the bill itself would  cover that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand what the  gentlewoman is talking about and wants to do here.   The concern here is this amendment establishes an entirely new grant  program with a national resource center. It is unclear how it would be  necessary, but it is also unclear on what resources would be used to  establish that new center. And if it means taking money out of the  current VAWA bill for victims, for women and others, then I would  definitely be opposed to this.   Provisions in existing law and the underlying bill already address  these and similar issues, including digital and cyber abuse.   So just from that perspective, from a concern of where the funds are  actually coming from and how to do this, but also the fact that it  seems redundant, that is why I would oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman. I  have no problem.   As far as any violence against anyone, no matter what the cause is,  is wrong. And no one should be treated differently because of choices  and other things in their life, whether it be just the basic humanity  that we deal with.   I think the only concern that I have here, as someone who has dealt  with  [[Page H3056]]  suicide, who has dealt with it on a counseling level for many years  both in the military and outside, I would not want to assign a certain  bias to the reasoning here, because there are other reasons, as well,  for suicide, and to keep that holistically. That is why, from my  personal standpoint, I would not want to assign that.   I think any of these is tragic and do contribute to that issue, just  as it would anything else. So I think limiting it, in my opinion, would  not be good in the holistic approach to making sure that no one  believes that their only choice in life is suicide, which is what the  amendment seems to do.   I think there are multiple things there, and we need to be very aware  of that--and the friends and family around us. If I could take anything  else from this moment, it is that I would include everybody listening  in today, no matter what their background is, suicide is something that  is tragic.   And if it comes to a point where people do not feel any hope, it is  imperative that people reach out to all people, no matter who they are,  if they know them or not, and just ask simple questions: ``Are you  okay?'' ``Can we talk?'' Do the things like that that help people  understand that they are not alone in this situation.   I appreciate the gentleman's concern. I do voice opposition to this  amendment just in the sense that I believe it is too limiting in scope  to say that this is the reason why or to input a bias into a  congressional finding.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not necessarily opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, again, I do not necessarily oppose  the amendment.   I think the underlying actual law addresses what you are after here,  so, in my mind, it is duplicative and can serve to muddy up, really,  some existing law that is already here. So that would be my concern  about your amendment. I think it is already covered.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman offering the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this one is one that, from many  perspectives--and we talked about this a little bit earlier in this  debate. Especially when it comes to the alternative justice issue here,  we understand the concerns for the victims and need to be a part of  that, but this is something prosecutors across the country have  [[Page H3057]]  opposed. And, in fact, the National District Attorneys Association  points out in a letter today:         While this approach may work successfully in other types of       situations, we lack sufficient information on potential       downsides of bringing a batterer into the same room with a       victim in order to conflict-resolve what is considered a       crime of violence.                                time  1900    They go on to say that:         A philosophy of putting the ability to consent to this kind       of program on a victim's shoulders is misplaced and may       result in unintended consequences to the victim, such as       safety concerns. The prosecutors are among the people that       utilize the beneficial tools of VAWA the most, and they are       on the front lines of combating the violence against women.    I don't think that we should ignore that. I think when we are looking  at this, as I said earlier in this debate today, anyone who does this  is a criminal. If they do this to people, stalking, domestic violence,  all this, they are criminal actions, and I do not want to take that  away from this. The victim should be cared for. The victim should be  nurtured. The victim should be able to come forward in that process.   But I do not want to take campuses and other places away where it  becomes something which law enforcement does not have the primary say  so, or you are allowing the campus, Mr. Chairman, to come in and have  their own alternative kind of investigative process. And this is  something that is of concern.   I appreciate the gentleman's concern in how people move through this  process, but this is just not the right way to go, especially in this  bill. There may be other ways to address this.   That is why I would oppose the amendment, because I just feel like we  do not need to ever take away the fact that the victims in this are  victims of a crime. We never can take that away and would not want to  resurface that in any other way. I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, not to prolong this, but I think the  interesting issue here, Mr. Chairman, is from the understanding there  are ways inside VAWA. There are other programs here. And I would just  have to say that for those who do not come forward, there are also many  other reasons besides the fact of the law enforcement process that we  go through here.   So what I don't want to have is just because the law enforcement  process does require reporting and does require this, we don't want to  let the abuser in this situation, or the perpetrator in this situation  be allowed to continue because the system is too hard.   I would like to see the system be made where the victims can come  forward and not take it away to where it would be something that is  alternative.   So I think in many ways we are probably saying or at least wanting  the same things. I want to make it easier for them to report the folks  who do this to them, no matter what background they are from or gender  they are or anything else and have that ability for law enforcement to  do what should be done, and that is, to put these people in jail.   I think that is the big difference I have here, and I don't think  this is the proper place for it. There may be other ways we can find  common ground in this, but not here, especially with what VAWA has the  ability to do already inside it.   So that is my opposition to this. We want the same thing. The people  who perpetrate these crimes need to be prosecuted. I just don't want to  see things diverted and an outlet given. It should be better for the  victims to be able to come and report this. It is a sad state of  occurrence when you don't have the ability or want to come report  because they feel the system is too hard. But also, not taking this out  of account, there are other reasons why this is not reported, or they  don't feel like they can come forward. And I don't think we can deny  that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, that is fine. I think  the National District Attorneys Association also would agree that this  is something that should be studied, but not mandated. And I think the  amendment here goes farther than most of us are feeling comfortable  with in that regard.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
