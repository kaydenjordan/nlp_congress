 Thank you very much, Representative Hartzler; it was  really eye-opening when we went down to the Arizona border. I have been  there a number of times, but I learned directly from not only the high- ranking officials, but from rank-and-file agents.   When I asked if a border fence was necessary to protect our Nation,  they said, absolutely, yes. That is part of the solution. We have a  major problem.   Today, I would like to focus on some people from Arizona,  Representative Hartzler, who were killed. They were killed by illegal  immigrants who came into our country illegally. So I rise today because  our open borders have caused a humanitarian and security crisis.   When the Democrats say that this is a manufactured crisis, that is  absolutely false. I have seen firsthand and have talked to people  firsthand. We have a crisis on our southern border.                                time  1730    Arizonans know the challenges of an unsecured border all too well.  Just ask Mary Ann Mendoza whose son, Brandon, a Mesa, Arizona, police  officer, was killed in a head-on collision caused by an illegal  immigrant.   The illegal immigrant who killed Brandon was arrested in the nineties  for burglary and assaulting a police officer. He never showed up for  court and was reapprehended at the border in 2002 attempting to come  back into our country. Unfortunately, a lenient judge let him stay.  Because of that, this law enforcement officer was killed.   Arizona Border Agent Brian Terry's life was taken by a group of  traffickers hoping to smuggle drugs into our country. When Agent Terry  and three other border agents tried to stop their illegal activity,  they shot him. Perhaps had our border not been so porous, Agent Brian  Terry would still be with us today.   A rancher from Cochise County, Arizona, Robert Krentz, was killed by  an illegal immigrant at home on his ranch.   Unfortunately, there are way too many stories just like these of  innocent people getting killed by illegal immigrants.   I live in a border State. I have been to the border a number of  times. Most recently, I visited the United States-Mexico border in  Nogales with the gentlewoman, where I met with Customs and Border  Protection agents. I asked the agents if they thought the border fence  would help. As I said before, they said absolutely, yes, that a fence  will help in our efforts to combat illegal immigration and other  illegal activity across the border.   The crisis we are dealing with at the border is not just illegal  immigration. There are illicit and illegal drugs flowing through our  borders; human trafficking; and, as we learned from the agents,  dangerous cartels at the border that are exploiting vulnerable children  and mothers. In fact, according to Doctors Without Borders, more than  30 percent of the women who come to the southern border have been  sexually assaulted on their journey.   This is something that is up to Congress to fix. We need border  security. The fence is just part of the solution.  [[Page H447]]  We need technology like sensors and drones, so we have eyes where we  can't have our agents. We need more boots on the ground. We have funded  more agents on the ground. Let's hire more agents, so our resources  aren't spread too thin.   What we are asking for is a multifaceted approach to border security.  Democrats know this. In 2006, Democrats supported a border fence. Chuck  Schumer and then-Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton voted to  fund $52 billion for 700 miles of fencing. Now we are asking for $5.7  billion. To me and you, that is a lot of money, but it really  represents only one-tenth of 1 percent of our spending.   On December 20, the Republicans in the House voted to keep the  government open and secure the border. Unfortunately, not one Democrat  voted for the bill. Now we are in a situation where the government is  shut down. They won't come to the table. They won't negotiate. They  don't have a counteroffer.   I am willing to sit down and listen to their suggestions, but they  haven't brought forward any suggestions. They are refusing to negotiate  and refusing to deal with this national security crisis.   While Democrats refuse to come to the negotiating table, our brave  Border Patrol and ICE agents continue their mission of protecting our  borders, even without a paycheck. We should be supporting them by  giving them the tools and resources they need to do their jobs and keep  our Nation safe.   Instead, unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues are ignoring the  public calls for border security. In fact, when Democrats repeatedly  say, ``We are for border security,'' I think their talk is talk. They  need to walk the walk and listen to our law enforcement that tells them  what we need. Part of that is a border fence.   President Trump addressed the Nation this week. Now it is up to  Congress to address and solve the issue with legislation. Let's stop  these political ploys and fund comprehensive border security.
