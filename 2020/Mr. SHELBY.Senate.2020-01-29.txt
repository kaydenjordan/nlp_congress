 I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Shelby's question is directed to counsel for the President:         How does the noncriminal ``abuse of power'' standard       advanced by the House Managers differ from       ``maladministration''--an impeachment standard rejected by       the Framers? Where is the line between such an ``abuse of       power'' and a policy disagreement?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I will address this.   Senators, thank you very much for that question because that question  I think hits the key to the issue that is before you today.   When the Founders rejected maladministration--and recall that it was  introduced by Mason and rejected by Madison on the ground that it would  turn our new Republic into a parliamentary democracy where a Prime  Minister--in this case, a President--can be removed at the pleasure of  the legislature.   Remember, too, that in Britain, impeachment was not used against the  Prime Minister, and neither was a vote of no confidence; it was used  against lower level people.   So maladministration was introduced by Mason, and Madison said no, it  was just too vague and too general.   What is maladministration? If you look it up in the dictionary and  you look up synonyms, the synonyms include abuse, corruption, misrule,  dishonesty, misuse of office, and misbehavior.   Even Professor Nikolas Bowie, a Harvard professor who was in favor of  impeachment, so this is an admission against interest by him--he is in  favor of impeachment--he says abuse of power is the same as misconduct  in office, and he says that his research leads him to conclude that a  crime is required.   By the way, the Congressman was just completely wrong when he said I  am the only scholar who supports this position. In the 19th century,  which was closer in time to when the Framers wrote, Dean White of  Columbia Law School wrote that ``the weight of authority''--by which he  meant the weight of scholarly authority and the weight of judicial  authority--this was in 1867--``the weight of authority is in favor of  requiring a crime.'' Justice Curtis came to the same conclusion. Others  have come to a similar conclusion.   You ask what happened between 1998 and the current time to change my  mind. What happened between the 19th century and 20th century to change  the minds of so many scholars? Let me tell you what happened. What  happened is that the current President was impeached.   If, in fact, President Obama or President Hillary Clinton would have  been impeached, the weight of current scholarship would clearly be in  favor of my position because these scholars do not pass the ``shoe on  the other foot'' test. These scholars are influenced by their own bias,  by their own politics, and their views should be taken with that in  mind. They simply do not give objective assessments of the  constitutional history.   Professor Tribe suddenly had a revelation himself. At the time  Clinton was impeached, he said: Oh, the law is clear. You cannot--you  cannot--charge a President with a crime while he is a sitting  President.   Now we have our current President. Professor Tribe got woke, and with  no apparent new research, he came to the conclusion: Oh, but this  President can be charged while sitting in office.   That is not the kind of scholarship that should influence your  decision.   You can make your own decisions. Go back and read the debates, and  you will see that I am right that the Framers rejected vague, open- ended criteria--abuse of power.   And what we had was the manager making a fundamental mistake again.  She gave reasons why we have impeachment. Yes, we feared abuse of  power. Yes, we feared criteria like maladministration. That was part of  the reason. We feared incapacity. But none  [[Page S672]]  of those made it into the criteria because the Framers had to strike a  balance. Here are the reasons we need impeachment, yes. Now, here are  the reasons we fear giving Congress too much power. So we strike a  balance. How did they strike it? Treason, a serious crime; bribery, a  serious crime; or other high crimes and misdemeanors--crimes and  misdemeanors akin to treason and bribery. That is what the Framers  intended. They didn't intend to give Congress a license to decide whom  to impeach and whom not to impeach on partisan grounds.   I read you a list of 40 American Presidents who have been accused of  abuse of power. Should every one of them have been impeached? Should  every one of them have been removed from office? It is too vague a  term.   Reject my argument about crime. Reject it if you choose to. Do not  reject my argument that abuse of power would destroy--destroy--the  impeachment criteria of the Constitution and turn it, in the words of  one of the Senators at the Johnson trial, to make every Member of the  Senate, every Member of Congress, be able to define it from within  their own bosom.   We heard from the other side that every Senator should decide whether  you need proof beyond a reasonable doubt or proof by a preponderance.  Now we hear that every Senator should decide on abuse of power.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE.
