 Madam Speaker, I oppose this impeachment effort and  will vote ``no'' on the Articles of Impeachment.  [[Page H12152]]    I represent the Fifth District of Virginia, which was home to so many  Founding Fathers whose vision shaped the great country we are living in  today.   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison are not around to see what their  creation has become, but I don't think they would be pleased to see  Congress subverting the will of democracy by holding an impeachment  vote because the majority party simply cannot accept the 2016 election.   Instead of wasting the taxpayers' time and money on specious  investigations, we could have passed legislation to address surprise  medical billing, secure the border, address the opioid epidemic, reduce  student debt, and solve a litany of other issues that Americans  actually care about.   Tomorrow, we might have a vote on the USMCA, which we should have  passed months ago had it not been for the obstruction and delays from  Democrats, delays that have made farmers in my district and other  districts suffer.   Votes like the one we will take today, the decisions that have led up  to today's vote, the nature and entire process of this proceeding reeks  of careerist bureaucrats and politicians that put politics over people.   I was not elected to take political votes that attempt to overturn  the will of the American people. I ran for office to serve my  constituents. Let's remember: that is why we are here.   Weaponizing emotion is not the way to serve the United States of  America.   And, Madam Speaker, to my colleagues who do just that, I offer a  quote Thomas Paine wrote in ``The Crisis'': ``To argue with a person  who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to  the dead.''
