 Mr. President, today I rise to continue my series of  speeches on Russian hybrid warfare and the threat it poses to our  national security. Russian hybrid warfare occurs  [[Page S6763]]  below the level of direct military conflict, yet it is no less a threat  to our national security and the integrity of our democracy and our  society. We must reframe our thinking to understand that these are  attacks from a foreign adversary on our democratic institutions, our  free markets, and our open society.   We recently honored our fallen and observed the attacks of September  11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission Report, which looked into what happened  after the attacks, assessed that one of our government's failures in  preventing those attacks was a failure of imagination. Now, too, we  have the Director of National Intelligence telling us that the ``system  is blinking red,'' akin to the threats we received before 9/11. We must  be focused on the current problem as a national security threat. This  threat requires that the United States defend itself against hybrid  attacks with the same level of commitment and resolve as we would  against a military attack against our country.   For far too long, we have failed to recognize that hybrid attacks are  the new Russian form of warfare. As laid out in the Russian National  Security Strategy of 2015, the Kremlin's approach to conflict includes  weaponizing tools and resources from across government and society. The  Russian strategy states: ``Interrelated political, military, military- technical, diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are  being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic deterrence  and the prevention of armed conflicts.''   The Russian strategy describes the conventional and nonconventional  arenas of warfare as the Kremlin envisions it and how Russia has  utilized all of the tools of statecraft to engage an adversary without,  in many cases, firing a shot. These different disciplines make up a  Russian hybrid approach to confrontation below the threshold of direct- armed conflict, a method that has been developing and escalating since  the earliest days of Putin's rise to power in Russia.   The main tenets of the Kremlin's hybrid operations are these:  information operations with cyber tools, which people commonly think of  as hacking; propaganda and disinformation; manipulation of social  media; and malign influence, which can be deployed through political,  legal, or financial channels.   A further characteristic of Russian hybrid warfare is denial and  deception used to obscure its involvement. The Kremlin deploys more  than one hybrid warfare tactic simultaneously to provide maximum  effect.   A look at the Russian hybrid warfare doctrine also illuminates that  the Kremlin sees deterrence and prevention differently than we do. This  is a critical point. We see deterrence as a way to avoid conflict. They  are not merely using these tactics as deterrence or strategic  prevention in the way we think about these conflicts.   Instead, they are deploying these tactics aggressively but below the  threshold of where they assess we will respond with conventional  weapons. One such example was the hybrid warfare operations the Kremlin  deployed in Crimea, including covert forces sometimes referred to as  ``little green men'' and the use of coercive political tactics,  including an illegitimate referendum.   Now, previously I have addressed aspects of Russia's hybrid warfare  operations against the United States dealing with tactics of financial  malign influence and multiple hybrid tools they have deployed against  our democratic elections. Today I will discuss another Russian tactic  and its hybrid warfare arsenal: the use of assassination, politically  motivated violence, intimidation, or detention to pursue the Kremlin's  objectives. These tactics are sometimes referred to as dirty active  measures.   With dirty active measures, the immediate attack is deployed against  an individual who is working counter to the Kremlin's strategic goals  by challenging Putin's power base, exposing corruption, or unearthing  hybrid warfare operations.   But the damage of these hybrid warfare tactics goes well beyond the  individual killed, hurt, threatened, or jailed by the Kremlin. These  tactics cause chaos, fear, and instability to bystanders and have a  deterrent effect, sending a chilling message to others that might seek  to challenge the Kremlin's rule.   Further, the reach with which Putin has deployed these weapons inside  Russia, across Ukraine, Europe, and even in the United States instills  fear that if the Kremlin wants to get rid of you, there is nowhere to  hide.   Like all aspects of Russian hybrid warfare, dirty active measures are  part of a pattern of behavior that serve Russia's strategic interests.  Putin's highest strategic objective is preserving his grip on power. He  also seeks to operate unconstrained domestically and in the near  abroad. Finally, Putin seeks for Russia to be seen equal to the United  States and to regain the great power status it lost at the end of the  Cold War.   He knows he cannot effectively compete with the United States in  conventional ways and win. Instead, he seeks to use tools from his  hybrid warfare arsenal in order to divide us from our allies and  partners in the West and weaken our democratic societies from within.   The Putin regime has been engaged in a pattern of dirty active  measures for more than a decade, and the tempo has only increased since  he retook the Presidency in 2012. These tactics have increasing  implications for the United States and allied national security.   I want to address this tactic of dirty active measures because it has  taken on greater urgency due to recent events. In particular, I am  thinking of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military  intelligence officer, and his daughter on British soil and Putin's  threat against Ambassador McFaul and other U.S. Government officials at  the Helsinki Summit. These events may seem unrelated, but they are  actually part of a pattern of malicious and threatening Russian  behavior.   Today, I will explain the connection and make recommendations for how  we can deter and counter Russia's use of dirty active measures as part  of its hybrid warfare operations below the level of military conflict.   Dirty active measures have a long and sordid history in Russia and  the Soviet Union, dating back to czarist times. For assassinations,  poison was often the weapon of choice, including the attempted cyanide  poisoning of Rasputin in 1916. In 1921, Lenin opened a poison  laboratory to test methods to be used against political enemies named  the ``special room,'' which was also known as the ``lab of death.'' At  this lab, they developed the nerve agents known as novichoks, which  were designed to be undetectable and were recently deployed against the  Skirpals. These tactics were amplified under Stalin and featured  killings by hired assassins, staged automobile accidents, and  poisonings, used inside Russia and deployed abroad. Stalin notoriously  said:         Death solves all problems. No man, no problem.    Given President Putin's background as a spy master, it should come as  no surprise that Russia's use of dirty active measures have continued  under his regime. Before becoming Prime Minister and President, Putin  spent the majority of his career in the KGB, the state's security  service, and its successor, the FSB.   As Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov wrote, the KGB's ``main task  was always to protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the  Kremlin.'' In this system, loyalty and fidelity to the state is prized  above all, and Putin's values were shaped by it.   In 2005, Putin lamented that the breakup of the Soviet Union was the  greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. When he assumed  power, he resurrected a system that reflected Soviet methods. He  employed all of the instruments of the state, including the Parliament,  the courts, and security services, to protect his power base and to  allow him to pursue strategic objectives in the foreign arena  unconstrained.   Putin's use of hybrid warfare tactics of assassination, political  violence, intimidation, and detention--the dirty active measures--are  tenets of this system he created to cement his hold on power.   Putin has also manipulated the Parliament and the court system to  make and enforce laws that manufacture legal consent for tactics of  dirty active measures. As opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who  survived being  [[Page S6764]]  twice poisoned, wrote recently in the Washington Post, ``in Vladimir  Putin's Russia, laws are often passed with specific people in mind,  whether to reward or punish.'' Notably, in July of 2006, the Russian  Parliament gave President Putin permission to use Russian armed forces  and security services to perpetrate extrajudicial killings abroad on  people that Moscow accused of extremism. Companion legislation passed  about the same time expanded the definition of extremism to include  libelous statements about Putin's administration. This legislation  effectively gave those who carry out dirty active measures immunity.   In addition to the use of the legislative and legal mechanisms at  their disposal, the Kremlin unleashes a barrage of propaganda against  those targeted for dirty active measures. These information operations  contribute to a climate of fear targeting both the individuals the  Kremlin is trying to silence and the broader population. Propaganda  campaigns are also deployed after the dirty active measure is carried  out, in order to sow confusion and make people doubt whether Russia is  culpable.   Putin and his inner circle have drawn a distinct narrative, branding  those who oppose the Kremlin as criminals, thus deeming them as  deserving of punishment. They are often also accused of being part of  the so-called ``fifth column,'' Russians that Putin defines as  advancing foreign interests.    Worse than criminals in Putin's mind are those the Kremlin viewed as  having been loyal in the past but who are now working against the  interest of the state. These people are branded as traitors, and as the  New York Times reported last month, traitors hold a special status for  Putin. Putin's disdain for traitors stems from the early days of the  end of the Cold War, when dozens of former Soviet intelligence officers  became defectors or informants for the West.   According to the Times, ``Mr. Putin cannot speak of them without a  lip curl of disgust. They are `beasts' and `swine.' Treachery, he told  one interviewer, is the one thing he is incapable of forgiving. It  could also, he said darkly, be bad for your health.''   Putin publicly threatened those considered traitors on multiple  occasions. One of those episodes occurred in 2010. After a spy swap  between Russia and the United States, which included the recently  poisoned Skripal, Putin stated ominously: ``A person gives his whole  life for his homeland, and then some . . . [blank] comes along and  betrays such people. How will he be able to look into the eyes of his  children, the pig? Whatever they got in exchange for it, those thirty  pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them. Believe  me.''   For Putin, labeling his political opponents in these stark terms  helps to justify the dirty active measures deployed against these  individuals.   These tactics of dirty active measures have been used with impunity  inside Russia to silence and intimidate Kremlin critics and preserve  the system of power Putin created. They have been unleashed against  journalists, opposition leaders, oligarchs, and others seen as  betraying the system. A Senate Foreign Relations minority staff report  from January detailed more than two dozen Kremlin critics who died  under mysterious circumstances in Russia since Putin took power in  2000. The report separately compiled violent attacks and harassment on  human rights activists and journalists.   Russian opposition activists are also a target of dirty active  measures inside Russia. One example was the assassination of Boris  Nemtsov, a popular regional Governor and Deputy Prime Minister under  Yeltsin, who became disenchanted with Putin's political system. He  publicly exposed extensive corruption and covert use of Russian hybrid  warfare tactics in Ukraine. Arkady Ostrovsky, a Moscow correspondent  for the Economist, described the tactics of intimidation deployed  against him, including that he was stigmatized as a ``national  traitor'' and an ``American stooge.'' He was demonized on television  and on the streets banners with Nemtsov's face were hung on building  facades framed by the words ``fifth column--aliens among us.''   These threats were followed with Nemtsov being brazenly assassinated  steps from the Kremlin. Nemtsov appears to have been killed for  exposing corruption in Putin's inner circle and trying to serve as a  constraint on his ability to conduct hybrid warfare operations in  Ukraine. These acts were clearly seen as a threat to Putin's power and  his ability to act with impunity.   Attacks of dirty active measures inside Russia continue unabated.  This April, Russian journalist Maxim Borodin fell to his death after  investigating the Wagner paramilitary forces linked to a close Putin  ally and Russian troll farm patron, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Three additional  Russian journalists who were investigating Prigozhin-sponsored,  Kremlin-linked military activities, particularly in the Central African  Republic, were killed under suspicious circumstances in August. Just a  few weeks ago, the publisher of a website that exposes Kremlin abuses  in the criminal justice system fell ill from apparent poisoning. This  attack occurred on the same day he expected to receive the results of  an investigation he commissioned into the deaths of the journalists in  the Central African Republic.   As I have detailed here, these attacks are not officially linked back  to the Kremlin, allowing for plausible deniability, but are part of a  clear pattern of tactics deployed against those who work to expose  activities that may hurt Putin's base of power.   Putin has resorted to using dirty active measures beyond Russia's  borders, which demonstrates the willingness of the Kremlin to use these  tactics not only for domestic political purposes but also as part of  its hybrid warfare operations to advance Russia's strategic interests  against other countries.   Similar to other tactics of hybrid warfare operations, Ukraine is  usually where Russia deploys these tactics first, a testing ground for  tools that may be deployed in the West at a later time.   We see these tactics of dirty active measures deployed in Ukraine as  far back as 2005, when the more Western-oriented Viktor Yushchencko was  poisoned after he won the Presidency, beating Victor Yanukovych, the  preferred pro-Russian candidate.   The Kremlin continues to deploy dirty active measures, including  assassination, in Ukraine with impunity. Last May, Denis Voronenkov, a  former FSB colonel and a former Russian Parliament Member, was shot in  the head on a crowded Kiev sidewalk in broad daylight. Voronenkov was  once a close Putin ally who used his position to promote key Kremlin  priorities, including, ironically, annexing Crimea. He fled to Ukraine  in October of 2016 and began to criticize Putin's government. He was  slated to provide testimony to Ukrainian authorities that would expose  Kremlin deliberations prior to hybrid warfare operations against  Ukraine. Forebodingly, a few days before his murder, he told the  Washington Post: ``They say we are traitors in Russia.'' Again, the  idea that he could be shot brazenly in broad daylight served as a  warning to others who might want to expose hybrid warfare operations to  think twice, and that they can't escape even if they leave Russia.   Similar tactics were deployed against Montenegro as it considered and  ultimately chose to join NATO in 2015 and 2016. The Kremlin saw the  Montenegrin Government's decision to move closer to the West as a  threat to its strategic interests, including Russia's ability to  operate in Eastern Europe unconstrained.   When several other hybrid warfare operations, including propaganda  and information operations, failed to keep Montenegro from joining the  alliance, Russian military intelligence officers planned and attempted  to execute an election day coup that included a plan to assassinate the  Montenegrin Prime Minister. The attempt on the Prime Minister's life  was unsuccessful, fortunately. However, it showed the extremes to which  the Kremlin would go and the methods that were used to try to maintain  its strategic interests.   Beyond Ukraine and Montenegro, the Kremlin has increasingly  demonstrated a willingness to use dirty active measures in the West,  suggesting a sense that Russia feels it can operate with impunity even  in these countries.   One Western country where a pattern of Russian dirty active measures  appears prominently is in the United Kingdom. Investigative reports  have  [[Page S6765]]  unearthed an estimated 16 suspicious deaths over the past 12 years, and  that may not even be the totality.   The most well-known measure of Russian dirty active measures inside  the UK is Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB and FSB officer who blew  the whistle on corrupt practices of the FSB. While Litvinenko had  retired from spying, he did consulting work with the British and  Spanish intelligence services, helping both governments understand  connections between the Russian mafia, senior political figures, and  the FSB. Further, he continued to speak out against the Putin  government and expose Kremlin corruption.   Because of these actions, the Kremlin branded Litvinenko a traitor.  He received threatening emails from a former colleague who told him to  ``start writing a will.'' Litvinenko was later poisoned with polonium- 210. The poisoning also served as a deterrent to others.   The day after Litvinenko's death, a member of the Russian Parliament  stated:         The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his       death will be a warning to all the traitors that Russian       treason will not be forgiven.    Litvinenko's poisoning served as a prologue for the poisoning of  Sergei Skripal 12 years later. Skripal was a former Russian military  intelligence officer who was convicted of being a double agent and  sentenced to prison. As I mentioned earlier, he was traded as part of a  spy swap in 2010. He was given asylum in the United Kingdom. Press  reports indicate that, similar to Litvinenko, Skripal appeared to have  been working with the Spanish, Czech, and Estonian intelligence  services.   This March, he and his daughter were poisoned by novichok sprayed on  the door handle of his Salisbury, England, home. In conjunction with  the assassination attempt, Kremlin officials deflected, denied, and  deployed absurd propaganda and disinformation. They unleashed an  estimated 2,800 bots to cast doubt on Prime Minister May's assessment  that Russia was responsible and to amplify divisions among the British  people. They blamed the West for the poisoning and suggested it was a  hoax. Once the UK named suspects and pointed a finger at Russian  military intelligence, the two alleged perpetrators went on TV and  absurdly claimed to be sports nutritionists with a yearning desire to  visit a Salisbury cathedral.   Again, these killings are part of a pattern. Both Litvinenko and  Skripal were part of security services. They turned on the state and  were deemed traitors. Even when they appeared to be safe, they were  targeted for dirty active measures, sending the message that the  Kremlin was the ultimate arbiter and that they could reach traitors  anytime or anywhere. This message was also directed at others who might  wish to expose Putin's secrets in the future or try to constrain or  challenge his power.   The pattern of dirty active measures also extends to the United  States. This includes Mikhail Lesin, a former Kremlin insider who was  crucial to Putin's consolidation of the Russian media. Lesin was also  responsible for the rise of Russian TV and internet platform RT, a tool  the Kremlin uses to deploy propaganda and disinformation across the  world, including against the United States during the Presidential  election in 2016.   Lesin was reported to have had a falling out with two members of  Putin's inner circle, including a longtime friend known as Putin's  banker. Lesin was found dead in a Washington, DC, hotel room in  November of 2015. The DC coroner concluded that the death was  accidental and that he died alone, despite noting that Lesin had  sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, and upper and lower  extremities. Lesin was allegedly planning to tell the secrets of a  major component of the Kremlin's hybrid warfare operations to the  Justice Department when he appeared to have conveniently died before he  could explain its inner workings.   Similar to other dirty active measures campaigns, the Kremlin  unleashed a disinformation campaign to ensure plausible deniability and  generate confusion about the circumstances surrounding his death. Here,  too, Lesin appears to fit the pattern of being targeted for revealing  aspects of the hybrid warfare campaigns that the Kremlin has come to  rely on.   In what appears to have been an even more brazen move for Putin, he  engaged in dirty active measures while the whole world was watching.  While standing next to President Trump in Helsinki, President Putin  proposed that he would allow Special Counsel Mueller to interview the  12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted on charges of  ``large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 Presidential  election.'' But there was a catch. Putin announced that in return, he  would expect that Russian authorities would be able to question current  and former U.S. Government officials whom Putin described as having  ``something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia.''  President Trump stood next to President Putin during this  disinformation operation and endorsed it as being an ``incredible''  offer that he and his administration actually considered.   The very next day, Russian officials announced a list of 11 accused  ``criminals'' whom they wanted to interrogate because, in the course of  doing the work of the United States of America, they took stances that  the Kremlin opposed. Among those listed was a congressional staffer who  helped write the Magnitsky sanctions act and former U.S. Ambassador to  Russia Michael McFaul, who served as the point person during the Obama  Administration and as Ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014.   During McFaul's time as Ambassador to Russia, the Kremlin unleashed  its hybrid warfare playbook against him. They denounced him as an enemy  and had security forces follow his family. The Kremlin also deployed a  disinformation campaign against him that accused him of being a  pedophile. The Kremlin was using these active measures in an attempt to  instill fear in him and others that they could be killed, hurt, or  jailed for doing the work of the U.S. Government.   The United States and Western countries more broadly must understand  that these attacks are not random; they are part of a pattern, a  doctrine of hybrid warfare being expressed across the globe. We need to  understand that assassinations, violence, threats, and intimidation are  tools and tactics that Putin is using to achieve strategic or foreign  policy goals, and these activities are harming our national security.   For instance, the New York Times reported in August that vital  Kremlin informants have gone silent, leaving our intelligence community  in the dark about what Russia's plans are for November's midterm  elections. The report continues that American officials familiar with  the intelligence ``concluded they have gone to ground amid more  aggressive counterintelligence by Moscow, including efforts to kill  spies.''    These are not just brutal tragedies or incidents; the use of dirty  active measures are purposeful and are intended to advance Putin's  agenda short of using tools of conventional warfare.   The United States must lead with strong denouncements against dirty  active measures and all other hybrid tactics used by Russia or any  other country. It is particularly critical that the President denounce  Russian threats against U.S. officials for their actions in carrying  out U.S. foreign policy or advancing our national security interests.  Instead, the President's deference to Putin at Helsinki sent the wrong  signal to Putin in the face of his threats.   Fortunately, the Senate has taken some action, including voting 98 to  0 to protect our diplomats and other government officials implementing  U.S. policy after Putin requested they be turned over for questioning.  However, our government must speak with one voice and send consistent  messages that this kind of action will not be tolerated and that Putin  will pay consequences for his behavior.   While it is important that we respond to these attacks, including  with unequivocal denouncements of these tactics by the President and by  the Congress, we should not be in the business of trying to respond to  these attacks symmetrically. Putin resorts to using these tactics  because he believes they give him an advantage over the West. We need  to stay true to our ideals of democracy, human rights, and liberty.  [[Page S6766]]  We don't need to normalize or legitimize these methods by engaging in  them ourselves. Doing so would simply create a false moral equivalence  that plays right into Putin's hands. Instead, we must employ responses  that play to our strengths. We stand for transparency and  accountability in the United States. We stand for the rule of law. We  must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that deploys tools  that are consistent with and showcase these values. We must shine a  light on corruption at the highest levels of the Putin regime. We must  shine a light on how Putin's cronies are hiding their ill-gotten gains  in the West. We must deploy a systematic and strategic messaging  campaign that counters the base of Putin's power, reputation, and  funding.   We must take these actions in concert with our allies and partners.  In response to the Skripal poisoning, the United States expelled 60  Russian diplomats, joining with more than 25 ally and partner nations  in applying diplomatic pressure on Russia. This action sent a strong  signal that the world would not allow Putin to act with impunity. When  we act together with our allies and partners to push back against these  hybrid operations, it imposes a cost to Putin's reputation on the world  stage, which thwarts one of his major strategic interests.   While these steps were in the right direction, they have been  undermined by the President's words and actions. Despite punitive  measures in response to the Skripal poisoning, the Kremlin thought that  the Helsinki summit erased that damage. Press reports indicate that  Western and U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that the Kremlin was  pleased with the outcome of the summit at Helsinki and is confused as  to why President Trump is not implementing more Russia-friendly  policies.   One important tool in our arsenal for holding the Kremlin accountable  is sanctions, including those on Putin's inner circle. In particular,  sanctions implemented under the Magnitsky Act appear to be particularly  threatening to him. This act was passed in response to the death of  Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered massive tax fraud and corruption that  was traced back to Kremlin officials. He was arrested in Russia and  placed in jail, where he was tortured until he died.   The origins of the Magnitsky Act were to hold accountable those in  the Russian Government who were complicit in Magnitsky's abuse and  death by sanctioning their assets and barring them from receiving  American visas. Subsequently, the Magnitsky Act has been expanded to  include others who are culpable of acts of significant corruption and  abuse.   Russia expert Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic and  International Studies testified recently at a Banking Committee hearing  about the significance of the Magnitsky sanctions to Putin. She said:         Because the Kremlin has based its economic model and its       survival on kleptocracy, sanctions and other policy       instruments dedicated to preventing the furtherance of       corruption--or worse yet in the minds of the Kremlin, to       providing accurate information to the Russian people of the       extent of this corruption--are a powerful countermeasure to       Russia's malign behavior.    The Magnitsky sanctions, along with those designated under the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA,  threaten Putin's power structure and present a counter-narrative of  corruption and abuse by the Kremlin.   We need to continue to use these sanctions to hold those who are  complicit in dirty active measures and those who are responsible for  aggression, corruption, and interfering in our elections accountable.  Ratcheting up sanctions on those in Putin's inner circle is a way to  make Putin and his cronies feel pain and has the potential to change  their behavior. Additional sanctions should be imposed on oligarchs and  high-ranking government officials to target Putin's base of power and  further expose the corrupt nature of their sources of income.   We should also consider declassifying the so-called 241 report  compiled by the intelligence community along with the Departments of  Treasury and State. This report required an assessment of the net worth  of senior Kremlin officials and oligarchs, their relationship to Putin  and his inner circle, and evidence of corrupt practices. If we were to  release such a report--with redactions for portions with national  security implications--to the public, it would further expose malign  activity and unexplained streams of wealth.   Congress has provided many tools for the administration to implement,  and it is time to utilize them fully. Implementing them in a  transparent, public manner is likely to cause reputational harm to  Putin himself and restore a level of confidence in the administration  here at home. However, specifically targeting sanctions this way is  unlikely to cause large-scale harm to the Russian people or to our  European allies.   It is very clear that implementing sanctions is far more effective  when done with the cooperation of the international community. The most  effective sanctions regimes are those that are implemented in a  multilateral fashion.   I urge the administration to engage with our allies and partners to  coordinate sanctions enforcement and further escalatory steps as  warranted. That includes working through diplomatic channels to ensure  that the sanctions placed on Russia by the European Union remain in  place. A coordinated front of the United States and our European allies  provides the greatest chance of successful implementation of sanctions  and deterring further aggression by Russia.   The administration must also place a premium on exerting diplomatic  pressure to isolate those who flout or do not enforce sanctions on  Russia.   Another form of pressure should be an increase in assistance to pro- democracy and civil society groups in Russia and in nations of the  former Soviet Union. Working with these groups in conjunction with our  allies, partners, and the private sector would provide another means of  raising the costs of Putin and his oligarchs. Putin is threatened by  the success of democracies and private enterprise.   In addition to sanctions, we must continue to play a strong role in  law enforcement, along with our allies and partners. That includes  aggressive prosecution of murders and threats of violence to limit the  impunity. With Litvinenko, it took almost 10 years for the United  Kingdom to have an official inquiry into the assassination. The United  Kingdom has acted quicker in the wake of the Skripal poisoning, moving  to identify suspects and hold the Kremlin accountable for these  actions. We need to adopt UK's lessons learned to ensure that those who  seek to use these weapons will be prosecuted fully and without delay.   We have missed too many of these dirty active measures operations for  far too long. We must recognize this is an element of Russia's hybrid  warfare. We must not fail to have the imagination to see what is  happening right before our eyes. We must do more to identify and  attribute these attacks from Russia. These attacks have only grown more  brazen and will not stop unless we take strong measures to counter them  and send the message that dirty active measures are unacceptable and  will be costly to Russia or any other country which uses them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I join the city of Providence and the State  of Rhode Island in celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Loew's  Theatre Building, home of the Providence Center for the Performing  Arts. From silent films to the Mighty Wurlitzer to live concerts and  Broadway productions, the Loew's Theatre Building has delighted,  educated, and entertained generations of Rhode Islanders.   On October 6, 1928, the theater opened its doors to more than 14,000  people who came to see its splendor and the silent film ``Excess  Baggage.'' Designed by the renowned theater architects George and C.W.  Rapp, the Loew's Theatre featured marble columns, gilded plasterwork,  and crystal chandeliers.   After early years of success, the theater saw a decline in its  economic fortunes as movie attendance waned. The theater sustained  damage during the hurricanes of 1938 and 1954 and barely escaped  demolition in the 1970s. Fortunately, local leaders stepped in to save  this landmark. In 1977, the Loew's Theatre Building was officially  listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the following  year, a nonprofit organization was founded to restore its luster and  establish a performing arts center for the community to enjoy.   Today the Providence Performing Arts Center is a hub of cultural  activity. It not only brings top-flight productions to town but also  offers a broad selection of community outreach programs, fulfilling its  mission of serving ``the entertainment needs of the State's various  populations by presenting the widest possible variety of arts and  cultural events.'' The center presents free, community concerts  featuring the Mighty Wurlitzer, the rare 1927 pipe organ, one of only  three ever made. There is a seats for servicemembers initiative that  offers preferred orchestra seating to our military families. There are  arts scholarships, summer theater programs, and special opportunities  for students to experience live theater productions.   Ninety years ago, Rhode Islanders flocked to the Loew's Theatre  Building to share in something grand. We are grateful for the steady  leadership and many contributions of the board of directors, dedicated  staff, and generous benefactors who have made this historic landmark a  living institution that continues to enrich the cultural life of our  community. The Providence Performing Arts Center is still grand. May it  continue to be so for generations to come.                            ____________________
