 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me,  first, praise Senator Wyden for his continuing effort on behalf of the  Baha'is. As he has mentioned, we have worked together on this in the  past. I am strongly supportive.   I am in complete agreement with what Senator Wyden wants to do in  terms of shining a spotlight on the abuses that the Baha'is face at the  hands of the Iranian regime and taking steps to protect that community.   I believe that religious freedom and support for religious minorities  is a fundamental right, one we have to defend both at home and abroad.  For decades, Iran has persecuted religious minorities, ethnic  minorities, women--as we have seen most pointedly of late--and anyone  who does not toe the regime's line.   Senator Wyden's resolution addresses an important issue. My challenge  here is that we have a flood of requests to release the committee both  of resolutions and legislation, including of members of the committee,  and we have said no in order to preserve the opportunity to have the  imprint of the committee's process on any given resolution or piece of  legislation. In order to preserve that, we ultimately have a challenge.  If we were to allow this to happen at this point, there would be an  enormous number.   So what I can commit to the Senator is that at the very beginning of  this new session, the committee will take up your resolution. I will  work with  [[Page S7806]]  the ranking member, as we have comity, but we will take up the  resolution, look to pass it out, and then work with you to make sure it  passes to the floor.    Sure.    And because of that, I object at this point.
