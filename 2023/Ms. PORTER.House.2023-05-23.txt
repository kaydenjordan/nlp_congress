 Mr. Speaker, ``I pledge my head to clearer thinking, my  heart to greater loyalty, my hands to larger service, and my health to  better living for my club, my community, my country, and my world.''   If it wasn't clear, I am a 4-H'er.   A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting with 4-H student  ambassadors from across California. They shared how the 4-H program has  empowered them, from building water filters from reusable materials to  developing public speaking and organizational skills.   4-H doesn't discriminate between urban, suburban, and rural  communities. I am here today representing Orange County because of my  experiences from this 4-H program.   As Congress begins consideration of the farm bill, let's continue to  invest in our Nation's young people with robust funding for the 4-H  program because our future leaders might be 4-H'ers themselves.                            ____________________
