 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Pea  Ridge Mayor Jackie Crabtree who is retiring after 27 years of leading  his community.   When Crabtree was elected mayor of Pea Ridge in 1994, it was a part- time position that oversaw a population of 1,300 people. He helped  usher in growth and development that, today, underpins a flourishing  community that now boasts nearly 6,600 residents.   In his decades of service and commitment, Mayor Crabtree successfully  met the moment to change the community including providing the services  and needs citizens rely on such as a full-time fire department and  paramedics and an expanded police department.   His leadership was crucial to improving the infrastructure in the  city with an upgraded wastewater treatment plant, new water lines, and  additional sidewalks.   The list of accomplishments he has directed is lengthy, but he is  quick to credit his dedicated team. Mayor Crabtree's humility reflects  his success as a leader and public servant.   The mayor considers it an honor and privilege to serve the people of  Pea Ridge. They will surely miss his vision and dedication, but I am  confident he will continue to be involved and engaged.   From a career at Walmart, to the Pea Ridge School Board and president  of the Arkansas Municipal League, Mayor Crabtree has spent countless  hours giving back to his community and beyond. I applaud him for his  commitment to helping others and enacting positive change. I appreciate  his example and many years of friendship.   I wish him the best of luck in his retirement where he will be able  to spend more time with his wife and high school sweetheart Freida Sue  Booth and their son Eric, daughter-in-law Shelly, and granddaughters  Mahala and Kaylea.                            ____________________
