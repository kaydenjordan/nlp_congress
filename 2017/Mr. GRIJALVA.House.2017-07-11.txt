 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1404, as was stated by my two colleagues, is a  culmination of a longstanding land agreement between Tucson Unified  School District and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. In the 113th Congress, we  finalized part of that agreement with the passage and signing of H.R.  507, which conveyed the two 10-acre parcels.   Both of my colleagues have stated the purpose of the legislation, the  need for the legislation. The passage of this bill will complete the  second part of that agreement, and both parties involved, as well as  the surrounding communities, all see mutual benefit in this.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that the bill is acted upon positively, that it  passes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Bishop for his cooperation in  working with our staff to bring this to the floor today, and I urge its  adoption.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5407]]
