 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Arizona, Senator Sinema, in introducing legislation to support the  ongoing operation of the national child abuse hotline, which is  currently operated by Childhelp, a national non-profit. Of all the  major national help hotlines, the crisis line for child abuse and  neglect is the only one without a Federal authorization and dedicated  funding. Our bill, the National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 2021,  would give the Administration for Children and Families the authority  to award funding to increase Federal support for this important  hotline.   Tragically, on average, five children die every day from child abuse  and neglect. According to the most recent Department of Health and  Human Services' Child Maltreatment Report, 656,000 children were  victims of child abuse and neglect in 2019, and a heartbreaking 1,770  children died--including three young children in Maine. The many  stresses created by the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated the risks  for vulnerable children, and I fear that the data from 2020 and 2021  will show a worsening crisis.   According to the CDC, ``heightened stress, school closures, loss of  income, and social isolation resulting from . . . . the COVID-19  pandemic have increased the risk for child abuse and neglect.'' As  Michelle Fingerman of Childhelp, the current operator of the Childhelp  National Child Abuse Hotline, details: ``There is a wide range of  fallout from pandemic anxiety and school shutdowns. There is more abuse  already occurring in homes where caregivers are melting down from the  stress, children are trapped at home with abusers, schools and daycare  are closed, and therapists and other frontline providers are now more  difficult to access.''   Despite these risks, official reports to child protection agencies  have declined across the country, in some places by as much as seventy  percent. But, fewer official reports does not mean abuse and neglect  are on the decline. To the contrary, less in-person contact between  children and mandated reporters like teachers, physicians, and coaches  is one explanation for this reporting decline. Additionally, while the  number of emergency department visits related to child abuse and  neglect decreased in 2020, the percentage of visits severe enough to  require hospitalization increased. Better access to prevention and  intervention services can help stop these troubling trends.   The Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is a resource that is  accessible to children and families across the country, especially  while many children are still not attending school in person full-time.  A simple phone call or text to the hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child can  connect people with those who can come to a child's aid before the  unimaginable occurs. The hotline saw 11,573 contacts in May 2020, which  is more than 40 percent higher than during May 2019. Childhelp's text  and online chat platforms also experienced a significant volume  increase last year. For the past few years, Congress has appropriated  $1 million to pilot these platforms, and our legislation would help the  grantee chosen by ACF expand its reach to more children and families.   The helpline serves a wide range of individuals in every single  state--at-risk children, distressed parents seeking crisis  intervention, and concerned individuals who suspect that child abuse  may be occurring. In Maine, where one in every 71 children is a victim  of abuse, the National Child Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers  in 2019. Those in need are connected--either on the phone, text, or  online  [[Page S1675]]  chat--with social workers who can offer confidential crisis  intervention, information, and referrals to emergency, social service,  and support resources.   The National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act would provide a meaningful  Federal investment to protect children across the country, authorizing  $2 million annually for the Administration for Children and Families  (ACF) to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to support a 24-hour,  national, toll-free telephone hotline. That hotline will get  information and assistance to victims of child abuse or neglect,  parents, caregivers, mandated reporters, and other concerned community  members. This will not interfere with any state-mandated reporter  hotlines and will bolster those state efforts. In fact, the current  operator has more than 80 community partners in just Maine alone.   Mr. President, child abuse is preventable, and the helpline's  prevention and intervention activities are both successful and well- documented. Consistent Federal support for the National Child Abuse  Hotline will improve our ability to reach children of all ages, as well  as parents or caregivers, during the pandemic and beyond. I urge my  colleagues to support the adoption of this important legislation that  could save lives.                            ____________________
