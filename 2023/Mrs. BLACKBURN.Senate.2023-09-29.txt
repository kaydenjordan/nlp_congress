 Mr. President, I join my colleagues on the floor this  morning to pay tribute to Senator Feinstein and to remember her warmth,  her generosity, her kindness, and the way she really loved to elevate  women. It didn't matter what your party was; it didn't matter where you  came from; when you achieved, she loved to recognize that.   As I came to the Senate from the House and in being the first female  from Tennessee to serve in the U.S. Senate, she talked about the  likeness of that experience for her as breaking barriers and being the  first female mayor of San Francisco and being the first woman from  California to hold a seat in the U.S. Senate. So I always appreciated  that she pushed forward with elevating women and encouraging women.   Of course, as we all know, she loved to gather the women of the  Senate together for dinner or for a photo to make certain that we  recorded our gains here in the Senate and that we had a place to share  our stories of what we were experiencing, because we all know there  were times that she had incurred different unkind words from people who  thought that she should not be in that position. So we appreciated that  of her.   I really enjoyed the opportunity to work with her on the Senate  Judiciary  [[Page S4807]]  Committee. She and I spent quite a bit of time working on issues that  pertained to our Nation's creative community. This was a community that  she truly celebrated. She loved the fact that people could create a  song out of a thought or a few words that they heard.   We worked together to protect those rights, the entertainers, and to  make certain that, as we worked on the HITS Act, as we worked on  intellectual property issues, that our innovators and our creators were  going to have that constitutional right protected to benefit from those  creations.   We all know--and I know many of my colleagues have mentioned today-- of her fondness for the Senate and for the institution. We will  remember that as we wish her family well and wish them protection  during this time of loss and sadness.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on June 27, 2014, an email was sent  to an individual who works with Iran's Foreign Ministry. The sender of  that email was seeking advice on whether she should attend a workshop  on Iran's nuclear program hosted by Ben-Gurion University in Israel.   The sender wrote:         I am not interested in going, but then I thought maybe it       would be better that I go and talk, rather than an Israeli       like Emily Landau who goes and disseminates disinformation. I       would like to ask your opinion, too, and see if you think I       should accept the invitation and go.    In a normal world, we would chalk this up to an academic seeking  politically charged advice from a mentor. But I became concerned when I  learned that this individual who wrote that email, who was actively  seeking guidance from individuals within the Iranian Foreign Ministry,  now has a U.S. Government Top Secret clearance and works within our  Defense Department as the Chief of Staff for the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict.   Just to be sure we are following this, this is a U.S. citizen who  wrote to someone inside Iran's Foreign Ministry to seek advice on going  to a conference in Israel and speaking at that so that they would speak  instead of someone who was pro-Israel. They were asking their advice.   Well, this individual is Miss Ariane Tabatabai, and that email was  not the last one that she sent to her friend who was there in Iran's  Foreign Ministry. She also wrote him a few weeks later, on July 10,  2014, to let him know that she was offering testimony to Congress on  the Iran nuclear deal and needed some advice on how to handle it.   To be sure that we are continuing to follow this, she is going to be  speaking to Congress, and she is asking the advice of someone inside  Iran's Foreign Ministry on how she should handle her testimony before  the U.S. Congress.   Now, some of my colleagues may have seen the Semafor article  detailing these communications and the extent of Iranian influence  operations against the United States. It contained details about the  Iran Experts Initiative, referred to often as the IEI, which was a  brainchild of the Rouhani administration.   It tasked a handful of second-generation Iranians with planting pro- nuclear Iran ideology in Western think tanks and writing propaganda  demanding compromise with Tehran.   So the IEI is a part of Iran's soft propaganda. It is very  intentional. We know that they were using this to push pro-Iran  stories. It wasn't a casual operation. The Iranian Foreign Minister and  his nuclear negotiating team were involved in creating this group-- creating this group--there to support pushing the nuclear complex, the  nuclear buildup in Iran.   Well, Miss Tabatabai was a part of the core group of the IEI, as it  was referred to--that tight-knit core group. Remember, this is the Iran  Experts Initiative. And from what we can gather, by all accounts, she  was very good at her job. We know this because we have now seen emails  between the Iranian officials in charge of this propaganda mill  boasting about the success of their propaganda mill.   And just a few years after Tabatabai made a name for herself, pushing  propaganda for Iran, the Biden administration invited her to take a  seat at the table as part of Robert Malley's Iran nuclear negotiating  team.   You remember Robert Malley. He was the lead negotiator on the 2015  JCPOA--or, as we commonly call it, the Iran nuclear deal. And then, in  2021, Biden named him the U.S. Special Envoy for Iran. It was his job  to bring the United States and Iran into compliance with the failed  nuclear deal.   Now, this is a tweet from June of that year sent by a high-ranking  Russian diplomat whose job it was to help reimplement this deal. It  shows the U.S. delegation at the negotiating table, hammering out the  details with the Iranians.   And that is Ms. Tabatabai on the end in the pink blazer. She was not  a background player. She was someone who had a seat at the negotiating  table.   For almost 3 years now, I have come to the floor to implore President  Biden and his advisers to just pay attention to the blatant information  warfare against our country that is being carried out every single day  by the new ``axis of evil''--Russia, China, Iran, North Korea.   Now, we have seen this take many forms. We see it with the remaining  Confucius Institutes that are still in our country. We see it on  TikTok. But for the most part, Biden has chosen to ignore the risk  these influence operations pose to our country.   Now, we know his administration found a willing participant in an  Iranian-influenced operation. He hired her. He gave her a U.S.  Government top-secret security clearance and sent her to negotiate with  the very officials that once she worked for.   Remember, she was a part of the Iran Experts Initiative. This is  beyond poor judgment. This is dangerous. It is also rather unthinkable.   I would also remind my colleagues that earlier this year, her former  boss and colleague, Robert Malley, was placed on leave after the State  Department suspended his security clearance. They had reason to believe  he was mishandling classified material.   Yesterday, we learned that the Pentagon is going to review  Tabatabai's links to Tehran. But that is not sufficient. I want to know  how it could be possible that the Biden administration found nothing of  concern when they vetted her.   That is why I have sent this letter over to the Pentagon demanding  answers to these questions. The American people deserve to know. How in  the world someone who had worked for the Iranian Experts Initiative had  been a part of what was called the core group--how could they possibly  get a security clearance?   But, you know, considering the links to which this administration has  gone to appease Iran, I imagine their response will be just as  satisfying as the other that some of my colleagues and I have received  in our attempts to exercise oversight over some of these foreign policy  and national security issues. The American people deserve answers.   I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the Secretary of Defense  regarding the foreign contacts of Ariane Tabatabai be printed in the  Record.  [[Page S4821]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 September 28, 2023.      Hon. Lloyd J. Austin III,      Secretary of Defense,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Austin: I am writing to express my concern       over the actions taken by Ariane Tabatabai, the current Chief       of Staff for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special       Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (ASD/SOLIC). Iran is an       evil, violent regime that supports terrorism and seeks to       annihilate freedom loving countries across the globe. Under       the Obama-Biden administration, your boss helped make it       easier for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon--showing regimes       across the world that the United States will reward them for       abusing human rights. Last year, the Iranian government       murdered a woman for not wearing a head scarf. There is no       other way to put it: Iran is a barbaric country.        This administration has gone to great lengths to appease       Iran--taking the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen off the Foreign       Terrorist Organization list and ending U.S. support for Saudi       Arabia and the UAE's war against the group. And just this       month, on the anniversary of 9/11, President Biden       incentivized Iran's terrorist activities and conceded our       nation's future security as he handed over a $6 billion       payout to Iran.        Given your administration's intentional appeasement of the       Iranian regime, it is unfortunately not surprising that you       are allowing those with close ties to Iran to serve in a       senior role. It is vital to the security of our nation to       thoroughly evaluate all individuals with links to the regime       that wish to operate within the Department of Defense. It is       imperative that no one with direct affiliations to the       Iranian regime have access to sensitive information or       influence over United States foreign policy.        According to a report, on June 27, 2014, Ms. Tabatabai       consulted with an individual within Iran's Foreign Ministry       over attending a workshop regarding the Iran's nuclear       program at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. To quote Ms.       Tabatabai. ``I am not interested in going, but then I thought       maybe it would be better that I go and talk, rather than an       Israeli like Emily Landau who goes and disseminates       disinformation. I would like to ask your opinion too and see       if you think I should accept the invitation and go.'' She       also wrote to that same individual that she was to give       testimony before the U.S. Congress on the nuclear deal.        Ms. Tabatabai's relationship with Iranian government       representatives, along with her malicious comments regarding       our ally, Israel, as a representative of the U.S. Department       of Defense is undeniably unacceptable. Ms. Tabatabai's ties       to the Iranian regime are dangerous and raise questions about       potential foreign adversarial influence within the Department       of Defense. Additionally, these reports call into question       whether Ms. Tabatabai should be permitted to a security       clearance with access to classified materials.        I ask a response to the following questions no later than       October 6th, 2023:        1. What level clearance does Ms. Tabatabai currently       possess?        2. How long has she held this clearance level?        3. Was her affiliation with the Iran Experts Initiative       (IEI) discussed during the processing of her security       clearance?        4. Has the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency       (DCSA) reviewed Ms. Tabatabai's SF-86 for consistency since       the release of this information?        5. Is it a standard Department of Defense policy to clear       speaking engagements with a foreign leader prior to       finalizing the decision?        6. Does the Department of Defense plan to question Ms.       Tabatabai on if there is additional information she has       leaked to foreign governments?        7. Has Ms. Tabatabai ever been in the position to make       impacts that directly impact the country of Israel?        8. Did Ms. Tabatabai have access to classified documents       related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action?            Sincerely,                                                  Marsha Blackburn,                                                      U.S. Senator.     I yield the floor.
