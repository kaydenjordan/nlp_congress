Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Democrats dropped the latest version of  their tax-and-spending spree last week. And like every previous  version, this bill is a bad deal for the American people.   So where should I start? Well, maybe with the bill's title. In true  Orwellian style, Democrats are calling the bill the Inflation Reduction  Act, even though the bill would do nothing to reduce inflation. And you  don't have to take my word for it.   The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model analyzed the bill and found  that the bill would not reduce inflation. In fact, the analysis found  that  [[Page S3843]]  the Democrats' bill would contribute to inflation through 2024 and have  no material impact on inflation in the long term.    Inflation has hit working Americans hard. Their grocery bills have  ballooned. Rents have skyrocketed. Filling up their cars costs 75  percent more per gallon than it did when the President took office.  Their utility bills have increased. And the list goes on.   Families are having to cut back on purchases and dig into their  savings or pull out their credit cards--or in some cases, visit a food  bank--to make ends meet.   And what does Democrats' tax-and-spending spree do to help? Nothing.  Americans are dealing with the worst inflation in more than 40 years,  and Democrats' bill does nothing to help end our current crisis.   So what does the bill do? Well, for one thing, it raises taxes. That  is right. Our economy has shrunk for each of the past two quarters--in  fact, by any common definition we are now in a recession--and the  Democrats' bill raises taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars.   Here is what the Democratic leader previously had to say about  raising taxes in a recession.         If we're in a recession and we're in a difficult economic       time, I don't think Sen. Obama or anyone else is going to       raise any taxes. You don't want to take money out of the       economy when the economy is shrinking.    That is something the Democratic leader has previously said.   President Obama himself expressed a similar sentiment when he said:         [T]he last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the       middle of a recession.    ``The last thing.'' Apparently, that doesn't apply when Democrats  have Green New Deal projects they want to pay for.   The Democrats' bill attempts to offset the cost of the Green New Deal  spending spree by raising taxes on American businesses, particularly-- particularly--manufacturers. The proposed book minimum tax would be a  $313 billion tax hike, with roughly half of that increase falling on  American manufacturers.   I don't think I need to tell anyone the likely outcome of raising  taxes on businesses, particularly when the economy is contracting. The  likely outcome is less growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs.   According to an analysis from the National Association of  Manufacturers, in 2023 alone, the bill would reduce real gross domestic  product by more than $68 billion and result in 218,108 fewer workers in  the overall economy--218,000 fewer workers in 2023 alone. That is  according to the National Association of Manufacturers if the  Democrats' bill passes.   The Democrats' bill also raises taxes on the energy sector-- specifically, on domestic oil and gas production. It is another face- palm move from Democrats.   Currently, gas prices are 75 percent higher than they were when  President Biden took office. Electricity prices are up. The cost of  utility gas service is way up. And yet Democrats think it is a good  idea to raise taxes on domestic oil and gas production. Apparently,  Democrats want our current high energy prices to stick around for the  long term.   So what are Democrats going to use all that tax-hike money for? Well,  for one thing, they are going to use it to fund Green New Deal  projects; critical priorities like monitoring gaps in tree canopy  coverage and road equity and funding--funding--for the post office's  purchase of electric delivery vehicles.   And then there are the multiple slush funds for Green New Deal  projects and the tax credit for the purchase of a new electric car or  truck. Of course, you will only be able to use the credit if you can  afford to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $60,000, which is the  average price for a new electric vehicle, while we are in the middle of  a recession.   So it would almost undoubtedly be mostly Americans with higher  salaries--and according to the bill, up to $300,000 per household--who  would be able to make use of this credit. So it is a tax credit to buy  electric vehicles for rich people.   But I guess Democrats think electric vehicle tax credits for  wealthier Americans are a good use of taxpayer dollars.   What else is in here? I mentioned the bill's tax hikes, but the  Democrats' bill also attempts to raise revenue by increasing IRS audits  and enforcement. That is right. The Democrats' bill would more than  double the current number of IRS employees, making the Agency nearly  three times larger than the U.S. Customs and Border Protection--the  Agency, I might add, that is charged with security at all of our  Nation's borders--and more than 50 percent larger--this is the IRS on  the Democrats' plan--more than 50 percent larger than the entire U.S.  Department of Agriculture.   Democrats give the IRS a whopping $80 billion in additional funding  over the next 10 years. Of that $80 billion, 57 percent goes to  enforcement; 4 percent goes to taxpayer services. That is right: 4  percent. This is an Agency that only succeeded in answering about 1 out  of every 50 phone calls during the 2021 tax season, and yet 4 percent  of the $80 billion is going to taxpayer services. Fifty-seven percent  goes to enforcement so that the IRS can spend more time harassing  taxpayers around this country. Democrats are focused not on improving  the IRS's responsiveness to taxpayers, but on boosting the number of  IRS audits.   I still haven't mentioned the bill's socialist-style price controls  for prescription drugs--price controls that would result in fewer new  drugs and treatments. A study from last November found that Democrats'  price control plans would result in 135 fewer new drugs through 2039.  That is a lot of potentially life-changing and lifesaving treatments to  lose.   Then, of course, there is Democrats' plan to expand Obamacare  subsidies to higher earning Americans, a move which would drive up the  cost of health insurance.   I could go on.   Most Americans remember the lead-up to Democrats' American Rescue  Plan spending spree last March. We were promised--they were promised-- at the time that passing that bill would have big benefits for our  economy and for American families. Well, we know what actually  happened. Democrats' reckless spending spree helped trigger the worst  inflation for decades, and American families have suffered as a result.   Now we are being asked to swallow a similar story about the  Democrats' latest spending legislation. This bill will help our  economy, we are told, even though we know it would make life harder for  American businesses and workers at a time when the economy is already  contracting. Make no mistake about that. This is the second consecutive  quarter where we have had negative economic growth, negative GDP  growth, in our economy.   It will help inflation, Democrats claim, even though a nonpartisan  analysis said it would do nothing--nothing to help alleviate our  current crisis.   It will reduce our deficit, Democrats say, relying on some very shady  accounting measures to reach their supposed deficit reduction number.   It will help lower energy prices, the President claims, even though  new energy taxes would further inflate near-term energy bills during a  season of already historic prices.   You would think Democrats might have been chastened by their  disastrous American Rescue Plan spending spree, but you would be wrong.  Apparently, Democrats are determined to get in another disastrous  spending bill. And, once again, it will be the American people that  will be left to suffer the consequences.
