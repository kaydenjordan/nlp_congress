 Madam Speaker, the gun violence epidemic has  horribly impacted American communities across the Nation. Texas is no  exception, and neither was El Paso.   In 2019 the El Paso community was shaken to its core when a crazed  gunman drove more than 11 hours to stop what he called the ``Hispanic  invasion of Texas.''   All of us know that his hatred and bigotry was encouraged from the  highest levels of our government and played upon stereotypes developed  in American media from hard news to Hollywood for generations.   This appalling event led to 23 innocent lives being cut short and  dozens injured in the deadliest targeted attack on Latinos in modern  American history.   But El Paso did not collapse in the face of tragedy. Instead, they  banded together to mourn their loved ones and rebuild their community,  and we, as Americans, stood with them. That summer we were all ``El  Paso strong.''   By designating the El Paso Community Healing Garden as a federally  recognized national memorial site, we will continue to honor the  victims and provide solace to survivors who have shown their remarkable  strength and resiliency on their path to healing.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support my friend, Representative  Escobar's, bill, H.R. 4380, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
