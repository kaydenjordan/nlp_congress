 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   After 7 years, we have heard the stories of our constituents,  patients, friends, and family who have suffered under ObamaCare. We  have heard from those who have benefited in some respects.   I think of the struggles of constituents like Indra from Bend,  Oregon. She lost her private insurance and her preferred doctor. When  she went to look for a new plan under ObamaCare, she found the plans  were too expensive, and she went without insurance for almost 2 years.  See, her story should not be lost in this debate either.                                time  1230    Then there is April. Last fall, she found out her insurer would not  be offering her plan this year. The most comparable plan available  would raise her monthly premium by $564 per month, bringing her total  monthly premium to $1,503.   You see, there is a whole other group of Americans out there who are  suffering these effects of ObamaCare. The American Health Care Act  represents a better way for patients like Indra and April all across  our country. Our plan will rescue and revitalize the market and lower  costs and increase flexibility for patients to choose. They will have  more choices for health care and keep a health insurance plan that  works for them and for their family.   This legislation creates the Patient and State Stability Fund. Now,  this is an innovative approach to give States the financing and  flexibility to repair the damage done to the insurance markets by  ObamaCare and meet the unique needs of their citizens. More  importantly, we provide an additional $15 billion, Mr. Speaker, to  States devoted for maternity coverage. We heard from people who said we  need to do more in this area: newborn care, mental health, and  substance disorders.   We are also taking action to strengthen Medicaid. We want to put  Medicaid on a sustainable path so it can better care for those it was  intended to serve, a path through this per capita program for States  that, frankly, was at one time embraced by Democrats, including  President Clinton.   The most vulnerable in our communities need this help. It represents  the most substantive reform to the Medicaid program since its creation  and will restore power to our States and local communities and  governments where they can make better decisions than a one-size-fits- all here in Washington. We want to give our States more control in how  they manage these people that they are closest to.   In closing, I want to thank our colleagues and the President of the  United States and the Vice President and Secretary Price. They have  worked day in and day out, tirelessly, without hesitation, to help get  to the best policy possible here and to work and listen to our  colleagues, as we have all done, to craft the best bill we can, given  the constraints under which we must operate.   The end result highlights the diverse ideas of our Conference that  come from the American people and the determination that we share to  save this market and make it work again.   Remember, we are talking about a narrow slice of the insurance  market, that driven by ObamaCare, that, last year, there were 225  counties in America where, if you were looking for insurance on that  exchange, you had one option. This year, it is 1,022 counties. That is  one out of every three in America. And that was before Humana pulled  out and other companies said this market is about gone.   We need to fix this market. That is what this legislation seeks to  do.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our terrific staff that has worked day  and night to get us to this point. We know there is a lot more work to  do. This should not be taken in isolation as the only healthcare reform  on our list. We are going to go after the cost drivers. We are going to  go after prescription costs. We are going to go after hospital costs.   Wherever it is in the health system, if you have nothing to hide, you  won't have to fear our investigations. But we are going to get costs  down. We are going to get costs down.   The American Health Care Act is just the first step in our mission to  rescue the American people from the failures of the underlying law. We  know they are there. We are going to fix this. We are committed to it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds.   The irony of that argument is it was just a year or so ago that every  Member of this House who was here at the time and the Senate, by a  unanimous vote, agreed to waive the essential benefits he just listed  off for the employment market between 51 and 100--and, by the way,  those essential benefits don't apply to the large group market--so this  has already been done.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), the  vice chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds before I yield to  the gentleman from Michigan.   I would just suggest that the American people are very smart.  Unfortunately, under ObamaCare, 19.2 million Americans said: I am not  going to buy ObamaCare. I am going to pay a penalty to the IRS instead.   You see, we are trying to fix it so they will want to buy it.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Harper), the chairman of the House Administration  Committee, and a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the former head of the Medicaid task force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Flores), a real leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Collins), a real leader on our committee.   Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day, make  no mistake about it. The American Health Care Act changes the  trajectory of health policy in this country. Here are just a few of the  highlights:   This bill eliminates the individual mandate penalty; eliminates the  employer mandate penalty; eliminates the ObamaCare subsidies in 2020;  eliminates ObamaCare tax increases; eliminates insurance mandates so we  can lower premiums; provides refundable tax credits for individuals and  families who do not get their health insurance through their employer  or the government, and allows them to choose the health care that works  for them; almost doubles the contribution limits  [[Page H2420]]  for health savings accounts; provides $115 billion for the Patient and  State Stability Fund to lower patient cost and stabilize the insurance  market; and enacts the most significant reforms to Medicaid in history,  ensuring that Medicaid is sustainable and available for the most  vulnerable among us for generations to come.   The American Health Care Act is a monumental step toward freedom,  choice, and individual responsibility in health care.   Mr. Speaker, I will proudly vote for this bill today, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), our resident pharmacist on the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to work with the  gentlewoman from North Carolina.   Health care sharing ministries are a vital part of our healthcare  system. They are a shining example of how communities can come together  without government mandates or dictates to provide innovative  healthcare solutions.   I look forward to working with Chairwoman Foxx on these concerns that  have been raised and will work with the Senate to get repeal and  replacement of ObamaCare to the President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy), our resident psychologist who does a  remarkable job on mental health care issues and all of these healthcare  issues.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if I could get an indication in terms of the  amount we are down on each side here? I think we were allocated a half  an hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman referring to the time in  which he is acting as the designee of the gentlewoman from Tennessee on  behalf of the Committee on Energy and Commerce?    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes  remaining in the Energy and Commerce portion of this debate.    Mr. Speaker, and the minority side? Or is that what is  remaining split equal?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.   The gentleman from Kentucky has not assigned designees on the basis  of committee affiliation. The rule provides for four total hours of  debate.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have any other speakers,  so I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   One of the great tragedies of this debate is some of the scare  tactics we have heard. And to listen to the gentleman from California  talk about how removing essential benefits from the Federal mandate  from the law is going to cause all that to happen is tragic because he,  on March 25 of 2015, cosponsored legislation that did precisely that,  removed the same Federal mandates for workers in the 51-100 pool of  employees for employers. He said it was too much of a mandate then on  those businesses, when they provide insurance.   So every Member of the House who was here then, and every Senator,  including the Democrat leader of the Senate at the time, voted for  that, passed unanimously.   By the way, the Congressional Budget Office said that those  regulations that we are pulling back here would have made nongroup  premiums 27 percent to 30 percent higher in 2016, than they otherwise  would have been. So we are basically taking what CBO said is a good  policy and implementing it here once again.   Last time, in 2015, that was bipartisan. It was a voice vote. Today,  you would think the world was falling around us, the sky was falling.  Yet, everybody who was here in 2015 said, that is okay, it is the right  thing to do because it will lower premiums, like CBO said, by 27 to 30  percent.   So we thought what was good for those in the work world, for  everybody who is insured through a large group plan, which is about 155  million Americans--they don't live under this mandate, yet they have  all those services and benefits--that that would make sense to lower  premiums for individuals on the ObamaCare exchange, because what I hear  is, premiums are too high, deductibles go up.   Nobody sees this thing coming down. We are making changes here  because those exchanges are collapsing. We want to bring the premiums  down. We want to make the changes that will bring them down. CBO says  doing this on essential benefits would have resulted in nongroup  premiums 27 to 30 percent lower than they would have otherwise been.  They basically say they would be higher in 2016 than they would have  otherwise been. So we are taking that, using that and saying: let's  drive them down; let's get premiums down.   It is unfortunate that you were willing to do that 2 years ago. It  was bipartisan. Today, it is some extraordinary thing we are doing that  is bad. It is not. We want to get lower premiums.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Actually, we did reach out to Democrats. We have always reached out  to Democrats. The vice chair of the Committee held lunches with  Democrats to say: How can we work together on this? And we were told:  No, we can't work with you on this particular measure. I hope we can. I  agree, there is a lot we need to do together. It is what the American  people expect.   We have had these individual conversations out of the bright lights  of the cameras. Let's get together. Let's get this done. A lot hangs in  the balance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, here is what I would say: What you have heard from the  other side is everything is working perfectly; leave it alone.   Democrats created ObamaCare. Democrats created the exchange. They  said: We are going to tell you the kind of insurance you have to buy;  we are going to force you to buy it, or you will answer to the IRS and  pay a penalty. They mandated that.   Then they came back and said: Well, that didn't work so well, so we  had better get rid of the essential benefits for the workers and  employers, 51-100 employees in a company; we are going to take that off  because that will drive up premiums. And they voted unanimously to do  that. Today, they come back and say: Oh, that would be horrible. But  they did it before, so they were for it before they were against it.   But let me talk about what really matters here. First of all, there  is lot of scare tactics out there by a lot of high-paid organizations.  The first is, we preserve your right as a citizen to acquire health  insurance regardless of your health condition.                                time  1345    So here is the deal: preexisting conditions, we protect that;  lifetime caps, we protect that so that insurance companies can't go  over the top of you; keep your kids on until they are 26, we protect  that. Those were good things. We agree in a bipartisan way those should  be protected. We do that.   But we also recognize that 19.2 million Americans looked at the  Democrats' healthcare exchanges and plans, went the other direction,  and said no. They have walked with their wallets and their feet and  said: I don't like what you are selling and I can't afford what you are  selling. I will even pay the IRS $600 or $700 not to take ObamaCare.   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, the insurers have said that the way the  Democrats created the insurance markets all over the country, we can  stay in them. We are losing too much money, and we are out.   That is why in one out of three counties today in America you only  have one choice, and that is called a monopoly. We are trying to fix  this market so people will have choices that are affordable. We are  trying to make sure people have access to coverage they want and can  afford. This is the first step, not the last step, toward fixing this  market.   I look at it like we have poured the foundation. Construction  projects are a little messy when you are just pouring the foundation.  Now we are going to put up the walls, we are going to put the roof on,  and we are going to build this out in multiple steps throughout this  year and next.   Meanwhile, we provide complete coverage. We do all the protections  ObamaCare continues in its support for people while we fix the market  and allow it to come back. We have timed this out. I know there are  some on my side of the aisle who wanted to get rid of those  protections, and we brought them around or they are going to vote  ``no.'' But we said: No; we have to have those protections in place-- existing conditions, no more lifetime caps, keeping your kids on until  they are 26.   We have a product here that needs to go to the next step. We will all  work on it and continue to make it better as we go forward. But if we  do nothing and let it fail today, these markets are going to get worse  and worse under the Democrats' ObamaCare plans, and people won't have a  choice in States and counties all over America.   I wish we could join together today and put forward a bipartisan vote  to save these markets and help our constituents going forward. Mr.  Speaker, we owe it to them. They have asked for it for 7 years. Let's  get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
