 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor a  great West Texan, United States Air Force Colonel Exa Fay Hooten, of  Abilene, Texas. She passed away on January 16 at the age of 92. She was  born on August 27, 1928, in Floydada, Texas, to Maude Latham and  Richard W. Hooten.   After graduating high school, she attended Texas Tech University,  where she received a bachelor's degree and then later received her  Ph.D. from Texas Women's University.   Exa Fay believed travel was second in importance only to a college  education. She joined the Air Force and traveled the world working in  military hospitals, taking care of our wounded warriors. After Active  Duty, she entered the Reserves and was the first U.S. Air Force Reserve  dietician to obtain the rank of full colonel.   I thank Colonel Hooten for her service and patriotism. I thank her  for showing us that, like the West Texas horizon, the possibilities of  life are limitless when you pursue your passion and put others first.   God bless, and go West Texas.                            ____________________
