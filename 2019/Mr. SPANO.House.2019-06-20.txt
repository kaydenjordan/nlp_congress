 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to thank Ranking Member  Aderholt and Chairman Serrano for working together on the bipartisan en  bloc package that passed the House yesterday. That package included my  amendment to increase funding for the International Trade  Administration by $2 million to provide additional funding for  enforcement and compliance activities.   Unfair trade practices directly harm our domestic manufacturing and  agricultural sectors. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports  that there are nearly 55,000 unpaid antidumping and countervailing duty  bills covering fiscal years 2011 through 2016, totaling $2.8 billion in  uncollected duties. This is a critical issue for my district.   Americans who eat U.S.-grown strawberries in the colder winter months  are probably eating a strawberry grown and harvested by the hardworking  farmers in Plant City, Florida. We are proud of our role in providing  Americans access to U.S.-grown produce year-round.   However, the strawberry growers in my district are under attack. They  are under attack from illegal ``dumping'' practices, and this must be  stopped. The additional funding provided by my amendment is a step in  the right direction to combat unfair trade practices so that U.S.  producers can compete.   Again, I want to express my gratitude to Ranking Member Aderholt and  Chairman Serrano for including this amendment in the en bloc package  that passed the House yesterday.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment  in the missed opportunity this House had this week to protect  individuals with preexisting conditions.   Since the Democrats took the majority in January, they have stoked  fear with the American public that the administration will remove these  protections; however, maintaining the current coverage requirements for  those with preexisting conditions is an issue that Republicans and  Democrats in this body agree on. That is why I cosponsored Congressman  Rodney Davis' amendment to H.R. 2740 that would have prohibited any  funds at the Department of Health and Human Services from being used to  weaken the existing safeguards.   However, every single Democrat on the Rules Committee voted to  prevent this amendment from even being debated by the full House.  Instead, they would rather continue to politicize the issue and stoke  fear that these critical protections are in imminent danger of being  taken away.   I urge this body to stop sowing discord on issues we agree on and to  work towards bipartisan solutions that benefit the people we serve.                            ____________________
