 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the ranking member  on our side for offering me time to explain my amendment. I commend my  friend from Iowa for her work in this legislation.   Let me make a couple of comments initially about the bill, generally.  First of all, I don't think this bill is going to be a disincentive, as  she described it, to companies who are recruiting to another State or  considering moving to another country, potentially, for supply chain  reasons, because, look, they are doing what they think is in the best,  long-run interest of building their product.   And, don't forget, our States recruit our companies, countries  recruit our companies. We look at supply chains. These are frequently  very public matters about Governors bragging how many employees they  have from each State and each company.   And the WARN Act, which is already on the statute books, certainly  takes care of this issue of notice on layoffs and disclosure of  employees.   In my own State recently we had Kimberly-Clark, a publicly traded  company, decide to move jobs to Wisconsin. Those jobs were well known  in my district and in Mr. Gallagher's district in Wisconsin. There was  nothing secret about it. It is just part of business realigning inside  our beautiful, largest economy in the world.   And I do have concerns about this disclosure internationally that my  friend is requiring, because what if you are proposing to enter a  country and you want to keep that private, for competition purposes,  from international competition or from your competitors in the United  States? You are now forced, as a public company, to disclose, oh, I  have one employee in a country.   I find that concerning. You may even put that employee at a safety  risk, depending on what country is a target for Americans.   So, in my view, that brings up the topic of overall burden, and we  know of the old expression ``the straw that broke the camel's back.''   And regulatory burdens are cumulative. Any one burden doesn't seem  large, but, when piled up on all the other burdens, you see it in  total.   I was talking to a chief accounting officer the other day of a $2  billion market cap company. She spends $250,000 a year, for example, to  comply with the conflict mineral rule. If you have a 10-time multiple  on that, that is a lot of money annualized impacting their business to  try to comply with something they say is not physically possible to  comply with.   So, I look at this as an additional burden. I urge that it not be  adopted.   And my amendment does something simple. It just simply says, if this  employment disclosure, domestically or internationally, is material to  the business, in keeping with the tradition of the securities laws,  then okay. So, if it is a material statement to describe where these  employees are located to the business, then that might be something  useful.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                time  1015     Mr. Chair, how much time do I have?    Mr. Chair, my friend from California, I think,  is making the case that this bill is confusing and a burden because we  don't even know internationally if these are American jobs that were  moved or not.   You are just counting the people in foreign countries. I don't know  that that is really relevant. And it weakens your argument, in my view,  as well, that we are disclosing in the States, as my friend, the  ranking member, made so eloquently. So I think it is a burden.   It is not about shipping jobs. We have the WARN Act, which directly  deals with jobs that are shipped overseas, or moved, and makes sure  that people are retrained and compensated in the right way.   Instead, this is another burden on our public companies, our public  companies. We want more public companies.   I just formed the Entrepreneur Caucus with my friends Mr. Foster, Mr.  Veasey, Stephanie Murphy, and   Steve Chabot. We have asked GAO why we  are not having more public companies at smaller sizes.   I submit to you, my friends from California and Iowa, it is because  we have raised the cost of being public too high. This is another  burden, and I think we should think long and hard before we add  burdens.   Materiality is the way to bring balance back.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't, but I have time that I  will use, so I will use that time to close.    Mr. Chair, let me close by simply saying that  we want more public companies. We want to lower the cost of being  public. We want to remove barriers from being public. We do that by  carefully balancing the regulatory burden to be public.   This bill, which does not enhance any knowledge for investors or do  anything important or material, weakens that effort to reduce barriers  to being public.   I believe we should have a materiality standard. I urge adoption of  my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
