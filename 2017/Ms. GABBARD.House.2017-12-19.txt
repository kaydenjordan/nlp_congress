 Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the American people  need and want real tax reform, but rather than passing a strong,  inclusive bipartisan bill focused on helping hardworking middle class  families, today Republicans passed a bill filled with massive corporate  giveaways and loopholes for the ultrawealthy.   For example, the top 1 percent in our country will receive over 82  percent of the entire tax benefit in the bill they passed today.   As long as Congress continues to pass legislation for partisan  political reasons that seriously serve special corporate interests  instead of the families that are struggling just to get by every day,  where lobbyists have more input in the writing of this legislation than  many Members of Congress, the American people lose.  [[Page H10233]]    Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation today. It is a disappointment  and a huge lost opportunity to actually help so many struggling  families all across the country.                            ____________________
