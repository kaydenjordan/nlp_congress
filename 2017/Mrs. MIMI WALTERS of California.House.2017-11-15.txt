 Madam Speaker, I rise to engage the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) in a colloquy.   Madam Speaker, tax reform will result in economic growth across the  country, especially in my home State of California. I thank the  gentleman for his dedication to this important effort.   Madam Speaker, my home State is uniquely positioned in this tax  debate. Due to the liberal tax-and-spend policies enacted by the  California State Legislature, my district in Orange County is one of  the most expensive places to live in this country. California has the  highest personal income tax rate in the country, reaching a crushing  12.3 percent. The median home price in my district is almost $800,000.  California also has the highest gas tax in the country.   While this bill makes important reforms that will grow our economy, I  have serious concerns that some of my constituents may be worse off. As  Sacramento continues to confiscate more and more of California's hard- earned paychecks, we must ensure that Washington does not put similar  tax burdens on our constituents.   I ask the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to assure me that  we will ensure that individuals and families in my district are  protected from such unintended outcomes.    I yield to the gentleman from  California.                                time  1900     I yield to the gentleman.
