 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  commitment to regulatory relief. We wouldn't be here today if it wasn't  for his diligence and for the hard work of all of the great folks of  the Financial Services Committee, on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the financial crisis the American people  needed regulatory relief that would lift the economy. Instead, Congress  responded with a framework that increased the cost of financial  products, restricted access to loans, and redistributed credit from the  middle-income borrowers to the high-income borrowers. Today, too many  consumers are left struggling to get the tools they need to achieve  financial independence.   S. 2155 is a big step in the right direction. The majority of the  provisions included in the bill come from bipartisan House-passed  measures, several of which wer included in my CLEARR Act. Despite what  rhetoric we might hear today, American borrowers are going to benefit  from the relief that extends from this bill.    However, the conversation cannot end with S. 2155. While the  provisions in this legislation are granting important relief, there is  so much more to be done. The Financial Services Committee has marked up  more than 100 bills this Congress, many of which have the support of  the ranking member and deserve to be considered by our colleagues in  the Senate.   We have to continue to rightsize regulation so that it is based not  just on size or a single arbitrary factor, but on thoughtful analysis  of an institution's business model and risk profile. Mr. Speaker,  arbitrary figures don't necessarily guarantee a financial system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the chairman for his diligent work on  this fine bill, and ask my colleagues to support S. 2155.
