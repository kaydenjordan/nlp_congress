 Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mr.  Patrick Newbold for his exemplary dedication to duty and service as an  Army Congressional Fellow and Congressional Budget Liaison for the  Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller.  Mr. Newbold is transitioning from his present assignment to continue  his selfless service with the U.S. Corps of Engineers.   A native of Florida, Mr. Newbold joined the Department of Army in  2004 as an Army Materiel Command Fellow upon graduation from Bethune- Cookman University with a bachelor's degree in computer information  systems. He also holds a masters of business administration from Texas  A&M-Texarkana and a master's of professional studies in legislative  affairs from the George Washington University.   Mr. Newbold has served in a broad range of assignments during his 15- year Army career. His assignments took him to the most strategic  locations responsible for modernizing, equipping, and empowering our  Army soldiers to fight and win wars; Red River Army Depot, Texarkana,  TX; Redstone Arsenal, AL; the Pentagon; and the headquarters of the  United States Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC. He has held many  positions, thriving in supervisory positions hallmarked by his servant  leadership.   In 2018, I had the privilege of working with Mr. Newbold in my  capacity as the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies. Mr. Newbold worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and  their staffs to articulate the Army's budget positions to the  appropriations committees. His professionalism, diligence and  commitment to the mission are unmatched, and his work both as a fellow  for Congressman Sanford Bishop and as a budget liaison effectively  represented the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense to the U.S.  Congress.   Throughout his career, Mr. Newbold has made positive impacts on the  lives of soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our country has benefited  tremendously from his extraordinary leadership, judgment, and passion.  I join my colleagues today in honoring his dedication to our Nation and  invaluable service to the U.S. Congress as an Army Congressional  Liaison.   It was a genuine pleasure to have worked with Mr. Patrick Newbold  over the last year. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my  colleagues today in recognizing and commending Patrick for his service  to our country, and we wish him all the best as he continues his  service in the U.S. Army.                            ____________________
