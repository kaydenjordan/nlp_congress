 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 535.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019, is a  comprehensive package of strategies to regulate PFAS chemicals, clean  up contamination, and protect public health.   PFAS are an urgent threat to public health. They are toxic,  persistent, and being found in the environment across  [[Page H117]]  the country. These ``forever chemicals'' have long been linked with  adverse health effects, including cancer, immune system effects,  infertility, impaired child development, high cholesterol, and thyroid  disease.   Mr. Chairman, the EPA has known about these risks for decades and has  allowed this contamination to spread.   Last year, EPA announced its PFAS Action Plan. It was woefully  inadequate, and since that time, we have learned that EPA is not even  keeping the weak commitments it made in that plan. The EPA failed to  meet key end-of-the-year 2019 deadlines. It failed to produce a  regulatory determination for drinking water. It failed to produce  hazard determinations for chemicals under Superfund. It failed to  initiate reporting under the Toxics Release Inventory.   The Trump administration is failing hundreds of impacted communities,  and Congress must act for communities like Hoosick Falls, New York;  Parchment, Michigan; Parkersburg, West Virginia; and far too many more.   We need to act on behalf of States like my own State of New Jersey  that are doing everything they can--adopting protective State drinking  water standards and pursuing natural resource damage cases--but facing  strong opposition from Federal agencies under the Trump administration.   There have been over 500 detections of PFAS in drinking water and  groundwater sources in New Jersey, and this is simply unacceptable, Mr.  Chairman.   It is time for Congress to take action and use every tool available  to stop the flow of PFAS pollution into our environment and our bodies.  That is exactly what the PFAS Action Act does.   This bill requires EPA to immediately designate two PFAS chemicals as  hazardous substances under Superfund, the two most studied of the PFAS  chemicals. EPA committed to make this designation in their action plan  last year but has failed to fulfill that promise.   The legislation requires that, over a 5-year period, EPA reviews all  other PFAS chemicals and decide whether to list them under Superfund.  During that 5 years, the bill will require comprehensive health testing  of all PFAS chemicals.   This is a really important point. You may hear my colleagues talk  today about the need to base decisions on science, and this bill will  generate that science. The two chemicals will be regulated upfront  because we already have the science on them. Other PFAS will be  regulated if, over the next 5 years, the science concludes that they  are hazardous.   The bill also includes a moratorium on any new PFAS during that same  5-year period. This will provide EPA the time it needs to ensure it has  enough science to really evaluate new PFAS.   H.R. 535 also requires a drinking water standard that will cover at  least the two chemicals and others at EPA's discretion. Importantly,  the drinking water standard will have to protect public health,  including the health of vulnerable populations such as pregnant women,  infants, and children. Because treating drinking water to remove PFAS  is expensive, the bill includes grants for water utilities.   Mr. Chairman, this bill includes a voluntary PFAS-free label for  cookware, which may be expanded through amendments to include  additional categories of consumer products. This label will empower  consumers to take steps to protect themselves from exposure to PFAS.   The bill requires guidance for first responders, to help them  minimize their exposure to PFAS chemicals. This is important because  PFAS is commonly found in firefighting foams.   Taken together, this is a serious, comprehensive, and reasonable bill  that should garner strong bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   I thank Chairman Tonko for all that he did to put this package  together and, of course, the sponsor of the package, Mrs. Dingell from  Michigan, who has faced so many problems in your home State, Mr.  Chairman, where Mrs. Dingell is also very involved.   The bill includes a number of pieces of legislation before our  committee by members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as  other Members of this body.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 6, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I write concerning H.R. 535, the       PFAS Action Act of 2019. There are certain provisions in this       legislation that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 535, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on the bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this Committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 535 on the       House floor.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 535, the PFAS       Action Act of 2019, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I agree       that your Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so       that we may address any remaining issues within your       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees from your Committee to       any House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will place our letters on H.R. 535 into the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader, and I want to thank him for  prioritizing this PFAS package and making it one of the first things  that we do in 2020.
