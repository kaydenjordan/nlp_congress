 So let's have trial by combat.    ``Trial by combat.'' Donald Trump praised Rudy, said he did a good  job, had guts for telling the crowd that we need trial by combat.   Next, more attacks.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. All Vice President Pence has to do is send       it back to the States to recertify, and we become President       and you are the happiest people.    This attack, like the tweets he sent that morning, had a purpose:  convincing his supporters that the future of our country, of our  democracy, hinged on whether Vice President Pence would overturn the  election--something he knew Pence could not and would not do.   He called out Vice President Pence nine times that day, and each  time, he got more forceful. Here is what he said at 12:15.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. And we're going to have to fight much       harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for       us. And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our       country, because you are sworn to uphold our Constitution.        Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault       on our democracy. And after this, we are going to walk down--      and I'll be there with you. We are going to walk down. We are       going to walk down any one you want, but I think right here,       we are going to walk down to the Capitol.        (Cheers and applause.)        And we are going to cheer on our brave Senators and       Congressmen and women, and we are probably not going to be       cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take       back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and       you have to be strong.    ``We're going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence will have  to come through for us.'' That is what he said, and he told the crowd  what he meant and exactly what to do, literally commanding them to  confront us at the Capitol. He even told them he would walk there with  them, which, of course, was not true, and then he told them exactly  what to do when they got to the Capitol.         You'll never take [your] country back with weakness. You       have to show strength.    And don't forget who is standing there, the same people Ms. Plaskett  described to you, many people violent--violent people law enforcement  had warned would be armed and would be targeting us.   One of President Trump's key defenses focused on what he said for a  few seconds, 15 minutes into the speech.   (Text of videotape presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. I know that everyone here will soon be       marching over to the Capitol building, to peacefully and       patriotically make your voices heard.    In a speech spanning almost 11,000 words--yes, we did check--that was  the one time, the only time President Trump used the word ``peaceful''  or any suggestion of nonviolence. The implication of the President's  tweets, the rally, and the speeches were clear. President Trump used  the word ``fight'' or ``fighting'' 20 times, including telling the  crowd they needed to ``fight like hell'' to save our democracy.   We know how the crowd responded to Donald Trump's words, and he knew  how they responded to his speech. Here is the evidence of how the crowd  reacted.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         (People cheering.)        President TRUMP. We are going down to the Capitol--        (People cheering.)        President TRUMP. . . . weakness, you have to show       strength--        Unidentified Speaker. Yes. Right.        (People chanting: ``Take the Capitol.'')        (People chanting: ``Taking the Capitol right now.'')        (People chanting: ``Invade the Capitol.'')        (People chanting: ``Storm the Capitol.'')        President TRUMP. Make your voices heard.    ``Storm the Capitol.'' ``Invade the Capitol.'' ``Fight, fight,  fight.'' ``Take the Capitol right now.'' These were the words of the  crowd. Trump was telling them to fight, and he would keep telling them  to fight throughout the rest of his speech. These are not only words of  aggression, they are words of insurrection, and if you have any doubt,  listen to what he says next.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. Today we see a very important event       though, because right over there, right there, we see the       events that will take place. And I am going to be watching,       because history is going to be made. We are going to see       whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or       whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of  themselves throughout history. Throughout eternity they will be  ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never  ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.    The Commander in Chief points to Congress and tells those assembled:  ``I am going to be watching . . . history is going to be made.'' This  was clearly not just some rally or march or protest; this was about  Donald Trump trying to steal the election for himself, claiming that  the election was fraudulent, illegitimate, so that his supporters would  fight to take it back. In fact, after stoking the crowd's anger for  nearly 40 minutes, after repeating false election conspiracy after  false election conspiracy, he said this in no uncertain terms.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. You will have an illegitimate President,       that is what you'll have.    Any outcome besides him keeping the Presidency would be illegitimate.  This was building on the big lie of a rigged and stolen election.   And here is what he said a little later in his speech.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. When you catch somebody in a fraud, you       are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has       the courage to do what he has to do.    ``When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very  different rules.''   We told you that context matters. Here is the context: This was not  just one reference or a message to supporters by a politician to fight  for a cause. He had assembled thousands of violent people, people he  knew were capable of violence, people he had seen be violent. They were  standing now in front of him. And then he pointed to us, lit the fuse,  and sent an angry mob to fight the perceived enemy--his own Vice  President and the Members of Congress as we certified an election.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. But I said something's wrong here.       Something's really wrong. Can't have happened. And we fight.       We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're       not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures       and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow       Americans, for our world, for our children, and for our       beloved country--and I say this despite all that's happened--      the best is yet to come.        (Cheers and Applause.)        So we're going to--we're going to walk down Pennsylvania       Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the       Capitol, and we are going to try and give--the Democrats are       hopeless. They never voted for anything--not even one vote.       But we are going to try and give our Republicans--the weak       ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We       are going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness       that they need to take back our country. So let's walk down       Pennsylvania Avenue.        (Cheers and Applause.)        President TRUMP. I want to thank you all. God bless you and       God bless America.        Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you       very much.        (Cheers and Applause.)        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')    ``If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country  anymore.'' And there was only one fight left, and it was a mile up the  road. Donald  [[Page S633]]  Trump, the President of the United States, ordered the crowd to march  on Congress, and so the crowd marched. ``This is incredible,'' we heard  him say. That is how President Trump ended his speech.   I would like to close with a very brief timeline of what was  happening in parallel alongside the President as he spoke on the 6th of  January. A little after noon, President Trump began his speech with a  fiery refusal to concede. He commanded the crowd to fight and march  down Pennsylvania Avenue, and around 12:20, some rally goers, some  attendees, began marching.   By 12:30, as President Trump continued to incite his supporters,  large segments of the rally crowd had amassed at the Capitol.   At 12:53, as the President's speech was playing on cell phone  broadcasts, the outermost barricades of the northwest side of the  Capitol were breached, and Capitol Police were forced back to the steps  of the Capitol.   At 1:10, the President ended his speech with a final call to fight  and a final order to march to the Capitol.   At 1:45, the President's followers surged past Capitol Police,  shouting: ``This is a revolution.''   Just after 2:10, an hour after President Trump ended his speech, the  insurrectionist mob overwhelmed Capitol security and made it inside the  Halls of Congress, because the truth is, this attack never would have  happened but for Donald Trump. And so they came, draped in Trump's flag  and used our flag, the American flag, to batter and to bludgeon.   And at 2:30, I heard that terrifying banging on the House Chamber  doors. For the first time in more than 200 years, the seat of our  government was ransacked on our watch.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, I think this would be a good time  for a break.                                    Recess
