 Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  for the time.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1112. This  legislation is an attack on the constitutional rights of  [[Page H2280]]  Americans. This bill puts incredible roadblocks in the way of law- abiding citizens seeking to exercise their Second Amendment rights that  are guaranteed to them in the Constitution.   We should be focused on enforcing the current laws that we have on  the books instead of passing Federal mandates that stifle freedom. This  bill creates a bureaucratic maze that will allow the Federal Government  to sit on its hands and force citizens to submit formal petitions to  the Attorney General when they are trying to legally purchase a  firearm, to ask permission to exercise their constitutional right.   What other constitutional right would you suggest we put this level  of restriction on? The freedom of the press? The freedom of religion?  Should we start having the Federal Government review every media  outlet's story for 10 days before they can be published? before a  church can meet for worship? I don't think so.   It is my hope that we will soon move forward with solutions,  solutions that will actually make a difference for hardworking  Americans across this great country.   When I was sworn in as a Member of the House earlier this year, I saw  great potential for Congress to come together and advance solutions to  our Nation's greatest problems. Instead, I find myself standing here on  the floor of this Chamber fighting for the basic liberties that our  Founding Fathers sought to guarantee for every American.   Madam Chair, I will continue to stand and continue to fight each and  every day, and I urge the House to reject this misguided legislation.
