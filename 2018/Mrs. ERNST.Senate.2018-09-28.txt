 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 49, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
