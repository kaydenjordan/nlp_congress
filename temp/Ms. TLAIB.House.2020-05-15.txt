 Mr. Speaker, access to clean water and to affordable water  is essential to saving lives and stopping the spread of COVID-19. No  one deserves, Mr. Speaker, to die because they are too poor to afford  water.   In my district alone, thousands of low-income households began this  pandemic with their water shut off. Just think about it. You are being  told to wash your hands 10 times a day but you can't have access. In  the richest country in the world, 15 million people cannot wash their  hands during this pandemic.   I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.
