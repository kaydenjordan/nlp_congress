 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I rise  today on the eve of the March for Life as a cancer survivor, as someone  who appreciates every day that we are given from the good Lord above as  a gift.   I want to recount a story from a couple of years ago that my wife and  I shared in ``National Review Online''. What do you do when the doctor  coldly asks whether you would like to terminate your child? Two years  ago this month, this became very real to my wife and I and we wrote  about it in the article in ``National Review''.   We received a call from one of our dearest friends. She was pregnant.  She asked me if I would be the baby's godfather, but her words of joy  were tempered. She then went on to explain a series of harrowing  medical concerns, the most significant of which was that the baby might  be missing a part of his brain, a part that connects the left and right  hemispheres.   She was terrified and she couldn't ask questions quickly enough.  Forty-eight excruciating hours later, the MRI was performed and it was  inconclusive. She was told to come back again in 2 weeks for another  ultrasound.   The next week, her obstetrician, a woman doctor, silently reviewed  the file. Then she looked at our friend straight in the eye and asked  her if she wanted to terminate the pregnancy.   Now, my friend explained that the doctor had asked her the question  in the same tone that she might have used when she ordered a coffee at  Starbucks. She didn't blink an eye. She asked the question in front of  her two little boys. She asked without her husband there. She offered  no explanation or comfort. It was cold.   The doctor told her she had to decide quickly because she was  approaching the 22-week limit, which is as long as you can legally seek  an abortion in Virginia.   Our friend's response was a source of pride for us. She told us she  almost laughed and then politely responded that termination was not an  option. She walked out of that doctor's office and never returned.   In a world where everything and everyone seems to be so sensitive  about every word that is uttered, we have completely desensitized  abortion. We use politically correct words. One is pro-choice. The  pregnancy is terminated because no one wants to say that the baby was  killed. But if you are ending an innocent life on purpose, I am not  sure what other way to put it.   So how did it all turn out? Her ultrasound was completely normal at  24 weeks. Her baby was born. He is my godson. He is healthy. He came  here and he saw his godfather get sworn into Congress.   Choose life. Life is not perfect. But each life is perfect.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this op-ed in its entirety,  which was published on January 26, 2017, in ``National Review Online'',  coauthored by my wife, Carrah.                 [From the National Review, Jan. 26, 2017]                 A Mother's Love and the March That Matters                         (By Chip Roy & Carrah Roy)         What do you do when the doctor coldly asks whether you'd       like to `terminate' your child?        For many people, January 2017 will be marked by the       inauguration of a president and a march on Washington the       following day. For us, every January is marked by two phone       calls we received in January 2015--and by a very different       march.        The ``Women's March on Washington'' has already been all-      consuming on social media. It was billed as an ``inclusive''       movement with the vision:        We stand together in solidarity with our partners and       children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our       health, and our families--recognizing that our vibrant and       diverse communities are the strength of our country.        Sounds so caring--until you learn that ``inclusive'' and       ``diverse'' mean that if you are pro-life, you are not       welcome, and if you don't attend or join in this supposed       solidarity, you are ``anti-woman.'' Doesn't seem as       inclusive, does it?        In deed, it is wholly exclusive. In their zeal to shock and       to trumpet a convoluted notion of freedom to have their       bodies ``left alone,'' these marchers exclude the bodies of       the unborn. What about the rights of an unborn child? What       about the safety of an unborn child? What about the health of       an unborn child?        Two years ago this month, this became very real to us.        We received a call from one of our dearest friends. Then 32       and already mother to two healthy, wonderful boys, our friend       said, with an air of urgency, ``[My husband] and I wanted to       wait a little longer to ask, but something's come up and we       have to ask now. I am pregnant--and we want you to be the       baby's godfather.'' We were thrilled, but the excitement was       tempered by the strange introduction. Here's what she       explained to me.        She and her husband, having two boys already, couldn't wait       to find out whether they would add another boy to the crew or       instead start buying things that were pink. They excitedly       drove to the appointment for the baby's 20-week ultrasound to       find out. A few minutes into the sonogram, the ultrasound       tech excused herself from the room. Immediately, their hearts       sank. Something was .wrong. It was a long wait. Finally, the       radiologist came back into the room and moved the wand around       with a blank look on her face. Then, she told our friend to       get dressed and come into her office. She explained that the       baby might be missing a part of his brain, the part that       connects the left and right hemispheres.        She was terrified but couldn't ask questions fast enough.       Would the baby survive the pregnancy? Live outside the womb?       Were these minor developmental delays or major issues? She       and her husband were sent home without answers and told to       come back so they could perform an MRI of the baby's brain.       The technician thought that the baby might be lying in a       position that didn't allow the doctor to get a good view and       that the MRI could clear it up.        Forty-eight excruciating hours later, the MRI was       performed. It was inconclusive.        They did learn that the condition could range from minor       developmental delays to severe cognitive and life-threatening       issues, but they wouldn't know the specifics for their child       until the baby was born. They were told to come back again in       two weeks for another ultrasound.        None of us stopped praying those two weeks. For our friend       it was a constant conversation with God. She was scared, but       she said that she knew it would be okay. She knew the baby       would be okay. She ``just knew.'' She felt scared of the       unknown but also at peace, saying, ``God gave me this baby       for a reason.'' If the baby needed help, she would do       everything she could and God ``would help'' them. And she       would love that baby just like she loves her two boys.        She had a monthly check up with her ob-gyn the following       week. Her husband had to work, but she took their two boys       with her. They liked going to hear the baby's heartbeat and       the checkups were usually routine and quick. She went in to       the appointment expecting that her doctor would reassure her       and answer more questions than the radiologist had. The       doctor--a woman--silently reviewed the file. Then the doctor       looked our friend straight in the eye and asked her if she       wanted to terminate the pregnancy.        She called us right after that appointment, understandably       angry and terrified. Terminate? What?        She explained that the doctor had asked her the question in       the same tone she might have used when ordering coffee at       Starbucks. She didn't blink an eye. She asked it in front of       her two little boys. She asked without her husband there. She       offered no explanation or comfort. It was cold. The doctor       told her she had to decide quickly because she was       approaching 22 weeks (which is as long as you can legally       wait to have an abortion in Virginia).        Our friend's response was such a source of pride for us.       She told us ``she almost laughed and then politely responded       that `termination' was not an option.'' She walked out of       that doctor's office and never returned.        Yes, there may be some issues. She didn't have a perfect       ultrasound. But it was her  [[Page H710]]       baby who, she told us, ``was growing inside of her, kicking,       loving music, moving when the boys spoke toward her belly,       doing somersaults when she ate ice cream.''        We all realized that God put our friend in this position       for a reason. She has a strong faith. She knew she could       handle it, because God was with her. She told us that the       baby ``would know love, would feel love.'' Facing her fear of       the unknown with faith and love strengthened her as a mother       and a woman. But what if it hadn't been our friend? What if       another woman had listened to that doctor, who made it feel       so easy and acceptable to just ``terminate'' and try again       for a ``better'' outcome.        We use politically correct words . . . The pregnancy is       ``terminated.'' Because no one wants to say that she killed       her baby.        In a world where everything and everyone seems to be so       sensitive, we have completely desensitized abortion. We use       politically correct words. One is ``pro-choice.'' The       pregnancy is ``terminated.'' Because no one wants to say that       she kilted her baby. But if you are ending an innocent life       on purpose, we're not sure what other way to put it.        But sadly, even today, more than 3,000 abortions are       performed every day in the United States. That is more than 1       million per year. Since Roe v. Wade inserted unelected judges       into the question of the beginning of life, more than 56       million babies have died at the hands of abortionists--56       million. Just let that sink in.        So how did it all turn out? Her ultrasound was completely       normal at 24 weeks. They just couldn't get a good read at her       20-week appointment. Her baby was born in May of 2015 and is       completely healthy. It was a boy, by the way. None of us--but       particularly his loving and courageous mother--can imagine       life without him.        This week, there will be another march on Washington: the       one that truly matters. This one is to celebrate life, and       all are welcome, including the unborn and those who love       them.        Choose Life. Life is not perfect, but each life is perfect.
