 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to the House's attention two  fine Texans who are sitting up in the House gallery, Ben and Dan  Matheson.   Ben has been on my Air Force advisory committee down in Texas for the  entire 32 years that I have been in Congress. He and the other two  members of that nominating committee have recommended to me over 100  young men and women whom we have nominated to the Air Force Academy and  who are now serving, defending our Nation.   His son is Dan Matheson, one of my best friends, a proud graduate of  the University of Texas Law School, former head of the Texas State Fed  office, and a successful practicing attorney in Austin, Texas.   I am very proud to have their friendship, and I am glad to bring to  the attention of the House these two fine Americans.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members not to refer to  persons in the gallery.                            ____________________
