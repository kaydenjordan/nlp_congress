 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. As Rhode Island's former secretary  of state, I know the importance of access to the ballot box.   That is why I was devastated when the Supreme Court gutted one of our  most momentous civil rights bills, opening the door to a litany of  voter suppression laws.   Our dearly departed John Lewis was bloodied on the bridge at Selma  while peacefully urging passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The  scars he carried were not in vain, as decades of progress have shown  us. But it is abundantly clear that we have not yet achieved equality  of access. There are forces at work in this country trying to undo what  we have so painstakingly earned.   That is why it is so important that we pass this bill to restore the  Voting Rights Act and ensure that every American, regardless of race,  can have his or her voice heard in our democracy.   Let's vote in favor of this bill and send a clear message that we  want to protect every vote in America.
