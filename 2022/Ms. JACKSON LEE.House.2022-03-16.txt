 Madam Speaker, I rise today to indicate that finally  we have passed and signed into law the Violence Against Women Act.   After years of introducing it and passing it in the United States  House of Representatives, we came together, and today at the White  House, relief has been given to the millions of victims of domestic  violence, rape, and sexual assault.   We provided the opportunity for enhanced police efforts for trying to  stop the most dangerous calls of police officers: domestic violence;  dealing with cultural groups that respond to this in a different way;  and once and for all, stopping the dastardly act of raping Indian women  and escaping prosecution. Now we allow the courts on Indian  reservations to be able to bring people to justice.   We have provided a place for abused persons to live. We have given  more money to area shelters, like the Houston Area Women's Shelter, and  we responded to the advocates across America.   I am glad to have written and authored H.R. 1620. I thank all of  those who ultimately brought that bill to law. Now, the President has  done what he has always wanted to do, to have the Violence Against  Women Act reauthorized.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for, first of all, all of her leadership in leading the Women's  Caucus for a very sizable period of time; and to give us the  opportunity to speak about women today; and to remind us that we really  started out with a very important woman, and that is, of course, our  mothers.   So why don't I, as well, acknowledge, Ivalita Jackson, who served her  community; but, more importantly, her profession, and she was proud of  that, in nursing. And at the time, she was a vocational nurse, and she  wore the uniform with pride.   She was a mother with pride. She was a wife with pride. She was  really our rock, and she did things that showed her sacrifice. She  loved her profession. She loved nursing. She was our at-home doctor,  probably the doctor for the neighborhood.   But in order to ensure that she was home during the day, she made  sure she took the night shift. And the night shift in a hospital is a  challenging shift.   We can see all of the great and wonderful things that nursing has  generated, the heroes of today, the sheroes of today, as we went  through 2 years of the pandemic. But my mother was a shero many, many  decades ago.   And I came to love the uniform, came to love those white sparking  shoes that she wore so proudly, came to love and honor her sacrifice;  and how much she gave to her family, her job, her profession, her  church.   Ivalita Jackson is one to be honored; along with her mother, my  grandmother, Vannie Bennett; my other grandmother, Olive Jackson; and  then my aunt, Valerie Bennett, Vickie and Audrey, all wonderful women,  and Sybil.   So today, I come to join my colleagues to be able to talk about women  and to celebrate, as the President did in Women's History Month, just  24 hours ago; but then to celebrate again, as I mentioned, now, in law,  now the law, and that is the Violence Against Women Act, that almost a  decade, it seems--even though we went back as far as 2013, that would  have been 8 years--it seems that I have been doing this for a decade.   But I remember standing next to Vice President Joe Biden on the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which was in 1996. I  call the image, me in short stature and Joe Biden, tall stature, but  yet, one of great compassion.   And I loved hearing him speak today, how culturally out of step men  were, or the community was, or the Nation was, in trying to understand  why he would be engaged in fighting against domestic violence. I  remember him today saying, they asked me whether or not he had come  from a family of domestic violence, or he had abused his wife or he had  known someone in his family who had experienced that. And he looked at  them incredulously and said no.   It is something to care about. Domestic violence kills. Sexual  assault can kill. Rape kills, and it destroys lives. From very little  girls and very little children, boys or girls, to adulthood.   We loved him for saying that. And out of that passion came the first  Violence Against Women Act centered around domestic violence. Then it  grew to focus on the wide breadth of sexual assault in this Nation.   In speaking to the head of the major chiefs at the White House, she  reaffirmed the fact, as a chief of police of a major city, that  domestic violence calls are the most deadly for law enforcement  officers, and don't end well, in many instances, for our families.    It is appropriate in this month of women's history, that we also have  a  [[Page H3769]]  curative response by putting into law, after so many years of trying,  introducing over and over again this legislation, and finally, H.R.  1620 became law as the Senate passed that bill with an enhancement of  what we had included, which was the work dealing with Native Americans,  the work dealing with providing for housing, the amount of money, $1  billion, to cover the many new issues dealing with women, dealing with  cultural organizations, different women from different ethnicities,  language; we were responding to the needs that they have, religious  groups. We have cultural training for young men and boys.   We wanted to make sure that we did not, in any way, undermine what  the President had dreamed about when he first introduced this  legislation, I believe, in 1994.   So I wanted this to be part of Women's History Month because it was a  long journey. And let me thank all of the advocates who, year after  year, month after month, day after day, second after second, minute  after minute, hour after hour, met with all of us to try to work to  enhance and to be assured of the best kind of legislation that we could  secure.   Today was a celebratory day. But I really focus on it for saving  lives. And I just imagine, somewhere in America today is a woman being  abused, a woman suffering. And we now have a law that her State and  Federal Government law enforcement can maybe intervene, and her days of  being abused will be ended.                                time  1815    I do want to also acknowledge, as I move toward the historic women,  the kind of work women do. I want to make sure that we talk about  daycare owners.   This is The Gingerbread School, and I thank the owner for taking the  children of mothers who work day-in and day-out, hourly wages, night  shifts. I remember my mom, as I said, working night shifts.   She is there for them. These are the kind of women in Women's History  Month that deserve honor and respect, and I thank her for it.   Madam Speaker, then I acknowledge the fact that women are in the  medical profession. We used to take them for granted. There are a  rising number of women becoming doctors. We did not take them for  granted in the horrors of the pandemic of COVID-19 because we were  desperate for those who were testing when the vaccines came or  vaccinating. But most importantly, it was those nurses at our bedside,  for those on ventilators, those in hallways, those who were suffering.   COVID-19 was devastating and deadly, and it was the nurses and the  medical professionals, the many women who provided the kind of support  that maybe got us through.   I thank those late-night shifts. I thank those tears, those  collapsing on sidewalks outside of hospitals saying, ``How much more  can I take?'' They took more, and they kept going on and on and on.   I pay tribute to the millions of medical professionals who are women.  I support all of them, but I particularly support those who are women.   Madam Speaker, today, we had a hearing in the Budget Committee on the  question of how the pandemic impacted women, and I want to make one  point about that. It was unanimity. Certainly, it was recognized by one  of our witnesses that the idea of childcare being only 7 percent of  your income under the Build Back Better Act would be transformative;  that childcare keeps women out of the workforce, but most importantly,  it takes 25 or 50 percent, even, of their income. Remember, they still  are the lowest paid.   We realize, in this Women's History Month, there are many things that  we need to do to improve the lives of women. With that in mind, I now  cite some of the women who should be honored who have done great  things.   First, I do acknowledge the paycheck fairness bill that we did this  year; the child tax credit, driven by women, joined by great men, but  driven by women and really saving the lives of families all over  America.   Madam Speaker, I acknowledge Vice President Kamala Harris-- historically, the first woman of color to serve in the highest offices  of the land as Vice President of the United States, a woman of Indian  descent and African descent.   It is important to take note of the fact that an estimated 10 million  people in this country, as I spoke earlier, experienced domestic  violence, and that is why, again, we celebrate this month with the  passing of that bill.   But I just want to give a roll call of the many pioneering women who  should be recognized today:   Shirley Chisholm; Barbara Jordan; and as well those early pioneers,  Harriet Tubman, who led the Underground Railroad and slaves to freedom;  Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist as well a suffragette who said the  words, ``Ain't I a Woman''; Rosa Parks, who refused to get up so that  she could sit so that others might walk and others might run toward  justice.   Astronaut Mae C. Jemison, my dear friend, a Houston resident, the  first African-American woman to go into space.   Mathematicians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary  Jackson, those mathematicians who helped NASA in the early days by  pencil and hand, calculating major calculations needed for space  exploration.   Authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, all  enormous authors with enormous missions and all fighters for justice.   All of these persons, in their own way, provided a pathway for women.   I am very pleased to have brought the first African-American statue  into the United States Congress--designed and sculpted by a woman, and  as well raised the dollars to bring her here. She now sits in  Emancipation Hall, and her next journey is going to be in the rotunda  or Statuary Hall, where she belongs with the other suffragettes.   We know that Shirley Chisholm was the first Black woman to ever serve  in the United States House of Representatives and the first woman to  ever run for President of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I want to take note of my hometown heroes, such as  Nellye Joyce Punch, Ramona Toliver, Beulah Shepard, Christia Adair.  These are women who have since gone on, but they were pioneers in their  time, fighting for what was right.   I remember Beulah Shepard saying, ``It just takes one vote.''   Nellye Joyce Punch led on hunger and trying to stamp out hunger, as  she was a great teacher.   Ramona Toliver was an activist in Frenchtown in the Fifth Ward and  always fought to ensure that the people of that community were  responded to and not ignored.   Madam Speaker, I think it is important to realize that as we honor  women, we must recognize they find themselves in many different  careers. Coming from Houston, I want to acknowledge Sally Christian  Ride, the first woman sent into space; Eileen Marie Collin, the first  space shuttle pilot; and, of course, numbers of other unsung heroes in  the space program.   I mentioned Vice President Kamala D. Harris, and I want to emphasize,  as I close my remarks, that we have yet another journey to take. That  is the final confirmation after hearings of the next person to ascend  to the Supreme Court, and that is a Justice Brown Jackson, who by all  accounts is an outstanding--without question--legal scholar and jurist.  I hope for her, in this time of newness and difference, that she will  be greeted by those who will look to her credentials, her firstness,  and, of course, the constant excellence that she has shown.    Women have always been challenged as to whether or not they could do  the job. I leave you with the names of Golda Meir of Israel, Indira  Gandhi of India, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Margaret Thatcher of  Great Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and Portia Simpson-Miller of  Jamaica, among many others.   I know that there are millions of women who we have left out, but  today, we come to celebrate under the leadership of Lois Frankel, as  well as the Democratic Women's Caucus, to be able to once and for all  put a mark in this Congressional Record to say that we paused to say  thank you to women, that we paused to say thank you to the new and many  Members of the United States House of Representatives who have grown  and grown, Members who happen to be women.   The few women who were here when I came in 1995, we have  exponentially  [[Page H3770]]  grown in excellence, and we have brought a new face, a new perspective.  I remember those days, sitting lonely on the Committee on the Judiciary  with Pat Schroeder as, day after day, our friends on the other side of  the aisle brought up partial-birth abortion. Over and over again, Pat  and I tried to explain that these are decisions that are health  decisions that should be left to the mother, her faith leader, and her  doctor.   It is sad that the State of Texas has failed to remember such and  continues to abuse women in that State as it relates to choice and the  ability to seek a lawful abortion as they may desire with their church,  their doctor, and themselves.   Madam Speaker, the last point that I want to make, that mothers have  to deal with, are the horrible actions of Governor Abbott dealing with  transgender children. I want to say on this floor today that this is  part of women's history because it was the parents but the mothers  leading to protect their children from the abuse of this governmental  agency, suggesting that you could not have trans medical care, trans- affirming medical care; that you, as a mother, could not protect your  child.   Thank you to the mothers who have stood up. Thank you to the court  that indicated that you, Governor Abbott, are wrong yesterday, wrong  today, and wrong tomorrow.   These are our precious children. These are precious lives. These are  precious families. These are precious mothers.   My tribute to women today includes my tribute to the fighters that  have always stood up for what is right, what is conscience, and what is  just, either in fighting for democracy; fighting against the terror of  January 6; fighting for women's rights in the Violence Against Women  Act; fighting against abuse; fighting to stamp out hunger; fighting to  stamp out anger; and fighting in Ukraine to be able to stand against a  despot called Putin, who is violent and is a war criminal killing  children.   The mothers in my State who are standing for their trans children, I  offer them my greatest respect and dignity as we salute Women's History  Month.    Madam Speaker, allow me to again express my  appreciation to the growth and bounty of the Women's Democratic Caucus.  It is amazing, the coming together of now generational women, freshmen  classes, sophomore classes, and some of us who have had the privilege  of serving for a period of time. What an amazing power base that you  and we have created.   Madam Speaker, I thank Lois Frankel for her leadership. I thank  Brenda Lawrence and Jackie Speier for the way they have guarded and  guided this privilege with this power. I do think it is important to  put in the Record her singular work. She will not say singular work,  but we were all glad to join her.   Obviously, this particular young soldier came out of the breadth and  depth of Houston and out of Texas--but to be able to honor the life of  a young woman that simply wanted all her life to join the United States  Army. Jackie Speier had been working on the issue of sexual assault in  the military, along with our good friend, Senator Gillibrand, and the  lack of justice that we were seeing all the time. This had been going  on for a very long time.   It is important in this Women's History Month to say that we together  made history with your legislation that responded to the heinous crime  of the killing of Officer Guillen, a precious young women, who, growing  up as a little girl wanted to be in the United States military.   I think this is the point that should be made. Only in this recent  time can young girls want to grow up to be generals, astronauts,  presidents, scientists, and others. As Ms. Frankel and Ms. Speier  indicated, the abuse that was laid upon women for even thinking about  equality or justice or voting. And then, of course, I must say that  African American women found themselves at the lowest wrung of the  ladder and suffered the continuing lingering history of slavery, the  rape that was put upon them, the tending to whatever child was born,  and then, of course, tending to the fields.   Here we are today with a little bright light--and I am going to say  little bright light because Ms. Frankel laid out all the things we need  to do: the ERA, and we hope to get this new Justice.   I wanted to take a moment just to respond and build upon this vile  war criminal who seems to have Ukraine--God bless the soldiers, the  men, the men that stayed behind to fight, but the toll has been so  brutal on the women of Ukraine.   Even in the last 24 hours, women are leaving safe places in Poland  and Romania and they are coming back to Ukraine demanding that they  fight, that they stand with the people of Ukraine for the democracy  that they love. The death toll is brutal. The way they are dying is  brutal. To be running with your child thinking you are protecting them.  And to have the greatest moment of your life, the birth of a new baby,  and you die and the baby dies, and your whole innards are crushed.   Besides the women that are left behind in pools of blood--then the  women who are escaping with their children who have nothing. This has  been found around the world in Sudan when we were fighting against  genocide. The victims were women who were trying to hold on to families  in Rwanda. Places in South and Central America; the missing Mexican  women that we have been working on for years.                                time  1845    My previous Member from California had led us in this fight, and we  are still fighting. In the United States missing girls and human  trafficking is a scourge today, and the dominant population of human  trafficking are girls and girls who were tending to their daily duties  of going to high school and, all of a sudden, they walked away, and  they are in human trafficking, or they are being trafficked.   So we have a lot to fight. We have a lot to put on the Record today  and this month. We have got a lot of grandmothers to thank, a lot of  moms to thank, and a lot of firsts to thank. We have got a lot of poets  who have described our lives and a lot of writers who have described  our lives. We have got a lot of children who simply say thank you.   I guess I don't want to leave the podium.   I must thank the teachers because if ever people were elevated to  know how much you appreciate women, this 2-year, 3-year period of the  pandemic really laid it out. You were either sacrificing as a mother  because you were wearing 25 hats, Madam Speaker, and a lot of them  dealing with homeschooling and trying to make do. You were a nurse; you  were a teacher. You were simply in the fight.  [[Page H3772]]    Madam Speaker, you were a doctor, you were a hospital administrator,  you were an EMS, you were a fire person, a police person, and you were  in here dealing with just the pit of COVID-19 and what it was doing to  our families. You could have been in the funeral home business as a  woman, and you were dealing with these circumstances.   So let me just give a big thank you in this month, and I hope that if  I have not called your name, I am giving a big, overall thank you to  all of you women. We recognize all of our gentlemen. But today, all of  you have stood in the gap during a time in America's history that no  one ever expected.   So I say thank you to Congresswoman Frankel, to Congresswoman Speier,  and to all the women. We count them as being on the floor today to be  able to honor Women's History Month and then, of course, International  Women's History Month to be able to say thank you to all of them.   I must say thank you to the Pakistani women. I was at the Pakistani  Embassy last night. I don't want to leave the floor without saying I  met a lot of Pakistani Americans who were there celebrating Women's  History Month and to honor Pakistani-American women.   First, I would like to thank the Democratic Women's Caucus for  hosting this Special Order to celebrate Women's History Month.   During Women's History Month, we celebrate the generations of  trailblazing women who, in the face of daily hardship and systemic  discrimination, have paved a path toward gender justice.   It also serves as a global call to action, calling on us to advance  the rights and dignities of women at home, at work and in all aspects  of life.   Women have always led the effort to create a more fair, more  resilient, more prosperous, and more equal America.   It brings me great pride that in 2022, women are not only working  tirelessly to meet the needs of this unique moment, women are taking  the lead.   With Vice President Kamala Harris making history for our nation, with  more women than ever before serving in Congress and taking on  leadership roles in the President's cabinet, with the first Black woman  nominated to the Supreme Court, with women leading some of America's  largest and most innovative businesses, and with women continuing to  break ground as scientists and researchers, America is stronger because  of women.   I am proud that House Democrats are leading efforts to expand on  opportunities for women and to combat gender discrimination.   In addition to our work to close the gender wage gap by passing the  Paycheck Fairness Act, a major part of that effort includes addressing  the challenges posed to American women by the COVID-19 pandemic.   It is important to recognize that the burden of caring for children,  the elderly, and the sick still falls to women unevenly in our society,  and the pandemic forced many women to sacrifice their careers to care  for loved ones.   Last year, Democrats and President Biden enacted the American Rescue  Plan, which extended the expanded Child Tax Credit to help families  make ends meet and help women stay in the workforce and return to their  jobs.   It is now year 3 of the Coronavirus pandemic, which means that women  have been leading the COVID-19 response, combatting the virus in  America and around the world.   During Women's History Month, we honor the female frontline health  care workers.   From health care to home care, restaurants to grocery stores, women  workers, low-paid workers, and women of color are on the front lines of  the COVID-19 pandemic.   According to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, nearly 80% of  healthcare workers and 83% of workers who provide social assistance,  including child care and emergency services, are women.   Additionally, women-dominated occupations, such as nurses, flight  attendants, and personal care aides, are among the most vulnerable to  getting sick and spreading it to others.   Women are also in the position to suffer the most in an economic  recession.   Women are the most economically vulnerable, comprising nearly 60% of  workers in low-wage occupations.   Low-paid women workers have very little in the way of savings, which  means it is much harder for them to weather economic shocks, especially  when they are likely to be supporting a number of dependents.   Just this week, my bill, VAWA, was reauthorized as part of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, which President Joe Biden signed  into law.   We must continue to do more to ensure that law enforcement has all  the tools it needs to protect Americans from domestic violence,  stalking, and sexual assault and that survivors have the resources to  heal.   VAWA is life-saving legislation.   This legislation was enacted in response to the prevalence of  domestic and sexual violence, and the significant impact of such  violence on the lives of women.   Statistics have revealed that these forms of violence impact us all.   In the United States, an estimated 10 million people experience  domestic violence every year, and more than 15 million children are  exposed to this violence annually.   According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about  20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner.   About 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner  physical violence, sexual violence, and/or partner stalking with  injury.   Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women and 34.5 percent of men are  subjected to domestic violence.   As we celebrate Women's History Month, let us reflect on the women  who shaped our history and on those today who are leading our nation  forward.   We must work toward a future with equal access to economic  opportunities, health care, and safety for all Americans.   It brings me great pride to say that more than 120 women House  Members proudly follow in her footsteps--including a record number of  committee and subcommittee chairs, myself included.   Driven by these women's devoted service and guided by their  leadership, the Democratic House continues to lead the way in building  a more just future--whether strengthening the rights of women in the  workplace through the Paycheck Fairness Act and Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act, defending reproductive health freedoms with the Women's  Health Protection Act or advancing the Build Back Better Act's historic  investments in maternal care, paid family and medical leave, childcare  and more.   Last month we celebrated the contributions of African Americans to  the history of our great nation, and paid tribute to trailblazers,  pioneers, heroes, and leaders like U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Jordan;  U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland; Mae C. Jemison; activists,  intellectuals, authors, and artists like Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks,  Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, to name just a few  of the countless number of well-known and unsung heroes whose  contributions have helped our nation become a more perfect union.   The history of the United States has been marked by the great  contributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and  artists.   As a Member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of  giants whose struggles and triumphs made it possible for me to stand  here today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and progress  for all, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.   Women's History Month is also a time to remember many pioneering  women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists Harriet  Tubman and Rosa Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like  Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; authors Maya  Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have each in  their own way, whether through courageous activism, cultural or  intellectual contributions, or artistic creativity, forged social and  political change, and forever changed our great Nation for the better.   Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to  Congress, when she was elected to represent the New York's Twelfth  Congressional District in 1968 running on the slogan, ``Fighting  Shirley Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.''   She reflected that spirit well during her 14 years in Congress.   Before Shirley Chisolm, no black woman had ever served in the U.S.  House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate but following in her  footsteps are 51 black women Members of Congress, two black women U.S.  Senators, including the president of that body and Vice-President of  the United States; 23 Hispanic members; and 15 Asian-Pacific members,  along with the first woman Speaker of the House, and mayors of several  of the largest cities in the nation, including the District of  Columbia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, New Orleans, Baltimore,  Hartford, Minneapolis, San Antonio, and St. Louis.   Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that during those turbulent  times the nation required a determined leader to represent the voice of  so many Americans who felt dismay at their treatment.   She took an extremely active role in changing the way women were to  be judged from that point on.   She remarked that, ``Women in this country must become  revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional  roles and stereotypes.''  [[Page H3773]]    This is a sentiment that I myself take to heart, women in this nation  are now told they have a right to determine the kind of life they want  to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core of this movement.   This past August 26, 2021, we commemorated the 101st anniversary of  the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which  granted women the right to vote.   This momentous achievement did not come easy or without struggle, for  as the great abolitionist and orator, Fredrick Douglas stated: ``If  there is no struggle, there is no progress . . . . Power concedes  nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.''   The fight for women's suffrage was waged over a 72-year period,  beginning in Seneca Falls, New York at the Seneca Falls Convention in  1848, and exemplifies the prophetic and timeless saying of Margaret  Mead that one should:   ``Never doubt the ability of handful of committed persons to change  the world. It is the only thing that ever has.''   The Seneca Falls Conference was organized by Lucretia Mott, with  others including Mary McClintock and Sojourner Truth, who went on to  establish herself not only as a great advocate for women's suffrage but  also as a great abolitionist.   Among the courageous suffragists who spearheaded the movement were  Alice Paul, who fearlessly executed the National Women's Party  picketing protests, and conceived the hunger-strike in prison; Carrie  Chapman Catt, who devised the ``winning plan'' at the Atlantic City  Convention; and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, whose political activism and  criticism of the suffrage leadership for excluding black women led to a  more inclusive and effective movement.   In 1916, four years before the ratification of the 19th Amendment,  Jeannette Rankin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from  Montana, the first woman elected to federal office in American history.   A little over a century later, a record number of women serve in the  House of Representatives, comprising 23.4% of the chamber's voting  members, and presided over by Nancy Pelosi, the first and only woman  elected Speaker of the House.   In the 117th Congress, about 37% of women are women of color, and  since 1964, more than 70 women of color have been elected to Congress.   Although there remains much work to do to ensure that women enjoy  full blessings of liberty and equality, that should not detract from  the achievements and contributions to the greatness of our country made  by American women, including Sally Kristen Ride, the first woman sent  into space; Eileen Marie Collins, the first woman space shuttle pilot;  Grace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and United States  Navy rear admiral; and Katherine Johnson, one of the unsung heroes of  the NASA Space Program, whose mathematical calculations helped the  United States win the Space Race.   Nor should we forget that the current Vice-President of the United  States is Kamala D. Harris, Vice President Harris is the first woman,  the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be  elected as Vice President.   Similarly, we should remember that just five short years ago, Hillary  Clinton shattered one glass ceiling when she became the first woman  nominated as the presidential candidate of a major political party and  came within 80,000 votes of winning the presidency and thus shattering  the ultimate glass ceiling.   American women will break this ceiling in the not distant future,  drawing inspiration from trailblazers in other nations such as Golda  Meir of Israel, Indira Ghandi of India, Ellen Sirleaf of Liberia,  Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and  Portia Simpson-Miller of Jamaica, among many others.   In my home city of Houston, there are numerous men and women who are  great because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who said:   ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a  heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''   One barrier left to fall, however, is one of the most important, and  that is membership on the Supreme Court of the United States.   For most of our national history, presidents and senators have turned  a deaf ear to Abigail Adams' plea to her husband ``to remember the  ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your  ancestors.''   Since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's 1981 appointment, only a small  handful of women have been nominated to the High Court during this  time, despite the fact that women constitute a majority of the general  population, 37% of all attorneys in America, a number that will soon  exceed the majority since a substantial majority (54%) of all law  students in America are women.   With Associate Justice Stephen Breyer's retirement announcement,  President Biden and the U.S. Senate, now have been presented and should  move quickly to capitalize on this opportunity to begin to rectify the  High Court's gender and racial imbalance and to diversify its  composition by confirming a member of the most underrepresented,  disadvantaged, marginalized, longest suffering, and most patient  demographic in America: black women.   Longer than any other racial or ethnic group, black women have been  subjected to the coercive powers of the law while being excluded from  the opportunities to make the laws citizens are to live under.   President Biden has made a nomination for the ages in selecting U.S.  Circuit Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as U.S. Supreme  Court Associate Justice.   Not only does Judge Jackson possess one of the finest legal minds of  her generation, her commitment to equal justice, the rule of law, and  Constitution is unsurpassed.   Judge Jackson will be a great Justice and a role model to women and  girls everywhere, especially little black girls, that in America all  things are possible with hard work and determination.   With this nomination, we are taking a massive step towards having a  government whose institutions, including and especially the Supreme  Court, are comprised of persons that look like the American people.   I applaud President Biden for making this historic nomination and  urge the Senate to conduct a fair, impartial, and expeditious  confirmation proceeding and confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson--who  has already been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three times.   As we celebrated Black History Month and now Women's History Month,  let us pay tribute to those who have come before us, and pay forward to  future generations by addressing what is the number one issue for  African American families, and all American families today: preserving  the American promise of equal opportunity for all.   And it is crucial that as we reflect on how far women have come, we  also not lose sight of how far we have to go and what must be done to  achieve true gender and racial equality so every girl everywhere can  pursue her dreams and realize her potential.   As we progress through Women's History Month, let us summon the  extraordinary courage and resilience of the many women who came before  us.   Democrats will never relent as we carry on the fight for full  equality--not only for our nation's daughters, but for women and girls  all over the world.   As the legendary Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm said, ``If they don't  give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.''    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the  Congressional Women's Caucus, I am pleased to join this Women's Caucus  Special Order with my colleagues, to discuss the bravery of Ukrainian  women and girls in the face of Russia's war against Ukraine.   I thank the Co-Chairs of the CWC, Representatives Dean and Gonzalez- Colon, for their leadership of the Bipartisan Congressional Women's  Caucus.   Firstly, I would like to commend all Ukrainians for their outstanding  bravery. It is truly inspirational for Americans, and for people around  the world. America stands with you.   Russia's launch of a premeditated war against Ukraine is an attack on  democracy and a grave violation of international law, global peace, and  security.   The fighting has sparked massive displacement and has forced over two  million Ukrainians to flee their homes to neighboring states and has  put women and girls at heightened risk of violence.   Although many people have fled, millions have stayed behind to help  fight the Russian invaders and defend Ukrainian sovereignty.   Thousands of Ukrainian women have taken up arms and are playing a  vital role in Ukraine's national defense. Today they make up 22.8% of  the Ukrainian army, not including the thousands who have volunteered as  civilian soldiers.   Life in the military is not easy for women. While women have been  serving in the Ukrainian military since the annexation of Crimea in  2014, they did not win the right to officially fight alongside their  male counterparts until 2017.   When Russian-backed forces seized part of the Donbas region and  conflict ensued in 2014, thousands of women volunteered to help the  Ukrainian military. They served as assault troops, medics, and snipers.   But the sacrifices made by these women went largely unrecognized.  Official documents issued by the Ukrainian military, listed these  soldiers as seamstresses, cooks, and janitors.   The women who volunteered ``often found themselves outside legal  protection,'' according to the Invisible Battalion, an advocacy group  for Ukrainian servicewomen, that studied women's roles in the war  against Russia.  [[Page H3774]]    Although these women have not always been adequately supported by  their government because of soviet era laws forbidding them from  enlisting, they have persisted.   In 2017 a group of women veterans got together and lobbied for their  rights, which brought about a much-needed change in the culture in the  Ukrainian military.   Just last year the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense determined that  female soldiers marching in a military parade celebrating independence  from the Soviet Union would wear high heels, not boots.   Regardless of the numerous hurdles and mockeries Ukrainian women have  faced and continue to face today, there are thousands who are putting  their lives at risk to protect and defend their homeland.   Among them have been a 79-year-old woman who recently learned how to  fire a gun, a former beauty queen Anastasia Lenna, who represented  Ukraine at the 2015 Miss Grand International pageant--and Kristina, a  former wedding singer.   Kristina was living in Italy last summer when tensions between  Ukraine and Russia rose. While knowing the security risks, Kristina  returned to her country to become a soldier.   She told a VICE news reporter that ``The risk of saying goodbye to  life is always there, [and she is] not afraid of death; [she] is afraid  to [become a slave].'' Words that will forever stick with me.   Women's History Month is a celebration of women's contributions to  history, culture and society, and there is no better example of this  than those women fighting in Ukraine today.   So, on this day, March 9, 2022, I would like to publicly commend the  women fighting in Ukraine for their boundless courage and bravery. The  world stands with you and will continue to fight alongside you to put  an end to Putin's cruel parade.
