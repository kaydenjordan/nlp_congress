 Mr. President, I know we are about to go to the vote.  Frankly, with what my distinguished colleague just said, I don't know  why these aren't all voice votes.   But I understand Senator Menendez is on his way here and wishes to  speak. Otherwise, I would move that it be a voice vote. But out of  respect for him and his committee, I will suggest the absence of a  quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator who  wishes to speak, I would note that I appreciate those who worked very  hard, including my friends on the floor, on the National Defense Act.  Yesterday, that passed with a pretty overwhelming majority, and I voted  for it. But as I have noted, that does not provide money; that provides  an authorization.   Right now, if we go on continuing resolutions, the Department of  Defense will see a multibillion-dollar cut in what is available for  them, as will nondefense matters.   So I would urge Senators to work with our leaders and get the  appropriations bills done. They could all be done in an omnibus by the  end of January, the 1st of February. I would urge Senators to do that.  Otherwise, there is going to be a dramatic cut in defense and  nondefense matters.   I yield to the senior Senator from New Jersey.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, while I  was necessarily absent for the confirmation votes of Ramin Toloui and  Rashad Hussain, I want the Congressional Record to reflect my support  for their confirmations. Had I been present, I would have voted in the  affirmative.   Ramin Toloui is nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of State for  Economic and Business Affairs. He is the professor of the Practice for  International Finance at Stanford University, and the Tad and Diane  Taube Policy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy  Research. His teaching and research focus on international economic  policy, financial crises, and the economic impact of artificial  intelligence. He began his career as a civil servant at the Department  of the Treasury. His nomination was favorably reported by the Foreign  Relations Committee, and he is superbly qualified to hold this  position.   Rashad Hussain is nominated to be Ambassador at Large for Religious  Freedom. He is a senior counsel at the Department of Justice's National  Security Division. He previously served as President Obama's Special  Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation--OIC--as U.S. Special  Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, and as Deputy  Associate White House Counsel. In his role as OIC Envoy, Professor  Hussain helped develop U.S policy and deepen and expand partnerships  with Muslim-majority countries, civil society organizations, and the  OIC, the world's second largest multilateral organization after the UN.  As Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications,  Professor Hussain led an interagency body that worked with  international partners to amplify credible narratives in countering  terrorist propaganda. Having been reported favorably by the Foreign  Relations Committee, I have no doubt of his qualifications for this  position.  [[Page S9251]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, those who know me, and even those who  don't, are well aware of the pride I have in my Italian heritage. My  maternal grandparents emigrated from the Friuli region of Italy, coming  to South Ryegate, VT, to work in the granite quarries. Since the 1880s,  many Italians have followed this same immigration pattern, settling  across Vermont, where the beautiful hills and lakes remind them of  their ancestral home. Today, Vermont boasts a strong community of  Italian Americans, many of whom, including me, are members of the  Vermont Italian Cultural Association, VICA. Led by President Lisa  DeNatale, the association preserves and promotes Italian culture in  Vermont, hosting language and travel groups, presentations, movies,  cooking classes, luncheons, and bocce socials. Last year, Marcelle and  I were delighted to join VICA and Trattoria Delia for a virtual wine- tasting. Joining with dear friends online helped us, like so many  Vermonters, get through the earliest and harder months of the pandemic.   It is nearly impossible to travel across our State without seeing the  influence of the Italian-American community. In Northfield, the streets  outside of La Panciata smell of Carrara, Italy, where founder Glenn  Loati learned the ancient art of baking Latin leavened breads. In  Burlington, Trattoria Delia serves traditional Neapolitan pizzas baked  in an imported Acunto oven. And of course in Barre, where so many  Italians immigrated, the Societa di Mutuo Soccorso provides community  support, and the Vermont Salumi and Alimentari Roscini Market keeps us  fed with some of the best cured meats in the State.   Some Italian philosophies have also made their way to Vermont. The  Slow Food movement, founded by Carlo Petrini in Turin, Italy, found a  welcoming home in our State less than 10 years after its conception.  The practices of growing and producing good, clean, and fair food  certainly weren't new to Vermonters, but Slow Food Vermont has become  an important part of our local food economy.   I am proud to be a member of VICA and so grateful for the rich  culture that Italian Americans have fostered in Vermont. The Green  Mountain appreciation for artisanal products created with craftsmanship  and traditional methods will always remind me of my Italian ancestors.  I look forward to being back in Vermont, breaking bread and sharing  wine, with this incredible community.   ``We the Italians'' recently interviewed VICA President Lisa  DeNatale. Her comments so resonated with me. I recognize many of the  businesses, friends and communities she references. Even when far from  Vermont and at work in Washington, these kinds of interviews take me  home.   I ask unanimous consent that the recent interview with Lisa DeNatale  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [Dec. 7, 2021]  We the Italians: Interview With Lisa DeNatale (President of the Vermont                       Italian Cultural Association)         If since the beginning of the pandemic I personally have       not yet had the opportunity to physically travel back to       visit any of the many friends of We the Italians scattered       across the United States, thanks to our interviews I often       have the chance to take a virtual trip and get to know the       various Italian communities both in the most famous areas of       America and in the lesser known ones here in Italy.        Vermont may be not that famous in Italy, but Italian       emigration to the Green Mountain State was very important and       I am pleased to thank and host Lisa DeNatale, President of       the Vermont Italian Cultural Association and also Ambassador       of We the Italians in Vermont. I'm hosting her on We the       Italians, but by telling me about the history and present of       Italy in Vermont, it's a bit like she's also hosting me in       Burlington and Barre. Are you ready? Come with me      Lisa, please tell us something about you and your Italian heritage         My grandparents, Maria Tripi and Salvatore DiNatale       emigrated from Pietraperzia, Sicilia in 1910. They married       and settled in Boston, eventually buying a home, and raising       their six children in Everett, Massachusetts.        Giuseppe Salvatore DiNatale, my father, was born in 1924.       He was deeply proud of his Sicilian heritage and often sang       songs and occasionally spoke to his children in Italian (not       dialect). If the truth be told, he mostly spoke in the       imperative! ``Vieni qui''; ``lasciala''; ``mangia'';       ``andiamo subito'' are some of the phrases I recall.        I had a large extended family which gathered at my       grandparent's home for Pasqua, Natale, Onomastici and almost       any other occasion. I remember celebrating my father's       Onomastico with zeppole in honor of San Giuseppe. Each       celebration included more people than there were chairs,       crowded around tables in my grandparent's home. As children       we played bocce alongside the grape vines and pear trees in       their yard and danced the tarantella.        From a young age I recall attending the Feast of Maria       Santissima Della Cava, patroness of Pietraperzia, one of the       many feasts celebrated in Boston's North End each summer. In       1967 my parents and grandparents traveled together to Sicily       and Italy, reestablishing family connections and invigorating       our ties to Sicily. Upon returning my father began a life-      long focus on preparing authentic Italian foods such as       risotto milanese, calamari, polenta, pesto and panettone,       well before these gained popularity in the US.        In my twenties I began to visit Italy and have since       traveled there dozens of times, including twice to Sicily. It       may be surprising to hear that on my first trip to Sicily, I       was struck by how many of my childhood friends surnames       corresponded with places in Sicily such as Siracusa and       Mondello, and how many more had relatives buried in the       Cimitero di Pietraperzia. I understood then how much of my       childhood was inextricably tied to Sicily.        I am currently pursuing my Italian citizenship and am       awaiting my appointment at the Boston Consulate schedule for       March 2022.     You are the President of the Vermont Italian Cultural Association.  Please tell us about the history and the activities of this association         The Vermont Italian Cultural Association was founded in       1983 by Italians and Italian Americans many of whom had       relocated to Vermont in the late 70's. Dr. Ken Ciongoli, an       Italian American born in Philadelphia and Dr. Mario Morselli,       born in Bologna, were lecturing about Italy in Burlington,       Vermont and attracted interest from the community and in       particular from other Italians and Italian Americans in the       area. Some of the early VICA members were new to Vermont and       sought an Italian community in which to continue their family       traditions and celebrate their Italian heritage. In time, a       small group formed, drawn together by a mutual passion for       preserving and sharing Italian culture. During the early       years the group met in living rooms and later, in restaurants       and community centers that could accommodate the growing       numbers. Membership extended south to Barre and Rutland;       communities steeped in Italian heritage. The growing       community shared the bond of family and Italian traditions       and preserved these for generations to follow.        VICA has for many years celebrated Epifania with a visit       from La Befana and Carnevale which included a mask making       activity. In addition, VICA has sponsored trips to Italy as       well as opera excursions to Montreal, a short 90-minute drive       from Burlington. Programs and activities have expanded over       the years, ranging from lectures on art, travel and genealogy       to film, cooking, dance, language groups and bocce       tournaments. Monthly amici lunches bring together members for       socializing, and Italian conversation groups have continued       in classrooms, in coffee shops and on zoom.        More recently, VICA has turned to virtual events which have       proven to be very popular. These include book readings hosted       by Phoenix Books, a VICA partner, featuring Vermont authors       Vincent Panella, Jay Parini and Charlie Nardozzi, along with       travel author Carla Gambescia. A recent lecture on Slow Food       with the Slow Food Vermont chapter attracted over 100 people       and earlier this year VICA held two virtual presentations       entitled In Pursuit of Italian Citizenship, attracting over       200 VICA and community members.        And because Vermont winters can be cold and snowy in       December 2020, and almost bi-monthly since then, we've co-      hosted virtual wine-tastings with VICA partner Trattoria       Delia, showcasing Italian wines from every region. In       celebration of Women's History Month in March we featured       wines produced by women in Italy. Participants were treated       to personal video messages sent from three producers: Cinzia       Sommariva, Elisa Sesti and Giulia Negri. Each event includes       a selection of hand-curated antipasti prepared locally. These       events have proven to be enormously popular, engaging our       members and successfully recruiting others to VICA. Upcoming       events include virtual cooking classes, opera lectures and a       trip to Puglia in October 2022.        Promoting knowledge and appreciation of Italian culture in       our community is at the heart of the Vermont Italian Cultural       Association's mission. Each year VICA awards small grants and       scholarships to support projects and endeavors consistent       with VICA's mission. The VICA Scholarship and Grants Fund       encourages those who are seeking to broaden their knowledge       of Italy, including the Italian American experience, the       Italian experience, its language, arts, music, history, and       culture to apply. Most recently (prior to covid) two       scholarships were awarded. One went to a University of       Vermont student who participated in an archaeological  [[Page S9252]]       and agronomic research project at an ancient Roman villa in       the commune of Mompeo in the Lazio region. The other       recipient, also a UVM student, attended an archaeological       field school in Badia Pozzeveri in Tuscany, where she       participated in the excavation of the remains of a thirteenth       century church. At the conclusion of each project, the       scholarship recipients gave presentations to VICA members and       the broader community.        In the last year VICA has become a big part of my life. On       January 1st, 2021, my father passed away at the age of 96,       and I wondered how I might hold onto the traditions and       heritage he shared so proudly with his family. While I have       only been a VICA member since 2015, and only recently was       elected President, I am delighted for the opportunity to       honor my father in my role. His absence has left me with a       deeper commitment to VICA's mission, and that in truth, VICA       is the key to keeping my own heritage alive.            What's the story of the Italian emigration to Vermont?         I am not a historian, so I have relied on resources and       information found in news articles, historical societies, and       other documents. I am grateful to those writers who have       shared their knowledge and perspective so that we remember       the contributions of Italian immigrants to Vermont's economy       and culture. My response is based on articles from two       sources and used with permission from Vincent Feeney, Vermont       Historian and The (Barre-Montpelier) Times Argus.        Many people are surprised that Vermont had such a large       Italian immigrant population, but one need look no further       than the granite and marble quarries to understand the       immigrant story. Vermont welcomed Italian immigrants       beginning in the 1880's. The first Italian stone workers came       from Carrara to work at the Vermont Marble Company in       Rutland. They were skilled marble carvers who were drawn to       America for economic reasons and specifically to Vermont       because its hills and lakes reminded them of their ancestral       home.        Italians came to Barre, from 1890 to 1910 as stonecutters       to work in the granite quarries. By the turn of the century       there were several thousand Italians in Barre. By 1910, about       14 percent of Barre's population was Italian, and Barre was       the home of Vermont's largest Italian population. Most       immigrants to Barre came from the granite area around Viggiu       and Bisuschio in Lombardy as well as from the marble area       around Carrara in Tuscany. Some of Barre's outstanding pre-      World War II carvers and sculptors were Italian immigrants:       Carlo Abate, Joseph Calcagni, John Comi, Elia Corti, William       Corti, Enrico Mori, Samuel Novelli, Augusto Sanguinetti, and       Geno Tosi.        Other Italian immigrants came from the north as businessmen       or landowners. Others from southern Italy first worked for       U.S. railroads and then migrated to Barre establishing a       variety of businesses. Novelli & Corti was established by       Samuel (``Sandro'') Novelli and Elia Corti in 1901 and also       included John (``Crosta'') Comi and William (``Bigin'')       Corti. Novelli & Corti became Barre's premier sculpture and       carving studio of the early 1900s. There are many outstanding       examples of the skill of Barre's carvers in monuments       throughout Barre. And a walk through Hope cemetery, where       many Italian immigrant stonecutters are buried, is a       testament to their skills.        Later, due to a shortage of skilled granite workers a small       number of master sculptors and carvers were lured from Italy       through substantial wage increases to work in Barre. These       artists led a renaissance of stone art in Barre and trained a       whole new generation of Barre sculptors and carvers. Some of       Barre's outstanding post-World War II carvers and sculptors       include Angelo Ambrosini, Angelo Bardelli, Giuliano       Cecchinelli, Alcide Fantoni, Flavio Furloni, Frank Gaylord,       Ernesto Malnati, Orazio Marselli, Gino Sassi, and Lambruno       Sarzanini.        Italian immigrants were also settling in Burlington's urban       core in large numbers, as laborers working on the railroads       and others in the lumber yards. Some became peddlers selling       fruit and vegetables, later opening markets to serve the       growing Italian population. For the Italians of this       Burlington neighborhood--despite the hardships of the Great       Depression--the pre-World War II years were something of a       social/cultural ``Golden Age.'' Their businesses dotted the       neighborhood. For groceries in general, but particularly for       pasta, salami, and olives, neighbors shopped at Colaceci's,       Izzo's and Merola's. For a night out people dined at       Bernardini's Cafe, and beginning in 1941 and continuing for       the next 70 years Bove's was the restaurant to treat family       and friends to an inexpensive Italian dinner.        The neighborhood was also home to Italian institutions. In       1933 Italian men of Burlington joined with their fellow       countrymen of Winooski to form the Twin City Italian Club       (TWIC). Its professed purpose was to ``raise the standards''       of the Italian community and to prepare immigrants for       citizenship, but it was also a place where old-country       Italian men could socialize, talk about news from home, and       perhaps make job connections. By 1936 the club was       sufficiently prosperous that it bought a vacant lot and built       a social hall. The hall was the center of Italian social life       in Chittenden County for the next dozen years. Italian women       socialized in an organization called Regina of Mount Carmel,       a group that attended Mass together once a month. The Regina       of Mount Carmel was Mary, who for centuries had a devoted       following in the impoverished south of Italy from where so       many Italians had emigrated.        You've already mentioned a few, but are there other important                       ``Italian'' places in Vermont?         Barre is one of the most Italian places in Vermont, and is       home to The Societa di Mutuo Soccorso, founded by Italian       immigrants in Barre in 1906 as a fraternal and community       support group. Along with the Societa, are several businesses       including Vermont Salumi and (Alimentari Roscini) AR Market       in downtown Barre. Peter Roscini Colman, born in Assisi to an       Italian father and American mother is the founder and       proprietor of both. Pete grew up on an organic farm in       Vermont and spent summers in Umbria with his babbo's family.       There, he used to ``warm up'' for lunch at his grandparents'       house by eating prosciutto. He loved it so much he decided he       wanted to learn to make it himself. His uncle Franco       introduced him to Pepe, who introduced him to Francesco and       David. Soon, he was apprenticing with these norcini, the       famed butchers of Umbria, who taught him the methods,       techniques, and centuries-old traditions of salumi-making.        There's also Campo di Vino an authentic grocery, chock full       of Italian specialties made on the premises. Refrigerators       are stocked with homemade pastas including ravioli, gnocchi,       tagliatelle, and more; freshly stuffed luganiga and sausages       as well as cannoli and pies.        Not far from Barre, located in Northfield is La Panciata, a       family owned and operated wholesale bakery. Founder Glenn       Loati learned the ancient art of making Latin leavened loaves       of bread in Carrara, Italy where he traveled in 1992 to work       in the bakery of a local market. Today the bakery is owned       and operated by Glenn's son Justin. La Panciata produces and       distributes a wide variety of breads including Pane       Siciliano, Pane Altamura, Focaccia and an assortment of       biscotti.        Perhaps one of the most important and representative       Italian places is Hope Cemetery located in Barre. Strolling       through the cemetery, it's impossible not to notice the       gradual refinement of granite tombs over the course of the       20th century. The earliest gravestones are rough and       weathered, as though the earth had coughed them from the       ground. Many stonecutters died performing their craft, having       succumbed to the ``American disease'' silicosis. Because the       climate in Italy was milder, workers labored in sheds with       open sides, naturally ventilating the area, allowing the fine       dust to escape. One such stonecutter, Louis Brusa, died in       1937 at age 50 from silicosis. His monument is one of the       most unusual (and disturbing) in Hope Cemetery. Brusa is       shown exhausted and slumped backward with his wife Mary       comforting him. His chest is merged into the granite base       symbolic of his lungs filled with granite dust. Looking       around, the names on the tombstones conjure far-away places:       Columbo, Benvenuti, Peduzzi, Corti, and more. More than a few       are engraved in Italian: Nata Novembre 1872, Mo11a Febbraio       1936. There are prominent mausoleums where generations of       Italian families are buried side by side, close in death as       in life.        Not so much a place but a philosophy is Slow Food, the       movement founded by Carlo Petrini in Turin in 1989. Vermont       led the US, establishing the first Slow Food chapter here in       1998. Good, clean, fair food is a practice that has long been       at the root of Vermont agriculture, respect for the land, the       animals, and workers. In 2000 Carlo Petrini visited Vermont,       and in 2008 Vermont began sending a delegation to Terra       Madre, the most important international Slow Food event.    And what about the most representative Italians who marked a spot in              the history of the Italian presence in Vermont?         I've already mentioned many of the sculptors who have made       their mark in the cities, towns and public spaces in Vermont       and elsewhere having created lasting monuments with their       hands. One of the most notable Italian Americans is Vermont       Senator Patrick Leahy, whose maternal grandparents were       Italian immigrants. Senator Leahy is the most senior member       in the US Senate and Vermont's longest-serving Senator. He       and his wife Marcelle are also VICA members.                   Is there an Italian festival in Vermont?         To my knowledge there has not been an Italian festival in       Vermont, however we would like to plan one for the future.       I'm certain there would be a great deal of interest from       Vermonters, including many from the business community. One       of Vermont's family owned and operated businesses,       Torronecandy.com would be very popular. Since 1988, the       Andriola family has attended a number of Italian festivals       throughout the Northeast, offering delicious Italian sweets       and treats from their traveling cart. Absent a festival in       Vermont, we can still order delicious imported treats shipped       to our homes, or we can invite Anne Marie Andriola,       Torronecandy.com founder and VICA member to a meeting!     You are an expert in marketing and brand development. How would you                     promote Made in Italy in Vermont?         Soon after joining VICA's marketing committee, I created       the tagline ``Discover Italy  [[Page S9253]]       in Vermont'' which I think lends itself very well to our       mission. For many, there is joy in discovering the       individuals, businesses, small producers, and artisans who       are preserving the traditions and craftsmanship made famous       by Italians both in Italy and here in Vermont. For example,       there are many businesses valued for their commitment to       sharing Italian culture as business owners, native-born       Italians, Italian Americans and purveyors of Italian food,       wine and Italian made products. And like Italy, Vermont has       its own brand with its reputation built on local production,       appreciation for quality and craftsmanship.        Vermont and Italy share similar values and I believe there       is already a deep appreciation for Made in Italy. We are       fortunate to have Italian farms like Agricola, a small       diversified farm in Panton, VT run by Alessandra and Stefano.       Both native Italians they are continuing the traditional       methods for making authentic Italian salumi and have       established Monti Verdi Salumi. More recently Trenchers       Italian Farmhouse began producing and selling home-made       pastas, sauces, bomboloni, focaccia and more at local farmers       markets. Jenny and Giacomo Vascotto are also sharing       traditional Italian techniques, practices and delicious food       with a growing number of devoted followers. So you see, in       some ways Made in Italy is also Made in Vermont.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in Vermont, the general store is the  epicenter of a community. It is where people not only buy their  groceries and newspapers, but also tools and hardware, mittens and  hats, axes and chainsaws, gas for their cars, and too many other things  to name. But just as important, general stores are where Vermonters  meet their neighbors, and when the weather is good, pass the time and  talk about their families, things going on in town, or the state of the  world.   Marcelle and I have been to just about every general store in  Vermont, and each one has its own history and character. One of them,  Dan & Whit's, stands out. Located in Norwich about halfway up the  eastern side of the State bordering on the Connecticut River, the store  that became Dan & Whit's has been operating since 1891. It was  originally called Merrill's Store, and the old Merrill's sign is still  affixed to the front. The same neon clock, mounted high on the front of  the store's facade, has told the time to the town since the 1950s. Made  by the Electric Neon Clock Co. in Cleveland, it was recently restored  and made energy efficient.   In 1955, Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks, who had both worked at the store  for over 20 years, bought it from Mr. Merrill. Since then, Dan & Whit's  has been open for business 365 days a year, including a half day on  Christmas and a half day on Thanksgiving. Dan and Whit ran the store as  partners, and Dan's wife Eliza, known to all as ``Bunnie'', did the  bookkeeping in the raised office near the stationery and greeting cards  until Whit retired and sold out in 1972.   Dan, who from what I am told hardly took a day off during all those  years, retired in 1993, and turned the management of the store over to  his sons George and Jack, and their sister Jane pitched in off and on.  George's wife Susan took over Bunnie's job in the office, which hadn't  changed in decades, except the typewriter was replaced by a computer.  Ownership of the store is currently shared between George and his two  sons Dan and Matt. Dan, after a 14-year career as a special education  teacher, has taken over the day-to-day management.   Most townspeople have an account, so they can simply sign the  register and pay the bill at the end of the month. At no charge for  local calls, anyone can use the push-button phone with its long cord by  the ice machine, and before cell phones, it was a vital link from the  magical abundance of the store to the outside world: ``Do we need  anything at Dan & Whit's?''   There is a reason why the sign in the store window says, ``If we  don't have it, you don't need it,'' because when you walk in and keep  walking, the store never seems to end. Dan & Whit's has got absolutely  everything, at least everything a person could reasonably want or need.  There is fresh fruit and vegetables, a selection of wines, kitchen  utensils, bins of nails and boxes of screws, fishing tackle, ladders  and rakes, paint, bags of horse feed, maple syrup and candy, toys, ice  cream scooped on the premises in summertime, home-brewed beer, bright  orange hunting caps, snow boots, plumbing and electrical supplies,  shovels and wheelbarrows, wood stoves, birdseed, the local and national  newspapers, a deli, gasoline pumps and an electric vehicle charging  station, and lots more. The place is kept warm in the winter by a wood- fired furnace in the basement, requiring cords and cords of wood-- delivered, split, and stacked behind the Frasers' homes, and there are  solar panels on the roof. Dan & Whit's has long been a favored stop for  hikers on the Appalachian Trail, which passes through the center of  Norwich.   Over the years, Dan & Whit's has hired local high school students to  run the cash registers, and there was a time not that long ago when the  employees who stocked the shelves and helped you find what you were  looking for were long-timers like Larry Smith, who worked there for  over 50 years.   Recently, like so many other businesses in our State and around the  country, it has been hard to find help. In fact, Dan & Whit's was  facing the real possibility of closing, which would have been  devastating for the people of Norwich, as well as countless others who  come there to shop, as well as former residents of Norwich who stop at  the store just to be sure that it is the same as it always was.   As many have remarked, Dan & Whit's is the heart of Norwich, and  losing it would have changed everything. I can't imagine Norwich  without Dan & Whit's, and I suspect just about everyone who knows the  store feels the same way. Real estate listings for property sales in  the town include the distance from Dan & Whit's. Hundreds of notices  are along the wall by the entrance: dog lost, secondhand items for  sale, yoga lessons, a free concert, snow plowing. It all happens at the  general store.   Fortunately, but not surprisingly, when word got out that the store  might close, the people of Norwich came to the rescue, and Dan & Whit's  has not lost a day of business. I want to add my thanks to Dan and the  volunteers who saved the heart of Norwich. They have reminded us of  what is best about Vermont and, in doing so, have set an example for  people everywhere.   I ask unanimous consent that a piece written on December 7 by Robert  Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 The Heart of a Community: a Small Business                             (By Robert Reich)         I've got a special place near my heart for Dan & Whit's       general store in Norwich, Vermont. It was there for me during       my undergraduate years in college in nearby Hanover, New       Hampshire--often on snowy evenings when I couldn't get       supplies elsewhere. Years later, when my parents moved to       Vermont for their retirement, Dan & Whit's was there for       them, too.        Like many places around the country, Vermont has been       struggling with finding enough workers to fill jobs. But       unlike most urban centers, where the obvious answer is to pay       workers more, rural towns can't always count on higher wages       to elicit more job applicants because populations are thin       and often declining. And unlike profitable national retail       chains, mom-and-pop businesses can't just absorb higher labor       costs. And they can't simply pass them on to customers in       higher prices, because small-town customers might not have       the ability to pay.        So when Dan & Whit's owner Dan Fraser recently put up a       ``Help Wanted'' sign, the inhabitants of Norwich knew it was       bad news. (I never met the younger Dan but I'm sure I met his       grandfather, who passed the store on to his father, who       passed it on to Dan.) After three generations, Dan would have       to close the place down if he didn't get help. So what was he       to do? I heard the rest of the story on the radio. It turned       out that Dan didn't need to do anything. Word went out. Soon,       Dan's customers began applying for the jobs. Rick Ferrell, a       local doctor, took on a shift at the register. A retired       finance director applied for the deli counter. A nurse, a       teacher, a psychology professor, a therapist, a school       principal--nearly two dozen customers have stepped up to       stock shelves, do the inventory, and clean up the place, so       that Dan & Whit's can remain open. (Virtually all of these       new hires are donating their hourly wages to some of Dan's       favorite charities.)        I've spent a lot of time over the years examining what       happens to communities when important businesses close or       abandon them--often because some bean counters back in       headquarters hundreds or thousands of miles away decide it's       not worth the cost of keeping the businesses going where they       are. Economists often praise capitalism's wondrous       ``efficiencies'' at moving assets to their ``highest and best       uses.'' Well, there's  [[Page S9254]]       something to that. But what's left out of the equation are       the social costs of these moves. They can be quite high.        When asked why the people of Norwich stepped in to help Dan       & Whit's keep going, employee Dianne Miller said it was       ``because Dan & Whit's is the heartbeat of this community.''       Others described it as the ``heart of the town.'' That's the       best quick summary of the social benefits of a place like Dan       & Whit's I've ever heard. Communities do have hearts. When       businesses at those hearts disappear, more is lost than an       economic asset. The community loses a place that allows it to       be a community--a place where people meet up, congregate,       exchange gossip and information, barter, learn about common       problems, sometimes decide to take action.        I remember Dan & Whit's as such a place. I can't imagine       Norwich without it. Luckily, it won't have to be. But this       isn't just a ``feel good'' story about one country town       coming together to save an iconic general store. It seems to       me there's an important lesson here for all of us, wherever       we live.        American capitalism is the harshest form of capitalism in       all of the world's advanced economies. It takes almost no       account of social costs and benefits. Businesses swoop in and       swoop out wherever and however profits can be maximized and       losses minimized.        But communities are different. They aren't nearly as       footloose as financial capital. They're built on social       capital, which often takes years to accumulate and can't be       cashed in.        I think people owe something to businesses that are the       hearts of our communities. Maybe we shouldn't allow big       chains or Walmarts to drain our main streets of the commerce       they need to survive. (Even if Walmart's items are cheaper,       the social costs of losing the small businesses that       undergird our community are often way higher.) Maybe we       should donate some of our own time and labor to account for       the importance of these core businesses. Maybe those of us       who can afford to should buy shares in them, to give them an       added financial cushion. At the very least, we owe them our       patronage--rather than, say, the Waltons or Jeff Bezos.        What do you think?                            ____________________
