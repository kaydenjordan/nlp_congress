 Mr. President, last night, I joined most of the Members  of Congress to hear President Trump give his first address to a joint  session. His speech lasted about 60 minutes, and I listened carefully,  as did everyone in the Chamber, to the President's first remarks from  that historic setting as he addressed a joint session of Congress.   There were some omissions, which I found very interesting. Not once-- not one time--in the course of an hour did President Trump ever say the  word ``Russia''--not one time--even though we have been told by 17 of  our intelligence agencies that Russia made an overt effort to influence  the outcome of the last Presidential campaign. That has never happened  before in American history. A foreign country attacked the sovereignty  of the United States in the election process for the highest office in  the land. I think that is noteworthy. It is certainly historic. It  would certainly be worth at least a mention when a President speaks to  a joint session of Congress just a few months after that election.  Instead, there was radio silence, mute button, crickets--nothing about  Russia.   What do we have in terms of congressional response to the possibility  that Vladimir Putin was trying to pick our next President? We have the  suggestion by the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House that  this matter should be taken up by the Intelligence Committees.   It sounds reasonable on its face. Having served on Intelligence  Committees, I can tell you it is an awesome responsibility and  assignment. I can also tell you we have some extraordinarily gifted,  talented, patriotic members of those committees from both political  parties in the Senate and in the House, but there is a fundamental flaw  to this approach. If you went searching on Capitol Hill to find the  room in which the Senate Intelligence Committee meets, you would come  up empty. There is no sign on the door. It is basically kept  clandestine, confidential, and secret. For 4 years, I entered that  door, sat down in closed hearings, with no one from the public able to  hear or even appreciate what we were doing. It is a lonely assignment-- unlike any other committee on Capitol Hill.   I wonder: Is that what we want to do to explore the involvement of  Vladimir Putin in our Presidential campaign--to go behind closed doors  in secret and meet clandestinely? I think not.   There is an aspect of this that will require some intelligence  gathering, some discussion of intelligence--and certainly that would be  secret--but there is much more of it that is public in nature that will  never be disclosed if we rely on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It  is an invisible process, and that invisible process does not serve the  needs of a democracy that wants the truth--the straight talk, the  answers.   Secondly, the work of an Intelligence Committee ends up in a report  that is classified, which means the public doesn't get to see it. We  have seen some renditions of it--heavily redacted pages, where one or  two words might escape being crossed out.   How do you move from a classified document on Putin's involvement in  our Presidential campaign to a public document the people can  understand? It takes declassification. Who makes the decision on  whether we declassify the information from the Intelligence Committee  investigation? The White House.   So, with the possibility--and I underline that word--with the  possibility that some people in the President's campaign may or may not  have been involved in this, the President has the last word as to the  American people ever hearing the results of an Intelligence Committee  report.   Many of us believe this is serious, and many of us believe there  should be an independent, transparent commission, just like the 9/11  Commission. Let's call on people we respect, such as GEN Colin L.  Powell, Sandra Day O'Connor, a former Supreme Court Justice, and many  others just like them, who could get to the bottom of this and answer  the basic questions: What were the Russians up to? We hear they had  1,000 trolls sitting in offices in Moscow dreaming up ways to hack into  the computers and Internet of the United States and to disclose  information to try to influence the outcome of the election. It is not  a new tactic from Russia. They have done it over and over again.   The last couple of weeks I visited Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine. They  know these tactics oh so well. Under Soviet times and since, Russia has  tried to invade their space when it comes to election decisions-- overtly, covertly, through propaganda, through cyber attacks. They have  done it in many countries around the world. Sadly, they are good at it.  Now they have decided they can do it in the United States. They can  decide who our President will be or at least try to. Are we going to  take this sitting down?   November 8, 2016, election day, was a day that will live in cyber  infamy in the United States. The Russians invaded the U.S. election  process. The President of the United States spoke to the American  people last night and never mentioned one word--not a single word-- about this.   How many Republican Senators and Congressmen have come to the floor?  I don't know about in the House, but I can tell my colleagues I know  about the Senate. None. Not one has come to the floor to even address  this issue.   So when President Trump ignored it last night, refused to even  mention it, I wasn't surprised, but it is not going away. It is a fact.   We currently have an investigation underway in our intelligence  agencies. I just met with former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. He has  been designated by the President to be the DNI--the Director of  National Intelligence. He made a statement publicly yesterday before a  hearing in Congress that he is going to cooperate with the committees  and with Congress in disclosing information they have accumulated in  our intelligence agencies as to this Russian involvement in our  election.   We also know the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in this  same exercise to find out exactly what happened and to disclose as much  as possible and take action--prosecutorial action--if necessary.   There is a problem, though. The Federal Bureau of Investigation works  for the Attorney General. The Department of Justice has the power to  impede or stop any FBI investigation. Our former colleague Jeff  Sessions was deeply and personally involved in the Trump Presidential  campaign. He should recuse himself. He has an obvious conflict of  interest on this issue. For the integrity of the office and for his own  personal integrity, he should step aside and appoint a special  prosecutor who can follow up, if necessary, with this FBI  investigation.   This is a serious matter that was not addressed at all last night by  the President of the United States speaking to a joint session of  Congress.   The Associated Press went through some of the claims that were made  by the President last night, and I want to give them credit for their  homework on this. It is important for the Record that some of the  things the President said be explained.   The President said:         According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current       immigration system  [[Page S1524]]       costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.    The Associated Press writes:         That's not exactly what the report says. It says immigrants       ``contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add       expenditures by consuming public service.''        The report found that while first-generation immigrants are       more expensive to governments than their native-born       counterparts, primarily at the state and local level,       immigrants' children ``are among the strongest economic and       fiscal contributors in the population.'' This second       generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis,       for example, than non-immigrants in the period, 1994-2013.        The report [that the President unfortunately       mischaracterized] found that the ``long-run fiscal impact''       of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as       more positive ``if their role in sustaining labor force       growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial       activity were taken into account.''    So to argue, as the President did yesterday, that the National  Academy of Sciences, as he said, stated that our current immigration  system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars is, at best,  incomplete and misleading.   The President then went on to say during the course of his speech  last night:         We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by       bringing down the price of the F-35 jet fighter.   I remember when he said that.   The Associated Press says as follows:         The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured       in full or large part before he became President.    He has taken credit for something he didn't do.   According to the AP:         The head of the Air Force program announced significant       price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35       fighter on December 19--after [candidate] Trump, [President-      Elect Trump] had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he       met with the company's CEO.    The AP goes on:         Pentagon managers took action even before the election to       save [this] money. . . . Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with       the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no       evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of       President Trump's actions.    Here is another statement made by the President last night:         We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.    I remember that one. That is something I hope we all can aspire to,  but let me tell my colleagues what the Associated Press says about that  claim.         Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen.       Independent analyses of his campaign tax proposals found that       most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families.       The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly       $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population       would get a tax cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax       Policy Center, a joint project with the Brookings Institution       and Urban Institute.    Here is another statement the President made last night:         Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.    The Associated Press says:         That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's       because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes       everyone aged 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't       looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are       staying home to raise children, high school and college       students who are studying rather than working.        They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the       economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching       retirement age many of them retiring, the population of those       out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do       so, most economists forecast.        It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of       working age and have given up looking for work. But that       number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million       President Trump cited.    Another statement the President made: He said his budget plan will  offer ``one of the largest increases in national defense spending in  American history.''   I will not dwell on this other than to say that the absolute number-- a $54 billion increase, or about 10 percent, is the largest single  number. On a percentage basis, there have been larger increases in  previous years, like 2002, 2003, and 2008.   Here is another claim made by the President last night:         Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors,       Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others       have announced they will invest billions of dollars in the       United States and will create tens of thousands of new       American jobs.    The Associated Press reports that ``many of the announcements reflect  corporate decisions that predate [Trump's Presidential] election,''  making it unlikely his administration ``is the sole or even primary  reason for the expected hiring. . . . In the case of Intel,  construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump  actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was  delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips,  but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years  because it anticipates business growth.   Another statement made by President Trump last night in his speech:         We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and       poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those       who have become so badly addicted.    The facts:         Addicts and mentally ill people who gain access to       treatment programs for the first time as a result of       ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--are worried about repeal       that President Trump has called for. Repeal could end       coverage for 1.8 million people who have undergone addiction       or mental health treatment, cut $5.5 billion on spending on       such services according to estimates by economist Richard       Frank, a former administration official under Barack Obama,       now with the Harvard Medical School.    The AP goes on to say:         The key question is what will happen to Medicaid as a       result of changes Republicans are pursuing? Broadly speaking,       Republicans want to transform the health insurance program       for low-income people from an open-ended Federal entitlement       to a system that provides States with a limited amount of       financing and gives them latitude on how to spend it.    The AP goes on to say:         If Congress is too stingy with State allotments, States       would be hampered dealing with the emergencies like the       opioid epidemic.    The next statement by President Trump last night:         According to data provided by the Department of Justice,       the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-      related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our       country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San       Bernardino to the Pentagon, and yes, even the World Trade       Center.    The Associated Press responds:         It's unclear what Justice Department data the President is       citing. The most recent government information that has come       out doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people       President Trump talks about were actually born in the United       States, according to Homeland Security Department research.       That report said of 82 people the government determined were       inspired by foreign terrorist groups to attempt to carry out       an attack on the U.S., just over half [of them] were [born in       the United States] native-born citizens.    The AP goes on to say:         Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the       work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his       Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in       San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago.        It's true that in the immediate aftermath of September 11,       the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas       feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But       that's no longer the case. The FBI and Justice Department       have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the       U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of       the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has       prosecuted scores of Islamic State-related cases since 2014,       and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens.    Another statement by President Trump last night:         ObamaCare is collapsing . . . imploding Obamacare disaster.    The AP writes:         There are problems with the 2010 health care law, but       whether it's collapsing is hotly disputed.        One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act       has been a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from       insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems       to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern.        Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the       whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured       if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say       GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating       uncertainty about the future.        The health law offers subsidized private health insurance       along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income       people. Together, the two arms of the program reach more than       20 million people.        Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid       are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the       administration to keep this expansion, and maybe even build       on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of       Medicaid.  [[Page S1525]]         While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the       markets for subsidized health insurance are stressed in many       states. Also affected are millions of people who buy       individual policies outside the government markets, and face       the same high premiums with no financial help from the health       law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation       says ``implosion'' is too strong a term. An AP count found       that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite       the Trump administration's threats to repeal the law.    I might add, that it is despite all of the speeches made on the floor  of the Senate and the House, promising that it would be repealed as  well.   The last point I want to make is this. I was troubled last night by a  recurring theme in the President's speech. It was a theme about  immigration in the United States. We are a nation of immigrants. My  mother was an immigrant to this country. I am proud to serve as a  Senator from the State where she and her family settled. I am proud of  the struggle they went through--coming to this country, not knowing the  language, going through some pretty rough times, facing poverty, taking  the dirtiest and toughest jobs. Because of that, the second generation  of my family--the one I represent--has brought some great people to  this world in our own families and perhaps even added to the benefits  of the United States for others.   Last night, if you listened to the characterization of immigrants, it  was negative, virtually from start to finish.   In the audience last night, I had a young lady as my guest. She is an  extraordinary lady. Her name is Aaima Sayed. She is Pakistani, and she  was brought to the United States at the age of 3 by her parents from  Pakistan. They settled in Chicago and eventually moved to New Jersey.  It turns out the family had its difficulties and the mother and father  split and separated. When the father left, he left behind his  paperwork--which was in place or at least in the process--of trying to  legalize the presence of his family, and nothing was done.   It wasn't until she was in high school that this young lady realized  that she was undocumented. That creates obstacles for any young person.  In her case, a special obstacle was the cost of higher education. As an  undocumented child in America, she didn't qualify for government  assistance--Federal Government assistance--and limited State  assistance. Yet she aspired to go on to school and to borrow the money,  if necessary, at high interest rates from private sources in order to  finish her education. She graduated from Rutgers University magna cum  laude and then wanted to go to medical school.   There weren't many medical schools accepting undocumented students,  but there was one. I am proud to tell you that it was Loyola University  of Chicago, the Stritch School of Medicine. There were about 65  undocumented young people in medical school in the United States, and  30 of them were at Loyola in Chicago. I have met most of them. Each and  every one of them is more inspiring than the next.   They opened up the competition. They didn't give them slots to fill.  They said: Compete with everyone. These students were so outstanding  from across the United States that they made it to Loyola.   This young lady, in her third year, faces another 6 years of  education before she completes her medical degree. When she is finished  with those 6 years, it isn't over. In Illinois, we told her she could  go to school, but it was part of a contract. She could attend school,  and we would reduce the interest payments at a later part in her life  if she gave us 1 year of service in an underserved community in  Illinois for each year of medical school. She has 6 years of school  left and 4 years of serving in a rural community or an underserved  neighborhood clinic in the city of Chicago or nearby.   She signed up for it. She is an amazing young person. She is  determined to get this medical degree--despite the debt, despite the  obstacles. The only reason she can do this is because she is protected  by something called DACA.   Let me explain. Some 16 years ago, I introduced a bill called the  DREAM Act. It said that if you were brought to the United States, like  she was, under the age of 16, you had a good life, no criminal record  or history of a problematic nature, and completed your education, you  can stay in the United States and eventually work your way toward  legalization.   President Obama took it up and created an Executive order called DACA  and said to the young people in that situation: Come and apply, pay a  $600 filing fee, then go through a criminal background check, and if  you make it, we will give you 2 years to live in the United States  without fear of deportation, with a work permit.   She signed up. That is how she can go to medical school. You need to  work to go to medical school. She is going through a clinical  experience where she is actually working in these hospitals. Without a  work permit, she wouldn't be able to complete medical school.   The obvious question is this: What is going to happen to this program  under President Trump? In fairness, the President has said positive  things about DACA and DREAMers. I thanked him personally. I have only  met him three times, but I thanked him personally twice for doing that.  I hope that it means that ultimately there will be some path for the  750,000 young people, just like her, who are simply asking for a chance  to be educated and be part of America's future.   I hope that, as people who listened to the speech last night think  about immigrants to the United States, they will think about this young  woman, as well, who has worked so hard her entire life to better  herself and to be able to help others at a later point in life.   She is an extraordinary person, and there are so many more just like  her. They are immigrants to this country. In this case it is Muslim  immigrant to this country who someday will be an exceptional doctor,  who is going to give 4 years of her life back to my home State and then  is going to help others all across the United States. That, to me, is  an image of immigrants that shouldn't be lost with the negative  connotations that were raised last night.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  sesquicentennial anniversary of the founding of the University of  Illinois, a nationally recognized institution of higher education with  a long record of innovation and discovery and the home of the Fighting  Illini.   In 1867, 150 years ago, my home State of Illinois established the  University of Illinois with the purpose of fostering access to higher  education for the working people. It would become one of 37 public,  land-grant institutions established as a result of the Morrill Land- Grant Colleges Act signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln.   Over the past 150 years, the University of Illinois and those  associated with it have been responsible for pushing the boundaries of  human knowledge, scientific discovery, social justice, and equality.   In 1941, David Blackwell, the son of a railroad worker from southern  Illinois, received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of  Illinois. In 1965, Dr. Blackwell became the first African American  elected to the National Academy of Sciences, whose members advise the  President and Congress on matters related to science and technology.  Dr. Blackwell is regarded as the most famous African-American  mathematician in history.   In 1948, the University of Illinois became, and remains to this day,  the most accessible campus in the world for individuals with  disabilities. Timothy Nugent founded the first comprehensive program of  higher education for individuals with disabilities at the University  and helped create a campus that allowed individuals with disabilities  to move about freely and independently. While the availability of buses  with wheelchair lifts, accessible street curbs, and comprehensive  collegiate programs for those with disabilities all have become the  national standard, they started at the University of Illinois.   The University of Illinois has long been a leader in groundbreaking  research and innovation in science. In the early 1970s, Paul Lauterbur  discovered magnetic resonance imaging--better known by its initials:  MRI. For his pioneering work, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2003.   Today the university is one of the premier public research  universities in the world. It ranks in the top 50 universities in  America for research and development dollars spent in science and  engineering. It is also home to one of the world's most powerful  supercomputers, known as Blue Waters. Blue Waters is the fastest  supercomputer located on a college campus in the world.   What began 150 years ago as a small building on the Illinois prairie  between  [[Page S1536]]  the Illinois Central train station in Champaign and the courthouse in  Urbana is today a 785-acre campus with a reputation admired around the  world. It is home to more than 44,000 students from all 50 States and  more than 100 different countries each year. The University of Illinois  has enhanced the lives of over 450,000 living alumni and produced 23  Nobel Laureates and 22 Pulitzer Prize winners in the process. In  addition, the university has grown to include campuses in Chicago and  Springfield and regional campuses in Rockford, Peoria, and the Quad  Cities.   It is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the sesquicentennial anniversary of the founding of the  University of Illinois. I offer my best wishes and congratulations to  President Timothy Killeen and all the University faculty, staff,  students, and alumni on this important milestone.                            ____________________
