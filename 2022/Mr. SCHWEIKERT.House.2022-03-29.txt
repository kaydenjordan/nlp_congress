 Madam Speaker, it is neat to see us actually have  something that we are all doing together.   A bit of trivia, at the end of this decade, 22 percent of our  population will be 65 or older. Retirement security is--besides just  the moral imperative--it is going to be the financial, it is going to  be the driver of almost all sovereign debt.   Look, there are a couple dozen provisions in this legislation, and in  many ways they look like tinkering, but they come together. If you  happen to have a profession where you have a mandatory retirement age  that might be 60, 65, the ability to do catch-up--to be a small  business and knowing what you can contribute to your 401(k) when you  are doing your taxes instead of trying to guess at the end of the  year--these things all come together.   We are also going to have to look forward in the coming year and deal  with the reality of what did inflation do to the cost of future  retirement? The taxation on, really, gain, that isn't purchasing power,  but is inflation. This is a terrific first step and it is neat to have  us do something together.
