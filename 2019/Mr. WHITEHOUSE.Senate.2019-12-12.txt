 Mr. President, I am here to speak about the success  of the Affordable Care Act in Rhode Island. It has been very well  managed in Rhode Island, and it has made a very big difference in many,  many lives.   The marketplace plan that the Affordable Care Act set up in Rhode  Island is called Health Source Rhode Island. It has been well run, and  it has been successful. For 2019, it has 34,533 people getting health  insurance through the plan.   We also expanded Medicaid, as the Affordable Care Act allowed. Under  the Medicaid expansion, 72,000 Rhode Islanders got coverage that they  didn't have before. So if you put those two together, that is 106,000- plus Rhode Islanders who got the benefit, the comfort, and the  confidence of coverage for healthcare as a result of this bill. It is  10 percent of our population, and it has driven our uninsured numbers  way, way down, into low single digits, which has been a very big win  for us.   I will also say that we have taken very good advantage of the  accountable care organization provisions of the Affordable Care Act,  with two of the best  [[Page S7012]]  performing ACOs in the country as two of our lead primary care provider  groups: Coastal Medical and Primary Care Partners. They are showing  just terrific results, as they are changing the way they deliver care.  They can do so because we have changed the way they can be reimbursed  for care.   That Rhode Island snapshot is part of a larger story of success.   Eleven and a half million Americans around the country have enrolled  in ACA marketplace insurance in 2019. There are 11.8 million Medicare  beneficiaries who have saved a total of $26.8 billion on prescription  drug costs. That is over $2,200 per senior. That is something to  celebrate. Unfortunately, it is still at risk in the courts.   President Trump and this Republican administration are still trying  to knock it down. If they succeed, 133 million Americans with  preexisting conditions will be at risk of losing healthcare coverage  protections.   One hundred and fifty-six million Americans with private or employer- sponsored insurance will lose the consumer protections in the ACA for  preventive care, disallowing lifetime or annual limits and closing  waiting periods to enroll--things that have really made a difference in  people's lives.   These are big numbers, and they add to a tremendous story of success,  but behind the numbers are faces. Every one of those 34,533 Rhode  Islanders who signed up and got health coverage through Health Source  Rhode Island has their own story.   Today it is my privilege to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to  tell the story of Bridget from Tiverton, RI. I can't tell it better  than she does, so I will simply read her story. She says:         For the majority of my life, I have suffered from chronic       pain. Though I am only in my 20's, I have suffered from acute       arthritis in my left hip due to multiple surgeries to correct       complications from a hip displasia surgery for almost 15+       years. I was told for years that I was not a candidate for       hip replacement as I was still growing, so when I was finally       developed enough and found a surgeon willing to perform the       hip replacement surgery, my life felt like it was actually       mine again. Last year, I finally was approved for a hip       replacement. It has been a year since that day, and I thank       God every day that I was able to receive the help I need.       Without the hip replacement, I would still be living in bed       and confined to a wheelchair or crutches.        Without my coverage, the preventive care that ensured my       health would not backpedal would have been gone. I cannot       stress enough how terrifying the thought of losing the       opportunity of living my life was. I would not wish this       endeavor on anyone, especially a child without coverage, as I       have been in their situation.        Since my surgery, I have been able to hold my first full       time job, I have been able to consider going back to college,       I have lived pain free for the first time in practically my       whole life.         No one should have to struggle with chronic issues or be       discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions.       Every day I grow stronger, and my voice, for those who are       not as strong as I am now, grows louder. I will fight for my       right to health care and for others who deserve the treatment       they need for the rest of my life.    Bridget, congratulations. Thank you. God bless you.   Let us make sure we do not let this administration tear down the  millions of stories like Bridget's that they seek to undo with this  reckless litigation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
