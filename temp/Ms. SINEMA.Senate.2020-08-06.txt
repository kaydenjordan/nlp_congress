 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent but had I been  present would have voted no on rollcall vote 153, motion to proceed to  the House message to accompany S.178, a bill to condemn gross human  rights violations of ethnic Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang calling for an  end to arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment of these  communities inside and outside China.  [[Page S5264]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Manuel ``Manny'' Cisneros, a dedicated public servant and advocate for  indigent and Latino communities across Arizona. Manny committed his  life and career to community building and equal rights empowerment for  Arizona's most vulnerable.   As a native of Somerton, AZ, Manny studied at Arizona Western College  and went on to pursue a juris doctor degree at both Harvard University  and the University of California Berkley School of Law where he  received his juris doctor in 1984. Manny would serve as the coordinator  of public health for the city of San Francisco, CA, before returning to  Arizona to serve as the magistrate and assistant city manager of the  city of San Luis. Under Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, Manny was  appointed to lead the Executive Office of Equal Opportunity. He would  also serve as the director of the Governor's Fair Housing Office. Manny  also dedicated a significant portion of his life to organizing and  advocating for Latino voting, education, and fair housing rights. He  served as chairman of the Maricopa County Democratic Party and as a  delegate to the 1996 and 2000 National Democratic Conventions.   I had the pleasure of working with Manny during the early years of my  career and I was always impressed by his kindness and dedication to  ensuring every Arizona family had access to affordable and safe  housing. As a humble public servant and Latino rights champion, the  impact Manny has left in our hearts, his community, and our State will  be felt for generations to come. His wife Beatriz and sons Jose and  Daniel will be in my thoughts. Please join me in honoring the life of  Manny Cisneros.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Michael McQuaid, an established figure of the Phoenix business  community and a determined philanthropist dedicated to reducing  homelessness in central Arizona.   Michael's work to end homelessness began nearly three decades ago  when he and his sons completed a community service project to serve  meals to the homeless at the Andre House of Hospitality. He eventually  became the group's first chairman of the board. In 2003, Michael  combined his desire to alleviate the chronic homelessness in Arizona  with his experience as a commercial real estate developer and president  of JP Management to oversee construction of the Human Services Campus  in Phoenix, a national model for holistic homelessness services. He  went on to serve as the managing director of the campus and as  president of its board of directors. Over the years, Michael also  served on the boards of Maricopa County Association of Governments,  MAG, Continuum of Care, the Lodestar Day Resource Center, the Arizona  Housing Commission, the Valley of the Sun United Way's Ending  Homelessness Advisory Council, Experience Matters, and Thunderbird  Charities, among others. In 2010, Michael was recognized by Arizona  Governor Jan Brewer with the State of Arizona's Lifetime Volunteer  Award. In 2013, he was awarded the first Virginia G. Piper Trust Encore  Career Award for his efforts to address homelessness in Maricopa  County.   Michael established a legacy of service in central Arizona that  others will undoubtedly seek to match. I am certain that the love he  shared for his fellow Arizonans will be felt for many years to come.  Please join me in honoring the life of Michael McQuaid.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Postmaster Humberto Trujillo Jr., ``Junior''. He was a beloved leader,  coach, and Postmaster. Junior served others with dedication, and his  impact will be felt for generations.   Junior grew up in West Phoenix, where he attended Edison Elementary  School and East High School. He was an avid athlete and went on to  attend Phoenix College, where he played football, and spent over a  decade coaching sports to the children in the community. Junior first  worked for the postal service as a masonry foreman who helped construct  the Phoenix Main Post Office. As a 31-year veteran of the Postal  Service, Junior used his skill and expertise to rise through the ranks  of the service. In 2015, Junior accepted the position of Phoenix  Postmaster, leading the staff of the same post office he helped build  many years ago.   Junior will be deeply missed by his family and the community who  shared in his love. Please join me in honoring the life and service of  Postmaster Humberto Trujillo, Jr.                            ____________________
