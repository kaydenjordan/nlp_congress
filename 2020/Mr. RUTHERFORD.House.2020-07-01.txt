 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Joseph J. Mancino, Sr., of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, who,  sadly, passed away in late June.   Mr. Mancino was a true American patriot who embodied the selfless  values of the Greatest Generation. He joined the Navy at the age of 17  and bravely served aboard the USS Griffin and USS Coucal in the Pacific  during World War II. He also witnessed the atomic bomb explosion  dropped over the Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads, which was  the first atomic test after the war. Joseph received numerous medals  for his service, including the Philippine Liberation Medal and Good  Conduct Medal.   Those who knew him best say that the only thing stronger than his  love for his country was his love for his family and friends. He is  survived by his wife, Mary--his wife of 72 years--his four children,  seven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida and the  United States of America, I thank Mr. Mancino for his service to our  Nation and offer our sincerest condolences to his family and friends.                      Honoring the Life of Tyler Lehman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Tyler Lehman,  who, tragically, passed away from a rare form of leukemia during 2017.   During his battle with cancer, Tyler became an inspiration to many in  our Jacksonville, Florida, community. Despite numerous cycles of  remission, relapse, and chemotherapy, which took a really hard toll on  his body, he never lost that positive spirit.   Each year, no matter how difficult it was for him, Tyler would lead  his team of walkers for the annual Light the Night Walk for the  Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. His team continues to walk each year in  his memory.   He has also befriended people from all over the world, supporting  them as they struggled with their own individual ailments and  conditions.   He loved the outdoors, whether it was biking nearly 20 miles each day  for charity or barbecuing at Cedar Point Park. It has now been over 3  years since his passing, and he is still missed dearly by his family  and friends. Tyler was important to so many in northeast Florida, and I  know that his memory will live on forever in those whom he touched.                                time  0945     Recognizing Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and U.S. Coast                         Guard Sector Jacksonville     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and United States Coast Guard  Sector Jacksonville for their response to a vessel fire beginning June  4 at JAXPORT.   For days, under the leadership of Fire Chief Keith Powers and Sector  Jacksonville Captain Mark Vlaun, they battled this fire under difficult  conditions with bravery and skill, extinguishing the flames and saving  the ship from complete destruction.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, nine of those brave firefighters  sustained injuries in the blaze, and five are still recovering.   We are so thankful to have these outstanding firefighters in  northeast Florida who are the heroes of our communities, saving lives  every single day. It is comforting to know we have talented, trained  professionals ready to respond to a medical emergency, a house fire, or  in this case, a ship fire, at a moment's notice.   Our thoughts continue to be with the injured firefighters and their  families, and we wish them a full and speedy recovery.                            ____________________
