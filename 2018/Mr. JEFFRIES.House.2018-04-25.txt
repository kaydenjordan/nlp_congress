 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest  chaplain, Rabbi Shlomo Segal of Kehilat Moshe synagogue from Sheepshead  Bay, Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal and his wife, Adina, founded the synagogue 5  years ago, and they have since created a vibrant community not only for  the diverse group of Jews who attend their services, but for people of  all faiths throughout Brooklyn.   Rabbi Segal is a leader in our community who works hard to build  bridges of understanding and tolerance. He serves on the board of  governors of the New York Board of Rabbis and is a rabbinical  consultant to the Kings Bay Y, a Jewish community center in the Eighth  Congressional District that I proudly represent.   Through his work, he celebrates the diversity of Brooklyn, bringing  together different religious and ethnic groups to emphasize what we all  have in common--as New Yorkers and as Americans and, most importantly,  as human beings.   Rabbi Segal has brought together Jews, Christians, and Muslims to  break fast for Ramadan and worked hard to bring together and strengthen  ties between the Black and Jewish communities of central Brooklyn.  Rabbi Segal's efforts are geared toward making religion the greatest  possible force that it can be in our community and in our Nation.   He is here today with his wonderful wife, Adina, and two tremendous  children, Shira and Rayna. It is my honor to welcome them to the  people's House and to our Nation's Capital.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished  ranking member, for yielding, for his leadership, and, of course, to  the chairman of the committee and to so many other Members:  Representative Issa, Representative Rooney, and Representative Crowley  and many, many others who have worked hard on this particular piece of  legislation.   Of course, above all else, I want to thank my good friend and  colleague, Congressman Doug Collins, who has been a phenomenal leader  in bringing stakeholders together from across the music ecosystem,  bringing folks together from the digital industry, bringing the  National Association of Broadcasters together to help us reach this  moment where we have a consensus product that can ensure that the  people of America and the Nation can continue to enjoy the music we  have come to know and love.    Article 1, section 8, clause 8 of the United States Constitution  gives Congress the power to promote and create a robust intellectual  property system in order to, in the words of the Founding Fathers,  promote the progress of  [[Page H3538]]  science and useful arts. The Founding Fathers of this great Nation  understood that we should incentivize creative brilliance and  incentivize innovation and, in that context, that the creator should be  able to benefit from the fruits of their labor and, in doing so, will  continue to share their creative brilliance with the world.   In the context of music, we know that the manner in which we have  consumed music has changed over time: from vinyl to 8-track, from 8- track to cassette, from cassette to CD, from CD to downloads, from  downloading to streaming. The manner in which we consume music has  changed, but the underlying brilliance and beauty and creativity of  that music remains the same.   Consistent with what the Founding Fathers have suggested, we need a  modern-day music licensing system, and that is what the MMA will  accomplish. I am thankful that it has brought together not just  stakeholders and industry, but it has brought together a Jerry Nadler  and a Chairman Goodlatte, a Darrell Issa and a Joe Crowley. It has  brought together a conservative Republican from Georgia and a  progressive Democrat from the people's republic of Brooklyn.   Music is a unifying force. It has the power to bring us together. We  should have the power to modernize our system on behalf of these  brilliant creators.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor that, on Tuesday, May 1,  the communities of south Brooklyn, on the corner of Brighton Beach and  Coney Island Avenues, will be co-named for Valeriy ``Larry'' Savinkin,  a dedicated and well-respected community leader, who passed away last  year.   Larry was my congressional field representative who served the  residents of the Eighth Congressional District with great distinction.   His success and impact on the neighborhoods of southern Brooklyn and  Queens were not limited to his work in the Eighth Congressional  District office. For over 20 years, he was involved in several  prominent organizations, including the September 11 Family Group, the  Holocaust Memorial Committee, and the Odessa Community of New York.   Larry had a magnetic personality and cared about his community  immensely.   I had the privilege of knowing and working with him for several  years. I look forward to standing on Valeriy ``Larry'' Savinkin Street  with New York City Council Members Mark Treyger and Chaim Deutsch next  Tuesday to commemorate and acknowledge this outstanding individual.                            ____________________
