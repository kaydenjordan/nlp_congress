 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  reckless and fiscally irresponsible bill that is going to add $2.3  trillion to our national debt.   There is a reason why airports, universities, the Fraternal Order of  Police, home builders, and veterans groups are opposed to this bill. It  is because it will increase taxes on tens of millions of middle class  families. That is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.   One of the most heartless provisions would make it harder for middle  class families to rebuild after disaster. When you vote today, you are  telling the survivors of the California fires that you don't care about  them or about the middle class families in your district who one day  may face a tornado or a hurricane--all to save a few dollars so that we  can give a tax break to corporations.    We have a chance today to reject this bill, to come together, hold  hearings, and hear from experts--something that wasn't done when the  Republicans wrote this bill.   We can take ideas from both side of the aisle and write a tax bill  that helps middle class working families. Let's reject this bill and  work on real tax reform that will not raise taxes on the middle class  and won't add $2.3 trillion--that is with a T--to our national debt.
