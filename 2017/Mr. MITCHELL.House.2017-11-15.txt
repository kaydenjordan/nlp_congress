 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4174, the  Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017.   I am pleased to see the bill's sponsors and the Speaker move forward  with the reforms proposed by the Commission on Evidence-Based  Policymaking.   H.R. 4174 aims to create and use technology to assess and solve  problems; in other words, to make sure tools exist to gauge whether  programs work to best serve the American people. It is about utilizing  the data we already have to find out what works, what doesn't work, and  what could work for some changes.   The bill requires agencies to develop evidence-building plans, key  outcomes and return investment for the money the taxpayers pay, and  creates the position of a chief evaluation officer. Imagine that, we  have to actually create a position to evaluate because we  [[Page H9291]]  aren't doing it effectively now. It establishes an advisory committee  to study the Commission's recommendation that Congress create a  National Secure Data Service. It includes the OPEN Government Data Act,  which ensures that government aggregate data is available to consumers  in a usable format.   As my colleague said on the other side of the aisle, to make the data  malleable, to make the data open format so that, in fact, people can  assess not just in government agencies, but out in the public what the  data is saying about the programs that they pay for that we fund.   Finally, the bill also creates procedures to share that data across  Federal agencies and to require protection of individual data that  makes up all that aggregate data.   All of these provisions are critical to setting our government on a  path toward better serving the people in this country. Washington can  no longer assess quality based on how much money we dump into programs,  how many people we enroll--outcomes that don't tell us whether or not  they are succeeding. This can only be done with quality, accessible  data.   By allowing key data to be connected and reported, we can build  evidence to determine what does and doesn't work. More importantly, the  American people can see the evidence of what does and doesn't work  rather than just bureaucrats in Washington.   I would also like to point out how the reforms are working here to  lay the foundation for government and Congress to create new policies  that apply this information in novel ways.   This act, in its call for transparent, efficient, and well-designed  data systems, dovetails with other efforts in Congress for transparency  and sharing data.   A bill I am working on, the College Transparency Act, would do just  that for student data and outcomes data from colleges and universities  to better enable students and families to make more informed decisions  on one of the most important part of their lives: what postsecondary  education they pursue and what the outcome will be.                                time  1500    This bill, and my bill, streamlines and updates higher education  information. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of all the data  we currently have and provide that to the taxpayers.   The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act and the College  Transparency Act both share a few critical goals of the Commission on  Evidence-Based Policymaking:   First is the protection of the privacy of individuals that may be  reflected in the data. That is the first priority.   Second is the recommendation that information be more readily shared  across agencies. Agencies actually will share what they already know  about programs.   Third is that agencies develop a strategy to share this data with the  public who pays for those programs.   These provisions are fundamental to responsibly and effectively  utilizing the data that the taxpayers pay for. The Foundations for  Evidence-Based Policymaking Act sets in motion these commonsense  policies that will increase the return on investment for the taxpayers  and the outcomes of our programs.   The compartmentalization of data the government already collects and  barriers that prevent the reasonable sharing of it represent a  significant missed opportunity for the government to provide value to  taxpayers.   It amazes me that we had to create a commission to tell us to share  this data. Taxpayers have already paid for it. Why aren't we already  using it?   Long term, these plans are essential. I urge my colleagues to support  the bill.
