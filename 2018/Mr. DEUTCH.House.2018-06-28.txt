 Mr. Speaker, in the 4\1/2\ months since 17 people were  killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, Florida, there have been 15 shootings at schools and colleges  around the country.   In the absence of congressional action, the only thing that has  stopped these school shootings is summer recess.   But summer recess won't stop the daily gun violence in communities  across the country. In the past 72 hours, 97 people were killed and 180  people were injured by gun violence.   And summer recess won't provide relief to the families who are still  grieving the loss of their children, their loved ones.   Earlier this month, four Stoneman Douglas seniors were honored with  degrees they earned but never received because they were murdered in  their school. Their parents and siblings walked onto that stage  instead. It shouldn't have been this way.   It is time for this House to act on gun violence. Bring up the  bipartisan bills on universal background checks, banning bump stocks,  gun violence restraining orders.   We cannot wait until the school bell rings again this fall. We have  to act now                            ____________________
