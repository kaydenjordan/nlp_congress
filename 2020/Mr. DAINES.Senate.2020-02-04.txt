 Madam President, I rise today in the very Chamber where  just three Presidential impeachment trials have been held over the  course of our Nation's history--President Johnson in 1868, President  Clinton in 1999, and now President Trump.   In fact, I sat at this desk the past 2 weeks listening to over 65  hours of trial proceedings, and during that time, we heard from 13  witnesses, and we viewed 193 video clips and 28,000-plus pages of  documentation. Senators, over a 16-hour period, asked over 180  questions. In the Senate, we took our solemn duty seriously.   If there is one thing to be remembered from this trial for  generations to come, it is this: Sadly, over the course of our  country's 244-year history, never has our Nation faced such a partisan  abuse of power. Never has the Senate been faced with Articles of  Impeachment that allege no crimes in an attempt to remove a duly  elected President of the United States from office. Never before have  we seen such a partisan Presidential impeachment process.   In 1974, when President Nixon faced impeachment--Nixon, a  Republican--177 House Republicans joined Democrats in support of the  impeachment inquiry. During President Clinton's impeachment--a  Democrat--31 Democrats joined House Republicans. But with President  Trump, there were zero. Not one Republican supported it. In fact, there  were some Democrats who opposed it. So, to be clear, there was actually  bipartisan opposition.   This impeachment is an unprecedented, purely partisan threat to the  Constitution. Our Founding Fathers, the Framers of our great  Constitution, understood what the power of impeachment meant when they  gave it to Congress after great deliberation.   Alexander Hamilton and James Madison feared--they feared-- congressional abuse of power and legislative tyranny as they debated  whether to include the power of impeachment in the Constitution because  the Founders knew the removal of a President from office amounted to a  political death sentence.   In Federalist 65, Hamilton warns that the House could be  ``intemperate,'' was the word he used, and abuse their majority. He  proclaimed that the Senate would be--and I use his words--``unawed and  uninfluenced,'' the ``independent'' institution to determine whether a  House impeachment was warranted.   The Founders had the wisdom to establish a two-thirds Senate vote  threshold to help ensure that removal could not be achieved by mere  partisan politics. The Founders established that the thermonuclear  option of impeachment must be bipartisan to safeguard not just the  President from unwarranted removal but, importantly, to protect the  will of the American people who elected the President in the first  place.   Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and House Democrats have  done exactly what the Founding Fathers feared. They have ignored what  House manager and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry  Nadler, himself correctly observed during the 1998 Clinton impeachment  when he stated:         There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an       impeachment substantially supported by one of our major       political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an       impeachment would lack legitimacy.    That was Jerry Nadler in 1998.   Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives discarded  Nadler's very wise words, and they stubbornly defied historical  precedent by rushing these Articles of Impeachment, driven by a  Christmas deadline, on a purely partisan vote and sending it to the  Senate.   The Democrats' decision was a mistake, and it has only further  divided our Nation at a time when we need to be working together. It  was wrong, and it has damaged our country. We now need to fear for  future Presidents, Democrats or Republicans, who will hold the oath of  office in this newly hyperpartisan era.   Importantly, for the first time in our Nation's history, the Articles  of Presidential Impeachment passed by Nancy Pelosi's House accuse  President Trump of no crimes, let alone demonstrate the President's  actions warranted removal from office.   This partisan and weak case from the House managers proves what this  impeachment has always been about--it is about purely partisan  politics. This impeachment has been nothing more than an attempt to  overturn the 2016 Presidential election and to severely impact the 2020  election.   By the way, if we were to convict the President of either one of  these articles, one or both, he literally would be removed not only  from office but from the 2020 ballot.   Speaking of the 2020 ballot, the 2020 election is already underway.  Just yesterday, Americans cast their votes in Iowa for President of the  United States. In fact, last Friday, Montanans submitted signatures and  filed the paperwork to place President Trump on the Montana ballot for  the 2020 election.   Sadly, it is no surprise that we are in this situation today. You  see, the Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching President Trump  since before he was even sworn into office. They could not accept the  fact that Donald Trump won the 2016 election.   On December 15, 2016, just 5 weeks following the 2016 Presidential  election, there was a headline from Vanity Fair, and I quote it:  ``Democrats are Paving the Way to Impeach Donald Trump.''   On January 20--now, when I think of January 20, 2017, I think about  the day the President was inaugurated, which it was--the Washington  Post headline read ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has  begun.'' This article was posted 19 minutes--just 19 minutes--after  President Trump was sworn into office.   It gets worse. Ten days later, on January 30, 2017, the attorney for  the whistleblower who was talked about during the trial--the  whistleblower's attorney, 10 days after President Trump was inaugurated  back in 2017, said this in a tweet: ``Coup has started. First of many  steps. Rebellion. Impeachment will follow immediately.'' That was the  attorney for the whistleblower who really started this entire  impeachment process.   We have even seen some House Democrats publicly state that the only  way to beat President Trump in the next election is to impeach him.   Our Founding Fathers would be grieved by the careless use of this  most powerful tool against the Presidency. Impeachment is not a tool to  overturn  [[Page S836]]  the results of a past election. It is not a tool to change the outcome  of an upcoming election.   You see, in America, the power of our government doesn't come from  100 Senators in this body or a handful of lawmakers; our power is  derived from the people whom we serve. This grand American experiment  of our democratic Republic is built upon the idea of a government of,  by, and for the people.   Montanans elected me to represent them in the U.S. Senate, to be  their voice on this floor and in Washington, DC. Montanans  overwhelmingly oppose this impeachment. Montanans stand with President  Trump. In fact, President Trump won Montana by over 20 points in the  2016 election. Supporting this impeachment means ignoring the voices of  Montanans who voted for President Trump in the last election, and it  means silencing Montanans who plan to vote for President Trump in the  2020 election.   Keep in mind--never before has the U.S. Senate ever removed a  President from office, and it is not going to happen now.   I am voting to acquit President Donald J. Trump.   For the good of our country, let it be seared in our minds  forevermore: Impeachment must never ever again be used as a partisan  weapon.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fully  understand the magnitude of what this would mean for our country. This  is the first purely partisan impeachment in our Nation's history, and  it must be our last. It should be up to the American people to decide  who their next President is, not the U.S. Senate.   The answer is an election, not impeachment.   I yield the floor.
