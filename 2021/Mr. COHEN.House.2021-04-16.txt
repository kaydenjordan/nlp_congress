 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Courtney for yielding to  me, and I appreciate him for bringing this bill. He has a long history  of now 15 years of looking out for workers, laborers, and their fair  place in our country, and I thank him for that.   Over the past 13 months, our healthcare and social service workers  have gone over and beyond in their efforts to keep us healthy and free  during this COVID-19 pandemic. This bill, the Workplace Violence  Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, is one way  Congress can help keep them healthy and look out for their safety.   This amendment is a simple one. It simply says that Alzheimer's and  memory care facilities are added to the type of residential treatment  facilities covered by this bill. Alzheimer's and memory care facilities  are sometimes overlooked in the definition and should not be.   With our aging population, Alzheimer's and dementia is growing in  prevalence. In the United States, more than 5.5 million people now are  living with Alzheimer's. The number is expected to increase to 14  million people by 2060. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death  in our country, but third among senior citizens, behind only cancer and  heart disease. This increase in Alzheimer's diagnoses means more  healthcare workers and social workers will be needed to help patients  and their families to try to manage this disease and cope with the  effects.   This bill doesn't only help the workers, but it helps the victims of  these diseases that put them in the institutions by making it more  likely that people will want to go into those professions and not fear  for their health.   As anyone who has or had a loved one with Alzheimer's knows that  Alzheimer's patients can become aggressive for many reasons. Sometimes  it is just the inability to grasp a subject or to remember something or  they are hungry or whatever, and they get violent.                                time  1030    That is the reason oftentimes they are put into long-term facilities  caring for Alzheimer's patients, and that is going to continue to grow.  They have these outbursts of aggression. Healthcare professionals and  social service workers need to be protected similar to their colleagues  that work in residential treatment facilities.   I appreciate your consideration. I appreciate this amendment being  put in the en bloc. Hopefully, we pass it and pass the bill and we look  out for healthcare workers and the people who are the beneficiaries of  their work. And they will need more and more service providers as the  years go on.
