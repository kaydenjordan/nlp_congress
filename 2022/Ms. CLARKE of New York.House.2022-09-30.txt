 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of  the 150th anniversary of the Lenox Road Baptist Church and their 150  years of selfless service as a spiritual home to the people of Central  Brooklyn and all those who were blessed to cross their threshold in  fellowship with one another.   It was a century-and-a-half ago, in the heart of Flatbush, that the  Lenox Road Baptist Church was established as a beacon of love, light,  and Christian discipleship.   Over these many years, this sacred community of faith never failed to  open its doors to any and all who were eager to hear and follow the  teachings of Jesus Christ.   For 150 years, those doors remained open to those in need of  spiritual guidance, communion of saints, and warm embrace.   On this sacred anniversary, under the leadership of Pastor  Kirkpatrick Cohall and his team, may the Lenox  [[Page H8357]]  Road Baptist Church continue to grow in its sacred mission of  magnifying God's word, blessing His holy name, uplifting the people in  service to all humanity, and honoring their incomparable legacy.                            ____________________
