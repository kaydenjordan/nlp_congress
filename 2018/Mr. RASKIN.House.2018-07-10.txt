 Mr. Speaker, I represent the Eighth Congressional  District in Maryland, and I want to give you a tale of two of my  constituents.   One is Merrick Garland of Bethesda, the chief judge of the D.C. Court  of Appeals, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in March of 2016. A  celebrated judge who had more judicial experience under his belt than  anyone ever nominated to the Supreme Court before, a graduate of  Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Judge Garland was often  described as the most qualified person ever nominated to the Court.   But Senator McConnell and the GOP in the Senate vowed they would have  no hearings, no action, and no vote on his nomination because there was  an election coming up in 9 months and the people should be heard. This  was unprecedented, but, fair enough, if that is the new standard.   Now, I have another constituent, Brett Kavanaugh of Chevy Chase, who  serves on the exact same court as Judge Garland does and who has been  nominated to the Supreme Court only 4 months before a national  election. He is a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School. But the  Senate now says that they are going to speed through hearings and a  vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   Why? Is he better qualified?   Not even Judge Kavanaugh would say that.   Why is it?   We have one-party control of the House, the Senate, the White House,  and the Supreme Court. This is nothing but a power play here in  Washington. They are doing it simply because they can do it, and it is  wrong.   We should have one standard that governs nominations from both  parties.                            ____________________
