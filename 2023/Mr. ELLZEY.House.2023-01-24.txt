 Mr. Speaker, today, I come before the House of  Representatives to honor the legacy of Captain Johnathan Benton.  Captain Benton tragically lost his life on January 16, 2023, in a small  plane crash.   Johnathan was a man of service. He served our country faithfully for  over 25 years in the Air Force. During that time, he was a command  pilot with over 4,000 hours in the C-130 and KC-135. He was also an  instructor and evaluator pilot.   He spent over 750 days deployed in support of conflicts in Bosnia,  Afghanistan, and Iraq. He eventually retired as a lieutenant colonel in  the U.S. Air Force's Air National Guard for the State of Oklahoma.   After his time in the military, Johnathan served as the Government  Affairs Committee chairman for CAPA as well as the Allied Pilots  Association.   Johnathan never stopped serving our country. Through his role as  chairman for CAPA and APA, he continued to advocate on behalf of  Americans.   To his wife, Bridget, and two children, Nathan and Ashlynn Marie, I  am truly sorry. Your husband and father was a great man. He had a great  big heart and loved you all dearly. What he gave our country cannot be  summed up in a 1-minute speech, but the legacy he leaves and the good  works he has done will last forever.                            ____________________
