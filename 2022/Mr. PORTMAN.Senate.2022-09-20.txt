 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life  and service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who was laid to rest in  Windsor Castle just yesterday.   Queen Elizabeth conducted herself with dignity and grace and  represented the best of the United Kingdom to the world. She was  unwavering in her support for the United States, and the American  people reciprocated with their admiration and respect for her.   My sympathies to the royal family and to the people of Great Britain.  We treasure our unique relationship and America stands with you once  again as we mourn your loss.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, I am here on the floor of the Senate for the 23rd week  in a row to bring to the attention of the Senate, to my constituents,  and to the American people the latest news of Russia's illegal,  unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine.   I will talk about the disturbing news from Ukraine, about more  Russian war crimes, and I will discuss the upcoming vote on the  supplemental spending bill for the effort in Ukraine and why it is so  important right now to continue to support Ukraine as it makes progress  in pushing back against Russia's war of aggression.   Last week, I spoke about Ukraine's stunning advances up here in the  north around Kharkiv. After distracting the Russians with a  counteroffensive here in the south near Kherson, the Ukrainian Army  launched a surprise counteroffensive in the north and punched through  the Russian lines. In just a matter of days--as you see in the light  blue part of the map here, in just a matter of days, the Ukrainian Army  was able to liberate roughly 300 settlements across 3,000 square miles  and liberate over 150,000 Ukrainians from Russian occupation. They also  managed to capture hundreds of pieces of Russian military equipment and  vehicles and ammunition. So now, instead of being used to kill and  subjugate innocent Ukrainian citizens, these vehicles, the equipment,  and the munitions can be used by Ukrainian forces to liberate their  fellow citizens from Russian tyranny. There were stories of Russian  soldiers abandoning their equipment and stealing Ukrainian cars to make  their escape--even stealing motorbikes and bicycles.   Last Wednesday, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy visited a town in this  area. The town is called Izium. Izium is located right here on the map.  It is a very strategic town for the Russians. Just 4 days before he  stepped foot there, this town was under Russian occupation, and even  when he visited, the frontline was only about 6 miles away.   Izium had been used as an important logistics hub from which the  Russians attacked south and east into the Donbas region--down into this  area. This was supposed to be the northern part of the pincer that  Russia would use to trap Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. The Ukrainian  forces who were here had to deal with this area that would be used as a  station ground to build a cut-off to Ukrainian troops. Instead, it is  now under Ukrainian control.   There were reportedly 10,000 Russian soldiers in this town of Izium,  and most thought it would be months before Ukraine would recapture it.  But after just a couple of days of a lightning strike, this town, which  had been held by the Russians for 6 months, is now free, its Russian  occupiers on the run.   Unfortunately, what the occupiers left behind was not just military  equipment, but clear evidence of Russian atrocities. Ukrainian  officials say multiple graves have been found near the city's cemetery.  President Zelenskyy has said it contained the bodies of civilians-- civilian adults, civilian children--as well as Ukrainian soldiers  showing signs of violent deaths including evidence of torture.   Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief prosecutor of the Kharkiv region, has  confirmed that at least 445 graves were at one site in this town. Here  is a photo of some of the corpses that had been discovered.   Some corpses had their hands tied behind their backs. Others had  ropes around their necks. Some victims are still being identified, but  as an example, investigators have confirmed that among the dead are the  entire Stolpakov family--Elena, her husband Dmitry, 6-year-old Olesya,  8-year-old Sasha, and Elena's parents. They were killed by a Russian  air strike on their home in this region. Again, another target--a  civilian target of Russian missiles.   Nearly 400 civilian graves in Izium were found near a previous  graveyard; but near there, they also found 17 graves of Ukrainian  soldiers. Their hands were all tied, and they appeared to be shot at  close range. They were in a single mass grave, bodies piled upon one  another.   They were executed. So those killed in Izium were men, women,  children, soldiers, and noncombatants alike--more victims of Russia's  brutal and unprovoked war. CNN described the scene this way:         Even the heavy rainfall couldn't erase the smell of death       in pine forests in Izium.    President Zelenskyy described it as ``cruelty and terrorism.''  Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova said  yesterday that the scene was one of ``torture, rapes, killings, and war  crimes of a massive proportion.'' It is indeed inhumane and genocide,  but it is not the first time we have seen evidence of Russia committing  such horrible atrocities.   A commander in the National Guard announced that his team is also  hunting for additional graves reportedly of people who were abused,  victims who were abused, at a detention center in Kozacha Lopan, north  of Kharkiv. It is this area up here. Certainly, we will learn about  many more graves and many more atrocities in this area as we begin to  discover more and more of these war crimes being committed by the  Russians.   Over the weekend, President Zelenskyy also said that Ukrainian forces  had found 10 makeshift torture chambers throughout the liberated  territories in that Kharkiv region. According to him, some of these  rooms had tools for Russian soldiers to conduct electric torture on  innocent Ukrainians. This photo is from inside one of these cellars-- one of these makeshift torture chambers--that were found in the Kharkiv  region. Here you can see where a prisoner actually scratched the Lord's  Prayer on the wall of the torture chamber.   The liberating soldiers are also recovering bodies on the  battlefield, which is where they are aligned too often in farm fields  or woods, just left to rot in the fields and the woods. This is what  Russia has done to Ukraine. This is not a one-off event.   When Senator Klobuchar and I were in Ukraine 3 weeks ago, we visited  Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, and we saw the spot where Russian soldiers had  dug a mass grave for dozens of innocent civilians they had murdered  during their occupation. Sadly, the murder, the torture, and the rape  discovered in Bucha was not unique. These horrific events that happen  behind Russian lines often aren't known to the world until that area is  liberated by Ukrainian forces. One has to wonder what other Russian  horrors are currently occurring in occupied areas that we will witness  when Ukraine finally liberates the rest of its territory.   This is the grim reality of Russia's war. President Putin claims that  his  [[Page S4846]]  war is about liberating Ukrainians and reuniting them with the  Ukrainian ``brothers and sisters,'' but this photo is not what brothers  and sisters do to each other. This is not a war of freedom or a war of  liberation. This is a war of conquest and genocide. And over the  weekend, we also got a glimpse of what happens to the Ukrainian  children who have lost their parents in this war and fall into Russia's  hands.   Russia's Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights, who by the  way has been sanctioned by the United States, recently stated that  Russian authorities are placing 125 Ukrainian orphans with Russian  families. Of course, the natural solution here would be to put these  children in the care of their extended family members in Ukraine, allow  them to stay in their country, but that is not their objective.  Russia's goal isn't to provide a better future for these children.  Their goal is to erase their Ukrainian identity and turn them into  Russians. Under the rules laid down by the United Nations, ``forcibly  transferring children of one group to another group'' constitutes  genocide. Another example.   Frustrated by Ukrainian gains in the northeast and in the south that  we have seen on these maps, Russians have begun bombing civilian  infrastructure at increased rates, like powerplants and dams,  threatening the livelihoods of millions of innocent Ukrainians.  Unfortunately, we have to expect more missiles being fired into Ukraine  to terrorize civilians.   Just this weekend, a Russian missile struck about 300 yards away from  a nuclear powerplant in southern Ukraine, threatening a nuclear  disaster. Now this was not the Zaporizhia plant that we have talked  about a lot on this floor. This is another powerplant. The Zaporizhia  plant, as you know, is the largest nuclear powerplant in all of Europe.  It provides 20 percent of electricity--or did--to the country of  Ukraine. That is a plant that the Russians are using as a shield, much  as they have used energy as a weapon, including in Europe, cutting off  energy unless Europe agrees to stop the necessary sanctions. They have  used food as a weapon, bombing grain bins in the Odesa region, keeping  food from going to starving people in Africa. Now they are actually  using nuclear powerplants as weapons in this war. It is all reckless;  it is all dangerous, but this risks a catastrophe by creating a  military zone around a nuclear powerplant and firing on Ukrainian  forces from there and actually exploding parts of the plant that  connect to Ukraine. This is incredibly dangerous and risks something  like the tragedy we had at Chernobyl.    So all of this is precisely why we need to continue to give Ukraine  the help it so desperately needs. Vladimir Putin will continue his  reign of terror against the neighbor that just wants to live in peace,  unless he knows that there are consequences. He is betting that he can  use terror to intimidate Ukraine and its allies into surrendering.   Let me be clear, I want this brutal war to end as much as anyone else  in this Chamber, but the responsible way to end this war is not to stop  providing our assistance to our allies and watch as Ukraine slowly  falls to Russian domination. The right way to end this war is to  actually win it, to continue to provide Ukraine the weapons it needs to  keep advancing and liberating territory, like it did over these past  few weeks. For the sake of global freedom, Ukraine must be allowed to  end this war on its own terms, not Russia's.   That is why, when this Chamber votes on the continuing resolution to  keep government open next week, I urge my colleagues to also support  the expected supplemental request for additional Ukraine funding. Most  important to me, frankly, is the military support, including needed  ammunition for the weapons they already have and including refilling  our own stockpiles of military weapons and ammunition. This is one way  we can show Vladimir Putin that we will not stand for his war crimes.  The West and our allies all need to recognize that these Russian  atrocities will not stop until there are more victories on the  battlefield and until sanctions are more effective at cutting off  funding to Russia's war machine. The world is watching, and if  President Putin's military is not held accountable for these  atrocities, it sends a signal to other rogue leaders that they will be  able to get away with the same types of war crimes.   As Congress considers this latest request for support, I hope my  colleagues will think about four things.   One, the mass graves I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. We  should not turn a blind eye to the indiscriminate violence Russia has  wrought on Ukraine. Vladimir Putin will continue his reign of terror  against the neighbor that just wants to live in peace unless he knows,  again, that there will be consequences. As President Zelenskyy said,  ``Russia leaves death everywhere and must pay for it.''   Second, despite these atrocities, Ukraine is turning the tide of the  war, in large measure, because of our help. It is working. This map, to  me, is very interesting because it shows here on February 24, after the  invasion of Ukraine on that date, how much territory that the Russians  controlled, not just the parts that they had already controlled, down  here in Crimea, here in Luhansk and Donetsk. But look at all the  territory that they controlled at that time, including right up to the  city of Kyiv. This is where the famous battle occurred at the airfield  outside of Kyiv where they had planned to bring in heavy weapons and  more military and topple the government in the capital of Kyiv. But,  look, all this in red, all of this in red; and today here we are. So we  have made progress. The Russians have come along the Donbas area. And  now, more recently, of course, we have made additional progress, here  and here, to push the Russians back. This would not have happened  without the support of this body. And we must think about that as we  look at this additional request for funding. We are making a  difference. Specifically, thanks to this Congress, these long-range  missiles called HIMARS have been extremely effective in enabling  Ukraine to be able to strike behind enemy lines and disrupt Russia in  ways no one thought possible. Before the Russians were sitting back and  firing on Ukrainian positions and Ukrainians couldn't respond because  they couldn't reach the Russian guns. They were firing with impunity,  killing civilians, killing Ukrainian soldiers. Now, with these new  weapons, these HIMARS, these longer range missiles coming from the  United States, coming from the UK, coming from Germany, Ukrainians are  able to hold their own and more, as we see with their advances in the  south and in the northeast.   We need to keep it up, particularly at a time when Russia is getting  help from its own partners. As our Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, pointed out, Iran is equipping the Russian military with  armed drones like the ones that they used against American forces in  Syria and Iraq. Additionally, there are reports that North Korea has  supplied Russia with artillery shells.   Third, I would ask my colleagues to remember this is not just about  Ukraine. We have got to remember that Vladimir Putin has said that  ``the borders of Russia never end.''   Earlier this summer, President Putin said he views Ukraine as  basically just the first step toward recreating the Russian empire. His  advisers have made similar statements about their intent with regard to  this war. It is not just about Ukraine.   What the United States does matters. What we do in defense of global  freedom not only shows the world we will stand up for Ukraine against a  rogue authoritarian attacking an ally, but our actions show our  adversaries that we are ready to defend democracy around the world. And  it is not just the United States providing this military support, just  remember that. Forty-nine other countries are contributing, in one way  or another, weapons, ammunition, training, and so on. And with regard  to economic support, more countries than 50 are providing help to  Ukraine.   Fourth, I ask my colleagues to remember that there are important  guardrails to ensure this assistance from the U.S. taxpayers is very  well accounted for, and there should be. While in Poland recently,  Senator Klobuchar and I met with the 101st Airborne to discuss their  unprecedented end-use monitoring of our military equipment that goes  into Ukraine. This has  [[Page S4847]]  ramped up even further with the addition of our Embassy staff on the  ground in Kyiv, which we also heard about when we were there, to ensure  there is no diversion of the military assistance that we are providing.  Again, this is an unprecedented level of accountability, and it is  necessary. Transparency is absolutely needed and promised by the  Ukrainians. I will say that from President Zelenskyy to members of his  government, to members of Parliament we met with, everyone said the  same thing; they too want total transparency and accountability. It is  very important to them. Just as they are continuing their reforms  against corruption even in the face of this war, they want transparency  with regard to all the aid. They have an accounting firm in Ukraine  that is following the budgetary funding that goes from this place, this  Congress, to Ukraine as well. And they have a need and an interest in  transparency themselves.    With regard to the end game in Ukraine--and some have asked me about  here on this floor--I believe Ukraine's Ambassador to the United  States, Oksana Markarova, said it well:         Ukraine will not rest until all our country is free, all       our people are back and Russia is brought to justice.    As Russia's military suffers setbacks in Ukraine, that is actually  good news for the freedom-loving countries of the world. For decades,  Russia has used its military to threaten and coerce its neighbors.  Think of Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year and back in 2014 when  they invaded Crimea and the Donbas. Russia, under its current  government, is a threat to all of its neighbors. Think about its  invasion in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing occupation of parts of  Moldova, just to name a couple.   As Russia's military is weakened, Europe and the United States are  made safer. So our support matters. Global support matters. I believe  President Putin responds to strength, and weakness on our part would  only invite more aggression. Helping Ukraine is just one way to show  our strength and to show our resolve as a country and as an alliance. I  noted last week that we are finally seeing the fruits of our labor when  you look at the progress that has been made. The support now is more  important than ever. Three thousand--three thousand square miles of  territory has been liberated just in the past few weeks.   This is the battle of our generation. This is the fight between  authoritarianism and democracy on the world stage--the fight between  evil and good. Freedom is at stake. Ukrainians are fighting for that.  They are fighting for democracy, for the right to live free, for the  right to chart their own course; and, as we have seen, they will fight  like hell for it. We see this every single day in their courage and  their resolve. They are fighting for their family. They are fighting  for their homeland. They are fighting for their freedom.   When Senator Klobuchar and I met with President Zelenskyy last month,  he started and ended our discussion with expressing gratitude to the  American people for their willingness to stand with Ukraine. He spoke  about Russia's war on his country as our joint battle as all freedom- loving countries strive toward our joint victory. Ukraine is the shield  of democracy. It is bearing the full brunt of the aggression that  Russia has threatened against Europe for years and is still standing  strong.   It is in our interest that Russia's military aggression ends here.  The sword of Russian imperialism must be broken in Ukraine by  Ukrainians, and the United States and our allies need to continue to  provide those brave Ukrainians with the tools they need to be  successful.   I yield the floor.
