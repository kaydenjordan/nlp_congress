 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in order to revise  and extend their remarks.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I also rise to  address the self-inflicted disaster occurring at our southern border.  I, along with nine other Republicans in the House Oversight and Reform  Committee, visited the border last week to see for ourselves the  national security and humanitarian disaster that is wreaking havoc on  our Nation.   When our Border Patrol agents are pulled from their posts to deal  with the swarms of children at processing facilities, the remote border  is left wide-open for the really bad folks to stroll right in. These  aren't people whom we see on television wearing Biden T-shirts, looking  for the nearest Border Patrol agent so they can surrender to them.  These are folks in full camouflage, ski masks, and usually armed, often  with automatic weapons.   These intruders who breach the remote parts of the border illegally  are referred to as get-aways. Because our agents are outnumbered,  usually all they can do is simply document these groups as they pass on  by. The notation for the records is simply 20 plus, even though there  are often 40, 60, or even 80 or more people.   In January and February alone, there were over 61,000 reported get- aways. That is a staggering amount, but because the 20-plus  documentation grossly underestimates the actual figures, agents told us  the real number for the first 2 months of this year was probably closer  to 120,000.   Left unchecked, we are looking at 750,000 get-aways breaking into our  country this year alone. Again, these are not asylum seekers  surrendering at the border. They are dangerous criminals, drug  smugglers, human traffickers, and terrorists who are willing to do  anything to get into America and not be caught. Once they make it to  Interstate 10, just a few miles north of the border, they can have easy  access to any place in the country.   This isn't a border State problem. It is an unfolding national  disaster of unprecedented scope that must be addressed for the security  of our country. Yet the Biden administration and my colleagues across  the aisle refuse to even acknowledge the problem. So far, neither the  President nor Vice President have bothered to visit the border.   We can stop this manufactured crisis.   First, we need to complete the border wall. We have construction  materials laying idle in the desert. President Biden used to think the  border wall was a good idea. It is time he stops cowing to the radical  elements within his own party and do what he knows is right. The  materials are there and the contracts to complete the work are in  place, just sitting there. Just finish the job.   Second, end the practice of catch and release and re-implement the  Migrant Protection Protocols that proved so successful in reducing the  number of border incursions. Officers shared with us that only 10 to 12  percent of people who come here seeking asylum have legitimate cases.  The rest are sent back. By requiring them to remain in Mexico while  their asylum requests are adjudicated, roughly 90 percent who know  their cases are bogus won't risk the journey, and those who do have  legitimate causes to seek asylum will have it granted more  expeditiously. That would be the humane course of action.    We are, indeed, a nation of immigrants. Many industries in my home  State of Florida, including agriculture, hospitality, and construction,  depend on a steady flow of legal immigrants in order to function. But  for America to remain the world's brightest beacon of hope, we must  acknowledge that a fundamental part of what makes it so attractive is  our adherence to the rule of law.   Honest, law-abiding citizens like the Johnsons, the Coopers, and  others we met at the border asked us to tell their story. They are not  confident, though, that we will. They also want our government to know  that they aren't looking for special consideration. These are tough  people who simply want the opportunity to live and work their land in  peace and security without having to live in fear. They want to know  that we will not forget about them. We promised to share their story.  We must not let them down.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________                   Scott Franklin of Florida, Mr. Norman, Ms. Mace, Mr.               Sessions, and Ms. Herrell):        H.R. 2783.
