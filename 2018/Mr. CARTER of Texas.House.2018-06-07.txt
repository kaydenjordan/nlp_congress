 Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here as the  newly appointed chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   I arrived post-midstream and I have a lot to learn. But I have served  on this subcommittee before and I have got a great base to start with.  Charlie Dent and Debbie Wasserman Schultz developed such a good bill  that it was approved by a 47-0 vote in the full committee.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill provides  generously for our servicemembers, our veterans, their families, and  our monuments and cemeteries. Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member  Lowey have provided strong support for this bill. I appreciate their  leadership, as well as the participation of all of the members of the  subcommittee, and I especially want to thank my ranking member, Ms.  Wasserman Schultz.   The bill contains $96.9 billion in budget authority, an increase of  $4.2 billion over last year's level. The funding recommendation  includes:   $11.3 billion for military construction, which is a $412 million, or  3.8 percent, increase over the fiscal year 2018 level. The bill  includes $10.3 billion in base funding and $921 million in overseas  contingency operations funding. The level is $131 million below the  request.   $85.3 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is an  increase of nearly $4 billion, or 4.8 percent over the FY18 level, and  the same as the budget request. Of the $85.3 billion provided for VA,  $71.2 billion is for medical care for 7 million veterans. We make  important investments in many VA programs, including: mental health  treatment and suicide prevention; development of the VA electronic  health record; prevention of opioid abuse; and disability claims  processing.   And $2 billion is provided as the second year of the budget deal  commitment for infrastructure funding for VA facilities.  [[Page H4901]]    This bill supports our troops with the facilities necessary to  maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the United States and  around the world.   In addition, the bill funds our veterans healthcare and benefits  systems to ensure that our promise to care for those who have  sacrificed in defense of our Nation is met as those men and women  return home.   This is a strong bill, and I urge everyone to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I will not oppose this amendment  because it does not require DOD to fund anything in particular.   I would like to point out that the FY 2019 budget submission for  Defense Appropriations included $442.9 million for demolition within  the facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization account,  double the FY 2018 level.   I would like to remind my colleagues that, while there may be a  particular interest behind the amendments, these do not direct funding  to a particular activity. Our bill does not even fund these activities.  For this reason, I will not oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  2315     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I will not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, we understand the gentleman's  concerns and will keep them in mind for the conference. We have  included report language on the topic in both the 2018 and 2019  reports.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, we understand the gentleman's  concerns. We will keep them in mind for conference. We will be  interested in learning more about this problem that he identifies.   I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.   The Acting Chair. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for  5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman's concerns about  providing adequate funding to address veterans' mental health needs is  shared by every member of our committee. We are pleased that the bill  provides $8.6 million for mental health programs, including $196  million for suicide prevention outreach.   We will certainly try to maintain these substantial levels in  conference.   Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.   The Acting Chair. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for  5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, we understand the gentleman's  concerns, and we will keep in mind this concern during our conference.  I have heard from veterans in my district about the concerns, and, in  fact, sat down with some last weekend, and this was one of their number  one concerns.   So this has a health impact. These burn pits are something we really  need to get into, and we will have this in mind in conference.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the bill provides $1 million over  the President's budget request for the Adaptive Sports Grant, ASG,  program for equine-assisted therapy, as our 2018 bill did also.   We understand the gentleman's concern in further increasing this  funding and will keep it in mind during conference.   In my congressional district, we also have equine therapy, and I am  very familiar with it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Barr) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5895)  making appropriations for energy and water development and related  agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
