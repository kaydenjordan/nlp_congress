 Mr. President and chairman of the Banking Committee, I  appreciate the time and the recognition. As the chairman knows, I am a  member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a former chairman of the  African Subcommittee, and I have traveled to both of those continents  for many years. I have seen resource-rich and poverty-poor countries  where they have a natural resource investment and wealth, but they  never reinvest in their people.   I think transparency is important in seeing to it that the resources  they receive for selling those natural resources are made available to  their people so that the resources go to the benefit of the people and  not the government.   Are you also aware that I am not a big supporter of the Dodd-Frank  disclosure bill, but I also have concerns that simply vacating the rule  implementing the Lugar-Cardin amendment without providing for a  replacement would create a setback for U.S. leadership in anti- corruption efforts around the world?   Because of what we have done in transparency and anti-corruption,  countries like the United Kingdom, the EU, Norway, and Canada have  followed our lead, and I do not want to lose that. Therefore, I wish to  ask the chairman of the Banking Committee a couple of questions to ease  my fears about this question.   First, I would like to direct a couple of questions to the chairman.  It is my understanding that this joint resolution does not--underscore  not--repeal section 1504 of Dodd-Frank law; is that correct?    I thank the chairman for that answer.   I would like his commitment to work with me and other members of the  caucus who are concerned and who want to be assured that the SEC will  move forward with the implementation of this replacement provision as  soon as possible.    I thank the Chair.
