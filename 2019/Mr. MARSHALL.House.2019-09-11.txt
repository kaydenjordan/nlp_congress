 Madam Speaker, on this day nearly 20 years ago our  great Nation suffered a loss unlike any she has suffered before or  since. Almost 3,000 American citizens were killed on September 11,  2001, and thousands more have died or become seriously ill since from  their response that day, whether  [[Page H7602]]  at Ground Zero or in the Middle East. Men and women, young and old were  stolen from their families, their communities, and our country.   As she always has during our darkest hour, this country came together  in a courageous way. We were one people uniting to heal a terrible  wound. May we all strive today to soon find that same unity--now, not  just in times of tragedy. Americans and her people will be all the  better for it.   May God bless the memories of those who died on September 11, and may  God bless this great country.                Striving to Make Kansas a Better Place to Live     Madam Speaker, last week I completed my tour of all 105  counties in Kansas. I enjoyed meeting folks of all backgrounds and  learning about their passions, concerns and what they need their  representatives in Washington to do to deliver for Kansas.   From Dodge to Topeka, Pratt to Leavenworth, the message I heard from  Kansans is they want their way of live preserved. They want their  representatives to fight alongside President Trump, reduce Washington  red tape, and advocate for new and fair trade agreements so our farmers  can feed the world.   For the most part, Kansans just want a decent job with a good wage  and a fair shot at the American Dream. Aside from the safety and  security afforded to them, most would otherwise be happy to not have  Washington involved in our day-to-day lives.   Despite folks' disagreements on some issues, Kansans are a people who  largely agree on the importance of faith, community, and hard work.   After completing this tour of all 105 Kansas counties, I have a  greater appreciation for the challenges of Kansans of all walks of  life. Each conversation was an opportunity to hear an individual's  story about the burden of securing affordable healthcare for a loved  one, finding good workers to grow a small farm or business, finding a  home to raise their family in, and protecting and nurturing the  communities they love and cherish.   I don't have all the answers or quick fixes for our challenges, but I  will continue to strive to make Kansas a better place to live. Each day  I am blessed with the opportunity to represent Kansas in Congress. I  carry that message in my heart, that we are the breadbasket of the  world and home to some of the best, hardest working and most decent  people on Earth.               Americans Must Reject a Radical Socialist Agenda     Madam Speaker, last week a socialist senator seeking  higher office proposed increasing abortions across the world as a way  to slow population growth and combat climate change. Worse yet, he  directly stated that he wanted U.S. taxpayers to pay for these  abortions. As many Kansans are coming to understand, this is just one  of the many disgraceful and disturbing socialist agendas increasingly  embraced by my colleagues across the aisle.   There is no policy proposal at present which more represents the  Democrats' quest for total control over every aspect of our lives than  the Green New Deal. This deal is nothing more than a rebranding of  overwhelming government control under the guise of environmental  stewardship. Just ask its sponsor's former chief of staff who said,  ``It wasn't originally a climate thing at all. . . . we really think of  it as a how to change the entire economy thing.''    The Green New Deal demands we completely overhaul our energy and  transportation infrastructure, which would kill the jobs of millions of  Americans working in the oil, and gas industry, manufacturing, and  aviation industries, to name a few. The plan would crush Kansas beef  producers by placing a hefty tax on our farms with estimates costing  nearly $2,000 per cow. The Green New Deal would be the greatest  centralization of power in the hands of Washington elites in American  history.   But destroying America's means of energy and food production isn't  all this radical socialist agenda seeks to do; as we learned recently,  the new Democrat party's to-do list includes everything from banning  private health insurance to plastic straws nationwide, positions  numerous Democratic candidates for President have already endorsed.   Democrats want to dictate what you can drink, how you drink it, what  you can eat, and where you can work, and what healthcare you can have,  all while you are forced to pay for abortions overseas. And don't  forget about the proposed 90 percent tax rates on Americans either.   We must emphatically reject this radical socialist agenda and work  instead to implement innovative solutions to provide for greater  prosperity and equality for all. Our children and our grandchildren's  future and the future of Kansas and this great Nation depend upon it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank so much the gentleman, my friend  and fellow colleague from Kansas, for leading on this issue and giving  me the opportunity to speak about it.   Certainly, times are very tough in agriculture, the toughest I have  ever seen, the toughest, certainly, since the 1980s. The passage of  USMCA, the NAFTA 2.0, is the single greatest thing  [[Page H7662]]  Congress could do for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and  workers.   The President has delivered, and now it is time for Congress to  deliver. Delaying the implementation of this program hurts agriculture  across Kansas because the deal would enable Kansas producers to trade  more commodities by opening the Canadian market up for American dairy,  wheat, chicken, and eggs, some for the very first time.   Additionally, this agreement will grow our business with our very top  two customers, Mexico and Canada, meaning thousands of jobs and  hundreds of millions of dollars in increased exports for Kansans.   Finally, the unprecedented standards for agricultural biotechnology  will support 21st-century innovations in agriculture and lay the  groundwork for future agreements with other countries around the globe.   Some of the brightest thinkers in the world are in America, but these  innovators have been robbed of billions of dollars over the previous  decades due to intellectual property theft. USMCA can't be delayed any  longer, as new protections for intellectual property will drive  innovation and create even more jobs by strengthening protection of  patents, trademarks, and secrets.   President Trump's USMCA also levels the playing field for workers in  my State by expanding guarantees for the enforcement of labor  protections across North America. Future economic growth and jobs for  Kansas and America are increasingly dependent on expanding U.S. trade  and investment opportunities in the global marketplace. President Trump  has delivered this incredibly bipartisan deal, and it is long past time  for Congress to bring it up for a vote to usher in a new era in  American trade.   Mr. Speaker, it is now time for us to bring USMCA to the floor.
