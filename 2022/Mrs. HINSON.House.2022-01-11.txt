 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize retired Dubuque  Police Chief Mark Dalsing. He retired after 32 years of service to the  city of Dubuque, Iowa.   Chief Dalsing is an absolute pillar in the community of Dubuque  because of his devotion to protecting his community. He built a  phenomenal legacy of successfully incorporating community engagement  into law enforcement.   While serving as Dubuque's police chief, he instilled a passion for  public service into his team of officers, bringing community engagement  to the forefront of their work.   Chief Dalsing's years of service are a testament to the love that he  has for his fellow Iowans and the compassion he led with.   I wish Chief Mark Dalsing and his family all the best in this  exciting new chapter of life and thank him for his selfless service and  dedication to the city of Dubuque for the past three decades.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our amendment would ensure that students are no longer  kept out of the classroom and forced to learn from behind a screen. It  would ensure that parents are able to return to the workplace. It would  help combat the ongoing youth mental health crisis spurred by school  closures.   Madam Speaker, my bill, the Reopen Schools Act, would condition  Federal COVID grants to schools on those schools actually being open  and operating in the first place, which is what that money was intended  to do.   I am proud that my home State of Iowa--and I am thankful to our  Governor, Kim Reynolds--for ensuring that Iowa students could go back  to school. In Iowa, kids have been back in the classroom, where they  belong, for over a year. They get to socialize with their peers and  they get hands-on learning help from their teachers. They get to run  and jump at recess. They get to raise their hands to ask and answer  questions instead of clicking a button from behind a screen. They get  to write on white boards during their lessons.   Unfortunately, this is not the case in the rest of the country. So  many students are still trapped behind screens. And what about the  students who don't have regular computer and broadband internet access?  What about students in households without computers or even households  with only one computer where mom and dad are maybe trying to use it for  work.   Virtual learning means we are leaving behind our most vulnerable  students, our rural students, our students with additional learning  challenges, and even kids who have every virtual advantage are  struggling. Families are struggling. Working parents are challenged  like never before, and American kids are suffering and paying the price  for it.    As a mom, I have personally felt this pressure, and I know many of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle know what it is like to have kids  trying to learn at home while you are trying to work at the same time.  So this is not a partisan issue. This is about our kids. This is about  supporting working families. Kids need to be in school.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the  previous question so we can reopen schools and prevent taxpayer dollars  from keeping kids at home.
