 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great man, a  colleague, and my friend: Jamie Wise.   It was nearly 10 years ago that Jamie joined Team Montana. The  passionate Representative Rosa DeLauro had toughened him up and groomed  him for success in the world's most deliberative body. As a newly  elected Senator ranked 100 in seniority, one of the first decisions I  made was to hire Jamie.   Some may say it is tough to break into Team Montana. We are few but  proud, an independent but tight-knit family, a little unpolished, but  persistent and most often underestimated. Jamie fit right in.   With his sharp wit and dry sense of humor, he quickly became a  Montanan. Hailing from his adoptive hometown of Great Falls, it was a  natural fit for him to tackle my veterans, defense, and homeland  security portfolios. And tackle it he did.   He wrote my first bill that was signed into law to more fairly  reimburse veterans who are traveling to and from their doctors'  appointments. It may seem like a simple thing, but it has been life  changing for veterans all across this Nation who cannot afford a tank  of gas but are facing debilitating medical conditions and need to see  their doctor. This bill would set the stage for Jamie's long and  incredible career in my office.   Jamie's dedication to Montana has taken him down into the silo of an  intercontinental ballistic missile, from the embassy in Yemen, to the  Port of Wild Horse on the border of Canada. Needless to say, his  legislative chops are unmatched on the Hill. His ability to look 1 inch  ahead while also calculating the roadblocks 100 miles away is a skill  that can't be taught. It is instinctual.   Jamie worked hard, long hours and rose through the ranks from  legislative assistant to legislative director and ultimately chief of  staff. It was common to find Jamie sitting in his office into the wee  hours of the night plowing through appropriations bills, making sure  Montana got its fair shake. Those long hours produced real results for  families and small businesses across the State. You can see Jamie's  fingerprints on hundreds of letters, thousands of press releases, and  the careers of dozens of young, aspiring staffers.   James D. Wise has left his mark on this world, and I can't wait to  see what he takes on next.   So today, I wish to thank Jamie on behalf of this Nation, 1 million  Montanans, and one grateful Senator.                  STATE OF THE UNION ESSAY CONTEST FINALISTS
