 Mr. Speaker, this week I had the honor  of meeting with the Pennsylvania National Guard Association, which is  solely dedicated to more than 19,000 Guard members and more than 67,000  Guard veterans and their families.   The National Guard is an essential element of the United States  military. Founded in 1636 as a citizen force organized to protect  families and towns from hostile attacks, today's National Guard  soldiers hold civilian jobs or attend college while maintaining their  military training, always ready to defend the American way of life in  the event of an emergency.   The mission of the Pennsylvania National Guard Association is to  ensure the Pennsylvania National Guard is fully funded, manned,  equipped, and trained to perform their Federal and State missions. That  also includes ensuring that members and veterans have the benefits that  they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, the Pennsylvania National Guard mostly hails from the  Commonwealth, and they are prepared to serve the Nation at a moment's  notice. In fact, Pennsylvania Guard personnel provided extraordinary  support to areas affected by the disastrous 2018 hurricane season. They  offered aviation support, restored lines of communication, and lent a  helping hand to their fellow Americans in their time of need.   More than 1,000 Guard members assisted in domestic operations,  including snowstorms and floods. In 2018, Guard members were deployed  throughout the world in support of mobile operations. They also  participated in training events at home and abroad to enhance  readiness.   As part of its Federal mission, approximately 1,000 Pennsylvania  National Guard personnel deployed throughout the world in 2018 in  support of mobile operations, including Operation Spartan Shield,  Operation Freedom Sentinel, and missions in support of U.S. Air Force's  Central Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, and NATO.   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit members of the Guard's  28th Infantry Division over the Thanksgiving holiday. I led a codel  last November to Kuwait, where we met with members of the 28th Infantry  Division who were deployed in support of Operation Spartan Shield.   The servicemembers that we visited, while serving honorably overseas,  were also serving in one of the Army's most historic units. The 28th  Infantry Division is the oldest continuous serving division in the  United States Army. In 1918, it earned its nickname ``Iron Division,''  fighting during World War I, and 100 years later, the same division  continues to defend freedom and liberty around the world.   Since the attacks of 9/11, more than 35,000 Pennsylvania National  Guard members have deployed overseas. In fact, Pennsylvania's Fort  Indiantown Gap is the busiest Army National Guard training center in  the Nation.   The Pennsylvania National Guard is also home to the 56th Brigade  Combat Team, which is one of the Army's nine Stryker Brigade Combat  Teams. This is a team that my son Logan belonged to when he was in the  National Guard before he went to Active Duty. It was the only National  Guard Stryker brigade in the United States Army.   Mr. Speaker, the Pennsylvania National Guard continues to serve the  Commonwealth and the Nation with pride and distinction. I look forward  to its continued success. I thank all of our citizen soldiers, past and  present, for their service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  my bill, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. I recently introduced  this legislation with chairman of the House Agriculture Committee  Collin Peterson and Ranking Member Mike Conaway.   This bill would allow for whole milk, both flavored and non-flavored,  to be offered in our school cafeterias.   Mr. Speaker, milk was once a staple in the diet of our students, but  consumption in schools has dramatically decreased since the Healthy,  Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 was implemented and basically demonized  milk fat that we know today, based on science, is where all the  nutrition, let alone the flavor, is.   Milk is the number one source of nine essential nutrients in the diet  of many young Americans. We can provide the foundation for a solid,  healthy lunch in our schools that also tastes great and that children  will want to drink and is good for them. When students don't consume  milk, they are not getting nutrients, such as calcium, potassium, and  vitamin D. This bill offers more varieties to give kids the option of  consuming the milk they love.   I encourage my colleagues to support the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids  Act and put flavor back into school lunches.                            ____________________
