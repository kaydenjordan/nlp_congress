 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate  the centennial celebration of the Historic Westside School in Las  Vegas, NV. This  [[Page S4583]]  school holds a special place in the history of Las Vegas and is a  symbol of resilience, education, and strength in this community.   The Historic Westside School's story began in 1923 when it opened its  doors as the Las Vegas Grammar School No. 1, consisting of just two  rooms. Over the years, this unassuming structure played a significant  role in the history of Las Vegas, particularly in the city's Black  community.   Initially established to serve local Paiute children, the school's  purpose evolved as the Black American population in Las Vegas grew  substantially. With the opening of the Gunnery Range, known today as  Nellis Air Force Base, and the construction of the Hoover Dam, the  population of Las Vegas expanded dramatically. During this period, the  school primarily educated Black children, reflecting the changing  demographics of the city.   It is important to acknowledge the discrimination and persecution the  Black community suffered during this era. In a stark reminder of the  racial prejudice that stained our Nation, the city of Las Vegas forced  Black families to move to the Westside and refused to allow the renewal  of Black-owned business licenses unless they relocated. Despite this,  the Westside School became a symbol of hope and perseverance for the  Black community as it provided education and opportunity.   As the city of Las Vegas eventually moved towards desegregation, the  school was closed. However, in 1979, the significance of the Historic  Westside School was formally recognized when it was listed in the  National Register of Historic Places. This designation highlighted the  school's historical importance and its role in shaping the local  community and preserving the heritage of the Westside of Las Vegas.   In 2015, the city of Las Vegas, with the assistance of Federal funds,  embarked on a commendable effort to restore this historic landmark.  Today, the Historic Westside School has been transformed into a vibrant  community center, home to KCEP-FM and the Economic Opportunity Board,  and a hub for various charitable foundations. It is a testament to the  resilience of our community and the commitment to preserving our  history.   As we celebrate the centennial of the Historic Westside School, let  us reflect on the enduring legacy of this institution and its  importance in shaping the history of Las Vegas. It serves as a reminder  of the progress we have made in the fight for equality and the  importance of preserving our history, no matter how challenging the  chapters may be.   I commend the city of Las Vegas and the Historic Westside School  Alumni Association for their dedication to preserving the memory of  this historic school and for organizing the centennial celebration. It  truly is an opportunity for our community to come together, learn from  our past, and work toward a brighter future where equality and  opportunity are accessible to all.                            ____________________
