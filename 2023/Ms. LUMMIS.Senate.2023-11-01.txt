 Mr. President, on March 31, 2022, the Securities and  Exchange Commission--SEC--issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 121--SAB  121--which purported to address the accounting treatment of crypto  assets. The bulletin was not issued as a rule under the Administrative  Procedure Act--APA--and was not submitted to Congress as required by  the Congressional Review Act.   On August 2, 2022, I sent a letter to the Comptroller General  requesting a GAO legal decision regarding the applicability of the  Congressional Review Act to SAB 121. On October 31, 2023, GAO issued a  legal decision finding that SAB 121 was a rule under both the  Administrative Procedure Act and the Congressional Review Act and that  no exception applied.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the GAO legal decision  regarding SAB 121 be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Decision       Matter of: Securities and Exchange Commission--Applicability           of the Congressional Review Act to Staff Accounting           Bulletin No. 121.      File: B-334540.      Date: October 31, 2023.                                    DIGEST         On March 31, 2022, the United States Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin       No. 121 (Bulletin). The Bulletin provides interpretive       guidance regarding how covered entities should account for       and disclose their custodial obligations to safeguard crypto-      assets held for their platform users. SEC did not submit a       report pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to       Congress or the Comptroller General on the Bulletin.        CRA requires that before a rule can take effect, an agency       must submit a report on the rule to both the House of       Representatives and the Senate as well as the Comptroller       General, and provides procedures for congressional review       where Congress may disapprove of rules. CRA adopts the       definition of rule under the Administrative Procedure Act       (APA) but excludes certain categories of rules from coverage.       We conclude the Bulletin is a rule for purposes of CRA       because it meets the APA definition of a rule, and no       exceptions apply. Therefore, the Bulletin is subject to the       requirement that it be submitted to Congress.                                   decision         On March 31, 2022, the United States Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) issued Staff       Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (Bulletin) and published it on       the Commission's website. SEC, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.       121, available at https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting- bulletin-121 (last visited Oct. 25, 2023). The Bulletin       became effective on April 11, 2022, and was published in the       Federal Register on that same date. 87 Fed. Reg. 21015. We       received a congressional request for a decision regarding       whether the Bulletin is subject to the Congressional Review       Act (CRA). Letter from Senator Cynthia M. Lummis to       Comptroller General (Aug. 2, 2022). For the reasons described       below, we conclude that the Bulletin is a rule under CRA and       thus subject to CRA's submission requirement.        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GA0-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006), available at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao- 06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to SEC to obtain the       agency's legal views. Letter from Assistant General Counsel,       GAO, to General Counsel, SEC (Oct. 24, 2022). We received       SEC's response on November 21, 2022. Letter from General       Counsel, SEC, to Assistant General Counsel, GAO (Response       Letter).  [[Page S5311]]                                       BACKGROUND       SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121        SEC was established in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934       (the Exchange Act). 15 U.S.C. 78a-78rr. The Commission is       composed of five commissioners who are appointed by the       President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.       Id. The Exchange Act grants SEC broad authority over the       securities industry. Id. The Act delegates to SEC the power       to oversee certain organizations dealing with securities, to       exercise disciplinary authority over covered parties that       participate in prohibited conduct, and to require the       periodic reporting of information by companies with publicly       traded securities. Id. In exercising these powers, SEC       publishes some its interpretations relating to financial       reporting matters in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 17       C.F.R. Part 211. These interpretations include Financial       Reporting Releases (Subpart A), Staff Accounting Bulletins       (SABs) (Subpart B), and Accounting and Audit Enforcement       Releases (Subpart C). Id. SEC also publishes these       interpretations on its official website in order to ``provide       guidance to those who must comply with the federal securities       laws.'' SEC, Staff Interpretations, available at https:// www.sec.gov/regulation/staff-interpretations (last visited       Oct. 25, 2023).        SABs in particular are used by SEC to publicize its staffs       ``views regarding accounting-related disclosure practices''       under federal securities laws. SEC, Selected Staff Accounting       Bulletins, available at https://www.sec.gov/regulation/ staffinterpretations/accounting-bulletins (last visited Oct.       25, 2023). According to SEC, SABs specifically represent the       interpretations and policies followed by the Commission's       Division of Corporation Finance (Division) and Office of the       Chief Accountant (OCA), two internal organizational units of       SEC. Id. The Division is tasked with ensuring that investors       are provided with material information to make informed       investment decisions. SEC, About the Division of Corporation       Finance, available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/  cfabout (last visited Oct. 25, 2023). In furtherance of this       goal, the Division selectively reviews filings made under the       Exchange Act in order to both monitor and enhance compliance       with disclosure and accounting requirements. Id. Division       staff ``may issue comments to a company to elicit better       compliance with applicable disclosure requirements,'' and, in       response, a company has the opportunity to amend its       disclosure or revise its financial statements and other       disclosures. Id. Additionally, the Division may ``refer[ ]       matters to the Division of Enforcement'' when appropriate.       Id. OCA, headed by the Chief Accountant, provides advice to       the Commission on accounting and auditing matters, including       accounting policy determinations. SEC, Office of the Chief       Accountant, available at https://www.sec.gov/page/oca-landing       (last visited Oct. 25, 2023).        Starting in 1975, the Division and OCA instituted the       practice of releasing SABs to more widely publicize staff       interpretations regarding the disclosure requirements of       federal securities laws. 40 Fed. Reg. 53557 (Nov. 19, 1975).       SABs were created to level the competition among accounting       firms; the Commission noted that large accounting firms       generally had multiple opportunities to exchange information       and views with SEC staff, but that small accounting firms       might have been disadvantaged by a lack of similar       opportunities. 40 Fed. Reg. 53557. To rectify this imbalance,       the SAB was thus instituted as a tool for the Division and       OCA to use to ``quickly and easily communicate[ ]'' their       staff's new and revised practices and interpretations to the       public. 40 Fed. Reg. 53557.        On March 31, 2022, SEC published the Bulletin to express       its staff's views regarding the accounting obligations for       covered entities that provide custodial services of crypto-      assets. SEC, Bulletin, available at https://www.sec.gov/oca/ staff-accounting-bulletin-121 (last visited Oct. 25, 2023).       The Bulletin was issued in response to SEC staff's       observation of an increase in the number of entities       providing platform users with the ability to transact in       crypto-assets. Id. In the Bulletin, SEC staff state their       belief ``that the recognition, measurement, and disclosure       guidance[ ] will enhance the information received by       investors and other users of financial statements . . .       thereby assisting them in making investment and other capital       allocation decisions.'' Id. The Bulletin presents a       hypothetical situation regarding Entity A, an example entity       engaging in crypto-asset services, and then provides       interpretive responses to three questions concerning how SEC       staff would expect Entity A to account for and disclose its       custodial obligations. Id. For example, according to the       Bulletin, covered entities that are responsible for       safeguarding platform users' crypto-assets may be required to       present a liability on their balance sheets to reflect this       obligation. Id. Additionally, the Bulletin states staff would       expect such entities to include clear disclosures of the       nature and amount of cryptoassets they are responsible for       holding for their platform users in the notes to their       financial statements, with separate disclosure for each       significant crypto-asset, and the vulnerabilities they have       due to any concentration in such activities. Id.        Also on March 31, 2022, one of the commissioners released a       public statement questioning SEC's use of a SAB to make and       publicize the Bulletin's change in accounting practices. SEC,       Statement of Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Response to Staff       Accounting Bulletin No. 121, available at https://www .sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-response-sab-121-033122 (last       visited Oct. 25, 2023) (criticizing the use of an SAB to       provide the ``definitive interpretive guidance'' conveyed in       the Bulletin).      The Congressional Review Act        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies to submit       a report on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to       the Comptroller General before it can take effect. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 801 (a)(1 )(A). The report must contain a copy of the       rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the rule,''       and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. CRA allows       Congress to review and disapprove rules issued by federal       agencies for a period of 60 days using special procedures. 5       U.S.C. Sec. 802. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted,       then the new rule has no force or effect. Id. CRA makes clear       that its provisions ``shall apply notwithstanding any other       provision of law.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 806(a).        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551 (4), which states that       a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3). CRA       excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules       of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency       management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        SEC did not submit a CRA report to Congress or to the       Comptroller General in regard to the Bulletin. In its       response to us, SEC maintained that the Bulletin is not       subject to CRA because it does not meet the APA definition of       a rule as it is not an ``agency statement'' of ``future       effect.'' Response Letter, at 2-4. For the reasons explained       below, we disagree. We find that the Bulletin does meet the       definition of a rule under APA and that no exception applies.       Thus, the Bulletin is subject to CRA's submission       requirement.                                  DISCUSSION         At issue here is whether the Bulletin is a rule for       purposes of CRA. First, we must consider whether it meets the       definition of a rule under APA. We conclude it does. We next       must examine whether any exception applies. We find that none       apply. Therefore, we conclude the Bulletin is a rule for       purposes of CRA.      The Bulletin is a Rule Under APA        The Bulletin meets the APA definition of a rule. First, the       Bulletin is an agency statement because it was published on       SEC's official, public-facing website as a representation of       the views held by its own employees. Second, the Bulletin is       of future effect because it explicitly states that it applies       to certain entities and contains ``guidance for [these]       entities to consider when they have obligations to safeguard       crypto-assets held for their platform users.'' Bulletin. From       this, we ascertain that SEC intended the Bulletin's guidance       to apply prospectively to covered entities' future accounting       and disclosure practices. Lastly, the Bulletin interprets and       prescribes policy because it announces a preference for how       covered entities should account for and disclose crypto-      asset-related custodial obligations. Id.        SEC contends that the Bulletin is not a rule under APA       because it is not an agency action. Response Letter, at 2. In       its response to us, SEC stated that the Bulletin is not an       agency statement because it is not binding on the agency and       ``at most'' indicates ``how the Office of the Chief       Accountant and the Division of Corporation Finance would       recommend that the agency act.'' Response Letter, at 3.       Additionally, SEC asserts that the Bulletin is not an agency       statement because the Exchange Act and SEC's organizational       rules prohibit the Commission from delegating general       rulemaking authority to an individual Commissioner or to       staff. Response Letter, at 2-3 (citing 17 C.F.R. 200.43).        We recognized in an earlier opinion that ``in order [for an       agency action] to be a rule [under APA], the statement must       be made by an agency.'' B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017. The Bulletin       is a statement made by SEC. While it is true that the       Bulletin was not held out by SEC as a statement representing       the full Commission, a statement issued by a subset of the       agency may still constitute an agency statement for CRA       purposes.        In particular, our prior opinions have recognized that       agency actions published by less than the full agency can       still constitute agency statements for the purposes of APA,       and thus CRA. In three of our previous opinions, we examined       whether various Supervision and Regulation Letters (SR       Letters) issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal       Reserve System (FRB or Board) were rules for purposes of CRA.       B-330843, Oct. 22, 2019 (finding that SR 12-7 and SR 14-8 are       rules under CRA, but that SR 15-7 is not a rule under CRA       because it fell within an exception to the Act), B-331324,       Oct. 22, 2019 (finding that SR 11-7 is a rule under CRA), and       B-331560, Apr. 16, 2020 (finding that SR 15-18 is a rule       under CRA). In those opinions, we noted that FRB has the       authority to inspect the financial condition of financial       institutions under its jurisdiction. B-330843, B-331324, and       B-331560. We explained that FRB examiners tasked with       inspecting and monitoring these  [[Page S5312]]       institutions can issue SR Letters when they believe guidance       on a particular issue is necessary and clarified that such       guidance is not binding on any institution. B-330843, B-      331324, and B-331560. In all three of our opinions involving       FRB SR Letters, we concluded that the SR Letters at issue       were agency statements within the APA definition of rule. B-      330843, B-331324, and B-331560. We explained that the SR       Letters were agency statements ``as [they were] issued by       FRB.'' B-330843, B-331324, and B-331560. The fact that such       SR Letters were issued by examiner employees of FRB rather       than the Board as a whole did not diminish the fact that the       SR letters constituted the FRB speaking as an agency.        While we recognize that the Exchange Act and SEC's       organizational rules limit the Commission's authority to       delegate its general rulemaking function to its staff, these       sources speak only to how the Bulletin does not stem from the       Commission's general rulemaking authority. On this point, we       find it helpful to draw a parallel between the organizational       structure and practices of both the SEC and FRB. Both are       multi-member, independent government agencies that are       statutorily restricted from delegating rulemaking authority.       The Federal Reserve Act expressly does not authorize FRB to       delegate its rulemaking function ``to . . . members or       employees of the Board.'' 12 U.S.C. Sec. 248(k). FRB adopted       this language from the Federal Reserve Act as an       organizational rule. Similar to how SEC's Division and OCA       publish SABs to announce how staff intends to administer       certain accounting-related disclosure practices, FRB's       Division of Supervision and Regulation publish SR Letters to       ``address significant policy and procedural matters related       to [FRB's] supervisory responsibilities.'' As these SR       Letters are published by a division FRB, we can presume that       the letters are published outside of FRB's rulemaking       authority since FRB is not authorized to delegate its       rulemaking function to its employees. Our determination that       the Bulletin is an agency statement is consistent with our       previous recognition of FRB's SR Letters as agency statements       in B-330843, B-331324, and B-331560.        Additionally, we have consistently concluded that CRA also       covers agency actions outside the APA rulemaking process. For       example, in B-331171, Dec. 17, 2020, we recognized that       ``[t]he sponsors of CRA intended the definition of rule to be       as broad as possible to ensure congressional review of agency       action.'' In B-331324, Oct. 22, 2019, we cited to a CRA       sponsor's statement that ``[a]lthough agency interpretive       rules, general statements of policy, guideline documents, and       agency policy and procedure manuals may not be subject to the       notice and comment provisions of [APA], these types of       documents are covered under the congressional review       provisions of [CRA].'' Id. (quoting 142 Cong. Rec. H3005       (daily ed. Mar. 28, 1996)). Moreover, SEC acknowledged that       ``CRA can apply to agency actions that do not require notice       and the opportunity for public comment [under       APA].'' Response Letter, at 4. Although the Bulletin was       published by staff who lack the Commission's general       rulemaking authority, our prior precedent and CRA's       legislative history demonstrate that the Bulletin is still       covered by CRA.        The Bulletin was issued by SEC staff as a representation of       how the Division and OCA interpret accounting-related       disclosure requirements. Since one of the Division's roles is       to monitor companies' compliance with accounting and       disclosure requirements, and, since the Division's practice       is to refer noncompliant companies to SEC's Division of       Enforcement when appropriate, it is reasonable to believe       that companies may change their behavior to comply with the       staff interpretations found in the Bulletin. SEC published       the Bulletin on its public-facing website to ``add[ ]       interpretive guidance for entities to consider when they have       obligations to safeguard crypto-assets held for their       platform users.'' Bulletin. Like the SR Letters issued by       FRB's examiners, the Bulletin was issued by agency employees       to provide non-binding guidance that covered entities were       nevertheless expected to follow. We therefore find that the       Bulletin is an agency statement within the meaning of APA.        As stated previously, the Bulletin is also of future effect       and was designed to interpret and prescribe policy.       Accordingly, we conclude that the Bulletin meets the       definition of rule under APA.      No CRA Exceptions Apply to the Bulletin        Having concluded that the Bulletin meets the APA definition       of a rule, we next consider whether any of the three CRA       exceptions apply. We conclude that none apply. First, the       Bulletin is a rule of general applicability because it       neither identifies specific entities by name nor does it       address specific actions for a named entity to take.''       Second, the Bulletin concerns actions that covered entities       should take, rather than actions that SEC management or       personnel should take, and is, therefore, not a rule of       agency management or personnel. This leaves the third       exception, the exception for rules of ``agency organization,       procedure, or practice that do[ ] not substantially affect       the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.'' 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 804(3)(C). The Bulletin does not qualify for this last       exception because it has a substantial impact on its       regulated community.        In analyzing the third CRA exception, we have previously       held that agency rules that encourage the regulated community       to change internal operations or policies have a substantial       impact on non-agency parties and thus do not qualify for the       exception. B-334032, Dec. 15, 2022. See B-330843, B-331324,       and B-331560. Additionally, we more specifically determined       that agency rules that recommend specific actions, such as       best practices the regulated community should take, do not       qualify for the exception. B-334032.        We examined a similar issue in B-330843, Oct. 22, 2019,       where we found that FRB's SR 12-17 did not meet the third CRA       exception because it had a substantial impact on the       regulated community. SR 12-17 put forth actions institutions       should take to ensure their resiliency if they enter a period       of financial distress and to prevent harm to the financial       system in case of the institution's failure. Id. We noted       that the actions from SR 12-17 could change covered entities'       expectations of FRB and could lead to and encourage changes       in the covered entities' internal operations and policies.       Id. For those reasons, we determined that SR 12-17 had a       substantial impact on the regulated community and thus did       not qualify for the third CRA exception. Id.        Here, the Bulletin recommends best practices for how       covered entities should account for their obligations to       safeguard the crypto-assets they hold for their platform       users. Bulletin. Similar to the FRB guidance in B-330843, the       Bulletin advises these covered entities on how they can       fulfill certain financial disclosure obligations to ensure       compliance with SEC staff's interpretations of these       obligations. By advising the covered entities in this manner,       the Bulletin is encouraging the regulated community to change       its internal operations or policies to comply with the       Bulletin's guidance.        Additionally, since the Bulletin was published on SEC's       official website, it is reasonable for covered entities to       believe they are expected to, at minimum, consider the       Bulletin's guidance when preparing their own financial       disclosures to the agency. SEC states that the Bulletin       reflects policies followed by the Division and OCA. Response       Letter, at 3. According to SEC, the Division uses its filing       review process to monitor and to enhance compliance with       disclosure and accounting requirements. Since SEC monitors       the covered entities' compliance with certain financial       disclosure requirements, it is reasonable to believe that       these entities might change their internal operations and       policies to align with the accounting practices suggested by       the Bulletin.        Furthermore, in a public statement about the Bulletin, an       SEC Commissioner recognized that the Bulletin ``provides       definitive interpretive guidance'' for public companies and       contains a ``detailed description of disclosure the staff       expects to see, including a full paragraph describing       relevant disclosures that `may also be required outside the       financial statements under existing Commission rules.' '' We       agree with this characterization. Because the Bulletin       changes covered entities' expectations of how SEC will       evaluate their compliance, and because it encourages these       entities to change their internal operations and policies, we       conclude that the Bulletin has a substantial effect on the       financial disclosure obligations of non-agency parties. Thus,       the Bulletin does not fall within CRA's exception for rules       of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.                                  CONCLUSION         The Bulletin is a rule for purposes of CRA because it meets       the APA definition of a rule and none of the three CRA       exceptions apply. Accordingly, the Bulletin is subject to the       CRA's submission requirement.
