 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for mentioning  that so that it doesn't detract from my time. But please visit  California, especially Riverside, California.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 114, which prevents a  funding lapse in the VA Choice Program while making critical  investments to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs.   This legislation is a significant improvement over the bill we  considered earlier this week. It now includes leasing authorizations  for VA medical facilities in 17 States across the country, and it  includes several provisions that I introduced that will help address  the VA's workforce shortages. This is what I hope to be the first step  in providing the VA the tools it needs to meet its internal workforce  challenges.   As I have often said, the VA's ability to provide quality and timely  care to our Nation's veterans will be determined by who it hires.   There are nearly 50,000 vacancies at the VA that need to be filled.  This bill strengthens and streamlines the VA's ability to recruit,  hire, and retain talented and dedicated individuals. But more needs to  be done to expand the VA's own internal capacity to provide care for  our veterans.   The VA Choice Program is a well-intentioned program, but it has not  delivered on its promise to consistently cut wait times or improve  care. We do not want to be back here in January passing another short- term fix.   Starting today, we have 6 months to come together and develop a more  efficient and effective system to connect veterans with the care they  need.   Earlier this week, I expressed my desire to vote for a bill that  avoids a funding gap in the Choice Program, while also recognizing the  importance of a strong and sustainable VA. This legislation meets that  standard, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, late last night, Senate Republicans failed  in their latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but today is  not a day for celebration. It is a day for solutions.   Over the past 7 years, the Affordable Care Act has expanded access to  healthcare for millions of Americans; but the law's imperfections,  combined with politically motivated opposition, have created a system  that falls short of the goals we all share.   In many communities across the country, there is not enough  competition in the individual marketplaces, there is not enough support  for middle class families and small businesses, and there is not nearly  enough being done to curb the prescription drug prices that are  swallowing family budgets.   The good news is that we know how to solve these challenges. Now is  the time for us to work together, Democrats and Republicans, to build a  healthcare system that is worthy of this great Nation.                            ____________________
