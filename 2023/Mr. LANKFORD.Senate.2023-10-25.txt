 Madam President, we have the opportunity to take a  really big step today that the entire country would pause and go:  Finally. We have the opportunity to end government shutdowns forever.  We will say: That is off the table. We, as a nation, don't do  government shutdowns.   Government shutdowns haven't always been in our system as a nation.  They really started in the 1980s, and we have had this repetitive cycle  of government shutdowns over and over and over again.   The American people and folks in my State in Oklahoma say: How do we  make this stop?   Well, this is how we make it stop. Senator Hassan and I sat down 5  years ago and just said: Everyone wants to stop it, but we have never  figured out a way that is a totally nonpartisan way. Let's figure this  out. What is a nonpartisan way to end government shutdowns?   So we sat down and worked on some language to try to figure out how  to be able to do this. We took input from Members all over this  conference on both sides of the aisle. We actually sat down years ago  with the Trump administration and worked with their Office of  Management and Budget and then have since sat down with the Biden  administration, with their Office of Management and Budget, to make  sure the process would actually work; that it would actually be  effective because we weren't interested in having a messaging bill; we  were interested in actually ending government shutdowns--that it would  work.   The idea is really very simple. If Congress gets to the end of the  fiscal year and the appropriations work is not done by the end of the  year, we stay in session 7 days a week. We can't move to any bill other  than appropriations until we actually finish appropriations.   If I can just make it just this simple: If we don't finish our  classwork, we have to stay after class. That is all it is. In the  meantime, the government continues to run at the previous year's  levels. That way, Federal workers are held harmless. The American  people are held harmless. The pressure is on the people it should be  on: us.   Now, I have heard from some folks that this won't work because the  House is crazy, and they won't care about staying here 7 days a week  because they are crazy. Well, I would respectfully say that House  Members, though definitely crazy at times, still love their families,  still have responsibilities back in their home district. They also want  to be able to get back home. They are not going to stay here 7 days a  week forever.   We do have other bills to be able to pass--the National Defense  Authorization and thousands of other things that we still have to do.  So the thought that we would be in continual CRs, both here, House and  Senate, 7 days a week and never leave and that we would never do other  bills is just not realistic.   I have also heard that if we take away the threat of a government  shutdown, we would lose the pressure point to be able to do  appropriations. Well, again, respectfully, I disagree. I don't think  Federal law enforcement and Border Patrol agents, air traffic  controllers, HUD staff, and millions of other Federal workers and their  families are leverage. They are not leverage to be able to get  appropriations work done. They are families. They are families who just  want to serve their neighbors and be able to get a paycheck for it.   Right now--right now--there are thousands of marines, sailors, and  airmen who are currently in the Mediterranean on high alert.   They should not have to make contingency plans for their family not  to get a paycheck at the end of this month. Right now, in Fort Sill,  OK, there are soldiers who are packing equipment to leave and head to  the Middle East right now. They should not have to look at their loved  ones before they leave and say: In case checks don't get deposited at  the end of next month, here is what to do. They should be able to go  serve.   So as simple as I can say it, we shouldn't say to them: Maybe we  won't have a shutdown or probably we won't have a shutdown. We should  say: Definitely, we are not going to have a shutdown. Thank you for  serving our country.   That is what we should do. The hardest thing in this body to change  is status quo. It is the hardest thing to change. Today, we have an  opportunity to change the status quo and to begin the process of ending  government shutdowns forever.   I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Hassan and I and so many  other folks from both sides of the aisle to say: Let's take a step  forward, and let's actually do our business.                   Amendment No. 1232 to Amendment No. 1092    (Purpose: To provide for a period of continuing appropriations in the  event of a lapse in appropriations under the normal appropriations  process, and establish procedures and consequences in the event of a  failure to enact appropriations.)    Madam President, I would like to call up my amendment,  amendment No. 1232, and ask that it be reported by number.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
