 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents  of New York's 25th Congressional District to voice my strong opposition  to a senseless and entirely avoidable government shutdown that would  hurt my community and millions of people across the country.   What is particularly alarming is that this looming shutdown has been  triggered over a potential border wall that is not only ill-conceived,  but would squander our limited resources, and fail to address the most  pressing challenges facing our Nation.   In my district, what we want instead is to take a unified approach to  ensuring quality, affordable healthcare; protecting Social Security and  Medicare; create more good-paying job opportunities; and addressing the  gun violence epidemic that is devastating our communities.   Over the coming days, I implore all parties to come together in a  spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation to focus on what is more  important to the American people and avoid a needless government  shutdown that would impair those priorities.                            ____________________
