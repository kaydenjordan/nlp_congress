 Mr. Speaker, we heard a great speech by the President  last night, who spoke to the strength of our country and the courage  and character of our fellow citizens:   People like 100-year-old Tuskegee airman Retired Brigadier General  Charles McGee and his great-grandson, the 13-year-old who dreams of  going to space;   People like single mother Stephanie Davis and her lovely fourth grade  daughter who received an Opportunity Scholarship. Who in this room does  not remember the look on Stephanie's face as she realized that her  daughter was going to get an opportunity that she sacrificed so greatly  for;   And people like Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, who surprised  his wife, Amy, and two beautiful children in the gallery last night.   As I looked around, I saw tears in many people's eyes from the  emotion that they felt at that time.   Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi was unmoved and chose to tear up the  House copy of that speech. She had no right to destroy this document,  especially one filled with such impactful stories of American patriots.   The record was presented before the people's House and it belongs to  the American people. That is why I am here today.   In my hand, I have an official copy of the President's State of the  Union address signed by the President, given to me at the White House  today. It will be delivered to the House Clerk to be archived and  preserved for posterity, whether she likes it or not.   These great American stories will be remembered by history, not  erased by the Speaker. We are better because of them, and we should  learn from them and we should be proud that they will shape our future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, to clarify, was that document provided  from the President to the Speaker of the House a document of the House?    So to be clear, your answer is: That is a document of  the House, and the President provides one to the Speaker for the House,  and the President provides one to the President of the Senate, the Vice  President, for the Senate?    Further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is it allowed to destroy a document of the  House?    But to be clear, it is a document of the House, much  like any historical document that has been provided to the floor of  this House.    Mr. Speaker, no, the gentleman is correct. It was her  intention.    Parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, you clarified that is a document of the  House. Can you clarify that is not a document for the Speaker, but a  document for the House?    Further parliamentary inquiry.    Did the Speaker have any history in past State of the  Unions where that document provided to the Speaker has not been  enshrined into the Record?
