 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment  at what the House is devoting its time to this afternoon. It is  certainly not the issues that my constituents elected me to come to  Washington to advocate for on their behalf.    We are not on the floor today talking about how we can improve care  and services for veterans. We are not talking about how to fix the  crumbling infrastructure, how to fix the broken immigration system. We  are not talking about how to modernize and personally tailor  healthcare. We are not on the floor talking about how we can continue  to implement policies to further strengthen our booming economy.   Instead, we again find ourselves on the House floor talking about  President Trump and his administration.   Sound familiar? This morning, in the interest of full transparency,  the Trump administration released the complete memorandum outlining the  telephone conversation between the President and the Ukrainian  President, just as the President promised he would do yesterday. But  before reading the transcript, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle prejudged the memo and called for impeachment.   Did the Speaker wait to see and review this information? No. Instead,  she went before the American people to announce that the House would  begin the formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump.   Well, I read the transcript, and I don't see the bombshell that the  Democrats promised. There is no quid pro quo, no this for that. Nowhere  does the President say that he will withhold military aid unless the  Ukrainian investigation continues. It is simply not there.   Rushing to judgment and overpromising, if it sounds familiar, that is  because it is. We waited nearly 2 years for Special Counsel Mueller to  finish his report on the 2016 election. Over and over, we heard  Democrats promise the report would lead to President Trump's  impeachment. After a disappointing report and an even more  disappointing appearance by the special counsel before Congress, they  went fishing for new reasons to attack the President.   What happened to the standard of innocent until proven guilty in this  country? I learned that in law school. How have we strayed so far from  this fundamental principle?   The Democrats are operating under the presumptive belief that the  President is guilty. They believe if they look long enough and hard  enough, maybe, just maybe, they will uncover something, anything, that  they can impeach him for.   This is wrong, and I will not support their efforts. I will not stand  by silently while it happens. If my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle truly believe that this warrants impeachment, and if they are not  willing to wait 1 day to read the transcript, then why are they sending  us back to our districts for the next 2 weeks?   The majority leader said this morning there are no plans to cancel  the recess because it is important Members go home to their  constituents and explain what we are doing. In other words, they still  need to convince the American people that today's revelations, which  didn't live up to their promises, should lead to President Trump's  removal from office.    Madam Speaker, I call on the Democrat leadership to keep  us in session the first 2 weeks of October, if this is as urgent and as  serious as they are telling the American people.   I will not support the political impeachment that Democrats are  incessantly pursuing. I implore this House  [[Page H7925]]  and its leadership to put this behind us once and for all and get to  work, get to work and do the important work that the American people  sent us here to do.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of Tampa  Bay's most impactful business leaders, Aakash Patel.   Aakash was recently honored as Businessman of the Year by the Indo- U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group that provides Asian American  professionals and entrepreneurs a platform to share and collaborate.   Aakash currently serves as the chairman of the Early Learning  Coalition of Hillsborough County, a 501(c)(3) that provides quality  childhood care and after-school programs to many of the children in my  district.   At the age of 27, Aakash founded a local consulting firm, with an  expertise in public relations, targeted networking, and social media.  Under his leadership, his small group of millennials, over the last 9  years, has actively resourced over 150 companies.   His love and passion for our community is also seen in his role as  the youngest board member of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and  with his selection as an honorary commander at MacDill Air Force Base.   Please join me in congratulating one of Tampa's most well-established  rising stars in the business community, Aakash Patel.                            ____________________
