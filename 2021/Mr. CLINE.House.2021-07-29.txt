 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition today to the  bloatedbus spending bill that is being jammed through the House this  week by the majority.   Instead of working to craft bipartisan legislation, Democrats have  put forward appropriations bills that are based on unrealistic and  irresponsible spending levels and include partisan policy provisions  that will only delay its final passage.   Further, rather than holding a vote on each individual appropriations  bill, the Speaker has lumped together seven separate spending bills  that include nearly $600 billion in discretionary spending, a 21  percent increase over just last year.   Twenty-one percent. That is almost as high as some of the price  increases families in my district are seeing in their daily lives,  thanks to the flood of deficit spending President Biden and Speaker  Pelosi have forced through this Congress already.  [[Page H4256]]    This is not how the legislative process should work. And with  inflation rates at a 13-year high, Madam Speaker, we simply cannot  afford it.   And while this bill provides unprecedented increases for Democrats'  domestic spending priorities, the left has decided to underfund two  appropriations bills that are required by the Constitution: Homeland  Security and National Defense. Worse yet, it reverses decades of  historically bipartisan pro-life policies like the Hyde and Weldon  amendments which have been bipartisan since 1976.   Further, it increases our dependence on China. It fails to keep us  safe by hindering the work of Customs and Border Protection, and it  abandons an all-of-the-above energy strategy. This is truly  unacceptable.   Madam Speaker, this minibus needs to be sent back to the scrap yard,  and if not, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                          Honoring Chief Joe Simmons     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 30-year  career of one of Virginia's finest, Bridgewater Police Chief Joe  Simmons.   Interestingly, this law enforcement veteran originally had  aspirations of being a firefighter, but after being a dispatcher,  jailer, and then a road deputy in the Rockingham County Sheriff's  office, the SWAT team recruited him in 1996. By 1997, he joined the  elite RUSH Drug Task Force, a mix of local and State officers, who I  was proud to work with as an assistant Commonwealth's attorney, as well  as Federal drug agents.   Simmons brought all this experience to the town of Bridgewater in the  late 1990s, eventually rising to chief in 2011. Mayor Ted Flory said of  Simmons: ``He's done an amazing job. . . . The model of community  policing . . . serves the citizens very well.''   Chief Simmons says most police officers are good people who care  about the citizens in their community. ``You have to have empathy. It's  not us against them,'' Simmons said, ``You have to police with an open  mind. It's customer service.''   In the end, while Simmons never became the firefighter he once wanted  to be, he had a successful career in public service, risking his life  to protect and serve his fellow citizens.   I thank Chief Simmons for his service.                            ____________________
