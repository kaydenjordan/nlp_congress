 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch     Madam President, as I have done from the time he was  nominated and as I will continue to do until he is confirmed, I rise to  support the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court.  Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist. I look forward to  helping make sure he can receive a vote here on the Senate floor.   In the weeks since his nomination, I have spoken at length about his  qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. I have recognized him as  a conservative champion of religious liberty, a defender of the  separation of powers, and a westerner who will bring some much needed  geographic diversity and a regional perspective to the Court.   During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Judge Gorsuch showed the country what it means to be a  judge.   Big or small, popular or unpopular, powerful or powerless, Judge  Gorsuch promised to render judgments based on the facts of the case,  nothing else. He also has a remarkable record of respectful cooperation  with judges appointed by Presidents of both parties.   During his decade-long tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,  Judge Gorsuch participated in more than 2,700 appeals. These comprised  some of the most difficult cases across six States. Of those cases, 97  percent of them were decided unanimously--97 percent.   Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. He was in  the majority on those cases 99 percent of the time. This is a testament  to Judge Gorsuch's ability to consider other points of view and to seek  out consensus, where possible. To try to paint Judge Gorsuch as an  ideologue simply doesn't work. Those are essential qualities for any  prospective Supreme Court Justice.   Now that we have reported Judge Gorsuch out of committee as of today,  I would like to say a few words on the obstacles that stand in the way  of his being considered here on the Senate floor.   As we proceed with Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, I would like to  explain my support for confirming him in light of what transpired in  the waning months of the previous administration.   For nearly 230 years, Presidents have been making nominations to the  Supreme Court. According to the Congressional Research Service: ``From  the appointment of the first Justices in 1789 through its consideration  of Nominee Elena Kagan in 2010, the Senate has confirmed 124 Supreme  Court nominations out of 160 received.''   I would like to reiterate that number. Out of 160 Supreme Court  nominations in our Nation's history, 124 were confirmed.   The Congressional Research Service goes on to state: ``Of the 36  nominations which were not confirmed, 11 were rejected outright in  roll-call votes by the Senate, while nearly all of the rest, in the  face of substantial committee or Senate opposition to the nominee or  the President, were withdrawn by the President, or were postponed,  tabled, or never voted on by the Senate.''   The manner in which the Senate decides to provide its constitutional  advice and consent on Presidential nominations has varied over the  centuries  [[Page S2167]]  with respect to nominations. This includes decisions not to take up  Supreme Court nominees.   As Jonathan Adler put it in his article in the George Mason Law  Review:         Much as the Senate may reject a legislative proposal that       originated in the House of Representatives by voting it down,       killing it in committee, or simply refusing to take up the       measure, the Senate may withhold its consent by voting       against confirmation of a nominee, rejecting the nominee in       committee, or simply refusing to act.    Is refusing to act the preferred outcome? I can certainly see where  some would say no, as would I.   However, the history of the Senate demonstrates that to do otherwise  in similar circumstances, as we just experienced is, in fact, a rare  exception.   To cite Adler's law review article again, he states: ``The last time  a Supreme Court vacancy arose in the calendar year of a Presidential  election and was filled prior to [the] election was in 1932.''   President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court  in the heat of the 2016 Presidential election. When he was nominated, I  understood the frustration of those on the other side of the aisle over  the fate of that nomination.   I met Judge Garland. He is a good man and a good judge, but the  decision by the majority not to take up Judge Garland's nomination was  not inconsistent with a longstanding practice of filling Supreme Court  vacancies after elections.   This brings us today to why I support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the  Supreme Court. There is no question about the appropriateness of  confirming Supreme Court nominees during the first years of the  President's term, let alone the first 3 months. In fact, there is  absolutely no justification for filibustering a highly qualified  Supreme Court nominee put forward by the President who was just  elected. That is just unprecedented.   There was an attempt to use this tactic in 2006 with Justice Samuel  Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, but he garnered sufficient  bipartisan support so that cloture was invoked.   Today, it appears that we will not enjoy that same rational support.  My preference would be to change the behavior of Senators rather than  change the rules of the Senate. But here we are, where a nominee who  would have received unanimous or nearly unanimous support just a few  years ago is about to be filibustered.   My question is this: If we can't confirm a judge like Judge Gorsuch  under contemporary use of Senate rules, who can we confirm?   It looks as if we will move forward later this week and make the rest  of the Executive Calendar subject to the same simple majority  threshold. Again, a change in Senate rules is not my preferred outcome,  but this rule change will simply make de jure what was de facto prior  to 2003, when filibusters were virtually never used on the President's  Executive Calendar.   Now, I want to make clear my steadfast support to preserve the  legislative filibuster. We need to distinguish between the President's  Executive Calendar, which has traditionally never been filibustered or  subject to filibuster, and the legislative filibuster, which is used  frequently here to ensure that we work across the aisle.   The Framers of our Constitution had the wisdom to create a Senate  with a strong minority to serve as a check on runaway power. If we were  to eliminate the legislative filibuster, we would cease to be that  check, and, indeed, the Senate would cease to be the Senate.   We have a qualified mainstream jurist before us. That is Judge  Gorsuch. I encourage all of my colleagues to give him fair  consideration and to advance his nomination to an up-or-down vote. I  will be voting to confirm him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moran). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support  the bill that is in front of us, S. 89, which will allow the historic  Delta Queen paddle wheeler to return to operation on the Mississippi  and Ohio Rivers.   This bill is supported by the National Trust for Historic  Preservation, the Seafarers International Union of North America, along  with a whole lot of excited people who live in Kimmswick, MO, where  this boat will have its home base.   The Delta Queen is an important piece of history. The vessel connects  us to a time before railroads and highways, when rivers were key  arteries of travel and commerce in this country. It was first placed on  the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and was designated as  a national historic landmark in 1989.   The Delta Queen's steel hull was originally built in pieces in  Scotland and then was assembled in Stockton, CA, in 1926, until the  beginning of World War II, when it ferried passengers between  Sacramento and San Francisco. During the war, she was acquired by the  U.S. Navy to support its operations in the San Francisco Bay. Following  the war, she was taken to Cincinnati, where she took passengers up and  down the river system for the next 60 years.   Three different U.S. Presidents have sailed on the Delta Queen-- Herbert Hoover, Missouri's own Harry Truman, and Jimmy Carter. In fact,  President Carter went on a week-long campaign tour on the vessel in  1979, along the Upper Mississippi.   For years, this vessel was home-ported in Cincinnati and was later  used as a hotel in Chattanooga. Should the bill before us be enacted,  the Delta Queen will be home-ported in Kimmswick, MO, just south of St.  Louis. There, its operations will create more than 170 jobs and have an  economic impact of more than $36 million, which is a big impact for one  boat in a small community.   The bill before the Senate today would reinstate the exemption that  the Delta Queen repeatedly received in the past when it was  grandfathered from regulations that occurred in 1966, which prevented  wooden boats from having passengers overnight. Congress repeatedly  renewed this waiver from 1968 to 2008 and recognized that these  regulations were primarily designed for ships on the high seas and that  this ship was a link to an important time period in American history.   Over the 40 years that the Delta Queen had its exemption, it operated  without incident, but the exemption was allowed to expire in 2008. S.  89 adds a new number of safety provisions as a condition of the waiver,  making it a very strong improvement over every previous waiver that was  issued by Congress during that time period.   I will not go through the long list of safety requirements that are  contained in this legislation. Suffice it to say that they must alter  the boat; they must protect the engine and boiler systems with non- flammable materials, and they must receive special training.   The owner cannot disclaim any liability for any crewmember's or  passenger's injury or death.   The Coast Guard has to conduct an annual audit and inspection of the  vessel. In order to receive the waiver, the vessel must have the  boilers and generators that meet current Coast Guard standards, which  means that the current owners of the boat are going to invest millions  in order to bring it up to the safety standards that are necessary for  today's traveling public. It has to have noncombustible enclosures that  are equipped with fire suppression systems, and multiple forms of  egress are provided off the vessel's bow and stern.   It is also reiterated in this legislation that the Coast Guard has  the authority to immediately withdraw its certification of inspection  for the owners' failure to comply with any requirement in this bill, in  addition to other penalties permitted by law.   In short, we have taken important steps to make this historic piece  of riverboat history safe for the traveling public. Frankly, I think  people need to remember the lengths to which we go in restoring and  preserving historic buildings in this country. We do not make them tear  them down. Rather, we make them comply with certain safety standards.  We treasure the fact that we are saving historic buildings all over  this country.  [[Page S2168]]    This is saving a historic vessel. It is very important that we save  this vessel not only for what it represents to our country but also for  what it means in jobs and economic activity to an important area of the  State that I love to call home.   I thank Senators Brown, Blunt, Boozman, Cassidy, Cotton, Kennedy, and  Portman, who joined me in introducing this legislation, and Chairman  Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, who have been so helpful in moving it  through the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.   I know it is a phrase that we like to use around here and that  sometimes it is not true, but this really is a bipartisan effort. This  really is an example of people coming together who have common sense in  order to put a boat back on the river that means a lot to history, that  means a lot to the traveling public, and that uses common sense in  addressing safety concerns that are necessary because of the historic  nature of the boat.   I ask that all of my colleagues support this bill and return the  Delta Queen to her rightful place on the Mighty Mississippi.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
