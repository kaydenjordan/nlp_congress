 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of my concern that, in  less than 1 week, the United States of America may default on its debt  and its obligations.   I know we all want to get home for Memorial Day. We want to celebrate  and honor our fallen heroes, the men and women who have served our  country. The best way for us to honor those heroes and the best way for  us to honor the American public is to pass the debt ceiling.   That is what we do. We teach our kids to pay their debts, and we  teach families to pay their debts. That is what we ought to do.   I am all for negotiating spending cuts, but that is what a budget  negotiation is for, not a debt ceiling to pay our debt.   Let's honor our veterans and honor our fallen heroes at Memorial Day  parades. Let's stay here, get this done, and fly home to celebrate and  honor Memorial Day and honor our veterans. Let's get this done.                            ____________________
