 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the beloved father,  husband, son, and hero, Specialist Steven Ray Givens, who gave his life  in service to our country.  [[Page H2154]]    As a young child, Steven was inspired by his grandfather and made the  decision to serve.   In May 2005, Steven gave his life in Balad, Iraq, while serving  during Operation Iraqi Freedom, for which he was awarded the Bronze  Star and the Purple Heart.   Steven is remembered for his incredible service and deep love and  commitment to his family. He loved playing video games with his son in  his lap, hunting and fishing, and chatting about military history.   Steven is survived by his mother, Joyce; his son, Blake; and his  wife, Cayssia. Cayssia serves as the Gold Star Congressional Fellow in  my Killeen, Texas, district office and honors Steven's legacy daily by  serving our veterans, Active-Duty servicemembers, and other Gold Star  families at Fort Cavazos and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, Camille and I thank Cayssia, Joyce, and Blake for their  incredible sacrifice, and we join them in remembering Steven.                            ____________________
