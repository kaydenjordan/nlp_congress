 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service  of MG James Bonner of the U.S. Army. Tomorrow, he will relinquish  command after nearly three years of leadership at the Maneuver Support  Center of Excellence and Fort Leonard Wood, MO.   During Major General Bonner's tenure, he demonstrated dedicated  leadership and played a crucial role in training approximately 240,000  soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, coast guardsmen, and civilians at  Fort Leonard Wood. Major General Bonner worked diligently to emphasize  the critical mission of the Army and Fort Leonard Wood in regional  middle schools, high schools, and universities. He also tirelessly  advocated for the fort and its surrounding community, expanding  partnerships with local, State, and Federal leaders. Throughout his  time, he hosted numerous elected officials, including the Missouri  Governor, the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army,  the Sergeant Major of the Army, and the Marine Corps Commandant. During  each visit, Major General Bonner ensured these strategic leaders  witnessed the unique and irreplaceable capabilities and competencies on  display at Fort Leonard Wood.   In fact, I had the opportunity to personally witness Major General  Bonner's leadership last week when I visited Fort Leonard Wood. My main  focus was to meet with military families residing on the installation  and discuss ways to improve their quality of life. Major General Bonner  joined me during these visits, and I could clearly see his genuine care  and concern for the families under his command.   Recognizing Major General Bonner's exceptional talent, the Army has  selected him to become the commanding general of U.S. Army North, where  he will lead the Army's efforts to defend the homeland. After 3 years  of commanding the finest CBRNE, engineer,  [[Page S1741]]  and military police soldiers in the Army, I believe there is no one  more qualified for this role. I express my gratitude to Major General  Bonner for his dedicated service to the soldiers and families of the  Fort Leonard Wood community and extend my best wishes for his future  endeavors. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to MG Christopher  Beck, who will assume command tomorrow. I am committed to continuing my  support for the Fort Leonard Wood community and those who train  there.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding constituent from Missouri, Mr. Marc Roecker. Marc is CEO  and general manager of Laclede Electric Cooperative, headquartered in  Lebanon, MO, and will be retiring from this position at the end of May.  For nearly 42 years, Marc has been a leader in Rural Electric  Cooperatives both in Iowa and Missouri.   Over the past 10 years as CEO and general manager, Marc has overseen  a significant amount of growth, implemented many technological  improvements, and helped navigate the twists and turns of the economy,  and he has done it all with a steady hand. He has been a great leader  and a great friend of the Ozarks region.   In his community, Marc was selected to serve on the Fort Leonard Wood  Institute and Sustainable Ozarks Partnership at Fort Leonard Wood.  These groups are focused on fostering the region's continued commitment  to national defense and advocating for local and regional development  initiatives, as well as the sustainment and growth of Fort Leonard  Wood. Marc is a strong advocate for supporting the men and women who  serve our country in the Armed Forces, both past and present.   Leading up to his retirement, Marc has been asked what he will miss  the most. In response, he says he will miss the people he has met over  the years: members, employees, board directors, and colleagues alike.  He said there is something very special about being a part of an  electric cooperative and working with people who are so committed to  serving their members.   Laclede Electric Cooperative and the Ozarks region are incredibly  grateful for Marc's dedication to the electric industry and Rural  Electric Cooperatives. His selfless service to his community is an  incredible example of citizenship, and they are all fortunate to call  him a neighbor and friend. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in  recognizing Mr. Marc Roecker, and I wish him the best in his much- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
