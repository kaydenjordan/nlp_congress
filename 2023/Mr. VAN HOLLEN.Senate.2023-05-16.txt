 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the achievements  of Mr. Paul Casasco, a senior audio operator for the Senate Chamber, on  the occasion of his retirement.   Maryland is home to a robust Federal workforce that serves our  country with pride. Federal employees work day-in and day-out to  provide vital services to the American people, and I have the honor of  representing many of these dedicated individuals.   A native of Howard County, MD, Paul Casasco has served the U.S.  Senate with distinction for 37 years. Hired in April 1986, Mr. Casasco  was a member of the original team that piloted live national coverage  of the Senate floor. Within weeks, the U.S. Senate voted to make this  coverage permanent, cementing public access to and transparency of its  procedures and activities. Mr. Casasco's contributions have ensured  that the Senate Recording Studio has become a modern facility that  caters to the body of the Senate. He is the last serving member of the  original 1986 team.   Paul Casasco's dedication will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate.  His colleagues and I join in wishing him all the best for a fulfilling  and enjoyable next chapter in retirement.                            ____________________
