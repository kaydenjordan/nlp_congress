 Mr. Speaker, recent polling shows great optimism about our  country, as Americans believe they are better off today than they were  before President Trump's conservative economic policies were enacted.   According to a Gallup poll released on February 5, almost 60 percent  of Americans say they are better off financially now than last year,  and close to 75 percent say that they expect to be even better off  financially in 1 year. This is the highest level on record.   Strong, conservative principles have created historically low levels  of unemployment for Americans regardless of their race, age, religion,  or gender.   Our Nation was built by Americans working to create a better future  for their children and their grandchildren. Both Democrats and  Republicans must fight the growing calls for socialism and instead  support the proven conservative policies implemented by this  administration that allow our economy to grow and help build a brighter  future for generations to come.                            ____________________
