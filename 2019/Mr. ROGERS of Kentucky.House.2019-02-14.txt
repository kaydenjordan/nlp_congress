 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for those  who can't speak for themselves: the souls of our Nation's unborn and  newborn children.   I have long championed pro-life legislation and initiatives, but  recent events have shaken me and millions across our country,  compelling me to address this body.   The act of abortion is tragic and heartbreaking; however, the  termination of human life for abortion survivors is something worse-- criminal, subhuman. But proposals exist in our State governments that  would allow just that.   Allowing an infant to die or intentionally killing an abortion  survivor is a disgrace and must not be allowed to happen in any  circumstance.   I echo the calls from Republican leadership to immediately pass the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to ensure the sanctity of  life remains a fundamental principle in this country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation, but first, I want to congratulate our committee's  distinguished chair and ranking member on their masterful work in  shepherding this compromise to the floor. This is a historic dynamic  duo that we have in charge of our committee, and they have produced the  historic product that we have before us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis at our southern border, period. There  is no denying that our Nation's security is threatened by the seemingly  unending flow of drugs that find their way into nearly every American  community, as well as the violence of the brutal cartels that profit  from this trade.   Where does it take place? On that border. So we do have a problem. It  is an emergency. President Trump is absolutely correct that we can't  allow this ruthless criminality to continue unchecked.   This bill takes important steps to secure this country: $1.3 billion  for further construction at the border for a wall and additional  resources for DHS to hire more personnel and deploy advanced technology  in the region.   In addition to the security crisis, there is also a very real  humanitarian crisis that we simply can't ignore. Thousands of  vulnerable women and children are seeking a better, safer life in the  confines of this country. It is not the American way to turn our backs  on these people, and that is precisely why we have processes under  Federal law to facilitate legal entry into our country.   This bill also takes important steps to enforce our current  immigration laws. The bill funds an expansion of the Alternatives to  Detention program. It also increases attorney and courtroom staffing to  reduce the backlog of currently pending immigration cases.   While the challenges at our border have rightly grabbed headlines,  the bill also funds a number of other important Federal agencies  through the end of the fiscal year. Importantly, it ensures that our  dedicated public servants can continue to show up to work without fear  of losing another paycheck.   In my Kentucky district, for example, hundreds of Federal prison  employees showed up to a dangerous, difficult, often thankless job for  over a month, not knowing when the next paycheck would come, if at all.  I thank them, and I am pleased to support this bill that will continue  to support the Bureau of Prisons.   Also for Kentucky, this bill continues our momentum in combating the  opioid epidemic by fully supporting community prevention efforts and  drug courts to get people into treatment.   This bill also provides $115 million for the abandoned mine lands  pilot program, which helps create economic development in Appalachian  coal communities.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, I am especially pleased  that this bill includes significant funding to secure our diplomatic  posts and to support critical allies like Israel, Jordan, Egypt,  Georgia, Ukraine, and others.   The bill also continues vigorous oversight of U.S. assistance  programs, prohibits funding for the Green Climate Fund, and respects  the sanctity of life around the world.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect. It is not everything we  wanted, but it is a true product of compromise. I urge my colleagues to  support it.
