 Madam President, today I wish to honor a longtime and  vital member of my staff, John E. Hoehne, Jr., for serving the people  of Idaho and our Nation for 25 years, both as my chief of staff during  my service in the U.S. House of Representatives and as my chief of  staff during my service in the U.S. Senate.   John has been with me since before the beginning of my congressional  service, leading my first congressional campaign. He officially became  my chief of staff when I was sworn into office in the U.S. House of  Representatives in January of 1993. His encouragement, wise counsel,  and friendship have been invaluable in decisionmaking and advancing  policy and legislative objectives. I cannot thank him enough for his  dedication and ongoing assistance.   John has contributed greatly to all aspects of my work, and he has  helped advance countless legislative and policy efforts of importance  for Idaho. He is instrumental in his work on first protecting Idaho's  water sovereignty and economy while trying to find a consensus solution  to anadromous fish recovery. He works to preserve Idaho's natural  resources and quality of life. His passion for collaborative problem- solving in addressing natural resources challenges has helped give  collaborative efforts every opportunity to succeed. John has been a  driving force in bringing stakeholders with often diverging viewpoints  to the table to build common ground and has helped provide room for  stakeholders to talk and resolve concerns rather than resort to  litigation. His involvement was essential in the enactment and  implementation of the Owyhee Initiative and has been of great  assistance with other collaborative efforts, such as the Clearwater  Basin Collaborative.   John has also been at the forefront of helping Idahoans who have had  challenges with Federal agencies. Earlier in his tenure, he helped get  reason to prevail to the benefit of an Idaho community in a dispute  with a Federal agency over how to best address mining cleanup. He was  also heavily involved in addressing problems a timber company in  southeast Idaho was having with another Federal agency. John intervened  on the company's behalf and helped resolve the issues. These are just a  few of the many achievements John has assisted with for Idahoans.   Every step of the way, John has been there with reasoned counsel and  a great sense of the bigger picture. I serve the people of Idaho in  Washington, DC, and I believe in strong ties to the State. Although it  seems to be a less common arrangement to have a chief of staff based in  the State, I have been fortunate to have a principal member of my staff  based in Boise fulltime and centrally involved in Idaho issues. His  deep knowledge, understanding of Idaho, and ability to effectively  represent me have been beneficial. John is well respected in all  corners of our great State. In an era and political environment where  turnover is common, John's 25 years of committed service is a testament  to his deep dedication to Idahoans.   Thank you, John, for your extraordinary counsel and friendship all  these years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor Susan Hawkes  Wheeler, chief of staff for my Washington, DC, office, for her 25 years  of congressional service. Susan's trusted, dedicated, and perceptive  counsel have been of great value throughout my congressional service.   Susan is a native of Idaho and has always had the Gem State's  interests in the forefront of her mind. I am fortunate that she chose  to serve Idaho through my office. I first met Susan when she worked as  a television reporter and news manager in Boise and Idaho Falls. She  covered me when I first ran for public office. Later, after a job  interview on a twin-engine plane flying between Boise and Twin Falls, I  hired her to help me get elected to Congress. Her sharp wit and  directness was and is refreshing and effective.   After my election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Susan joined  my congressional staff as press secretary and moved from Idaho to  Washington, DC. This was back at a time when faxes still came on  thermal curly paper and speed dials were limited to 10 numbers per  machine. Radio actualities were done by actually splicing audiotape and  calling each radio station separately to play the soundbite for them  over the phone line, which was a landline. As technologies advanced,  she met those changes with imaginative approaches and implemented  innovative ways to improve communications and outreach with Idahoans.  Her responsibilities also increased in my office.   Susan served as my acting administrative assistant during my last  year in the House. Then, in the Senate, she served as my communications  director until June 2011, when she earned the job of chief of staff-DC.  She proved herself someone who can always be counted on for a  straightforward and reasoned approach, no matter the situation or the  audience. She helped make the office more effective and has been  integral to improving the way our office communicates with Idahoans.   She improved the quality of the communication in my office, both  externally and within the office. Her extensive work making the website  a better resource for Idahoans has also resulted in it being recognized  through multiple awards. Another of her achievements is the focus she  has given to establishing office procedures and working with Senate  administrative offices to fine-tune policies that enable smooth office  operations. She also serves as a great example of leadership,  communicating well with staff, and empowering them to share insight.  While helping me become more effective, Susan has also taken the time  to mentor countless staff and help young people start their careers.   From day one, no matter the job title, Susan has always been a senior  counselor with trusted insight given her deep familiarity with Idaho,  experience, and sound judgement.   Thank you, Susan, for dedicating so much of your time and talent to  serving the people of Idaho in Congress and for your strong support and  steady friendship.                            ____________________
