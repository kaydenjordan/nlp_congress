Mr. President, last week on this Senate floor, I made the  case for Democrats and Republicans joining together to confirm one of  the most qualified individuals ever nominated to the U.S. Supreme  Court. I was referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick Garland.   I don't wish to belabor the point here this evening, but it bears  repeating that Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial  experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United  States.   It bears repeating that Judge Garland is an extraordinary man, a good  man, a brilliant man, a fair judge, and a consensus builder on the  bench in a day and age when we need consensus builders on the Supreme  Court and other courts across the country. Frankly, we also need them  right here on this floor, in this body.   It bears repeating that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination  was unprecedented in the history of the United States of America and in  the history of the Senate.   Since the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings on  Supreme Court nominations in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever  been denied a hearing and a vote--until Judge Garland. Many of our  Republican colleagues refused to meet with him. When his nomination  expired at noon on January 3, 2017, 293 days had passed--293 wasted  days.   A good man was treated badly. I believe our Constitution was treated  badly. I believe that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination was  unprecedented. I believe it was shameful. From my view, we cannot  pretend that this vacant seat on the Supreme Court--what I believe  should be Judge Garland's seat--is anything other than blatant  partisanship.   I believe that upholding my oath to protect the Constitution means  finding agreement on moving Judge Garland's nomination forward at the  same time--at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President  Trump's Supreme Court nominee.   I have no choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination this week  because anything else would be a stamp of approval for what I believe  is playing politics with Supreme Court nominees. I cannot support Judge  Gorsuch's nomination because we cannot have one set of rules for  Democratic Presidents and another set of rules for Republican  Presidents.   Some of my colleagues and maybe some of the Americans listening at  home tonight may be asking themselves: Well, Senator Carper, didn't the  Democrats change the rules for judges when they were in the majority?  That is a fair question. To that, I would say yes. That is true for  lower court nominees, nominees to Federal district courts and courts of  appeals.   But it wasn't because Senator Harry Reid woke up one morning and  decided that was the day to change the rules of the Senate. A decision  of this magnitude didn't happen on a whim. It was because, by the time  November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to  block--get this--more nominations in the first 5 years of President  Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined. Let me say that  again. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our  Republican friends had attempted to block more nominations in the first  5 years of President Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined.   It wasn't the unprecedented use of cloture motions--79 cloture  motions--during those 5 years that precipitated Democrats' seeking a  solution to restore the capability of the Senate to do its job. It was  because our Republican friends refused to consider any nominee--any  nominee--to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, despite three critical  vacancies on our Nation's second highest court.   So, yes, it is true that Democrats supported a change that allowed a  vote on those nominees, but it was because our Republican friends took  the unheard of position that no nominees--no nominees, no matter their  qualifications--were entitled to a vote.   I should note that Democrats were careful to preserve the 60 votes  for Supreme Court nominees.   Let me just say that, if there is any position in the Federal  Government that should require at least 60 votes, my view is it should  be the Supreme Court, and that is the rule under which we operate as of  this moment.   One of the reasons why is because Supreme Court vacancies come around  quite rarely. When they do, we need to ensure that debate is robust, we  need to ensure that the nominee is from the judicial and the political  mainstream, and we need to ensure that these lifetime appointments are  held to the highest standards. In other words, I believe we need a  nominee like Judge Merrick Garland.   Despite his own impressive resume, I have concerns with Judge  Gorsuch's nomination beyond the treatment of Judge Garland, and I have  concerns with the way that our debate has not been, frankly, robust. I  have concerns that Judge Gorsuch's views are outside the judicial and  political mainstream, and I have concerns about what others have termed  ``evasiveness.'' His evasiveness before the Judiciary Committee does  not meet the high standards that we should expect for those lifetime  appointments.   I would be remiss if I did not mention what I referred to last week  as the cloud that lingers still over President Trump's campaign. Like  many Americans, I read the news related to Russia and the Trump  campaign, and I come to the inescapable conclusion that the cloud is  darkening and the forecast is a matter of grave concern for our  Constitution.   FBI Director Jim Comey has testified under oath that there is an  ongoing investigation to determine the links between the Trump campaign  and Russia, an adversary that attacked our election and undermined a  free and fair election to change the outcome of that election. From all  appearances, they did.   To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch--who is 49 years old, who  could serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century-- without first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular  actions of Trump campaign officials would be, in my view, a mistake.  [[Page S2210]]    For many Americans, this Supreme Court seat will always come with an  asterisk attached to it. They believe and I believe that it was a  stolen seat that belonged to Judge Merrick Garland.   Many Americans are wondering why we are rushing to fill a lifetime  vacancy while President Trump's campaign remains under investigation  and will for at least some while.   I believe we have some time. Judge Garland waited 293 days for a  hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch has waited 48 days  for a hearing and many of our Republican friends would like to see him  seated this week.   Again, I would say: Judge Merrick Garland waited 293 days for a  hearing and a vote that never, never came.   What we face here today, I think, is a rush to judgment. I would just  say that we have time. We ought to hit the pause button on this  nomination.   The American people are watching us, and history will judge us. I  fear that history may judge us poorly if anyone other than Merrick  Garland is confirmed at this time. I fear that history may judge us  poorly if we do not insist that the Trump campaign is first cleared of  any wrongdoing before we move forward. We need to get this right. We  have time to get this right.   The Senate has been through it all. The good men and women of the  Senate have always disagreed--sometimes passionately, oftentimes  loudly. I understand that this disagreement before us may seem  irresolvable, but that is only if we seek to cut off debate and admit  defeat. Personally speaking, I am not ready to do that today or this  week.   I believe we have time. I believe we have the opportunity to right a  historic wrong. We have not just an opportunity to right a historic  wrong but also an obligation to get this right.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is pretty obvious, based on the  announcement Senators have made, that we are experiencing the first  partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the  country.   We have had plenty of time to discuss Judge Gorsuch and his  credentials both in committee and on the floor, and I think it is now  important to move forward.    Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise today, on behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation--Senator  Chris Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, and myself--to honor  the exemplary service of Delaware Supreme Court Justice Randy J.  Holland. His talent and expertise is admired by both Republicans and  Democrats alike. Justice Holland was the youngest person to serve on  the Delaware Supreme Court when he was appointed and confirmed by  Delaware Governor Mike Castle in 1986. I had the honor of reappointing  him to a second 12-year term when I was Governor of Delaware in 1999.  Then, in March 2011, he was reappointed again by Governor Markell and  unanimously confirmed by the Senate for an unprecedented third 12-year  term. His length on the Delaware Supreme Court--30 years and the  longest in history--is a result of his broad knowledge of the law and  of our State and the respect and professionalism he upholds on and off  the bench.   Delaware's supreme court has a reputation for handling complex  disputes in a knowledgeable, reliable, and expedient way. It is no  doubt that Justice Holland was an integral part of making Delaware's  highest court one of the  [[Page S2422]]  most respected in the Nation and highly regarded internationally. Over  the course of three decades, Justice Holland has written more than 700  opinions and several thousand orders and gained the reputation as an  expert in Delaware's constitutional law. He has done this all with a  unique sense of humility and respect for others, something that fellow  judges and attorneys have and will continue to emulate. He is the  embodiment of the ``Golden Rule,'' always treating others the way he  would like to be treated.   It is perhaps his homegrown knowledge of Delaware and his experience  as a general practitioner of the law that allowed Justice Holland to  make his mark in the Supreme Court. He grew up in Milford, DE, and went  on to graduate from Swarthmore College, University of Pennsylvania Law  School, and the University of Virginia Law School. Before joining the  bench at age 39, Justice Holland was a partner at Morris, Nichols,  Arsht and Tunnell in Georgetown, DE, where he was known for his ability  to draw clients from all over the State on issues ranging from  corporate and contract law to zoning and real estate transactions.  During this time, he had the opportunity to appear before almost every  judge in every court of the State. It was this wide breadth of  knowledge that made him an excellent choice for Delaware's supreme  court, even though he had no judicial experience at all.   Justice Holland's colleagues describe him as a mentor and a role  model and have relied on him throughout the years for his institutional  knowledge of Delaware and the court. This especially came into practice  during an unprecendeted turnover in the Delaware Supreme Court. That  turnover allowed Governor Jack Markell to appoint four justices,  including the chief justice, to the five-officer court. Justice  Holland's help and guidance to his colleagues throughout this  transitional time proved vital as they became acclimated to their new  roles.   When Justice Holland was not in his role as an officer of the court,  he was writing. Regarded internationally as an author and historian,  Justice Holland has written, coauthored, or edited nine books including  ``Delaware Supreme Court Golden Anniversary,'' ``Delaware Constitution  of 1897,'' ``The First One Hundred Years,'' ``Magna Carta: Muse &  Mentor,'' ``Delaware's Destiny Determined By Lewes,'' and ``Delaware  Corporation Law, Selected Cases.'' He has also published several law  review articles, primarily dealing with judicial ethics and legal  history.   Over his three decades on the Delaware Supreme Court, Justice Holland  has received numerous awards, including the 2014 American Inns of Court  Powell Award for Professionalism and Ethics, 2012 First State  Distinguished Service Award, and the 2011 Dwight D. Opperman Award. In  2004, he was elected to be an Honorable Master of the Bench by  Lincoln's Inn in London. He was also recognized by members of our  Nation's highest court--Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John  Roberts--when they appointed him as the State judge member of the  Federal Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules.   On behalf of Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, let me  express our heartfelt thanks to Justice Holland for his service to our  State and judicial system. Today we are honored to be able to offer him  our sincere congratulations on a job well done. It will be quite a  change not to see him sitting on the second chair in from the left, but  we look forward to him continuing to share his deep knowledge about the  history and legacy of Delaware law. From our hearts, we wish him and  his wife, Ilona, along with their son Ethan and daughter-in-law  Jennifer and granddaughters Aurora and Chloe, many happy, healthy, and  successful years to come.                            ____________________
