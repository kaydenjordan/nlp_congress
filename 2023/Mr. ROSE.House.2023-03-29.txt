 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act because lowering energy costs is a top priority of  Tennesseans.   Since President Biden took office, energy costs have skyrocketed. To  make matters worse, congressional Democrats poured gasoline on the fire  by passing a $370 billion Green New Deal giveaway that has done nothing  to address the root cause of record-high energy costs and inflation.   My neighbors often ask, Why have energy costs gone up so much, so  quickly? Why is the President not doing anything about it?  Unfortunately, the Biden administration prioritizes the demands of  woke, leftwing activists that would rather hold our economy hostage  than promote the cleanest, most affordable energy produced right here  in the United States.   Madam Chair, because of the reckless policies of the Biden  administration, Republicans have many priorities this Congress, but our  number one priority is to lower energy costs on behalf of the American  people.
