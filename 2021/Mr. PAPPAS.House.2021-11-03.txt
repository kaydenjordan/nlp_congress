 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life and  service of New Hampshire State Police Staff Sergeant Jesse Sherrill.  Staff Sergeant Sherrill was tragically killed on October 28 when his  cruiser was struck by a tractor-trailer when he was on duty working an  overnight detail.   This is an immeasurable loss for his family and community and the  entire State of New Hampshire.   Today, our State will pause for a celebration of life for Staff  Sergeant Sherrill. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife and their  children and extended family. We must never forget his dedicated  service to keeping our State safe and the burden borne by the Sherrill  family.   My thoughts are also with the men and women of the New Hampshire  State Police and law enforcement community that has lost one of its  own.   Day in and day out, those who serve and protect our communities risk  their own safety for all of us. We can never forget their sacrifice.   I urge Granite Staters to take time to reflect on the legacy of Staff  Sergeant Sherrill and to keep his family in your thoughts and prayers.   Through this horrible tragedy, we must honor his example and keep his  memory alive.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1917) to modify eligibility requirements for certain hazard  mitigation assistance programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1917         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hazard Eligibility and Local       Projects Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF ACQUISITION OR                     RELOCATION PROJECTS.         (a) Eligibility for Assistance for Initiated Projects.--  [[Page H6137]]         (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, an entity seeking assistance under a hazard mitigation       assistance program shall be eligible to receive such       assistance for a covered project if the entity--        (A) complies with all other eligibility requirements of the       hazard mitigation assistance program for acquisition or       relocation projects, including extinguishing all incompatible       encumbrances; and        (B) complies with all Federal requirements for the project.        (2) Costs incurred.--An entity seeking assistance under a       hazard mitigation assistance program shall be responsible for       any project costs incurred by the entity for a covered       project if the covered project is not awarded, or is       determined to be ineligible for, assistance.        (b) Definitions.--In this section, the following       definitions apply:        (1) Covered project.--The term ``covered project'' means--        (A) an acquisition or relocation project for which an       entity began implementation prior to grant award under a       hazard mitigation assistance program; and        (B) a project for which an entity initiated planning or       construction before or after requesting assistance for the       project under a hazard mitigation assistance program       qualifying for a categorical exemption under the National       Environmental Policy Act.        (2) Hazard mitigation assistance program.--The term       ``hazard mitigation assistance program'' means--        (A) the predisaster hazard mitigation grant program       authorized under section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       5133);        (B) the hazard mitigation grant program authorized under       section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and       Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c); and        (C) the flood mitigation assistance program authorized       under section 1366 of the National Flood Insurance Act of       1968 (42 U.S.C. 4104c).        (c) Applicability.--This section shall apply to funds       appropriated on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on H.R. 1917.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1917, introduced and  championed by Representative Fletcher. The Hazard Eligibility and Local  Projects, or HELP Act, is designed to cut through red tape to unlock  Federal assistance to State and local governments to complete some of  the most basic mitigation projects more efficiently, such as buyouts of  flood-prone properties. It represents a change to the current law's  one-size-fits-all approach to reviewing projects that frequently delays  mitigation work which will be welcome news to communities across my  State in New Hampshire, and across our country as we deal with more  frequent severe weather events that may require a Federal response.   The National Institute of Building Sciences has conducted significant  analysis on the return on investment to taxpayers for investments in  mitigation. Congress, under both Democratic and Republican majorities,  has seen fit to bolster investments in mitigation to drive down future  disaster response and recovery costs.   Just last week, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  marked up the Resilient AMERICA Act which would align the calculation  used to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency's pre-disaster  mitigation program with the agency's post-disaster mitigation program.   FEMA's longest-running mitigation program, the Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program, or HMGP, began in 1989 and provides assistance after a  disaster has struck. While there have been more than $5.2 billion  obligated to HMGP projects, more than $1 billion in HMGP dollars have  gone unobligated and will return to FEMA.   This bill will help disaster-impacted communities complete the land  acquisition and simple construction projects that would otherwise be  categorically exempt from a NEPA review, streamlining the process with  FEMA. I want to commend Congresswoman Fletcher for her efforts to help  disaster-vulnerable communities quicken the pace of recoveries and  mitigate against future events.   I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. I reserve  the balance of my time.           Committtee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, November 1, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1917, the Hazard Eligibility and Local Projects Act.

In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving provisions within this legislation on       which the Committee on Financial Services has a valid       jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       1917.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, November 1, 2021.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1917, the       ``Hazard Eligibility and Local Projects Act.'' In order to       permit H.R. 1917 to proceed expeditiously to the House Floor,       I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 1917 in light of our       mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration       of H.R. 1917 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward with regard to any matters in the Committee's       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       that involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 1917.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Fletcher  again for her leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to pass  this commonsense piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on H.R. 1339, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill introduced by the  gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids) as well as the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).   Once viewed as only a figment of people's imagination, flying cars  are now on the verge of becoming a reality and will take to the skies  in no time, thanks to recent innovations in aircraft and propulsion  technology. Advanced air mobility, or AAM, vehicles have the potential  to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce the current burden on surface  infrastructure, create good-paying U.S. jobs, and provide a more  environmentally sustainable mode of daily transportation. In fact, last  year, my home State of New Hampshire became the first State to safely  allow roadable aircraft to use our roads, once they become certified  for travel.   But as these new aircraft emerge in an already complex U.S. airspace,  we must ensure that they are safe, both for those on board and those on  the ground.   H.R. 1339, the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act,  would establish an interagency working group, bringing together the  Federal Government, States and localities, the aerospace industry,  labor unions, and other key stakeholders to plan and coordinate efforts  to safely integrate AAM operations in our national airspace system.   The interagency working group's recommendations on safety, security,  and infrastructure needs will help support the deployment of this  technology and advance U.S. leadership in this emerging global  industry. This legislation has support from both sides of the aisle and  the endorsement of several organizations representing the U.S. aviation  and aerospace sector.   Madam Speaker, I support this bipartisan bill, I urge my colleagues  to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we thank Holly as well for her  contributions to the House and to this important issue area and wish  her all best in her next steps.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3193) to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act  of 1965 to provide for a high-speed broadband deployment initiative, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3193         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3193, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3193, the Eliminating  Barriers to Rural Internet Development Grant Eligibility, or E-BRIDGE,  Act.   Introduced by Ranking Member Graves and Representative Guest, the  bill would create a high-speed  [[Page H6142]]  broadband initiative at the Economic Development Administration and  clarify that public-private partnerships and consortiums are eligible  for broadband project grant awards.   Access to reliable high-speed internet is vital for participation in  today's workforce and economy. Whether it is working or learning from  home, communicating virtually with friends and family, shopping online,  or consulting with your doctor remotely, almost every aspect of our  daily lives now relies on a connection to the internet.   Unfortunately, millions of people across the country still don't have  access to high-speed internet. In my home State of New Hampshire, 10  percent of households lack an internet subscription. This problem is  especially prevalent in rural America.   According to a study by the Pew Research Center, almost 30 percent of  rural Americans don't have access to high-speed broadband internet  services at home. This poses challenges for our small businesses, for  students, for families.   Passing this legislation will help our rural communities thrive by  removing existing barriers to internet development.   EDA already has the authority to award grants to fund the deployment  of broadband infrastructure in communities in most need of assistance,  but many communities lack the financial and technical resources  necessary to properly develop broadband deployment strategies.   In order to effectively deploy broadband projects in the last mile,  local communities must have the flexibility to collaborate with public- private partnerships and consortiums in developing these proposals. By  clarifying that public-private partnerships and consortiums are  eligible for EDA grants, H.R. 3193 ensures that communities can  leverage private-sector expertise without disqualifying them from  receiving assistance.   This bill also provides grant applicants with additional flexibility  in financing broadband infrastructure projects by clarifying that funds  can be combined with other Federal resources and allowing real or  personal property to count toward the non-Federal share of a project's  cost.   Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for introducing this  critical legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, November 3, 2021.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3193, the       ``E-BRIDGE Act.'' In order to permit H.R. 3193 to proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 3193 in light of our       mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration       of H.R. 3193 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward with regard to any matters in the Committee's       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       that involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3193.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, November 3, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3193, the E-BRIDGE Act. I appreciate your willingness to       work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing formal consideration on       H.R. 3193, the Committee on Financial Services does not waive       any future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or       similar legislation, and that your Committee will be       consulted and involved on any matters in your Committee's       jurisdiction should this legislation move forward. In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving provisions within this legislation on       which the Committee on Financial Services has a valid       jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       3193.            Sincerely,                                                     Peter DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves and Mr.  Guest for their leadership on this important issue. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3709) to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to submit to Congress a report on preliminary damage  assessments and make necessary improvements to processes in the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3709         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preliminary Damage       Assessment Improvement Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Preliminary damage assessments play a critical role in       assessing and validating the impact and magnitude of a       disaster.        (2) Through the preliminary damage assessment process,       representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency       validate information gathered by State and local officials       that serves as the basis for disaster assistance requests.        (3) Various factors can impact the duration of a       preliminary damage assessment and the corresponding       submission of a major disaster request, however, the average       time between when a disaster occurs, and the submission of a       corresponding disaster request has been found to be       approximately twenty days longer for flooding disasters.        (4) With communities across the country facing increased       instances of catastrophic flooding and other extreme weather       events, accurate and efficient preliminary damage assessments       have become critically important to the relief process for       impacted States and municipalities.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall submit to Congress a report       describing the preliminary damage assessment process, as       supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the 5       years before the date of enactment of this Act.        (b) Contents.--The report described in subsection (a) shall       contain the following:        (1) The process of the Federal Emergency Management Agency       for deploying personnel to support preliminary damage       assessments.        (2) The number of Agency staff participating on disaster       assessment teams.        (3) The training and experience of such staff described in       paragraph (2).        (4) A calculation of the average amount of time disaster       assessment teams described in paragraph (1) are deployed to a       disaster area.        (5) The efforts of the Agency to maintain a consistent       liaison between the Agency and State, local, tribal, and       territorial officials within a disaster area.       SEC. 4. PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall convene an advisory panel       consisting of emergency management personnel employed by       State, local, territorial, or tribal authorities, and the       representative organizations of such personnel to assist the       Agency in improving critical components of the preliminary       damage assessment process.        (b) Membership.--        (1) In general.--This advisory panel shall consist of at       least 2 representatives from national emergency management       organizations and at least 1 representative from each of the       10 regions of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,       selected from emergency management personnel employed by       State, local, territorial, or tribal authorities within each       region.        (2) Inclusion on panel.--To the furthest extent       practicable, representation on the advisory panel shall       include emergency management personnel from both rural and       urban jurisdictions.        (c) Considerations.--The advisory panel convened under       subsection (a) shall--        (1) consider--        (A) establishing a training regime to ensure preliminary       damage assessments are conducted and reviewed under       consistent guidelines;        (B) utilizing a common technological platform to integrate       data collected by State and local governments with data       collected by the Agency; and        (C) assessing instruction materials provided by the Agency       for omissions of pertinent information or language that       conflicts with other statutory requirements; and        (2) identify opportunities for streamlining the       consideration of preliminary damage assessments by the       Agency, including eliminating duplicative paperwork       requirements and ensuring consistent communication and       decision making among Agency staff.        (d) Interim Report.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit       to Congress a report regarding the findings of the advisory       panel, steps that will be undertaken by the Agency to       implement the findings of the advisory panel, and additional       legislation that may be necessary to implement the findings       of the advisory panel.        (e) Rulemaking and Final Report.--Not later than 2 years       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator       shall issue such regulations as are necessary to implement       the recommendations of the advisory panel and submit to       Congress a report discussing--        (1) the implementation of recommendations from the advisory       panel;        (2) the identification of any additional challenges to the       preliminary damage assessment process, including whether       specific disasters result in longer preliminary damage       assessments; and        (3) any additional legislative recommendations necessary to       improve the preliminary damage assessment process.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3709.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3709, introduced and  championed by Representatives Katko and Delgado, two colleagues of ours  on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   The Preliminary Damage Assessment, or PDA, Improvement Act would  direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to produce a report  examining the PDA process and establish a more consistent training  regime for FEMA personnel to effectively support State and local  officials as they conduct these assessments in the wake of disaster.   FEMA uses PDA findings to determine the extent of damage and the  subsequent unmet needs of individuals, businesses, and the public  sector in a disaster-impacted area.   This bill will ensure greater consistency of PDAs across FEMA's 10  regions by creating a training program with a goal of ensuring a more  consistent process of data collection and analysis.   As communities across the country experience more extreme weather  events, consistent and timely PDAs are more important than ever to the  recovery process.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation and ask my colleagues to do  the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to commend again my fellow  committee members for introducing this legislation. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2220) to amend title 40, United States Code, to modify the  treatment of certain bargain-price options to purchase at less than  fair market value, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2220         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON DISCOUNTED PURCHASE OPTIONS.         Section 585 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(d) Any bargain-price option to purchase at less than       fair market value contained in any lease agreement entered       into on or after January 1, 2021, pursuant to this section       may be exercised only to the extent specifically provided for       in subsequent appropriation Acts or other Acts of       Congress.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2220.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2220, introduced by Representatives Guest,  Webster, and Pence, requires the General Services Administration to  secure congressional authorization before it can exercise a  prenegotiated purchase option in an operating lease.   Currently, OMB rules stipulate that a lease cannot be scored as an  operating lease if it contains a prenegotiated bargain-price purchase  option. Operating leases allow agencies to budget their rent outlays  annually, whereas capital leases require the agency to budget, upfront,  the entire net present value of all rental obligations it will incur  over the duration of the lease term. Unless GSA has full, upfront  appropriations in hand, the agency must rely on operating leases that  can be paid for year by year.   But preventing an operating lease from containing a prenegotiated  bargain-price purchase option means that if GSA wants to acquire the  building at the end of the lease, the agency must pay fair market value  instead of being able to negotiate a sales price at the beginning of  the lease. In essence, the Federal Government ends up paying for the  building twice, once when it leases the building and once when it  purchases the building at the end of the lease at the current market  rate.   The scoring rules are designed to ensure that ownership risk stays  with the lessor and that the lease isn't a mechanism by which the  government finances its ownership of the property. But the effect is  that the Federal Government is overpaying for buildings and not getting  the benefit of equity that it has created for private-sector landlords.   It is time to give GSA the flexibility it needs to make savvy  financial deals for the Federal Government. I urge adoption of this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 390) to redesignate the Federal building located at 167  North Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee as the ``Odell Horton Federal  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 390         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION.         The Federal building located at 167 North Main Street in       Memphis, Tennessee, commonly known as the ``Clifford Davis       and Odell Horton Federal Building'', shall be known and       designated as the ``Odell Horton Federal Building''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the Federal building       referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to       the ``Odell Horton Federal Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 390.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 390 designates the Federal building at 167 North  Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee, as the Odell Horton Federal  Building.   The bill is sponsored by our colleague from Tennessee, Representative    Steve Cohen, and it is cosponsored by the entire Tennessee  congressional delegation.   Currently, the Federal building in downtown Memphis is named for  Clifford Davis, a former Congressman who was a member of the KKK, and  this legislation would rename the building in honor of Judge Odell  Horton, the first Black Federal judge and assistant U.S. attorney in  Tennessee since Reconstruction, who was nominated by President Jimmy  Carter and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1980.   The history of America is replete with acts of bigotry, oppression,  and hatred. We can't erase it, but we can make sure we don't honor it.  I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cohen for his  sponsorship of this legislation, for the bipartisan support that it  enjoys.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to require  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a study on the  number of job applicants impacted by age discrimination and issue  recommendations on addressing age discrimination in the job application  process.   Nearly half of older job applicants report being asked for age- related information when applying for a job, and three-quarters of  workers over the age of 45 lack confidence in their ability to find a  new job due to age discrimination.   This poses a significant challenge for workers in my home State of  New Hampshire. As a State with an aging workforce, New Hampshire  businesses are concerned about both how to attract talent and how to  ensure that the institutional knowledge and experience of workers  reaching retirement age is passed down. When workers are pushed out of  our labor force by age discrimination or by the concern that they may  face discrimination, our businesses and communities lose the benefit of  their knowledge and experience.   Strengthening age discrimination laws is the right thing to do  because it will both protect workers and also serve to help keep them  in our labor force at a time when businesses are already struggling to  attract talent. In our changing economy, we need to ensure that older  workers continue to have opportunities available to them.   We must pass the Protect Older Job Applicants Act to clarify that job  applicants can challenge discriminatory hiring practices under the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act, and I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense amendment and help us gain a better understanding of  the issues that older job applicants face when applying for jobs and  the solutions that are needed to stop discriminatory practices.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in support of the  underlying legislation, one from the American Federation of Government  Employees and one from the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations.                                             American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents       more than 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees,       I urge you to vote for H.R. 3992, the ``Protect Older Job       Applicants (POJA) Act of 2021.''        Under existing law, the Age Discrimination in Employment       Act (ADEA) only applies to currently employed people seeking       recourse in the face of employment discrimination based on       age. The ADEA does not cover job applicants who experience       age discrimination in hiring, including applicants for       federal government positions.        H.R. 3992 extends the protections of the ADEA to external       job applicants in addition to employees. Specifically, this       legislation would allow job applicants to be able to bring       disparate impact discrimination claims under the ADEA. The       bill would protect older Americans against employment       discrimination that prevent them from even getting a foot in       the door. Considering the heightened long-term unemployment       struggles older Americans have experienced during the COVID-      19 pandemic, this bill is critically important.        Building on our support for H.R. 1230, the ``Protecting       Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,'' AFGE is proud to       be a  [[Page H6165]]       leader in the fight against all forms of employment       discrimination including those affecting older Americans.       Please support H.R. 3992, the ``Protect Older Job Applicants       (POJA) Act of 2021.''            Sincerely,                                                  Julie N. Tippens,      Director, Legislative Department.                                   ____                                                  Leadership Council                                          of Aging Organizations,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: The Leadership Council of Aging       Organizations (LCAO) is a coalition of 69 national nonprofit       organizations concerned with the well-being of America's       older population and committed to representing their       interests in the policy-making arena. We urge you to       strengthen protections for older workers by voting for H.R.       3992, the Protect Older Job Applicants Act (POJA) of 2021.       POJA would clarify that the Age Discrimination in Employment       Act's (ADEA) prohibition against all forms of employment       discrimination based on age covers individuals during the       hiring phase of employment.        Age discrimination is pervasive and stubbornly entrenched.       It often starts in the hiring process when employers       circumvent anti-age discrimination laws by using such tactics       as setting a maximum number of years of experience that a       prospective employer will consider or setting up screening       processes that exclude older applicants. In 2020, 78 percent       of older workers reported having seen or experienced age       discrimination in the workplace--a significant increase from       61 percent in 2018. Age discrimination is also pervasive       among older women and African American workers--nearly two       thirds of women and three-fourths of African Americans say       they have seen or experienced workplace discrimination. The       COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on employment for       everyone, with older workers taking a harder hit. Those aged       55+ continue to experience long-term unemployment in greater       numbers, with 55.3 percent of older jobseekers unemployed for       27 weeks or more as of June 2021, compared to 36 percent of       younger workers. The rates were worse for older workers who       were black, female, or who did not have a college degree.        Although the ADEA was meant to apply to all forms of age       discrimination in hiring, recent court decisions have       narrowly interpreted the applicability of ADEA's protections       and have excluded job applicants who are subjected to hiring       practices that have a discriminatory impact based on age,       such as specifying a maximum number of years of experience.       The Protect Older Job Applicants Act would clarify that older       workers seeking employment should be protected from all forms       of age discrimination in hiring.        We urge Congress to swiftly pass the Protect Older Job       Applicants Act and clarify the ADEA's prohibition against       hiring practices that have a discriminatory impact on older       workers.            Sincerely,                                                 Katie Smith Sloan,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will correct the record again on the fact  that the committee did hold a hearing on this subject on March 18,  2021.   At that hearing, Laurie McCann, a senior attorney at AARP Foundation,  testified about the erosion of protections for older workers in  judicial decisions under the ADEA, including specific mention in her  testimony of the Seventh Circuit's Kleber decision and its harmful  impact on applicants. So, that is well-documented.   This particular amendment seeks to give us additional information  going forward that would be valuable in understanding the plight of  older job applicants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), the cosponsor of the underlying  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
