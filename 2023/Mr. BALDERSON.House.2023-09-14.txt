 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for that great  introduction.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1435, the Preserving Choice in  Vehicle Purchases Act. We are here today because lawmakers in  California want to outright ban the sale of new vehicles with an  internal combustion engine. They are fed up with the pace of the free  market and want to force their consumers to switch to more expensive  electric vehicles.   This bill would simply prevent President Biden's EPA from granting  California the waiver needed to approve this ban.   If the California waiver is approved, over a dozen other States could  adopt identical standards to ban the internal combustion engine.   House Republicans believe that Americans should be able to purchase  the vehicle that meets their needs. The fact of the matter is that  consumers across America are wary of making the shift to electric  vehicles.   As Cox Automotive experts pointed out in July, the unsold inventory  of EVs across the Nation swelled nearly 350 percent this year. There  are 92,000 EVs currently sitting unsold on dealer lots.   As shown during the Secretary of Energy's recent EV road trip, there  are still major problems with owning and charging an EV in America  outside of big cities.   Regardless of whether you want to buy an EV or a traditional internal  combustion vehicle, House Republicans believe that you should have the  choice to purchase the vehicle that is best for you and your family.  This bill will do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this  commonsense bill.                                time  1500
