 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of the Respect for Marriage Act.   In all my decades of public service, I have never wavered in my  support for the LGBTQ+ community. In 1990, I introduced the first  legislation in New York State history to grant legal recognition to  same-sex couples.   When the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced in 1996, I was one of  67 House Members to vote against it. I knew then what I know now: DOMA  was a bigoted, discriminatory solution to a problem that never existed.   It never made sense that I, or anyone in this body or in this  country, could get in a cab and marry the cabdriver that same day or  some stranger on the street, but a bold, brave New Yorker and a friend  of mine named Edie Windsor could not have her marriage recognized.   She sued. She won in court. Today, this law will codify her court  case. I dedicate my remarks to her and thank her for her lifelong  commitment to LGBTQ rights and equality.   Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill.
