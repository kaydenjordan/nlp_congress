 Madam President, I am delighted the Senate has decided to  take up S. 140, a bill to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water  Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the  WMAT Settlement Fund which, in part, includes a bill I have  cosponsored, S. 63, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017.   S. 63 is a much needed reform measure aimed at correcting excessive  government overreach by the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB. In  2004, the NLRB overturned longstanding precedent by asserting its  authority over Native American Tribes. The NLRB never should have  expanded its authority to Indian Tribes located on Tribal land. This  decision has caused tremendous legal confusion and stagnation of Indian  business development. Fortunately, with passage of S. 140, the Congress  is acting to address bureaucratic overreach by the NLRB. I urge my  colleagues to support its passage.                            ____________________
