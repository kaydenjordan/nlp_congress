 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Noah Jacob Shahnavaz, an Indiana police officer who was killed in  the line of duty last year. Noah would have turned 25 today.   Noah was born in Indianapolis to Matt and Laurie Shahnavaz. After  graduating from Fishers High School, he enlisted in the Army where he  served as a sergeant and was awarded the distinguished Air Assault  Badge. He was deployed to the Middle East and two border missions.   Following his honorable discharge, Noah answered the call to service  once again and joined the Elwood Police Department in August of 2021.   On behalf of Indiana's Fifth Congressional District and our Nation, I  share my deepest appreciation and gratitude for Noah's service to our  Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence to remember Noah and the  heroes who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. You will not  be forgotten.                            ____________________
