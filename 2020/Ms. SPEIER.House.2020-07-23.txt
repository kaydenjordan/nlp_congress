 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I want to compliment her on a profound, articulate, and accurate  statement of what is wrong with what is going on in this country and  what is going on wrong in this body.   As one of the co-chairs of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I stand  here as the author of the letter, along with my colleagues, calling on  Mr. Yoho to apologize, demanding an apology from him to Ms. Ocasio- Cortez. He didn't give an apology yesterday, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez  indicated.   We really are at a watershed moment in this body. We have mourned the  loss of two great leaders of this body. John Lewis, we sat on this  floor last night for hours on both sides of the aisle talking about his  greatness. And what did he call us? He called us a family. A family  does not talk to each other as Mr. Yoho had talked to Ms. Ocasio- Cortez.   We mourn the loss of Congressman Elijah Cummings, who said, ``We are  better than this.''   We are better than this. We are the most diverse Congress ever in the  history of this country. Twenty-four percent of us are women; 8 percent  of us are women of color.   Now, where does this all come from? It comes from the top. It comes  from the White House, who calls women ``crazy Nancy'' or ``such a nasty  woman'' or ``a low-IQ person'' of a colleague of ours who serves as the  chair of a committee, a ``crazed, crying lowlife.''   Our colleague, Mr. Yoho, conducted himself like a hit-and-run driver,  and he does not want to take responsibility for his conduct. I believe  he must take responsibility for his conduct.   We are not, as women in this House, going anywhere. We are here to  stay. We belong here, and we will demand respect for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez  and every other woman in this House who has been demeaned by a  colleague, whether a Democrat or a Republican. It is not right, and we  can do better.
