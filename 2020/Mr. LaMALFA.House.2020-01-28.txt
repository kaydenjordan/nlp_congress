 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to make in order the Cole-McCarthy amendment that would ensure the  President can protect the United States and our ally, Israel.    Madam Speaker, I wish to commend EPA Administrator  Andrew Wheeler for his recent clearing up of the definition of waters  of the United States, known as WOTUS, indeed, causing a lot of woe for  people in my district and the Western U.S., especially.   Under the 2015 definition, it seemed every puddle, every ditch, every  possible water source was going to be brought under the fist of the  U.S. Government. With much dismay, many farmers, ranchers, people  building, and people doing simple things were unable to understand what  they were supposed to do. Indeed, it was a long arm of government  overreach.   What we have heard since then: ``Oh, the sky is falling. This is  going to roll back protections.''   These aren't protections. These are things that are way beyond the  scope of what government should be doing.   It limited the scope of rivers and large streams and our oceans. So  with all of ``the sky is falling'' you are hearing, no, it isn't  anything like that. Indeed, it is putting it back into more equitable  space.   What this rule does is, indeed, end the confusion and ends the  Federal overreach and helps us get back to business and still protect  the environment.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Newhouse for his leadership  on this and for providing this time for us here this evening to be able  to talk about this issue in a very real and constructive way.   The ESA passed in 1973, I think with a pretty strong bipartisan  effort, signed by President Nixon. It was very well intentioned at the  time, as were some of the other protection measures that were put in  place for air and water.   As we saw the other day here with the changing of the WOTUS rule, the  waters of the United States rule, over time, regulations can get out of  control. They can be used for politics. They can be used for  controlling people, for NIMBYism, and for no-growth and all that. I  think that is really what these have expanded into.   Our job is to provide oversight. Our job is to provide course  corrections, to make sure the ship is on the course it was intended 40- plus years ago.   The package of reforms that are being talked about by my colleagues  and the bills that are being offered aren't here to gut the Endangered  Species Act or to eliminate species. It is to bring back that course  correction that we are looking for.   Though it was signed 40 years ago, it is our job to constantly  monitor it and make sure it is working.   We talked earlier about that 3 percent of species that were listed  that have recovered. Now, 3 percent doesn't give you a very good  batting average, I think, in any league, so that would be considered a  failure.   It is not because of a lack of effort or lack of spending. Certainly,  in my own State of California, where species have been listed, we have  issues with fish, with delta smelt, with salmon, and yet trillions of  gallons of water are expended flushing the delta each year to find a  lower result. Only two smelt have been caught in their check traps in  the last five quarters, I think. That doesn't show success, but it  shows a lot of damage to the people who need that water for other  purposes as well.                                time  1815    So, let's find and focus on things that are going to be helpful to  the species to be recovered and doesn't have to damage people and their  livelihoods along the way.   Reform is necessary to refocus the efforts of the Federal Government  to help them recover more timely. One of the longtime listed in  California, the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, was listed for  approximately 40 years. And, yet, in 2012, the Fish and Wildlife  Service was saying: Okay, we think it is time to pull that from the  list. Let's do the work involved to remove it from the list because  they had seen some success in that time period.   An important part that we don't talk about enough is what is known as  critical habitat. Critical habitat is any host plant or other vehicle  for a possible endangered species that might take residence there.   So the bush itself, the elderberry bush, any one of those, basically  cannot be touched because it might be a potential habitat for a  traveling elderberry beetle, although maybe none of them have ever been  tracked in that particular area. Yet, every single bush--it is a  battle. It is a fight.   Now, why are we fighting over the bushes? It is because many of these  grow in floodplain areas, on levees that need to be maintained,  rebuilt, and upgraded. We have a lot of potential for flooding in  northern California.   Indeed, it wasn't so much potential as several times we have had bad  floods result. And I would mention in the Yuba City-Marysville area,  two very big floods in 1986 and 1997 that happened from crumbling  levees.   Why don't they maintain the levees?   Because they can't. It is getting the permits and getting through the  process and then being able to afford it by the time you have done that  with all the requirements that are put on to maintain this habitat.   To maintain these elderberry bushes, in this case, makes it cost  prohibitive for these local levee districts to be able to do their job.   So, what happens?   Nothing happens.   And so, in 1986 there was a giant flood, hundreds, thousands of homes  in 1986. In 1997, it happened again. If the lesson wasn't learned, 11  years later in 1997, it happened again in the Yuba City-Marysville  area. And at this point, three lives were lost in addition to all of  that other damage. Three lives were lost needlessly because we couldn't  learn the lessons and get the permits done to get the levee work done.   Why does that have to be?   Because of roadblocks, because of endless lawsuits and slow-moving  bureaucracies that won't issue the permits and help with the funding  that needs to get done.   So, finally, after all that was litigated, the government had to pay  approximately $400 million in damages for the losses of life and  property in these floods.   It is pretty disgusting. But still, every single bush is litigated as  a potential for critical habitat, even  [[Page H621]]  though there may not ever be one of the species you are talking about,  in this case the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, that might  potentially use it.   So what happened with the delisting in 2012?   Well, they finally gave up because of litigation and about how they  do the sampling of the beetle; how they do the sampling of the habitat  of the beetle.   They said, Well, we can't tell if it is the valley elderberry  longhorn beetle or the California elderberry longhorn beetle that might  be making these boreholes in the plants and in the ground there.   So they just gave up and said, We are not going to delist it anymore.   That is similar to the situation my colleagues were talking about  with the gray wolf. You can find plenty of gray wolves all over the  upper Midwest and those other States. Yet, the standard seems to be in  the Endangered Species Act, you have to find two or four remaining  pairs in every single county, otherwise it is still listed as  endangered in California or anywhere else.   The rules have gone too far. We need caps on the attorney's fees that  make it not such an incentive for environmental groups to use this as a  way to get paid as well as the way to stop progress, stop things that  people need.   So I hope this package of bills at least can be a light and example  of a direction we are trying to take back to reasonableness and how the  Endangered Species Act is interpreted and used; not abused, not used as  a weapon, weaponized against what we need for flood control to save  peoples' lives or water storage.   If we are going to play the climate-change game, then we need to be  able to have more of these tools available to us to store water.   It would certainly help if we had more input from our local  stakeholders on this who actually know how to get a project done.   Finally, the Marysville-Yuba City area I was talking about, using  local districts and local efforts, they did some amazing work after a  lot of roadblocks were overcome.   So finally, the last bit--which is up to the Army Corps of  Engineers--is going to be completed in that area of rebuilding the  levees and putting the slurry wall in that is going to make them much  less likely to erode and blow out. In 2020, the last piece is going to  be done, if the Army Corps stays on their own unique schedule.   This is many years after those two floods. So I commend the great  work that has been done up to this point, but how many needless years  of risk in these flood zones have to happen because we can't get out of  our own way because of a permit or because of somebody's interpretation  of a critical habitat for a creature that doesn't even show up to these  critical habitat areas?   I am tired of fighting the fight against people who don't seem to  care how it affects the people who they govern.   And so this is, I hope, a true effort that everybody can see to  reform this act into something that actually works for people, works  for the species, and gets a little better batting average than 3  percent recovery rate, which is pathetic, especially for the trillions  of gallons of water we lose to the delta each year, the risk we have  for people in flood zones, the high cost, the loss of potential, and  the anguish that all of that brings.    Madam Speaker, I am glad we had this time to be able to share this  with the public that is watching and our colleagues who are hopefully  listening that we can reform the act and still have it pursue the goals  of making the endangered species, that we talk about and care about,  come off those lists because they are thriving once again.   We have seen some successful examples. The bald eagles, which I can  see outside the window of my home in my rice field there, that is  pretty tremendous. But we have got to get our batting average up,  especially when you look at what it is costing society in lost  potential and, unfortunately, sometimes in lost lives.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Newhouse yielding me the time, and I  appreciate his efforts on this.
