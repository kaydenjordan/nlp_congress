 Madam President, the Senate opens this morning after a  very late night of amendment votes on the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act--USICA; those are the initials--five in total, four of  which of these amendments were sponsored by Republicans. So far on this  bill, the Senate has held votes on no fewer than 18 amendments, 4 from  Democrats and 14 from Republicans, and there are more to come.   As I mentioned yesterday, in a landmark moment for bipartisanship in  the Senate, we even adopted an amendment from Senator Rand Paul by  voice vote. Yes, that is right. I said the two words together. Rand  Paul; voice vote--four words. I said the two concepts together: Rand  Paul; voice vote--four words.   Now, the media will tell you that if you are talking process, you are  losing, but the process was really important here. For years, Senators  have been clamoring for a more open process and more amendment votes. I  can't tell you how many speeches I have heard on the floor about the  virtues of regular order. Well, this competition bill ought to be the  answer to my colleagues' prayers.   The bill has moved through regular order, flying through various  Senate committees with staggering bipartisan votes. The entire Senate  opted to take up the bill by a vote of 86 to 11.   Here on the floor, we have held the kind of vigorous, bipartisan,  open amendment process that Senators have been calling for. Some of  these votes were tough for our side. In the old days, we would have  said no. We said yes, we will vote for them, but let's keep moving  forward, and we are.   Listen to this. It is only May, roughly 5 months since Democrats took  the majority in this Chamber, and already more amendments have received  rollcall votes than during any of the past 4 years. Let me repeat that  so people hear it from one end of the Capitol to the other,  particularly on this side of the aisle. In 5 months, more amendments  have received rollcall votes in this Democrat-led Senate than during  any of the years in which Donald Trump was President and Senator  McConnell was majority leader.   We have considered the competition bill in an exceedingly bipartisan  way.  [[Page S3548]]  There will be a few final steps to take, a few final amendments to  consider, but I hope my Republican colleagues have seen our commitment  to developing, drafting, and perfecting this legislation in total  concert with the other side of the aisle.   With cooperation from our Republican colleagues, we can finish the  bill today, and I hope we do. That is our intention, because despite  the lack of attention it has garnered from the press, the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act will be one of the most significant  pieces of bipartisan legislation we pass in a very long time. It could  be a moment in history that future generations look back on as a  turning point for American leadership in the 21st century.   Everyone knows the Federal Government's commitment to science and  technology has been slipping for decades. We have become complacent at  the top of the global heap, and our position as the world's economic  leader is teetering. We now spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on  basic scientific research. The Chinese Communist Party, as a  percentage, spends more than twice that. We have put ourselves in the  very precarious position of potentially falling behind the rest of the  world in technologies and industries that will define the next century.  If that happens, the days of America leading the world in scientific  innovation and the days of America being the leading economic and  military power in the world may be over.   This is a moment when the U.S. Senate can arrest the decline and lay  the foundation, instead, for another American century. That is why this  is a moment in history that future generations could well look back on  as a turning point for American leadership in the 21st century.   By investing in science and technology and shoring up critical  industries like semiconductors, boosting our universities,  laboratories, and businesses, we can keep America on top and outcompete  the world in industries of the future. That is just what this  legislation would do. Our two parties have worked very hard on it. I  think we have made a number of notable improvements to the bill. It is  time to move forward together and pass this bill.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on another matter that should also  be just as bipartisan in the Senate: the Commission to investigate the  January 6 attack on the Capitol.   We all know that January 6 was one of the lowest moments in our  democracy and one of the lowest moments in the grand, grand history of  our 200-and-some-odd-year experiment--noble experiment--in democracy.  An outgoing President of the United States, fresh off an electoral  defeat--a significant electoral defeat--did something that no other  President in recent history has done. Rather than accept the results of  the election and support the peaceful transfer of power--a hallmark of  our democracy that has inspired democracies all over the world--former  President Trump unabashedly lied, repeatedly, about the results of the  election and fomented an armed rebellion at the U.S. Capitol.   We are all witnesses to those events. We all heard the lies. We lived  through their terrible consequences. Lest we forget, 140 police  officers were injured in the attack, and 5 Americans would eventually  lose their lives.   In the weeks since, faith in our elections has plummeted. More than  half of the Republican Party now believes that the 2020 elections were  rigged and that Joe Biden isn't the actual President of the United  States. Republican State legislatures across the country, captured by  Donald Trump's Big Lie, are tripping over themselves to restrict access  to the ballot box. Arizona Republicans, in an ``election audit,'' have  been searching for traces of bamboo fibers in the 2020 ballots--chasing  a bananas-crazy, rightwing internet conspiracy that China had ballots  imported to tip the scales for Biden. That is how insane this has  become--hunting for bamboo in ballots.   We need to put a stop to this cancer in the Republican Party. We need  to stand up to the Big Lie. We must get at the truth and do everything  in our power to restore Americans' faith in our elections and this  grand, ongoing, noble experiment of democracy.   In that light, a national, bipartisan, independent Commission to  report on the events of January 6 is exactly what the doctor ordered.  We have to investigate, expose, and report on the truth. We need to  establish a trusted record of what really transpired on January 6 and  the events that preceded it. That is what this Commission is designed  to do in a bipartisan, straight-down-the-middle manner.   Now, I have gone through all the silly excuses that we have heard  from our Republican colleagues about why the Commission isn't needed or  is too early or will go on for too long or needs to be modeled after  the 9/11 Commission, even though it already is. The truth of the matter  seems to be that Senate Republicans oppose the Commission because they  fear that it might upset Donald Trump and their party's midterm  messaging.   I am not speculating. It was reported in POLITICO yesterday that the  Senate Republican leader warned his Conference that a January 6  Commission could hurt the Republicans politically.   Well, too bad. This is too important.   For the sake of Americans' faith in our democracy, there must be a  full, thorough, and trusted account of what happened on January 6.  Senate Republicans must decide if they are on the side of truth or on  the side of Donald Trump's Big Lie.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 135; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume legislative session.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to direct the Sergeant at Arms  to request the attendance of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.
