 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the dedicated efforts of a great champion in service of wildlife  preservation and nature conservation. Janet Nyce of Elliottsburg,  Pennsylvania, is a leading advocate for conservation and women in the  outdoors, both locally and nationally.   Since 1990, Janet has held leadership roles in conservation  organizations such as the Safari Club, the National Rifle Association,  and the Wildlife for Everyone Foundation. In addition to being a  charter member of the Wildlife for Everyone Foundation since 2004,  Janet served as secretary and president during her tenure. Most  recently, Janet was elected by her fellow members to serve on the board  of directors of the NRA.   Most notably, Janet has dedicated her time to teaching classes about  the outdoors and self-defense for women. She has frequently been an  instructor for hunting and firearms safety courses throughout the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Janet Nyce for her many years  of dedication to the cause of conservation and outdoor sportsmanship.  Thanks to her work, future generations will be able to carry on in the  outdoor traditions that we now enjoy.                            ____________________
