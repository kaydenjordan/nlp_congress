 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 88, which I am a cosponsor of.   This Congressional Review Act would stop President Biden's radical  SAVE Plan that alters the income-driven repayment program to redefine  the vast majority of borrowers as financially distressed.   It saves nothing. In fact, in my business, it is called false  advertising, and costing the taxpayer an estimated $559 billion is  effectively a loan cancellation program in disguise.   Who is talking about the lenders? Who is talking about the people who  loaned the money, the people of America?   In June, President Biden's unconstitutional plan to cancel  outstanding loan debt was struck down by the Supreme Court, which  stated that the authority to cancel student loans lies with Congress  and Congress only, not with President Biden.   This latest plan by President Biden is yet another attempt to ignore  the Supreme Court and sidestep Congress even after members of his own  party have admitted the executive branch lacks the authority to do so.   Yesterday, the President announced that his administration approved  another $4.8 billion in student loan cancellation, bringing the current  total to over $130 billion, basically sponsoring deadbeats.   This is a slap in the face to the taxpayer, forcing the 87 percent of  Americans who do not hold any Federal student loan debt and who have  made sound financial decisions to foot the bill for those unwilling to  pay off the debt they chose to rack up.   What this administration refuses to admit to the American people is  that this is not debt cancellation or debt forgiveness but a shift in  responsibility from the borrowers to the pocketbooks of hardworking  families.   In Texas, where I come from, a deal is a deal. You pay your debt  back, and a handshake still works.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 88  and put a stop to this administration's unlawful attack on the American  taxpayer. In God We Trust.
