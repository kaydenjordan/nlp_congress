 I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from New  Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Jeremy C. Daniel to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District  of Illinois.   A native Chicagoan, Mr. Daniel received his bachelor's degree from  Illinois Wesleyan University and his law degree from Loyola University  Chicago School of Law. Mr. Daniel has served his country in more ways  than one. As an undergraduate student, he served as a U.S. Marine Corps  Reservist. After he graduated, Mr. Daniel served as a first lieutenant  in the Marine Corps and completed tours in Japan and South Korea.   Following law school, Mr. Daniel worked in private practice on  intellectual property cases for several years before clerking for Judge  Virginia Kendall on the Northern District of Illinois. In 2014, Mr.  Daniel returned to public service, becoming an Assistant U.S. Attorney  in the Northern District of Illinois. In this role, he has prosecuted a  wide range of Federal crimes, including violations of drug and firearm  laws, gang cases, and financial crimes. Since 2019, Mr. Daniel has  served as deputy chief of the Narcotics and Money Laundering Section.  In addition to prosecuting his own cases, he supervises other attorneys  in the section. The American Bar Association rated Mr. Daniel  unanimously ``well qualified.''   Given his breadth of experience practicing in the Northern District  of Illinois and his expertise in intellectual property and criminal  law, Senator Duckworth and I strongly support Mr. Daniel. He will be an  outstanding judge. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from New  Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from New  Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, 10 days ago, America lost a visionary  public official, and I lost a friend. He was 97 years old. His name was  Newt Minow.   He was 35 years old in the year 1961 when President John Kennedy  tapped him to chair the Federal Communications Commission. At the time,  Americans were involved in big change--moving from their radios to this  new thing called television.   In his maiden speech as FCC Commissioner, Newt Minow famously  described much of commercial television as a ``vast wasteland.'' He was  especially concerned about the effects of endless commercials and  violent cartoons and other programs on the minds of our children. He  said the public airwaves should serve the public interest and that the  FCC should use its power to ensure that this emerging new technology of  television met that standard.   Fast-forward six decades. Social media now fills the role that  broadcast TV once did in the lives of our kids. Yet Federal laws  currently allow social media companies to endanger our children with  near total immunity. Social media companies can and regularly do sell  children's personal information for profit, allow bullies to hound  children mercilessly, and allow drug dealers and sexual predators to  hunt for child victims on their platforms.   Our laws, as they are currently written--as we have currently written  them--make it nearly impossible for victims to hold these companies  accountable. This has to change, and the Senate Judiciary Committee is  taking bipartisan action to see that it does.   Virtually every parent I know is concerned about how much time their  kids spend online, looking at screens, how it is affecting them, and  the dangers that kids can stumble into. Parents have a right to be  concerned. Look around the next time you are in a grocery store or in a  mall or at a family restaurant. You will see kids who are transfixed by  smartphones and tablets. I have seen this happen. I will bet the  Presiding Officer has seen it. Many kids learn how to scroll before  they learn how to walk.   I know two children in New York who are quite adept at navigating the  online world. They are 11 years old. Their  [[Page S1699]]  parents have talked to them about the dangers lurking online. Both  parents monitor their kids' screen time as much as they can, but they  still worry that they are missing dangers. I know these children  because they are my grandchildren. My wife and I visited them recently.   I sat down with my grandkids, and I asked them: What do you know  about staying safe online?   Well, they both assured me they ``knew all about it, Papa.'' They  knew all the danger signs to steer clear of.   But we cannot continue to place the responsibility for protecting  children online entirely on these children, even their parents, and  even child advocacy groups alone. No matter how concerned and vigilant  they are, parents stand virtually no chance against social media  companies that use powerful algorithms to hook kids and make a profit  off of them but cannot be held accountable in a court of law for the  harm that their products cause.   Well, Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee  want to change that. Over the last 2 weeks, we have voted out of  committee a package of four bipartisan bills that would require  Facebook, Snapchat, and other social media companies to adhere to new  online safety standards for children or pay a price. The price would be  anything from significant fines to civil judgments to criminal  prosecutions. I say enough is enough.                                STOP CSAM Act    Mr. President, last Thursday, the Judiciary Committee voted  unanimously to advance a bill I am sponsoring, called the STOP CSAM  Act. CSAM stands for ``Child Sexual Abuse Material.''   Before I go any further, I want to say a word about this 23-member  committee.   We have some pretty strongly held political opinions among the  membership of that committee, both on the Democratic side and on the  Republican side. It is rare, if ever, that we agree on everything, but  these four bills about social media passed with unanimous rollcalls in  the Senate Judiciary Committee. Every Democrat and every Republican  voted for it.   Sadly, the online spread of violent material is exploding, and it is  a call to action for us. It is far beyond the ability of victims, of  child safety organizations, or even of law enforcement to stop it under  current law. The STOP CSAM Act, which I introduced, would protect  victims and promote transparency and accountability for social media  companies.   Here is how it works: Companies that fail to remove child sexual  abuse material and related imagery after being notified about them  would face significant fines, and companies that promote or facilitate  the online sexual exploitation of children or host or store child  sexual abuse material could face new civil and even criminal penalties.   According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children-- the recognized national experts--there are an estimated 84 million  images of child sexual abuse material on the internet--84 million. That  figure is increasing exponentially each year. These images are traded,  sold, and shared online around the world.   I have spoken before about a young woman called Charlotte. Like many  naive young people, when Charlotte was 16 years old, she shared  intimate images of herself with a man she met online whom she thought  was a friend. That man then posted those images of Charlotte online.  They have haunted Charlotte ever since--for more than 10 years. She has  attempted suicide three times. She has lost jobs when those images  would appear in communities where she was trying to work. The images of  Charlotte have been shared around the world. She has endured years of  online harassment and abuse because of it.   She and her mom and child advocacy groups have asked social media  companies in dozens of nations to take down the images, with almost no  luck. Charlotte lost a teaching job she loved because of the images.  She attempted suicide, as I mentioned. She says she doubts that she  will ever feel safe.   Other children and teens have been bullied mercilessly online. Sadly,  some have taken their own lives to escape the torment. We had a hearing  at which some of the mothers came in, holding the color photographs of  their kids, some who were induced to try choking exercises in their  closets, ultimately taking their own lives by hanging themselves.                                 EARN IT Act    Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, our committee passed another child online  safety bill--again, unanimously. It is called the EARN IT Act. It would  modify section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.   Here is why we need it: Section 230 currently shields media  companies, such as Facebook and Snapchat, with very rare exceptions,  from being held accountable when material that is posted on their  platforms results in harm to kids and others. It gives social media  companies a pass and denies their victims their day in court.   Section 230 was written when Mark Zuckerberg was in the sixth grade,  long before social media existed. It was passed when internet companies  were small and struggling. Today, social media companies are some of  the richest, most powerful companies in the history of the world. Yet  they still benefit from the shield of section 230 to deny victims their  day in court.   The EARN IT Act eliminates immunity and creates accountability. Its  cosponsors are our colleague Senator Blumenthal, from Connecticut, and  Senator Graham.   Big Tech can no longer disregard its role in online child  exploitation. Many of the rest of our committee members, Democrats and  Republicans, are cosponsors. I am happy to be one of them.   We also passed two additional child online safety bills in our  committee, the SHIELD Act and the Project Safe Childhood Act. Senators  Klobuchar and Cornyn are the lead sponsors of both bills, and both of  them have bipartisan sponsorship.   We can, and we will, balance the need to protect free speech with and  the need to protect our kids from harm. What we will not do is accept  the status quo where some social media companies continue to destroy  lives and make vast fortunes by exploiting a legal loophole that can no  longer be justified.   We hope our colleagues will join us in protecting America's children  and teenagers from online horror.                                 S.J. Res. 18    Mr. President, we are going to vote on a resolution in a few minutes  that I would like to speak to. It is called the ``Public Charge Ground  of Inadmissibility.'' I oppose this resolution, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting against it.   This resolution aims to overturn a Biden administration regulation on  the public charge ground of inadmissibility. This regulation provides  immigrant families--especially those with U.S. citizen children--with  stability and certainty.   It does not make a single immigrant eligible for public benefits.  Instead, it restores and qualifies the longstanding practice that an  individual is ineligible for a green card if the individual relies on  public benefits for income.   Four years ago, the Trump administration upended that definition,  creating a new, vague test. For the first time, receiving supplemental  public health benefits like nutritional assistance and Medicaid could  be considered part of a public charge determination. Most immigrants,  even those with lawful status, have been ineligible for means-tested  programs since 1996. Immigrants who apply for these benefits are  usually doing so to obtain central healthcare or food assistance for a  U.S. American citizen child.   In 2016, 5.8 million U.S. citizen children with an immigrant parent  had Medicaid or CHIP coverage, for example. The Trump administration  rule forced these parents to make a choice: Deny their kids essential  services or risk losing their status and being deported.   When that rule was announced, school districts reported massive drops  in school lunch enrollment. Healthcare providers also reported pregnant  women were afraid to receive assistance for fear of losing their status  or putting at risk the immigration status of a loved one.   For example, one healthcare center reported that immigrant parents  here on a student visa were afraid to obtain Medicaid for their  disabled child. Although the child was a U.S. citizen and it was  perfectly legal for the child to receive Medicaid, the parents worried  that they could lose their status and be  [[Page S1700]]  separated from their child if they applied for this assistance.   A 2021 report found that even after the Trump rule was rescinded,  nearly 50 percent of Americans with an immigrant family member believed  that applying for assistance for any family member could cause  immigration problems.   The Biden administration tried to resolve this. Their regulation  makes it clear that an immigrant cannot be eligible for a green card  simply for receiving healthcare or food assistance for their U.S.  citizen child. That is why the American Hospital Association, the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the Illinois Department of Human  Services, and countless other healthcare organizations support the  Biden rule. These experts believe that the rule provides clarity and  certainty to immigrants, as well as medical professionals, ensuring  that kids get the basic access to food and healthcare they need.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this harmful  resolution and protecting families and children.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons) and  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.
