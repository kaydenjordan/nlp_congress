 Madam Speaker, this is my last speech on the House floor.  I have given hundreds of speeches on this floor, but there will be no  more. I am reminded of a quotation, each of us is called to do  something, and if we don't do it, it won't get done.   For almost 15 years now, I have had the privilege to be in this  Chamber to  [[Page H9921]]  do this work. Like many staffers who come to this great building, they  seek to one day become Members of Congress, and I became one of those.   I was legislative counsel to the late Congressman Leo Ryan, who was  assassinated in Jonestown, Guyana, trying to extract constituents who  had been held there against their will by a cult leader name Jim Jones.   I am proud that, along with Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' name,  Congressman Leo Ryan's name now appears above the Democratic cloakroom.  I was shot five times on that airstrip and left to die, but obviously  survived, and committed the rest of my life to public service.   In fact, I have the record here in Congress of being the Member who  had the longest stretch between the time they first ran for Congress,  which was 29 years before I was elected the second time.   What I know is this: We are specks in the timeline of history--few  will remember us, but they will remember events. The corridor to the  Members' dining room on the House side shows a mural of L'Enfant  choosing the site for the U.S. Capitol, then President Washington is  seen actually laying the cornerstone, and then in 1814 the British  burning the Capitol, and then the Rotunda being used to house Union  soldiers as a medical center.   There is one more mural that has to be placed in that corridor. It is  the mural of January 6.   What will we do to prevent another one? That is the challenge to all  of us.   What will we do to lower the rhetorical temperature in this sanctuary  of democracy?   Will we ever end the blood sport that goes on in this Chamber?   Above us on the ceiling is the eagle with the words e pluribus unum:  Out of many, one. It is our duty to our constituents, not to our  Facebook audience or Twitter followers. It is not our goal to increase  our followers. It is our duty to increase the confidence of our  constituents in democracy in getting things done.   Madam Speaker, I hope the 118th Congress will do what I was not able  to do in 10 years and get the ERA into the Constitution of the United  States; it is 24 words. Every democracy in the world has an ERA in  their constitution but the United States.   I hope that we will restore the right to reproductive autonomy for  every woman.   I hope that we will do what we should do and pass an assault weapons  ban. Surely, we can prohibit the purchase of these weapons of war by  teenagers.   We should make permanent the child tax credit; we lifted half of the  children in this country out of poverty last year when we did that.   We have got to do a better job of providing for our servicemen and  servicewomen.   Madam Speaker, I have had an extraordinary staff these almost 15  years. They make me sound smarter than I am, more articulate than I am.  They work long hours to move legislation. They plan conferences in the  district for senior citizens, job seekers, students, and all the many,  many townhalls we have had.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the names of former staff  members. They are the sheroes and heroes of this institution.
