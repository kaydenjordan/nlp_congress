 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as Filipino  American History Month, a time for all Americans to remember and  celebrate the incredible past, present, and future of our fellow  citizens whose heritage lies in the great country of the Philippines.   I am especially humbled to do so as the proud Representative of  Hawaii's First Congressional District, where live more Filipino  Americans--close to 200,000--than in any of our 440 districts  throughout our country. And with Hawaii's Second Congressional District  number two, at about 175,000, our Fil-Am community in Hawaii stands at  about 375,000, one-quarter of all Hawaii residents and, by far, the  largest percentage of any State or territory.   We observe Filipino American History Month in October because the  first recorded arrival of Filipinos in the continental United States  took place in 1587, when the Luzones Indios came ashore from the  Manila-built galleon Nuestra Senora de Esperanza in Morro Bay,  California.   And in 1906, 113 years ago, the first 15 sakada, or contract  laborers, arrived in Honolulu from the Philippines aboard the SS Doric,  marking the first sustained immigration into our country and the humble  beginnings of Fil-Ams in Hawaii.   Today, our Fil-Am community numbers some 4 million throughout our  country, now the second largest of our Asian American groups.   The story of Filipino Americans is the story of America. From very  humble beginnings, they have risen through hard work, sacrifice,  commitment to advancing the next generations, and mutual support to  achieve so much already.   Hawaii Fil-Ams, in particular, have been trailblazers:   Peter Aduja became the first Fil-Am elected to public office in the  United States when he was elected to the Hawaii territorial House of  Representatives in 1954.   Benjamin Menor became the first Fil-Am higher court judge as  associate justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court.   Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino American Governor of a U.S.  State.   Major General Antonio Taguba was the second Filipino American  promoted to general officer rank in our Army.   Eddie Flores, Jr., bought the first L&L Drive-In on Liliha Street in  Honolulu in 1976, turning it into a national franchise.   Carolina Dizon Wong was the first Filipino American woman to obtain  an M.D. degree.   Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino American graduate of the school  of public health, nursing, and social work at the University of Hawaii.  She received the prestigious Jefferson Award in 1986 for her service.   Francisco Flores ``Corky'' Trinidad, Jr., of Honolulu was an award- winning editorial cartoonist of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, who became  the first Asian editorial cartoonist syndicated in the United States.   And a loyal veteran of the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment that fought  alongside our troops in the Philippines during World War II, Domingo  Los Banos was Hawaii's first Filipino American school principal.   I was recently honored to join the promotion ceremony in Honolulu of  Roy Macareg from colonel to brigadier general in the Hawaii Army  National Guard, the first Fil-Am to become a general officer in the  history of Hawaii's citizen soldier ranks.   In Hawaii, we also regularly honor the over 250,000 Filipinos who  answered the call to protect and defend the United States and the  Philippines in the Pacific theater. In 2016, President Obama signed  into law the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal  Act to bestow Congress' highest honor upon these worthy veterans.   We also, of course, celebrate, right here in Congress, our proud Fil- Ams who serve our country here, my colleagues  Bobby Scott of Virginia  and TJ Cox of California.   Each and all of these lives of achievement are but a very small  sampling of a broader community that has achieved so much and  contributed so much to the rich fabric of our country. And the story of  Filipino Americans is still in its early chapters.   Why are Filipino Americans among our most successful communities?  General Macareg spoke to some of that at his promotion ceremony when he  credited his own success to the hard work and sacrifice for him and his  five siblings of his father, a laborer, and mother, a teacher, to the  values they instilled, and to the constant nurturing and support of his  broader community.   That well describes Filipino Americans overall, that and a full and  constant embrace of the values, responsibilities, and opportunities of  America, while honoring and treasuring the rich heritage of their  ancestral homeland.   All of this is why I recently joined Congressman Cox in introducing  H. Res. 621, a resolution to express support for the permanent  designation of October as Filipino American History Month.   We urge our colleagues' support to promote an ongoing appreciation of  the contributions of Filipino Americans to our country and to the rich  diversity of our Nation.   To Fil-Ams everywhere: ``Thank you very much and God bless''-- ``maraming salamat po and dios ti agngina''--and congratulations. I  truly look forward to partnering with you on your next proud chapters.  [[Page H8604]]                                ____________________
