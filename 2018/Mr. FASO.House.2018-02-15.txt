 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to  recognize Hurley Fire Department member Shelagh Sweeney.   Shelagh was named Hurley Fire Department's first female Firefighter  of the Year. Her service and dedication to her community as a  firefighter, EMT, and field training officer for mobile life support  services is most admirable.   Her inspiration to join the fire department came from her attendance  of a first-aid class during her time at SUNY Ulster. Continuing her  education by taking classes at Marist College is a testament to the  dedication she reflects with her service to her community.   Shelagh's selfless service to the community, while striving for  further personal growth, is greatly appreciated, and I wish her the  best in continuing on her journey.                            ____________________
