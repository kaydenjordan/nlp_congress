 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act in honor and memory of one of my constituents who was  killed in the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Michelle Vo.   I also rise in the memory of the kids who were killed in Uvalde,  Texas, in Parkland, in Sandy Hook.   I rise in their memories, and I also rise due to the fact that I will  have a newborn child on August 8. That child, in a few years, will be  going off to school, and I will be worried about that child being put  in danger because he is going off to school when there are mass  shootings across this country.   I rise in support of this because it is a small step forward to  prevent the loss of life.   In the end, it comes down to one simple question, as my colleague  from northern California posed: Are you with the kids, or are you with  the killers? Are you with the victims, or are you with the killers?   I choose the victims; I choose the kids; and I choose the countless  lives we will save because we will pass this law.
