 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.  2850 and to urge passage of this amendment to the White Mountain Apache  Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010.   The White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of  2010 resolved the Tribe's water claims against the Federal and State  governments, as well as other parties and States. This act also  authorized the White Mountain Rural Water System all while being budget  neutral.   This bill is simply a straightforward, technical amendment which is  necessary to clarify that authorization authority exists for the Tribe  to use the settlement fund for water-related economic development  projects. The Tribe needs this clarification in order to complete the  construction of its rural water system, which is long overdue and a  critical project for the community.  [[Page H6630]]    I thank Senator Flake, whose staff has worked closely with me and my  office on this issue for the past year and a half. I also thank the  chairman and ranking member for supporting this bill.   Given the importance of the water system and the implementation of  the settlement legislation to the White Mountain Apache Tribe, I urge  the swift passage of this bill and look forward to working together  with all affected stakeholders on its implementation.
