 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today I had a good conversation  up in New York with President-Elect Trump about a number of pressing  issues. We talked about the upcoming Senate agenda, the President- elect's nominees, and the way forward on repealing and replacing  ObamaCare. As I told him, the Senate's focus this week will remain on  the process to repeal ObamaCare and keep our commitment to the American  people.   ObamaCare has been a flawed system from the start, and things have  gotten progressively worse over the last 7 years. From skyrocketing  premiums to dwindling insurers in the exchanges, ObamaCare has corroded  insurance markets across the country to a point that is simply  unsustainable. That is why we are taking action to bring relief to  countless American families who have been hurt by ObamaCare.  Unfortunately, there are some who will never accept the realities of  this failed partisan law. They seem more interested in messaging  exercises than replacing ObamaCare with real solutions to improve  health care. Catchy slogans, expensive campaigns, or messaging  amendments are not going to undo the damage ObamaCare has caused.   Our Nation cannot continue on this trajectory as ObamaCare continues  to  [[Page S127]]  unravel at every level, leaving Americans to pick up the pieces.   We may not be responsible for the damage of this law, but we are  committed to bring relief nonetheless. We will continue working this  week to pass the legislative tools necessary to begin clearing the way  for repeal and then a different way forward that will lower costs and  increase choices from where they are now.   There is no quick fix to undoing the damage created by this broken  and complex law, and repeal is just the first step in that process, but  the sooner we act, the sooner we can begin bringing relief to those who  need it. Let us continue working to keep our promise to the American  people by passing legislation that will help us finally move beyond  ObamaCare's broken promises.
