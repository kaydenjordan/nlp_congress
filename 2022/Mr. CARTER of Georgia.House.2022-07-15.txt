 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  the life of a young man from my alma mater, Artez Benton.   A talented baseball player at Young Harris College, Artez tragically  lost his life this past month while in Atlanta.   Born in Scottdale, Georgia, Artez was a star on the Druid Hills High  School baseball team. He chose to continue his athletic career at Young  Harris as an infielder for the Mountain Lions.   Artez was wise beyond his years, hardworking, and was working to  become a certified electrician with dreams of owning his own home. He  would begin his days at 4:00 in the morning, studying for his  apprenticeship, and despite his busy and long days, Artez was sure to  make time to help his father with his landscaping company and to teach  his young nephew the sport he loved so dearly.   This tragedy has rocked the Young Harris community and has stolen a  bright future from a young man and his family. My heart aches for the  Benton family, and my prayers reside with them in this terribly  difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles of attacks on  churches and pro-life pregnancy centers.                   [From the National Catholic Register]          Attacks on Churches, Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers Continue         A pro-life sign at St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church in       Hutchinson, Kansas, about 50 miles northwest of Wichita, was       vandalized over the weekend.        Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization       decision on Friday, attacks on Catholic churches and pro-life       pregnancy centers have been reported in West Virginia,       Washington, Virginia, Louisiana, Colorado, California, Texas,       Florida, New York, and Indiana.        Below are the latest recorded attacks since the decision.        Matt Vainer, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Wichita,       said that the perpetrator was followed by a witness who       called the police. The perpetrator was arrested, he said.        The pastor of St. Teresa of Avila, Father Aaron Spexarth,       placed the sign underneath a crucifix in the church, as he       believed it was most appropriate to place it at Christ's       feet, Vainer confirmed to CNA.        All Saints Catholic Church in Portland, Oregon had its sign       defaced with pro-abortion graffiti June 25.        A photo of the vandalism shows the words ``If abortions       aren't safe, neither are you!--XOXO Jane.'' The FBI is       investigating, Barbara Custer, a parish secretary at the       church, told CNA.        A Woman's Friend Pregnancy Resource Clinic in Yuba City,       California was vandalized June 27.        The clinic had one of its windows smashed by what seems to       be one perpetrator according to video footage, the clinic's       executive director Kristen Bird told CNA.         Video shows the perpetrator throwing three rocks at the       window until it broke. Repairs will cost anywhere between       $700 and $900. The FBI is investigating, Bird said.                                   ____                    [From the Daily Caller, July 12, 2022]    Elizabeth Warren Calls To `Shut Down' Crisis Pregnancy Centers Amid                            Pro-Abortion Attacks                            (By Nicole Silverio)         Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called on       crisis pregnancy centers to be ``shut down'' across the       country Tuesday as pro-abortion groups vandalize and commit       arson on centers throughout the nation.        The senator claimed the centers ``fool'' and ``torture''       women into carrying their pregnancies to term as they seek       abortion access. She lamented that the centers outnumber       abortion clinics in Massachusetts by 3 to 1.        ``In Massachusetts right now, those crisis pregnancy       centers that are there to fool people who are looking for       pregnancy termination help outnumber true abortion clinics by       3 to 1, she said. ``We need to shut them down here in       Massachusetts and we need to shut them down all around the       country,'' she told NBC 10 Boston. ``You should not be able       to torture a pregnant person like that,''        Warren's criticisms of crisis pregnancy centers follow       multiple attacks on the centers facilitated by pro-abortion       activists since the Supreme Court draft majority opinion       leaked in May.        Surveillance footage showed a suspect spray painted the       words ``If Abortions Aren't Safe, You Aren't Either'' and       broke the windows of the Next Step Pregnancy Center in       Lynwood, Washington, in late May. An unknown pro-abortion       group splattered the Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center       with red paint and marked the words ``Jane Says Revenge'' in       graffiti.        Police arrested 10 pro-abortion protesters for allegedly       throwing smoke bombs at an Oregon pregnancy center on June       27. The activist group Jane's Revenge allegedly firebombed       crisis pregnancy center in Amherst, New York, overnight on       June 7, while arsonists attacked Wisconsin Family Action in       Madison. The Oregon Right to Life offices in Keizer, Oregon,       were also firebombed with Molotov cocktails.        The centers offer free or low-cost pregnancy testing,       education on adoption services, ultrasounds, STD testing and       treatment, prenatal and parenting lessons, after abortion       recovery counseling and sexual risk avoidance education,       according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute.        The Massachusetts senator has repeatedly called for the       construction of abortion clinics on federal lands and       national parks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.       Wade, handing states the right to regulate abortion. She       suggested that tents and trained medical personnel be set up       on federally funded property to allow women to access       abortion.        In a New York Times op-ed, she and Democratic Minnesota       Sen. Tina Smith advocated the use of ``federal property and       resources to protect people seeking abortion services       locally.''        Warren and several prominent Democratic lawmakers signed a       letter urging President Joe Biden increase access to       medication abortion and establish a medical ombudsman at the       Department of Human Health and Services and Department of       Justice to analyze data on the types of reproductive services       needed and provide that on federal lands.        ``The Department of Justice and all relevant agencies could       analyze the types of reproductive health services that could       be provided on federal property, especially in states where       such services are limited by state law or regulation,'' the       letter stated.        The senator's push for clinics on federal lands is       currently prevented by the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits       federal funding toward abortions except in cases endangering       the mother's life. Many activists estimate that the Hyde       Amendment prevents at least 60,000 abortion per year.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the  unconscionable abortion on demand until birth act.   This bill creates a national standard to allow for abortions of  unborn children for any reason and at any stage of pregnancy up until  birth. As a father and grandfather of six precious grandchildren, I am  sickened by the attempt to allow abortion on demand until birth.   Now, Madam Speaker, I will speak for just a second about something  that was brought up by one of my colleagues across the aisle about  pharmacists dispensing prescriptions for abortion.   Also, Madam Speaker, if you could, do me a favor and get a message to  the President who is trying to sign an executive order to force  pharmacists to fill prescriptions against their will for abortion. Let  me assure you, you can pass all the legislation you want, and you can  sign every executive order that you want to sign, but if you think you  are going to force a pharmacist to go against their moral obligation to  take care of patients and to take care of babies and dispense a  prescription that is going to be used for abortion, good luck with  that.    Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name as  cosponsor of H.R. 8167.
