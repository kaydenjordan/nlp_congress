 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Pete  Buttigieg's nomination to lead the Department of Transportation.   Whether it is rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, maintaining  our leadership in the global mobility race, or improving pipeline  safety, there is no shortage of challenges facing our incoming  Secretary.   As a fellow midwesterner, as a former officer in the U.S. Navy  Reserve, I can't think of anyone more equipped to take on this  challenge than Pete Buttigieg.   He understands the need to revitalize our infrastructure because he  has seen it in our neighborhoods and on our roads each and every day  when he served as a mayor.   He has a unique understanding of how the Department can be a resource  to State and to local governments and what can be done to ensure that  the Federal Government supports those State and local governments and  make sure that need gets addressed most effectively.   If we are going to build back better, a partnership at each level of  government will be absolutely vital. Having someone at the helm who  recognizes that that relationship is so important will be an incredible  asset to the Department.   I have also had several conversations with Secretary-Designate  Buttigieg on the auto industry, which is the very beating heart of our  manufacturing economy. And as the industry advances both toward  electrification and self-driving technologies, it will be critical that  we support these technologies and make sure that they are safely  deployed and that they are deployed here in the United States.   We have an opportunity to save lives but also to create jobs and  empower our domestic auto industry to take the moonshot for artificial  intelligence and spur technological innovation, and I am pleased that  Secretary-Designate Buttigieg has committed to working with us as we  craft legislation that establishes a Federal framework around these new  technologies.   Finally, I am excited to work with Secretary-Designate Buttigieg on  improving pipeline safety, especially around the Great Lakes.   We know that line 5, under the Straits of Mackinac, poses a very  serious threat to the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are not only an  economic driver and natural resource for our country, they are  literally in the DNA of every Michiganian.   As a midwesterner and as husband to a Michigan native who was born  and raised in Traverse City, Secretary-Designate Buttigieg fully  recognizes the need to protect the Great Lakes.   I agree with Mayor Pete's belief that, as he says, ``good  transportation policy can play no less a role than making possible the  American dream.''   I am proud to support Pete Buttigieg's historic nomination, which has  already garnered bipartisan support, and I urge all of my colleagues to  vote for him.    Madam President, I ask I unanimous consent to complete my  remarks.    Madam President, I rise in support of confirming  Alejandro Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland Security. I appreciate my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for advancing this critical  nomination so that we can finally provide the Department of Homeland  Security with a qualified, experienced, and Senate-confirmed leader  that they so desperately need.   Mr. Mayorkas is a proven leader and has the experience to protect the  American people from harm. Throughout his confirmation process, Mr.  Mayorkas confirmed his commitment to transparency and working on a  bipartisan basis to ensure the Department is able to take on persistent  and emerging threats.   And right now the threats we face are severe from domestic terrorism,  including the rise of White supremacist violence to cyber attacks from  foreign adversaries, to tackling a deadly pandemic. DHS continues to  face daunting challenges, challenges that have only been made more  difficult to address due to the years of chaos during the previous  administration.   That is why former Homeland Security Secretaries from both Republican  and Democratic administrations, other senior Homeland Security  officials, and law enforcement organizations have urged the Senate to  quickly confirm Mr. Mayorkas--because they know he is well prepared for  the difficult task that lies ahead.  [[Page S225]]    The Department of Homeland Security needs leadership, and it needs it  now. By voting to confirm Mr. Mayorkas, this body can show every  American that we are committed to ensuring that they are safe and  secure    I ask for the yeas and nays.
