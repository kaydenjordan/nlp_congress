 Mr. Chair, when are my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle going to give up this toddler argument that we should not take  action to address the number one issue facing humankind, and that is  climate change?   The fact that other countries are not moving as fast as we are is no  reason for us to give up the mantle of leadership and allow the United  States of America to be the only country on the face of the Earth not a  member of the Paris climate accord.   It is time for us to be on the right side of history, and I would  implore the Members on the other side of the aisle to recognize this is  their time to do the right thing, not just for us, but for our  children, our grandchildren, and future generations.  [[Page H4683]]         Mr. Chair, the gentleman knows the Paris climate accord is  voluntary, so he does not save one job by declining to follow the  protocol that we previously agreed on.   I do agree that there are economic opportunities that we can embrace,  new technologies. I would love to see us work across the aisle to do  just that.   As a former Republican, I used to be in that party because of its  environmental stewardship, because it believed that capitalism could  help solve these problems. I still believe it as a Democrat on this  side of the aisle, and I am hopeful that we can work together.   For example, for every $1 that we provide in economic incentives for  renewable energies, we have provided $80 to the fossil fuel industry.  Clearly, if we had parity, we would see a much faster adoption of clean  energies and the dissemination of clean energies by the existing energy  companies. I can't wait to work with my colleagues across the aisle to  accomplish that outcome.   Ninety-seven percent of scientists recognize that climate change is  real. The Department of Defense recognizes this is one of the top, if  not the number one, national threats to our security.   Let's work together. Let's quit pointing fingers across the aisle and  using rhetoric that does not move forward an important issue that all  of us should be fighting hard to address.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  recognize the contributions of Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian  immigrants and to discourage attempts to repatriate them to those  countries.   In 2008, Vietnam and the United States reached a formal agreement  that contains specific restrictions on the repatriation of certain  individuals to Vietnam, including barring the repatriation of any  Vietnamese national who arrived in the United States before our two  nations established formal diplomatic relations on July 12, 1995.   This limitation in the agreement, which has not been renegotiated  since its signing, strengthens and protects our communities by keeping  families together and empowering individuals who have lived in the  United States for decades to continue to make positive change in  communities across our country.   Under President Trump's Administration, however, we have seen an  increase in deportations of Southeast Asian immigrants in a push to  negotiate repatriation agreements across Southeast Asia, including  using visa sanctions to unilaterally punish countries like Laos that do  not currently have such an agreement with the United States.   I am proud to represent a thriving Southeast Asian community,  including thousands of men and women and children who came to the  United States fleeing violence and genocide during and after the  Vietnam war in search of a better life.   I call upon President Trump's administration to cease these attacks  on Southeast Asian constituents and halt all efforts to renegotiate the  2008 agreement with Vietnam and negotiate a new repatriation agreement  with Laos.   I would like to thank the organizations, like the Southeast Asia  Resource Action Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and the  National Pacific American Bar Association for their work to support  these individuals and their help in raising this issue before the  House.                                time  1545    I would also like to thank my colleagues, especially Representatives  Alan Lowenthal, Lu Correa, and Zoe Lofgren for their important work on  behalf of these communities. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
