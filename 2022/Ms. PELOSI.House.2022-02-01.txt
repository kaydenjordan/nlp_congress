 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this  important legislation to the floor of the House in such a bipartisan  way.   I rise today in support of legislation to honor the leadership and  legacy of Congressman John Robert Lewis.   I thank the gentleman, who is also from Georgia, for presiding. It  makes it very special to all of us.   I support this legislation officially and personally, as our beloved  John Lewis was the conscience of the Congress and a dear friend to many  of us who served with him.   I came in with the same class as John Lewis, so I served with him for  decades, and I had the benefit of seeing up close and personal on a  daily basis the special nature of this man.   Let us salute Congresswoman Nikema Williams, who has the awesome  privilege of serving in John Lewis' seat for Georgia, for her committed  leadership in making this legislation possible.   John Lewis was a titan of the civil rights movement--we all know  that--a moral giant on Capitol Hill and in the country, and a hero of  American history who transformed our Nation with his vision, his  persistence, and his courage.   John offered our Nation a clarion voice for freedom and justice from  lunch counters in Nashville to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, from  the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the floor of the House. On the  floor of the House, John led a demonstration in support of gun violence  prevention that was historic.    John's extraordinary sacrifice, indomitable spirit, and endless  generosity in the face of unimaginable adversity made him revered in  both Houses of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, and across the  country.   It was my solemn honor to welcome John back to the Capitol a final  time in July 2020 to lie in state.   Then, in July 2021, I had the great privilege of leading a  congressional delegation to San Diego to christen the formidable USNS  John Lewis.   Today, we again honor John by affixing his name upon a post office in  the heart of his beloved Atlanta, another fitting tribute that will  inspire generations of Georgians.   It is appropriate we do so today as Americans across the Nation mark  the beginning of Black History Month this very day.   As we do so, let us pledge to continue to carry on John's mission to  strive for a more perfect Union and to work to build a world worthy of  John Lewis' legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I also proudly honor a pioneering spirit and a friend of  John Lewis', a progressive champion and a dear longtime friend of so  many of us, Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, with legislation to rename the  Petaluma downtown post office in her honor, which I am proud to  cosponsor as a Californian.   We pay a proper tribute to an inspiring leader who has improved the  lives of countless working families in the bay area and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jared Huffman for his committed  leadership to bring this legislation to the floor and for carrying on a  great legacy that he and Lynn Woolsey shared of leadership on behalf of  the families of the north bay.   During Lynn's two decades in the House on the Education and Labor  Committee and as co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, she  was a leader on welfare reform in the nineties, opposing the war in  Iraq since day one, working relentlessly on ending gender  discrimination, championing fervently our environment, and, again,  bravely protesting the genocide in Darfur.   So the Congress will salute her instrumental leadership. She was one  of the leaders who established Women's History Month, an important  tradition allowing us to pay homage to the extraordinary women on whose  shoulders we now stand.   For two reasons I come to the floor. Of course, one, to share in  honoring John Lewis in the naming of the post office, and to honor Lynn  Woolsey. I hope we have a strong bipartisan ``aye'' in both cases.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chair Wasserman Schultz for affording me  this opportunity to speak on behalf of two great champions of the  Congress, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.                                time  1430
