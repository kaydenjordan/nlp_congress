 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor National Deaf History  Month, celebrated March 13 through April 15 each year.   What started as a very small observation at a Washington, D.C.,  library has grown to a 32-day-long celebration recognizing the  countless contributions of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans and  honoring deaf culture.   I was so pleased when one of my constituents, Dawn Watts, an advocate  for the deaf community, approached me with an idea of introducing a  resolution recognizing Deaf History Month in Congress for the very  first time.   I want to thank Dawn, as well as the National Association of the Deaf  and the American Library Association, for their insight and support for  this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Americans to take time this month to  learn more about deaf Americans who helped shape our country, and I am  honored to be able to have introduced this resolution.                            ____________________
