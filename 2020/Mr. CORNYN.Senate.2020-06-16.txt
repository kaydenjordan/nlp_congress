 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the lunch recess.    Mr. President, as the Nation discusses the need for  police reforms, our work in the Senate to deliver those reforms is  ramping up. This afternoon, the Judiciary Committee, on which the  Presiding Officer and I serve, will be holding a hearing to examine the  use of force and community relations.   I am glad that our witnesses include two outstanding Texas  witnesses--Erin Nealy Cox, the U.S. Attorney of the Northern District  of Texas, and Chief Art Acevedo, Chief of the Houston Police Department  and also the chair of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. I know they  will be able to help shed some light on the changes that need to be  made to restore trust between officers and the communities they serve,  and I appreciate their willingness to share their perspectives with us.   It is important, I believe, for us to hear from a variety of sources  as we debate what those potential reforms might look like: those who  represent law enforcement, community and faith-based organizations, and  the men and women who get up every day and put on the uniform to  protect us by serving in law enforcement agencies. We need to hear from  all of them.   In recent weeks, African Americans across the country have shared  their experiences with law enforcement--stories we have heard of being  profiled, discriminated against, targeted, and having a negative  perception of law enforcement that even in dangerous situations they  are afraid to call the police. Really, the way it was described in a  meeting I had on Friday in Dallas by Chief Hall and Sheriff Brown is  that they called it a wedge between law enforcement and some minority  communities for lack of trust. John Crusoe, the district attorney, said  because of the number of offenses for which minorities are arrested and  prosecuted, it seemed to be disproportionate. They have the impression  that somehow they are being targeted unfairly. We know that even our  friend, Tim Scott, an African-American Senator, has said he knows what  it is like to be driving while Black and to be stopped, where somebody  who looks like me would not be stopped by the police.   We need to work our way through this. We know that Black parents have  spoken openly about their concerns for their own sons and daughters and  that lessons that they have given them of what they should do if pulled  over by the police: turning off the car, rolling down the windows,  placing their hands on the dashboard, and explaining what they are  doing before reaching in their pocket for their driver's license.   Well, the lack of trust between law enforcement and our communities  isn't unfounded, but it is unsustainable. In order for every American  to not only be safe but feel safe, we need to enact long overdue  reforms to our Nation's police departments. Mostly, these are not  prescriptive in nature. These are in the realm of being an assistance  to our law enforcement officials and not somehow assuming, as some do,  that racial discrimination is rampant among law enforcement. I don't  believe that. I don't believe that there is systemic racial  discrimination in our law enforcement officers where they target  minorities. I just don't believe that.   I do believe there are some bad actors who abuse their power and  violate even the status of their own police department. And,  unfortunately, in the example of the officer who had his knee on the  neck of George Floyd, we know that there have been 17 separate  complaints made against him in their internal affairs division there,  but, apparently, neither the police department nor the city  leadership--the mayor and city council--did anything about it, or if  they did, we have not yet learned about it.   Well, we know that Senator Scott has been leading the effort in our  conference to try to come up with a reasonable package of legislative  responses, and it is really kind of surprising to me to see the overlap  between the political parties and also our colleagues in the House.  [[Page S2994]]    Now, there are some things that I don't think we should do. For  example, there are some who call for reforming qualified immunity, a  judicial doctrine that protects the discretionary acts of a government  employee or government official and holds them financially responsible  only if they violate an established standard. Well, the same legal  doctrine that protects police officers protects school teachers as  well, and I will bet that a number of our colleagues who are calling  for wholesale reform of qualified immunity didn't even know that.   Well, as I said, it is important that we hear from a variety of  voices, and that is why I appreciate Mayor Johnson in Dallas hosting a  roundtable with a group of law enforcement leaders and faith leaders  who are committed to delivering real change. I spent a few minutes  talking about what we are doing here in Washington, but I spent most of  my time listening. I think that is something we need to do more of--to  listen. We are all pretty good at talking, but we need to do more  listening.   Everyone agrees that there is a problem--a big one--that will not go  away if we ignore it. As the mayor acknowledged, the fact that everyone  agrees that the status quo is not sustainable represents progress in  and of itself. That is the first step toward solving a problem-- recognizing that you have one. But now it is time to turn that  consensus into collective action.    We know that many of the changes that need to be made will happen at  the local and State level. At the U.S. Congress, we have a Capitol  Police, but we don't control what happens in the Minneapolis Police  Department or the Dallas Police Department or San Antonio or any other  locally run and controlled law enforcement agency. We know that they  are not all the same. Most major law enforcement agencies, like the one  in Dallas, have deescalation training. It has been mandatory for years.   So when people talk about doing that and mandating it here from  Washington, the fact is that most of our major law enforcement agencies  are already doing a lot of these things, like banning choke holds, for  example. One of the participants in our roundtable was Frederick  Frazier, a longtime law enforcement officer who actually trains  officers in deescalation.   More recently, the Dallas Police Department banned choke holds, as I  mentioned, and any use of force intended to restrict a person's  airways. They have also embraced a policy requiring officers to  intervene in a situation where use of force is unnecessary and  inappropriate. For example, if a law enforcement officer sees another  officer use excessive force or dealing with that use of force  inappropriately, the Dallas Police Department requires the other  officers who witnessed that to intervene--something we did not see  happen in Minneapolis.   During our discussion, Chief Hall also discussed steps they are  taking to release body camera or dash camera footage and overall  increased transparency. Similar changes are being made in cities across  Texas and across the country, and I think transparency is an important  area where changes can and should occur. A one-size-fits-all Federal  approach to policing would be, I think, a mistake.   But here in Washington, we do have a role to play. We have both the  opportunity and the responsibility to ensure that America's police  departments are helping public safety and are not considered to be a  threat by the communities they serve. The bill being led by Senator  Scott would take major steps in the right direction. While the final  details are being ironed out, our discussions have included a range of  proposals that would address everything from training to transparency,  to minority hiring.   I am not interested in passing a bill for the sake of just checking a  box and saying we have done something significant. That route is sure  to lead to even more problems. I am interested in delivering real  reforms, as I am confident all of my colleagues here in the Senate are,  and I think our legislative efforts can produce a product that will be  responsive to the crisis we are now experiencing--a crisis largely of  trust.   Of course, for those changes to reach communities in Texas, they also  need to be able to pass not only a Republican-controlled Senate but a  Democratic-controlled House and be signed by President Trump, and I  believe the legislation we will unveil tomorrow could deliver in each  of those bodies. I think each of us has a responsibility to take action  to repair and address the fear, the anger, and the lack of trust  between law enforcement and our communities, and this bill does an  important first step.   I am proud to have worked with Senator Scott and all of our  colleagues in this effort, and we all will make our contribution before  we are through. I am looking forward to sharing those details tomorrow  during the press conference.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
