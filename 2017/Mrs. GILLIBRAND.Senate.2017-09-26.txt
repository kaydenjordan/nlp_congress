 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.             Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Recovery Effort     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.             Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Recovery Effort     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.             Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Recovery Effort     Mr. President, I rise to speak about the  humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is  one of the worst disasters our country has ever seen.   The men, women, and children who live on these islands are American  citizens. Do not forget that. They are suffering, and they need our  help. They have no food to eat, no water to drink, no power, and no  refrigeration. If we don't give them help now, then many more people  there will die--far more than those who were killed during the  hurricane itself.   I urge my colleagues to think about our fellow American citizens in  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and what they are suffering  through right now. Listen to their cries for help. Listen to what one  of my constituents said to me:         We need help getting my grandparents to come to New York.       Their house is damaged and not safe. My grandfather is 93       with Alzheimer's. He is bed bound. He has not been able to       walk for over 18 months. My grandmother is 92 and diabetic       with a heart problem. My aunt is 68, and we think had a brain       aneurism and needs medical care. Please help them. Help get       them to New York. We can pay for the plane ticket. We need       help getting them to the airport and putting them on the       plane.    Another New Yorker told me that her father is a veteran of Vietnam  and is a retired police department lieutenant who now lives in Puerto  Rico. This veteran of the U.S. military told his daughter that he  suffered from head trauma because he slipped and fell while clearing  water from his house. He told his daughter that Puerto Rico is  devastated and looks like an atomic bomb has struck the island. He is  without power, cell phone use, and water. He told her that Mother  Nature had unleashed a monster on them.   He said, ``God have mercy on us,'' and then told his daughter that he  loved her.   This man is a veteran. He served in our military alongside so many  other Americans from Puerto Rico. He protected our country when we  needed him, so we need to protect him now.   How would you respond if this humanitarian crisis happened in your  State or in my State or any other State around the country?   Can the Presiding Officer imagine what this would be like if it were  Ohio? Can you imagine what this would be like if it were New York? We  would act as quickly as we could. We would give people there every  resource they need to recover. We wouldn't hesitate even  [[Page S6115]]  for a moment. This is urgent and serious, and we have to help our  fellow citizens now.   Congress must provide the funding necessary to send every resource  available. Help them clean up. Help them recover without further delay.  That includes providing disaster community block grant funding, just as  we did for the people of Texas and Florida. We cannot turn our backs on  our fellow citizens.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
