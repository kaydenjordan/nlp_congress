 Madam Speaker, recent Persian Gulf tanker  attacks do not--I repeat, do not--justify unilateral American military  action against Iran.   On May 12, 2019, two Saudi Arabian tankers, a United Arab Emirates  tanker, and a Norwegian tanker were attacked. According to a Saudi  Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Norway joint report, explosions  caused all four vessels to suffer hull breaches.   The report states that limpet mines were ``highly likely placed by  divers below or at the waterline,'' and the placement of the mines was  ``consistent with intention to disable the mobility, but not physically  destroy, each vessel.''   The report concludes that ``these sophisticated attacks were most  likely carried out by a state actor.'' For emphasis, the report does  not accuse anyone of conducting the attacks.   On June 13, 2019, a Japanese tanker and Norwegian tanker were  attacked with explosive devices that caused considerable fire and hull  damage to both tankers.   Who is responsible for these two tanker attacks? There is  international disagreement.   America and the United Kingdom blame Iran. Iran denies  responsibility. Other nations offer no opinion and caution against a  rush to judgment. Perhaps more evidence will persuade the international  community that Iran orchestrated these tanker attacks, perhaps not.   Regardless of blame, there are other factors to consider. For  example, what is America's national security interest in these six  tanker attacks? Not a single attacked tanker is owned by Americans.  Rather, they are owned by Saudi Arabia, Norway, the United Arab  Emirates, and Japan.   Not a single attacked tanker involved oil produced in America.  Rather, all six tankers were shipping Saudi Arabian or United Arab  Emirates oil. Neither of the two tankers loaded with cargo was bound  for the United States.   Hence, the United States has no national security interest in the six  attacked tankers sufficient to trigger an American retaliatory military  action against Iran.   There are, however, other nations that do have a national security  interest in these tanker attacks. Japan and South Korea import roughly  80 percent of their oil from the Persian Gulf. India imports roughly 60  percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf. China imports roughly 50  percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf. Western Europe imports almost  20 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf.   Hence, Japan, South Korea, China, India, Western Europe, and many  other  [[Page H4924]]  nations all have a national security interest in keeping Persian Gulf  oil shipping lanes open and are justified in using military force to  defend those shipping lanes at their own risk and at their own cost.   Similarly, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United  Arab Emirates all have a national security interest in keeping Persian  Gulf shipping lanes open to transport the oil they produce and sell.  Hence, each of these countries is justified in using military force to  defend their shipping lanes at their own risk and at their own cost.   Clearly, then, other nations have a far greater national security  interest in Persian Gulf oil and shipping lanes than does the United  States. As such, these nations should be primarily responsible for  using military force as is necessary to protect their national security  interests.   Madam Speaker, America must stop being the world's policeman on every  corner of the planet. America must stop burning through our treasury  and risking our American lives when we have no compelling security  interest in a dispute. This is particularly true when those nations  that do have a national security interest don't care enough about their  own national security interest to protect them.   While America can and should help our allies, it is equally important  that America's allies put up their own defense capabilities, protect  their own national security interests, and shoulder their own share of  military burdens.   If countries with a national security interest in Persian Gulf  shipping lanes act as a unified force to protect them, and if they ask  for America's assistance, America should then, and only then, consider  military assistance. Unless that happens, this is not America's fight.   Of course, should Iran attack Americans or their property, or should  Iran attack and kill any of our allies' citizens, an entirely different  set of considerations come into play, and Iran will not like America's  response to those kinds of attacks.                            ____________________
