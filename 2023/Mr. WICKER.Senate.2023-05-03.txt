 Madam President, I come before the Senate this afternoon  to discuss the U.S. Navy's ability to deter conflict in the Pacific. As  China's navy has grown, ours has shrunk, and we are running out of time  to tilt the balance of power back toward the United States and ensure  that deterrence does not fail in the Western Pacific.   For centuries, American naval power has proven the decisive factor in  our security and prosperity. The U.S. Navy secured our victory in the  American Revolution during the 18th century. It enabled our  transformation into a world power in the 19th century. It defeated  adversaries in two world wars in the 20th century, and it will decide  our success or failure this century.   China's rising strength on the seas is a direct threat to  international peace and security. Their ability to exercise total  control of the major sea lanes strikes at the heart of free and market- based economies in Asia and around the globe. For a few minutes today,  I will outline the threat, our lack of preparedness, and what it will  take for us to deter China from acting in an irresponsible way.   The Chinese Communist Party understands a truth that 19th century  American CAPT Alfred Thayer Mahan summarized when he said, ``Whoever  rules the waves rules the world.'' Beijing knows a great navy is a  necessary step in their march for regional dominance.   And so, while our own shipyards were closing and downsizing and our  shipbuilding budgets shrank, China went to sea.   According to the Secretary of the Navy, China has more shipbuilding  capacity in just one shipyard than we have in our entire industrial  base. By the end of this decade, China is expected to have a fleet of  440 warships. If the Navy's latest 30-year shipbuilding plan is a  guide, we would have only 290. Of course, the statutory requirement  enacted by the Congress and signed by the President of the United  States is 355.   A Chinese navy of the size I mentioned--440--and a strength relative  to our own directly endangers our partner Taiwan, our allies in Japan  and in the Philippines, and our military bases in the Pacific. More  Chinese ships means more sea-based Chinese vertical launch cells-- missile delivery systems, which are the primary offensive tool of any  navy. A recent analysis found Beijing has more vertical launch cells  than the United States and our allies combined. Those cells, in  addition to China's extensive sensing capabilities on the ground and in  space, increase their advantage in the Western Pacific as our Navy  plays an away game far from home.   These troubling facts demand a decisive response. Yet our Navy has  failed to keep up. The Department of Defense recently delivered another  30-year shipbuilding plan that fails to meet Congress's requirement.  Their plan contains three building options, only one of which would  grow the fleet to  [[Page S1491]]  the legally required battle force size of 355 ships. Even then, it  would take two decades to get there.   This is not a blueprint for long-term American command of the sea.  Instead, the administration is ceding control of the Western Pacific to  dictator Xi Jinping and his Communist fleet. In fact, we are still  living off the remains of the Reagan-era defense buildup, retiring  ships we built at the end of the Cold War, without replacing them. Our  shipbuilding pace has slowed. At the peak of the 1980s production  surge, we constructed four Los Angeles-class attack submarines every  year. Today, we struggle to build just two advanced submarines  annually.   Some put a positive spin on this policy, labeling it a ``strategic  pause'' or saying this is a deliberate strategy of ``divest to  invest.'' Whatever the catch phrase, it is dangerous. We are shrinking  our fleet and leaving our sailors to fight a war without the tools to  win.   In some cases, technicians are forced to repair destroyers by taking  parts off of other destroyers just to meet deployment requirements. One  of our most vital submarines in the Indo-Pacific, the USS Connecticut,  sustained damage 2 years ago and will likely not be repaired for  another 5 years--another 5 years. Congress has already appropriated $50  million to repair the Connecticut, and we will probably need to set  aside more funds. The USS Boise--one of our fast-attack nuclear  submarines--has spent 8 years in dry dock--8 years in dry dock--to  receive rudimentary maintenance--8 years. This is absolutely  unacceptable. It will cost over $350 million to repair the Boise on top  of the costs associated with keeping it in port for nearly a decade.   A diminished fleet size is not just about numbers; it has other  cascading negative effects, particularly on our sailors. When we have  fewer assets and yet ask our Navy to perform the same mission, we make  sailors take longer deployments. That means a lower quality of life and  higher stress on our ships and on our sailors, both of which impede our  readiness efforts--and our recruitment and retention, I might add.   This diminished naval strength leaves us in a dangerous near-term  situation with China, whose ambitions to dominate Asia loom large over  the next decade.   Time is not on our side. We have promising new military technology  set to come online in a decade or more, but China will likely reach its  strongest position against us much sooner, well before that new  technology of ours is in operation. That, combined with the retirement  of ships built in the 1980s, has led some to dub the coming decade as  the ``terrible 20s.''   Our Navy struggles to meet basic requirements, while Xi Jinping  visits Chinese military installations and tells its sailors to prepare  for war. This discrepancy led Director of Naval Intelligence RADM Mike  Studeman to say that we have ``China blindness.'' It is no small thing  for a one-star to tell us we are blind to the capabilities and urgency  of our chief adversary's military.   We are short on time, but we are not out of time. We do not want a  conflict with China. China and the United States can prosper and  coexist, but the best way to achieve peace is deterrence. To deter  China in the short term and restore our long-term maritime strength, I  propose three concrete steps that we can take right now.   First, we need to make a monumental investment in maritime  infrastructure. Our shipbuilders are ready to build more, but they need  the investments in machine tooling, workforce, and materials.   As our Chief of Naval Operations recently testified, our Navy should  get a second shipyard for Constellation-class frigate construction, and  we should increase investments in our submarine industrial base if we  have any hope of implementing the AUKUS deal. The AUKUS deal is a 2022  agreement in which we promised to sell submarines to Australia as fast  as we can build them.   Congress can spark a renaissance of shipbuilding by offering a demand  signal for a major maritime buildup. Alongside a bipartisan group of  Representatives and Senators, I have introduced the SHIPYARD Act to  offer just such a demand signal.   The act authorizes $25 billion of investment in our shipbuilding  efforts. It empowers our shipyards to build the future of the U.S. Navy  fleet and could be immediately implemented into this year's defense  funding measures.   Increased funding could push the Department of the Navy's Shipyard  Infrastructure Optimization Program to new levels of efficacy. This  would add to the success we are already seeing, and there is no time to  waste.   Second, we must immediately give the Navy the capabilities they need  to deter a conflict in the next 5 years. This means taking technologies  and concepts that are already on the shelf and integrating them into  our Western Pacific posture. We should be forging ahead with purchases  of sea mines, unmanned platforms, and long-range munitions, which would  all be relevant and capable in the near term.   We also need to accelerate our efforts to field maritime target cells  to ensure our fleet is properly able to coordinate and target  adversarial assets far from our shores.   Third, we should continue to boost the programs within the Navy that  are already making major strides toward deterring China. Commandant of  the Marine Corps David Berger's Force Design 2030 has transformed the  Marine Corps into the cutting edge of our deterrent posture in the  Pacific, and General Berger needs a fleet of amphibious ships to  complete the job. Congress should step up and add funding for  amphibious ships in this year's NDAA. Multiyear block buys would also  signal demand to the shipbuilding industry.   These programs will be difficult and will, of course, cost money, but  failing to complete them will facilitate China's advance and be much  more difficult and much more expensive in the long run.   We are in our most dangerous national security moment since World War  II. We are in our most dangerous security moment since World War II,  and we must urgently restore our naval deterrent to meet the moment.   Others have recognized this throughout our history. Reflecting on the  dark days of World War II in early 1942, Winston Churchill wrote:         The foundation of all our hopes and dreams was the immense       shipbuilding program of the United States.    Once again, the peace and security of the free world depends on our  Navy. We need to rebuild it with haste.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Hubert  Couch and James Causey--interns in  [[Page S1516]]  my office--be granted floor privileges until May 4, 2023.
