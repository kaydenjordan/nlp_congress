 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a veteran to  recognize an amazing achievement of a fellow servicewoman in Iowa.   Last month, Private First Class Taylor Patterson, a student at Iowa  State University, became the first female enlisted infantry soldier in  the Iowa National Guard after being the first Iowa woman to complete  the rigorous 22-week training program at Fort Benning, Georgia.   Five years ago, the United States Army began to allow women to serve  in combat positions given that they can pass the same base physical  requirement for all combat personnel. Through determination and the  support of her family and team at Fort Benning, Private First Class  Patterson blazed a trail for generations of Iowa women.   For over 183 years, the Iowa National Guard has been an excellent  example of service above self by always answering their call to duty.  Whether it is assisting communities in disaster relief efforts, like we  saw with last year's derecho in Iowa, or being deployed to Afghanistan  this year to aid in the refugee crisis, Iowa's National Guard has  always gone above and beyond in their service to our State and our  country.   Congratulations to Private First Class Patterson for her service and  for being a trailblazer for women everywhere.  [[Page H5936]]                                ____________________
