 Mr. Speaker, Ethiopian Prime Minister  Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali has made positive changes in the country since his  April inauguration. Prime Minister Ali has released thousands of  political prisoners and ended a state of emergency.   Critically, Dr. Abiy has stated that Ethiopia will fully comply with  the Algiers Agreement, the peace agreement signed for the formal end of  the war of 12 years between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which, gruesomely,  has killed more than 100,000 people.   Prime Minister Abiy's leadership and initiative to personally visit  with the Eritrean leadership and offer direct airline routes has melted  away a nearly 18-year cold war between the two states.   The United States will continue to support Prime Minister Abiy's  diplomatic outreach and reform, which will  [[Page H7095]]  also contribute to regional stability. New hope and opportunity with  free market reforms are now available to the people of Ethiopia.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Welcome, Pastor John Hagee and Christians United for Israel, to  Washington, addressed last night by Ambassador Nikki Haley.                            ____________________
