 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 37.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is an important moment for the House, Madam Chair. For years,  under administrations of both parties, the Congress has handed away our  authority and abrogated our responsibility when it comes to foreign  policy, particularly the questions of how and where our military is  engaged around the world.   Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to  declare war, yet we have given Presidents of both parties a virtual  blank check to send our brave servicemembers into harm's way while we  have stood on the sidelines.   With the measure we are considering today, we take some of that power  back, and we do so to restore a sense of American values and American  leadership to the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.   For the last few years, we have all seen horrific images of the  civilian casualties in the Yemen war: starving children, millions  displaced, outbreaks of deadly disease.   Madam Chair, 85,000 children have starved to death. Fourteen million  are on the brink of famine. More than a million suffer from cholera.  And the ongoing military operations are bringing us no closer to a  resolution. The only way out of this mess is for parties to sit down  and work toward a political solution.   The United States can and should play a role pushing for that  solution, pushing parties to make a commitment to negotiations. This  measure, introduced by Mr. Khanna, will help us do exactly that.   Let me explain why this is so important and why I support passing  this resolution right now.   In the last few years, the Saudi-led coalition has carried out 18,000  airstrikes. A full one-third of those strikes hit nonmilitary targets.  This is absolutely reckless.   I am not naive, Madam Chair. I know we have critical strategic  interests in that region. The Houthis are a problem. They get support  from Iran. They launch missiles into Saudi territory and international  waterways, threatening Saudi civilians. They are starving the Yemeni  people, diverting assistance, and holding civilians hostage to their  political demands. But we cannot just give the coalition a blank check  when so many innocent lives are being lost. And if the administration  won't demand any sort of accountability from the Saudis and Emiratis,  it is time for Congress to act.   I want to acknowledge my friend from Texas, the ranking member on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. I believe that he also wants to  see Congress reclaim our prerogatives on foreign policy, though I  understand we have an honest difference of opinion on the approach we  are dealing with today.   I am glad that we moved this measure through regular order, that we  had a hearing with experts and a markup, and that the gentleman from  Texas and I could make our cases before the Rules Committee. It allowed  me to hear the arguments from all perspectives on this issue.   I think, during this debate, we will hear my friends on the other  side call this resolution misguided. I think because this resolution  has to do with our security agreements with the Saudis and Emiratis, we  will hear them question what impact this may have on other security  agreements.   It is a fair question, to be honest. That is why this measure is  tailored so specifically to deal with just this situation. This is not  a broad, blanket policy that is going to tie the hands of the executive  branch. There is no dangerous precedent being set here, just an attempt  to stop a war that is costing far too many innocent lives.   I think we will hear my friends question whether this measure would  even do anything because this measure withdraws American forces engaged  in hostilities, and the Pentagon says ``hostilities'' only applies to  situations where American troops are firing weapons at an enemy. I have  two reactions to that.   First of all, this measure would specifically define ``hostilities''  to include aerial refueling of warplanes carrying out airstrikes  against Houthi militants. Now, I understand the Defense  [[Page H1544]]  Department has stopped refueling as a matter of policy, but policies  can be reversed, so this resolution would cut off refueling as a matter  of law.    My second point is broader and gets at the heart of today's debate.  This body is not subject to the definitions conjured up by the Defense  Department. We don't ask permission to exercise our Article I  authority. Of course, the Pentagon will try to define things in a way  that consolidates the power of the executive branch, but Congress, with  authority over war powers, need not accept that definition.   The Congress has lost its grip on foreign policy, in my opinion, by  granting too much deference to the executive branch, by failing to  examine the decisions, determinations, and definitions that are used to  justify sending Americans into harm's way. Our job is to keep that  branch in check, not to shrug our shoulders when they tell us to mind  our own business.   Lastly, I think we will hear my colleagues on the other side ask:  Isn't this just all politics? No, Madam Chair. Politics is what the  former majority did to this resolution twice during the last Congress.  Politics is stifling debate on national security issues because we are  uncomfortable with the message it might send or we don't want to take a  tough vote.                                time  1415    Politics is walking away from our constitutional responsibilities, as  Congress has done for far too long; and frankly, we have done it for  far too long, Congresses in both parties with a majority and Presidents  in both parties.   Our Article I responsibilities are things that we cannot just simply  turn the other way. We are a coequal branch of government, and we have  not had a declaration of war, for instance, since 1941. We are content  to just tell whatever administration is in, go ahead, you handle it. We  don't have any responsibility. I hope that that stops this afternoon.   The other body has already weighed in on this measure. It passed with  bipartisan support. Today, the Members of the House get our chance to  go on record finally and say where we stand.   I joined this resolution as an original cosponsor because I think it  will lead to a sort of reckoning for our government.   What is our role in the conflict in Yemen?   What is Congress' voice in our foreign policy?   How will we exercise American leadership and American power?   What will we provide and what will we withhold to push warring  parties toward peace?   I want to thank Mr. Khanna for his hard work and for his leadership  in shining the light on this issue.   I want to thank our members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  who have contributed so far to a valuable debate.   I want to thank Mr. McCaul, who has made his opposition to this about  the policy, not about the politics or the personalities. We are going  to have a lot more debates; sometimes we will be on the same side and  sometimes not, but I hope we can always grapple with these challenges  in a substantive way.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), the author of this joint resolution.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee's  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, a very valued member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Levin), a new member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who is  already making his mark.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.  [[Page H1546]]     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu), a very well-respected member of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat), another very valuable member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), another new member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.  [[Page H1548]]     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), a champion of progressive causes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), another very valued member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont  (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Today is the day that Congress begins to take back its jurisdiction  over war and peace. For time after time and year after year,  administration after administration, Congress after Congress, the  Congress has relinquished its responsibility given to us by the  Constitution.   The Constitution clearly says that Congress has the power to wage  war, and yet, since President Roosevelt declared war against Japan on  December 7, 1941, we have had war after war and conflict after  conflict, and Congress has not had anything to do with it. Congress has  been silent.   This is not a matter of whether a war is a good war or a bad war.  This is a matter of the fact that this Congress needs to make that  determination.   Article I makes us a coequal branch of government. And, again, for  too long, we have had administration after administration, Republican  and Democratic, usurp the power that should be the Congress'. So this  is the day my colleagues would begin to take it back.   Mr. Chair, I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle have  been saying that this is not the best way to do it, but, you know, I  have learned through the years that, if you don't take the bull by the  horns, it is never the best way to do it.   There is always a reason not to do it. There is always a reason to  point out certain things and say, well, this is not a perfect  situation. This isn't the perfect situation. I will be the first to say  that. But it is perfect in terms of saying we will take back our  jurisdiction and do what the American people elected us to do.   Again, I want to thank Mr. Khanna for his tireless work on this  issue.   As I mentioned, this measure is an important step in Congress  reclaiming its role in foreign policy by debating where and when the  United States military is engaged abroad. I don't think that is too  much to ask. I think that is what we should be doing.   With the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it is critical that we act  now. We can go after Iran another time--and heaven knows I have been  the sponsor of many resolutions and bills sanctioning Iran--but this is  not to mix apples with oranges.   There is a civil war going on now in Yemen, and innocent children are  dying. We have an ability to put an end to that, and that is what we  should do. With this humanitarian crisis, it is critical that we don't  delay.   So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 1 minute. I actually support  intelligence sharing. We need to work to reduce civilian casualties and  ensure that the United States has a clear picture into the security  threats in the region.   However, this amendment is unnecessary. The underlying resolution  does not implicate intelligence sharing. I have been very clear about  what this resolution would do. We have made necessary changes to this  resolution, but I do not support adding unnecessary rules of  construction to a resolution which has already passed the Senate.   For that reason, I am opposed to this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the motion.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I accept this resolution, and I  agree with everything that Mr. Kustoff just said. Anti-Semitism is a  scourge. It is a scourge on humanity; it is a scourge on this country;  and it has to be fought just the way prejudice of any kind has to be  fought.   I think that this entire House should support this and say, once and  for all, with a united voice, we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any  shape or form.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the instructions of the House in  the motion to recommit, I report the joint resolution, H.J. Res 37,  back to the House with an amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.J. Res. 37, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House, including the change now at the desk.
