 Madam Speaker, for 228 years the United  States Postal Service has delivered for the American people. It is an  institution built on trust, trust that the United States military  veterans will receive their prescriptions each and every month, trust  that Social Security recipients will receive their checks each and  every month, and trust that small businesses can manage and grow with  the assistance of the United States Postal Service.   Today, the trust and confidence of the United States Postal Service  is under attack by the very administration and Postmaster General who  should be protecting the time-honored tradition of that institution.   Yesterday we stood outside the mail processing facility in Buffalo  where five sorting machines were removed without explanation.   This House will approve today the Delivering for America Act, an act  to protect the United States Postal Service from the destructive acts  of the President and his postmaster disaster.                            ____________________
