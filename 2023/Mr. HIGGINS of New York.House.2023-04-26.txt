 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor one of  western New York's greatest athletes, Randy Smith.   A natural competitor, he came to Buffalo to play basketball, soccer,  and track and field at Buffalo State before he was drafted into the  National Basketball Association by the Buffalo Braves in the third  round.   An underdog from the very start, Randy Smith became the heart and  soul of the Braves, holding records and becoming the most valuable  player in the 1978 NBA All-Star Game.   Randy Smith embodied western New York's hardworking spirit and  community pride. He often spent time playing basketball in local parks  and visiting city schools, serving as an inspiration and mentor to kids  across the community.   Randy Smith passed away at the age of 60 in 2009. During a time when  our community is still healing from heartbreak and loss, we must  continue to keep his legacy alive.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Buffalo Braves all-star  Randy Smith and his commitment to becoming the good neighbor to the  City of Good Neighbors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 2811.   Under President Biden, we have created 12 million jobs, including  800,000 manufacturing jobs, and unemployment is at a 54-year low.   The previous administration lost 3 million jobs in 4 years, including  nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs.   This irresponsible proposal on the floor today would tank our  economic recovery and hurt hardworking families, and it would not be  good for my western New York district.   Throughout the pandemic, this Congress worked together to keep  families strong amidst unprecedented uncertainty. It is shocking how  anti-family this bill is.   This bill will lead to less healthcare for parents and children. More  kids will go to bed hungry because their parents  [[Page H2016]]  can't afford food. It would cut healthcare for veterans, hurting not  only them but their families and caregivers, as well.   Congress raised the debt limit nearly 80 times since 1960--the  majority of those taking place under Republican Presidents.   It is time for the GOP to stop playing games with the livelihood of  American families.   I ask my colleagues to join me in rejecting this proposal and instead  pass a clean bill that prevents the first default in our Nation's  history.
