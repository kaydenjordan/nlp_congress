 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is facing a  critical point as we discern whether we will lead or whether we will  follow in 21st century innovation.   The Chinese Communist Party, following years of underhanded  practices, including cheating and even outright theft, is poised to  gain global dominance in the technology and telecommunications sectors.  Their ultimate goal is controlling critical market segments and even  weaponizing the global supply chains for medical equipment, weapons,  and other critical electronics.   Through pawns like Huawei and ZTE, this regime is seeking to dominate  next-generation technology like artificial intelligence, semiconductor  production, quantum computing, 5G, and beyond.   Funded directly by the Chinese Communist Party, these companies are  free to operate however they please, distorting the global market and  edging out free-market competitors in their mission to monopolize the  industry.   If we do not intercede, Huawei and ZTE could stand to be the only  companies left with the ability to innovate. This is a daunting threat  as we look past 5G to 6G.   As I consider the innovation that I personally have witnessed in the  span of my own medical career, I recognize that there is a world of  opportunity to be discovered in the remaining days of the 21st century,  from remote surgeries and autonomous vehicles to other inevitable  additions to our ever-increasing virtual world.   If the United States does not act now to correct course, the Chinese  Government will succeed in controlling the world's electronic network-- our data, our research, and, ultimately, our security.   As a nation, we cannot allow this malicious regime to take hold of  the world's network. America needs to lead the way and work with our  allies to beat the Chinese Communist Party in deploying next-generation  telecom networks.   On the China Task Force, we are developing pragmatic solutions to  stand up to the Chinese Government. We are working on legislation to  standardize and create interoperability to every point in radio access  networks. Open RAN, or O-RAN, are critical to driving competition in  existing networks.   Additionally, we are working to lessen Huawei and ZTE's grip on the  global market. For years, Americans have gone to great lengths to break  up trusts and other monopolies by enforcing free-market principles.  Now, the China Task Force is developing opportunities to do this on a  global scale.   Throughout this process, we must be mindful of the supply chains that  are used to manufacture every component of the devices that we rely on  daily. I am working to end Chinese dominance in manufacturing and  sourcing, from rare earth elements and mineral extraction all the way  to their undercutting of the internet. By ending this stranglehold, we  can ensure that China will not be able to control and dictate their  terms for any nation to access future technologies.   All of us surely can agree that Americans must be set up once again  to lead the world in research and innovation.   We want American jobs for American citizens. We want American  innovation for the American people. And as President Trump said last  week, we want the American Dream for American children.   Congress must counter the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to  dominate the telecom sector, and we must ensure that Americans can step  up to the challenge.   For centuries, Americans have been trailblazers. Once again, we are  facing a new frontier. This is not the time to stop moving forward.  This is our chance, and this is the time to make a difference.                            ____________________
