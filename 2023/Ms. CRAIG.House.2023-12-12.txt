 Mr. Speaker, too many American families know the immense  heartbreak of losing a loved one to an overdose, but overdose deaths  are preventable, and we have a responsibility to do everything we can  in this body to save lives.   That is why I introduced my bill, the bipartisan RECONNECTIONS Act,  to get overdose education and prevention tools like naloxone into the  hands of all of those who need it and to ensure that the opioid crisis  is treated like the public health crisis it truly is.   I am proud that my colleagues have recognized the urgent need to  expand access to these lifesaving overdose prevention resources, but we  must continue our bipartisan work to keep our community safe.   Mr. Speaker, I thank so much my mental health and substance use  advisory council, a group of law enforcement officers, educators,  parents and community members who I work with regularly to find ways to  address the opioid crisis in our home communities and across this great  country.   Your stories, and especially the memories of your loved ones, that  you have shared with me over the years have truly touched my heart. It  is these stories and memories that have informed the policies that we  champion here and are at the top of my mind as this bill stands on the  House floor today.   Thank you for your tireless drive and dedication. You are helping to  make our community safer.   We have so much more work ahead of us as a community in Minnesota 2  and as a Nation. If it helps to save just one life, it is worth doing  the work.   Thank you to the Members who are coming together on both sides of the  aisle today to support this important bill.                            ____________________
