 Madam President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Captain James Grasela III, Sergeant Lee Ann Shelton, and  Officer Dallas Thompson of the Kansas City, KS, Police Department.   On January 7, 2022, while the Kansas City Police were conducting a  burglary investigation, Officer Thompson found pills crumpled in an  envelope belonging to a detained suspect. Captain James Grasela  immediately recognized the pills as ones which might be laced with  fentanyl. Officer Thompson did everything by the book: placed the pills  and envelope in an evidence bag, sealed it, and removed his gloves, yet  just minutes later, he dropped to the ground, struggling to breathe. It  was only through the quick action of Captain Grasela and the other  officers on the scene that Officer Thompson was able to survive.   If the officers had not been there to administer emergency  medication, Officer Thompson would not have made it home to his two  daughters. Thankfully, this accidental overdose did not end in tragedy.  Unfortunately, deaths involving Fentanyl are not uncommon in this  country. Fentanyl kills more Americans than any other drug and is a  clear threat to our society. The fact that it takes less Fentanyl than  can fit on the tip of a pencil to kill someone makes this crisis even  more severe.   I want to honor these officers for everything they do to protect our  citizens from the dangers of fentanyl. They put their lives on the line  every day to shield Americans from this crisis, as seen this past  January. I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the bravery  of our Kansas City, Kansas, police officers and to honor them for their  dedication to protecting their fellow Americans from the scourge of  Fentanyl.                            ____________________
