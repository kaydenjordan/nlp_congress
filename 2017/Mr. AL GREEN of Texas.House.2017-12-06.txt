 Mr. Speaker, again, I am honored to be  accorded the privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, the American poet, Robert Frost, penned a poem with the  words: ``Two roads diverged in the woods, and I took the one less  traveled. . . . ''   Mr. Speaker, in a metaphorical sense today, sometime after noon,  shortly after 12 p.m., I will take the road less traveled.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that no one take this journey with me. I am  absolutely convinced that this is a road worth traveling, but I have  not asked that others travel this road and will not.   Mr. Speaker, after noon today, I will present Articles of  Impeachment. There are many who want to know: What is next? What will  happen after there is a vote?   Mr. Speaker, I will satiate those concerns after the vote. But I will  take the road less traveled, and I believe that it will make all the  difference.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, once again, I am accorded the  preeminent privilege of addressing the House. I consider this one of  the great honors of my life to be able to address the House of  Representatives.   Today, after this 1-minute speech, Mr. Speaker, I will present a  privileged resolution.   I want to thank the many persons, especially my staff, who have  assisted in the drafting and crafting of this resolution. I am grateful  to the many persons who have supported me in many ways.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high  misdemeanors.   Resolved, that Donald John Trump, President of the United States is  unfit to be President and is impeached for high misdemeanors, and that  the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate:   Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of  the United States, in the name of itself and of the people of the  United States, against Donald John Trump, President of the United  States, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for  high misdemeanors committed as President constituting harm to American  society to the manifest injury of the people of the United States:   Article I.   In his capacity as President of the United States, unmindful of the  high duties of his high office and the dignity and proprieties thereof,  and of the harmony and courtesies necessary for stability within the  society of the United States, Donald John Trump has with his statements  done more than insult individuals and groups of Americans, he has  harmed the society of the United States, brought shame and dishonor to  the office of President of the United States, sowing discord among the  people of the United States by associating the majesty and dignity of  the presidency with causes rooted in White supremacy, bigotry, racism,  anti-Semitism, White nationalism, or neo-Nazism on one or more of the  following occasions:   On August 15, 2017, Donald John Trump made a widely published  statement characterizing a group of anti-Semites, bigots, racists,  White nationalists, and Ku Klux Klansmen who rallied in  Charlottesville, Virginia, as ``very fine people.''   On August 7, 2017, hate groups returned to Charlottesville, Virginia,  at the statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, chanting ``You  will not replace us!''. Since this event on October 7, the President  has made many widely published statements about many things, including  the National Football League, but has not made one widely published  statement condemning the hate groups for returning to the place where  an innocent person lost her life at the hands of hate.   On November 29, 2017, Donald John Trump shared three videos posted by  a leader of a British political party considered by many to be an  extremist group. The videos purported to show various violent acts  committed by Muslims and were entitled: ``Muslim migrant beats up Dutch  boy on crutches!''; ``Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!''; and  ``Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!''.  The clearly inferable intent of the post was to demonstrate the alleged  propensity of Muslim immigrants to engage in violent acts. Even if the  videos showed what they purport to show, in sharing these videos with  his 43,800,000 followers on Twitter, Donald John Trump's dissemination  of such material evinces an invidious intent to create division within  American society.   In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, by his  statements, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the  dignities and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony, respect, and  courtesies necessary for stability within the society of the United  States, has undermined the integrity of his office, has sown discord  among the people of the United States, has brought disrepute, contempt,  ridicule, and disgrace on the Presidency, has acted in a manner  antithetical to the cause of a just society, has betrayed his trust as  President to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,  and committed a high misdemeanor in office.   Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the society of  the United States is unfit to be President and warrants impeachment,  trial, and removal from office.   Article II.   In his capacity as President of the United States, unmindful of the  high duties of his high office, of the dignity and proprieties thereof,  and of the harmony and respect necessary for stability within the  society of the United States, Donald John Trump has with his statements  done more than simply insult individuals and groups of Americans. He  has harmed the American society by publicly casting contempt on  individuals and groups, inciting hate and hostility, sowing discord  among the people of the United States, on the basis of race, national  origin, religion, gender and sexual orientation, on one or more of the  following occasions:   On January 27, 2017, Donald John Trump issued Executive Order 13769  providing for a partial shutdown of immigration from mainly Muslim  countries, to fulfill a campaign promise that read as follows: Donald  J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration, New York, New  York, December 7, 2015. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and  complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our  country's representatives can figure out what's going on, thereby  casting contempt upon Muslims, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing  discord among the people of the United States on the basis of religion.   On July 26, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: ``After consultation with my Generals and  military experts, please be advised that the United States Government  will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any  capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive  and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous  medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would  entail,'' and thereby casting contempt on  [[Page H9674]]  transgender individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing  discord among the people of the United States on the basis of gender.   On September 23, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL  owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ``Get that son of a  B-I-T-C-H off the field right now, out, he's fired? He's fired!'',  thereby casting contempt on professional football players who engaged  in constitutionally protected protests pertaining to allegations of  police misconduct with regard to racial minorities, as well as casting  contempt on the professional players' mothers by calling the mothers  ``B-I-T-C-H-E-S'', effectively calling these mothers ``dogs,'' thereby  inciting hate and hostility and sowing discord among the people of the  United States on the basis of race and gender.   On September 30, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: ``They want everything to be done for them  when it should be a community effort,'' in the aftermath of Hurricane  Maria, thereby casting contempt on Puerto Rican citizens of the United  States, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the  people of the United States based on national origin and race.   On October 3, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've  thrown our budget a little out of whack because we spent a lot of money  on Puerto Rico, that's fine, we've saved a lot of lives, but Donald  John Trump did not make similar comments about Texas or Florida in the  aftermath of Hurricane Harvey or Hurricane Irma, treating the Puerto  Rican citizens of the United States disparately, thereby casting  contempt on Puerto Ricans, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing  discord among the people of the United States based on national origin  and race.   On October 19, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: ``The Fake News is going crazy with wacky  Congresswoman Wilson (D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and  gave a total lie on content!'', thereby casting contempt on an African- American Member of Congress, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing  discord among the people of the United States based on gender and race.   On October 21, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: ``I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking  about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is  killing the Democrat Party!'', thereby casting contempt on an African- American female Member of Congress, inciting hate and hostility, and  sowing discord among the people of the United States based on gender  and race.   On October 22, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement  substantially as follows: ``Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that  keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You  watch her in action & vote R!'', thereby casting contempt on an  African-American female Member of Congress, inciting hate and  hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States  based on gender and race.   In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, by his  statements, brought the high office of President of the United States  in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute; has sown discord among  the people of the United States; has demonstrated that he is unfit to  be President; and has betrayed his trust as President of the United  States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States; and  has committed a high misdemeanor in office.   Therefore, Donald John Trump, by causing such harm to the society of  the United States, is unfit to be President, warrants impeachment,  trial, and removal from office.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of privilege  of the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
