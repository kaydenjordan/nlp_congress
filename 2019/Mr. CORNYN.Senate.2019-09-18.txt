 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to legislative session to  resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2740; further,  that at 2:20 p.m., there be up to 20 minutes of debate equally divided  between the chairman and ranking member; and that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the cloture motion on  the motion to proceed to H.R. 2740, with the mandatory quorum call  being waived.    Mr. President, one of most poignant moments of my life-- and certainly of my career here in the Senate--came in 2017, when a  gunman opened fire on a Sunday service at the little Baptist Church  right outside of Sutherland Springs, TX.   Twenty-six lives were lost that day; 20 people were injured; and the  entire community--that small, little community outside of San Antonio-- was shaken to its core by this hateful act.   It didn't take us too long to learn about the shooter--a man with a  record of domestic violence, animal cruelty, and mental illness. He had  been court-martialed by the Air Force and convicted of serious domestic  abuse, which is a felony.   By law, the shooter should have been prevented from purchasing or  even possessing a firearm, but he wasn't because the critically  important information about his criminal background had not been  uploaded into the relevant background check databases maintained by the  FBI, even though a Federal statute clearly states that all Federal  agencies are required to do so. As a result, the gunman was able to  unlawfully purchase four firearms, three of which he used to carry out  this despicable act.   In the wake of any tragedy like this, you can't help but ask: What  if?   In this instance, it was our sad duty to ask those questions, but we  knew the answer. If his criminal record had been uploaded into the FBI  background check system, the shooter would have been prevented from  purchasing these firearms that he used in the attack.   It was the worst kind of system failure. I searched my conscience,  and I searched the record to try to figure out exactly what we might be  able to do to prevent acts like this from occurring in the future.   Ten days after the shooting, I introduced a bill called the Fix NICS  Act. Now, it is a little bit confusing. NICS is the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System. But it was clear that we needed to  fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System--hence, the  name Fix NICS Act, which is now law.   That law broadened the background check system to prevent violent  criminals who shouldn't be able to purchase firearms from being able to  do so. It was actually one of the good things that came out of this  terrible tragedy. At a time when division and partisanship were much  more common than working together, we actually were able to overcome  that partisan divide and division to pass this commonsense solution to  a real problem, which I am convinced will save lives in the future.  This is the kind of thing our constituents expect us to do and what we  need to do more of.   It has been 2 years since the shooting in Sutherland Springs.  Unfortunately, that was not the last mass violence episode experienced  by the State of Texas. On August 3 of this year, a gunman stormed the  El Paso Walmart, killing 22 people and wounding two dozen others. Less  than a month later, on August 31, a man went on a shooting rampage in  Midland and Odessa, killing 7 people and wounding 25.   I visited each of these cities in the days following the shootings to  pay my respects to those who had lost loved ones, to visit those who  were still recovering in hospital rooms, and also to thank the law  enforcement officers who I believe saved lives that would have  otherwise been lost but for their quick and professional response.   In those early days, we were still gathering information and working  to get to the bottom of how these shootings happened. Now that we have  a pretty good idea about what happened and what didn't happen that  should have happened, it is time to work on solutions to help prevent  these types of episodes of mass violence in the future.   Over the weekend, the minority leader here in the Senate and the  House Speaker said that any proposal that does not include the House- passed universal background check legislation ``will not get the job  done.'' But I would say to them that there is simply no evidence that  if the House bill was law, it would have prevented any of these recent  acts of violence.   I have to ask: If the solution that you proposed would not have  prevented these acts from occurring, what is the point? Is this about  making a statement? Is this about virtue signaling? Is this about  politics? Or is this about trying to come up with solutions to the  problem?   We also know that the President has repeatedly issued a veto threat  on that particular bill, and we know there is zero--zero chance--that  it will ever become law. That is not what I call getting the job done.   Some of the folks who don't believe in the Second Amendment are using  these tragedies to advance an agenda rather than to try to solve a  problem. That is not good enough, and this is not what the American  people deserve.   I am not interested in introducing legislation just because we are  being urged to ``do something.'' I am interested in trying to solve a  problem and save lives in the process. That is what we did with the Fix  NICS legislation, and that is exactly what we need to do by coming  together once again.   In the wake of the shootings in El Paso, Midland, and Odessa, I have  been working on some ideas that I believe can, once again, help to  unite Congress so we can pass laws that will have a real impact, and  not just ``do something.''   One of the most important ways to intervene as early as possible is  to improve access to mental health services. Assisted outpatient  treatment programs, otherwise known as AOTs, were under the 21st  Century Cures Act, as part of a bill I introduced back then called the  Mental Health and Safe Communities Act.   What is so important about assisted outpatient treatment programs is  the alternatives available to a family member. When your son or  daughter or your spouse or your parent or your brother or your sister  becomes mentally ill and is suffering a crisis, your options are  extraordinarily limited. The assistant outpatient treatment programs  provide alternatives to allow a family member to help somebody  undergoing a mental health crisis who otherwise might be a danger to  themselves and others.   We know that the most common cause of gun-related deaths are  suicides. If we could somehow get people  [[Page S5554]]  the mental health treatment they need early, before they even think  about taking their own life, we would save many lives. If we can get  people--like Adam Lanza, for example, in Sandy Hook--mental health  treatment, so he does not become violent to others as well, I think we  have a very realistic opportunity to actually save lives going forward.   The Mental Health and Safe Communities Act also increased resources  and training for law enforcement and first responders to identify those  with mental illness and respond with treatment-based alternatives. By  strengthening and expanding these programs and prioritizing a strong  mental health workforce, I believe we can avert potential crises before  they happen--not all of them, but I think we can make some real  progress.   Additionally, I think there are things we could do to build on the  success of Fix NICS by enforcing current law and improving the existing  background check system.   We know we need to take decisive action against individuals who are  violating current law by selling and manufacturing large numbers of  firearms without a Federal firearms license. It is clearly Congress's  intent to make sure that if you are in the business of buying and  selling firearms in a commercial enterprise, you should be licensed by  the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or the ATF.   For example, the shooter in Odessa attempted to purchase a firearm  from a licensed dealer, but because licensed dealers must perform  background checks, he flunked it. He managed to circumvent the  background check requirement by later purchasing his weapon from an  individual who was obviously in the business of manufacturing and  selling firearms, but who never registered as a firearms dealer. Thus,  the shooter evaded a background check, because, as I said, all  federally licensed firearms dealers are required to do that.   We know that, under current law, it can be difficult to prosecute  individuals who are circumventing Federal law when they fail to  register as a federally licensed firearms dealer. I believe Congress  has a role--and there is a pretty clear path forward--to clarify  existing law so that unlicensed dealers can be prosecuted and more  people in the business of selling firearms will become federally  licensed firearms dealers and, thus, by definition, end up doing more  background checks when they are in the business of doing so.   As we have learned as well, it is also important for us to take  additional steps to harden soft targets like schools. We know that  people don't generally try to shoot up a police station. They go to the  soft targets, where these cowards know they will not be met with much  resistance. We need to improve intervention and threat assessment at  schools and share information more broadly between teachers, parents,  and counselors so we can identify potential acts of violence before  they occur.   My point is that we need to focus on things that could actually work.  In the case of the Fix NICS Act, it was able to become law because it  had the support of both Republicans and Democrats here in Congress, as  well as the President. That is precisely what we need to do again.   The sorts of things I mentioned are real and meaningful changes we  can make here to prevent more communities from grieving from additional  tragedies. I hope we rise to the occasion and once again work together  and come up with consensus legislation. I, as one Senator, am willing  to work with anyone on either side of the aisle to build consensus and  to pass legislation that will make our country and our communities  safer.                               Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, briefly on another matter, Justice Brett Kavanaugh was  confirmed almost a year ago, but that hasn't stopped the partisans on  the left from carrying out their fact-devoid smear campaign.   About this time last year, the confirmation hearing for an  exceptionally well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court was turned  into a media circus over uncorroborated and unsubstantiated  allegations. I had hoped that we had moved beyond this embarrassing  chapter for the Senate and for the country, but the circus has somehow  returned.   This time, the wild accusations didn't play out here in the Senate  but rather in the New York Times. That newspaper ran a story over the  weekend that publicized more unsubstantiated allegations against the  Justice from way back when he was in college.   The authors and editors managed to leave out the most critical detail  of the entire story. The woman at the center of this reported alleged  event declined to be interviewed by the journalists, and her friends  say she doesn't even recall such an event from occurring. But the New  York Times printed it anyway.   Well, the reaction was predictable and immediate. As members of the  media began pointing out this glaring hole in the story, some Democrats  saw an opportunity to continue their smear campaign against this good  man. They pounced on these unsubstantiated claims as evidence of  wrongdoing by Justice Kavanaugh and began calling for his impeachment.   Once the paper issued its colossal correction, none of these folks  backed down or apologized for calling for the impeachment of this good  judge, this good man, even though the newspaper admitted their error.   This isn't about the allegations or an investigation, or even Justice  Kavanaugh, for that matter. This is just the latest assault on the  independence of the Federal judiciary by a party that is struggling to  come to grips with reality.   From alarming court-packing calls to baseless allegations against a  sitting Supreme Court Justice, I am not anxious to see what sort of  reprehensible allegations and attacks they come up with next.   I would like to reiterate the commitment made by the majority leader  earlier this week. As long as we remain in the Senate, we will prevent  this type of mob rule and this sort of media circus and fight to  preserve the rule of law and the independence of our judiciary.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
