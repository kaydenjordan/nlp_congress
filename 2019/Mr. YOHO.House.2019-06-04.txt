 Mr. Speaker, I have the utmost respect for the majority  leader.   What I see as a problem here, that we see over and over again, is  finger pointing.   Yes, we did have the majority and the Republican Party didn't do  anything. But the Democrats had the majority back in President Obama's  first 2 years; they did nothing. But fingers get pointed. Nothing gets  done.   I rise today in opposition to this bill, but that is not to say I am  against legal immigration. In fact, I don't believe anyone in this  Chamber or up in the gallery, even though we can't reference them, is  against legal immigration.   I have repeatedly stated that I want to find a solution for the  Dreamers, those kids who, through no fault of their own, were brought  to the United States as children, illegally.   I support providing a method for those who have registered under the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, to obtain  legal status. However, this must only be done in coordination with  measures completely fixing our Nation's broken border.   We have to have border security and the enforcement of current  immigration law or we can't go forward, because a vacuum is turned on  and more people will come.   Without enhancing border security and addressing the loopholes in our  immigration system, this bill simply encourages more illegal  immigration.   There is a cause-and-effect process that does occur. If borders are  open, they are overrun, and immigration laws aren't enforced. Guess  what? There is more illegal immigration.   There is a crisis at our southwest border, and this year we have seen  apprehensions of people illegally entering at the border increasing  every month.   For instance, in January of 2019, there were approximately 49,000; in  April of 2019, 99,000. The numbers are going to continue to go up  because the word is out, as Mr. Collins said, if you get to the U.S.  southwest border, you will get amnesty.   That is unfortunate. The 99,000 in April are only the crossings that  we know about.   Let's look at why this is a crisis. It is because the previous  administration created an illegal program called DACA.    It has created a problem in Congress.   What we have to do, if my colleagues on the other side are serious  about finding a fix for this problem, for our broken immigration  system: Let's work together and agree that, without border security,  this will not work.   Let's fix this broken system once and for all. Let's do what is best  for America because, if we do what is best for America, is that not  best for the immigrants, too?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak before  the House and all the people who are here listening. Today's talk is  going to be a Special Order on the human rights abuses of China.   Being the 30-year anniversary of Tiananmen Square, where hundreds, if  not thousands, of people were murdered at the hands of the Chinese  Communist Party, I think it is due that we give respect to the people.   What I have here is a poster of people in China in 1989 who came to  Tiananmen Square. These were the  [[Page H4299]]  people who were peaceful. They were wanting a democracy. They were  wanting the things that we yearn for that are innate in all people.   And we are blessed in this Nation to be born in a country where the  founding principles said that our rights come from our creator, not  from government, and government is instituted by ``we the people.''   We give our consent to be governed, the very first nation on the  planet to ever do that. And so that word had spread around the world,  obviously.   China, being somewhat of a hermit nation from the Opium Wars of the  1840s into the early 1900s, wasn't introduced to the modern world. But  with the advent of publications and with other things, they became  aware of what freedom was. And freedom, as we know it in this country,  is something that we fought for.   The freedom and liberty that we have today is something that is  innate in all humans on the planet, regardless of what government form  they have. The ability to be free thinking, to want freedom, to want  liberty, is something that comes with us when we are born, when we are  created in the womb.   It is no different than, I guess, an oak tree. If an acorn is put in  the ground, it doesn't know it is an oak tree, but it goes straight up  into the sky. The roots grow down. That is an innate quality that has  been designed genetically in that.   Humans are the same way, so they have a desire to be free thinking  and free determining. The thing that is fortunate for us is that we  have a government that got formed.   And so the people in Tiananmen Square, June 4, 1989, wanted this very  same freedom, but, unfortunately, the Government of China thought  differently.   June 4 marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre,  when the Chinese Government forcibly suppressed the peaceful pro- democracy protest--and I want to repeat that, a peaceful pro-democracy  protest--and declared martial law, killing hundreds, maybe thousands,  of innocent Chinese citizens. Troops with assault rifles and tanks  fired upon the protests, creating utter and despicable chaos.   Thirty years later, the Chinese Communist Party continues to censor  all information relating to this attempt, attempting to completely  erase it from history. So, for the new generations of Chinese, they  don't know if this happened or not because they can't look outside of  China.   The Chinese Communist Party has such control over the people of China  that it is forbidden to look at pictures. They are taken off of the  internet. They are not in the history books. They are not in the school  books that talk about Tiananmen Square, that talk about the pro- democracy movement that people yearn and desire for.   The human rights abuses under the Chinese Communist Party have  continued. But if we look back at China--and I want to direct this  conversation, not to the Chinese people, because they are like people  everywhere else in the world.   I chaired the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee in the last Congress. I am  the ranking member this Congress. I have had the opportunity to travel  around the world, and when I talk to people around the world, we will  ask them the same question: Do people in your country have the desire  to be free and self-determining?   Every one of them says that, and they say: I want a better future for  our children than I had.   And, again, that is why I feel this is an innate thing that we are  born with, and I know that.   So, as we travel around, we see this as not true in China. And so the  Chinese people are great; it is the Chinese Communist Party under the  control of Xi Jinping.   China has an amazing history that spans thousands of years. Its  culture has stayed, for the most part, intact since the 19th century.   There have been multiple rulers and emperors recorded in the history  books. In fact, at one point, China and most of Eurasia were under the  control of Ghengis Khan and the Mongolian Empire. This empire was  larger than the Roman Empire.   Khan allowed the people in his empire to be free and prosper through  their work and developed a market economy based on production and  trade. He provided protection from invasion, and they provided goods,  services, and loyalty to the Khan empire.   This is the way history has been repeated over and over again. Since  then, that is when China became the Silk Road. They were a major  economic powerhouse around the world. They are great traders in spice  and garments and linens and silks around the world.   But China went from a major economic power in the 18th century to a  nation addicted to opium. During the 19th century, China's ruling class  allowed their country to be taken over by the European colonial and  Japanese imperial powers.   During this time, over 90 percent of the male population became  addicted to opium. The culture, heritage, and social fabric of China  decayed, and China truly did enter into a peasant state, isolated from  the world, for the most part, during the next 70 years. They were a  lost country. This has become known as the century of shame.   The PLA, the People's Liberation Army, emerged in 1927. In fact, they  will have a 100-year anniversary in 2027.    Mao Zedong was a favored member of the PLA, and he later became the  Chairman of the Communist Party of China. He promised communism would  be the savior of China.   Mao was an ardent student of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, the  father of communism, where an individual's role in society was to serve  the party for the greater good of the whole. His policies were one  where the Communist Party was the supreme law of the land.   Mao, being a firm believer in this philosophy, implemented top-down  policies in all sectors of China's economy and culture, destroying the  greatness that China once had. His farming policies led to a famine and  starvation. Seventy to eighty million people died under Mao's policy  due to a combination of starvation and a purge of those who dared to  show political dissent towards the communist ruling party.   Mao set a 100-year plan for China to regain its lost stature. Maoism  became a belief and a philosophy for many. It was even idolized in some  think tanks, with prominent individuals claiming this was a better way  to govern a country, a country where the individual needs are secondary  to the needs of the Communist Party, where individuals can't challenge  the government, the party, or its ideology.   And, again, I am so thankful that we are born in our country, as  messy as democracy is. As Ben Franklin forewarned us back when they  came out of the Constitutional Convention in Pennsylvania, when asked  by a lady, ``What form of government did you give us, sir?'' he said,  ``A republic, ma'am, if you can keep it.''   We know democracies like we have in a constitutional republic are  messy, but, by God, they are worth it because they empower the people.                                time  1930    It seems bizarre to me that some would idolize Maoism, knowing that  history records that 70-plus million people have been killed through  the failed policies of communism, again, from the starvation, but also  from the brutal torture and the murder of those who challenge the  Communist Party and its ideology. That is what I would like to focus on  tonight, the human rights abuses of the Chinese Party and the PLA.   Since its founding almost 100 years ago, it has a record of human  rights abuses that has led to the death of tens of millions of people,  if not over 100 million people.   It does this through the elimination of anyone that challenges the  doctrine of the Communist Party. I think that can be seen right here.  This shows a peaceful prodemocracy protest that occurred June 4, 1989,  in Tiananmen Square in China. This is how it started.   This shows the statue of democracy that these people wanted because  they saw what free people could do in a free society that had a  government that they could address their grievances to, to change  government to fulfill the needs of society, not government changing  people to fulfill the needs of government.   This is how it started, and I think we have all seen this. Any of us  of a little age or long in the tooth, this is what we remember, as the  videos showed on  [[Page H4300]]  our television sets, the horror of people brave enough to stand in the  way of the tanks.   The Chinese Communist Party and its ruler, Deng Xiaoping, ordered the  tanks to disperse the protesters. So they literally killed people.  There are videos of people being run over by tanks, people are running  away. Tanks are chasing them down and running them over from the back.  And they killed them over and over again.   This is something that China had done then, and they are doing it  today. We made a big blunder in our foreign affairs policies back in  the 1970s under President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger by inviting  China into the modern world. It wasn't the wrong thing to invite them  into the modern world, but with no safeguards or direction, their goal  was that they felt that if China became successful and developed a  strong economic base, they, too, would become free thinking and would  incorporate into the modern world.   But, unfortunately, as history has recorded, China became more  totalitarian, more authoritarian, and the Communist Party grew in  strength. China, over the last 30 years, we have seen go from a  backward state to a very prosperous state, to where 12 percent of the  billionaires are now residents of China or of Chinese origin. They  should be commended for that type of success, but not at the cost of  what the Chinese Communist Party has done to their citizens.   Under the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the CCP in  1921, the Communist Party repeatedly disregarded the human rights of  the Chinese people. Abuses include the practice of incommunicado  detention, torture of persons in custody, censorship of the internet  today, and restrictions on the freedoms of religion, association, and  assembly.   Xi Jinping, the ruler for life in China now, has further implemented  a clampdown on political dissent, civil society, human rights  activists, and lawyers.   The Great Leap Forward, which was an economic and social campaign led  by the CCP under Mao Zedong from 1949 to 1976, when he died, through  the idea of collectivism--again, right out of Karl Marx and Friedrich  Engels' handbook on communism--the CCP took control of citizens'  workplaces, took control of their lands and resources, and used  coercion, violence, and murder to control their famished citizens.   This failed initiative led to the deaths of over 75 million people,  making it the largest episode of mass murder ever on the planet. Not  only were 2 million to 3 million people starved to death, people were  needlessly tortured and killed, and I suspect that number is small.   The Cultural Revolution also launched by Mao from 1966 to 1976 called  on the Chinese youth to purge impure elements of Chinese society. That  means anybody that dare challenge the Communist Party's ideology would  be purged and they had their own citizens do that to their own  citizens.   This escalated when students formed paramilitary groups called the  Red Guard and attacked and harassed other Chinese citizens. Violence  erupted between factions of the Red Guard, creating wide chaos. The CCP  views separatist sentiments as a threat to internal order, and  ultimately the party's control.   Tibet, Taiwan, the Uighur population in Xinjiang and Hong Kong are  all threatened because the CCP and Xi Jinping are insecure and paranoid  in their country and in their leaders, because they fear free-thinking  people. The CCP in China is the highest entity in that country. It is  higher than any other entity in the universe, including God.   The Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, it has been reported up to 1  million people--I read a report today that said it could be 3 million  Uighurs, which are the Muslim sect of the Chinese population--have been  interned. We don't know because it is a closed society.   I have met with the Chinese foreign ministers. They told me this is  not something that is going on, that the Uighurs have the ability to  come and go at random. Although I talked to a Uighur today that was in  Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, and he said that is not the case.   You don't book a reservation to go into the internment camp or the  reeducate camp. You are ordered, or forced, or kidnapped and put into  that camp. You walk around with headphones on your head for 24 hours a  day, 7 days a week, and they are playing the national anthem. They are  playing the thoughts of Xi Jinping which are now the standard that all  students must listen to in China, and so they are reeducating these  people forcefully. This is something they do not have the free will to  leave.   In addition, we found a horrific element that came out, there are  concentration camps--they are not concentration camps, although they  probably are--but what we are seeing is there are crematoriums, not  just crematoriums for when people do pass away, but they are armed  crematoriums. There was an advertisement that people must be physically  fit and able to fend off people.    My question is, if you have got a peaceful situation where you are  reeducating people at their free will, why do you need armed  crematoriums?   Mr. Speaker, I think what we are seeing in China is a repeat of what  we saw in Nazi Germany. This is something I remember Dwight Eisenhower  said, as he went over there to Auschwitz and to the other camps:  ``Never again.''   It saddens me that I have been in Congress for 7 years and I watched  the genocide in Africa, in the different countries, in Darfur, and  Somalia. We said, never again. Yet it happens. In Syria, over 500,000  people have been murdered and slaughtered in that civil war under the  hideous rule of Bashar al-Assad, and we say, never again. Yet we allow  it to happen.   Mr. Speaker, it is happening right now. And China is our number one  and two trading partner in the world, as it is with many of the  countries around the world. I think that we should rethink our foreign  policy of who we trade with.   There was a hearing today and we had several people who were members  of the peaceful protest in Tiananmen Square. One of the protesters,  Dong Shengkun, was arrested as a political dissident and he was given a  death sentence that got commuted to a life sentence that he got off  after 17 years.   His comment was in a periodical yesterday and he said that he would  prefer to have his son think he is just a regular criminal, at least in  the current political climate in China, than be potentially put in  danger by learning of his father's political past.   His child should be proud of him because that father's political past  was fighting for the very things our Founding Fathers fought for:  freedom and liberty. He stated: ``It is for his safety,'' his son, ``I  worry that I might influence his thoughts if I started chatting to him  about those things.''   Other former political prisoners have expressed concerns about  talking to their children about the massacre for fear of putting them  at risk. Fellow Tiananmen survivor, Fang Zheng, said that he doesn't  blame Dong and the other activists who wanted to shield their children  from politics. Fang, who lost both of his legs in the massacre, blames  the ruling Communist Party. That is the fear and horror that the regime  has brought to everybody.   Three decades after the Chinese Government declared martial law--and  I find this interesting, because this relates to the abuses that we are  seeing and why China can do this--three decades after the Chinese  Government declared martial law and unleashed the military on unarmed  students and worker protesters, the bloodshed has been largely erased  from the nation's collective memory.   Think about that. The Chinese Communist Party has so much power that  they control what is in the textbooks, and we have seen this  revisionist history over and over again in different countries around  the world.   They tried to do it here in the United States with, I believe it was  the Harvard University Press, to get them to rewrite history books so  it wasn't a negative slant against China.   I know they have done this in Australia and other countries around  the world, and they have done this through force, coercion, and  intimidation to get other countries to bow down to the ideology and the  teachings of Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party.   So after three decades, they have erased the nation's collective  memory.  [[Page H4301]]  The question today was asked: What percentage of the Chinese people  even know of Tiananmen Square? The answer was shocking because these  people who were there in our hearing today were the actual freedom  fighters for democracy in China at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.   Their answer was: Probably not 20 percent of the people in China are  even aware of what happened in Tiananmen Square. The Communist Party- led effort has created a generation who are mostly unaware of the  Tiananmen massacre. Dong said, school textbooks don't mention it, and  students won't find photos or stories of June 4 on China's heavily  censored internet.   The story can go on, but I hope it doesn't for the sake of humanity.  If we look at the Uighurs, the Muslim population in the western  province of the Xinjiang region, like I said, up to 1 million, maybe 3  million have been interned. There is no way to know. We asked the  foreign minister when he was in my office, and he assured us this  wasn't happening. These were voluntary camps. And I said: If you feel  that certain, Mr. Foreign Minister, invite the Western free press in  there, and let them report on that.   He said: No, we are not going to do that. So in the reeducation labor  camps, there is near totalitarian levels of surveillance and security  measures. Xinjiang is now a police state where cultural genocide is  occurring.   And, again, I go back to Dwight Eisenhower: ``Never again.''                                time  1945    CCP views Islam as a threat to the atheist state.   Again, keep in mind that the Chinese Communist Party has stated that  the role of the Chinese citizen is to serve the Chinese Communist Party  and that the Chinese Communist Party is the ultimate power in the  universe; there is nothing higher.   If we look at Tibet, Tibet has been a sovereign nation over the  millennia. It is where the Dalai Lama comes from and has come from  throughout history.   In 1959, there was an armed conflict between the Tibetan people and  the PLA. Retaliation for such an uprising involved the killing of  87,000 Tibetans.   During occupation of Tibet there were tortures, killings,  bombardments of monasteries, and the extermination of a whole nomad  camp. What they have done is they have gone through and erased the  monasteries and erased much of the people. They moved in the ethnic  Chinese Hun population to the point where they have diluted the Tibetan  population, and all they have to do is wait out time because the youth  won't know that.   In Tibetan culture, the Dalai Lama is not chosen by the people. He is  chosen through their process, and it is through the birth of the  Panchen child. The Panchen child is the next Dalai Lama in their  culture.   When the Panchen child was discovered, China kidnapped him, and they  said: This is not the Panchen child. We have the real Panchen child.   So they brought him forth.   I found this to be very hideous and just offensive. Being a Christian  nation as we are, that would be as if King Herod went to the manger and  took Jesus Christ, saying that that is not the Lord and Savior and that  you have got it wrong.   Then they kidnapped him and they put somebody they want in there.  That is how warped the Chinese Communist Party's thinking is.   In 2008, violent protests and riots erupted through Tibet as they  desired more independence from China. CCP views this as a threat to  their control. That is why I said that the Chinese Communist Party and  Xi Jinping are insecure.   We can talk about Tibet; we can talk about the Uighurs; we can talk  about Hong Kong; and we have to talk about Taiwan, because human rights  abuses are going on through all of these countries through coercion,  intimidation, and threats.   Hong Kong was a nation that the British powers captured in the 1800s  during the Opium Wars, during the period of colonization. When that  happened, Hong Kong became a province of Great Britain.   What happened in 1997 is there was an agreement between Great Britain  and China that they would give the Hong Kong territory back to China,  but there was an agreement that, for 50 years, there would be  autonomous rule in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong could continue as it  was.   Well, we are 22 years into that, and already we have seen the  usurpation of power and the influence of China coming in. In fact,  China, right now, is trying hard to get extradition laws so that they  can take executives from any company. If they feel they have treated  the Chinese Communist Party wrong, they can extradite them to China,  and my bet is we will never hear from these people again, Mr. Speaker.   We have seen this happen with booksellers, and we have seen this  happen with successful businesspeople who have started insurance  companies in China, who came to America. All of a sudden, they have  mysteriously disappeared, and they have never shown up.   So Xi Jinping stated that, as far as he is concerned, the agreement  between Great Britain and China for the 50-year autonomous rule is no  longer valid and that it needs to be done away with.   My question is: When we talk about Taiwan--and I think it was a  blunder of our foreign policy when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger  said that they would agree to a one-country, two-party system, which  stripped Taiwan of its autonomy--if Xi Jinping sees no need to follow  course with the 50-year agreement with Hong Kong, does that give us  cause to forget the agreement that we had with President Nixon and with  the Chinese rulers back in the seventies? I say, yes, and I think it is  time that we honor and respect Taiwan for the country it is.   Today, in China, we have mass surveillance of its citizens. So what  we see are human rights evaporating more so today than ever before.   China has become a powerhouse economically. They are starting to  become a powerhouse militarily. They have learned to leverage certain  things that hold other nations, including the United States, in debt to  them.   If we just look at one example of that, that would be the rare earth  metals. Our F-35 fighter jets, 10 percent of the weight of those are  rare earth metals; 90 percent comes directly from China, and the other  10 percent comes from countries that get it from China.   China is on a march to take over the world. Mr. Speaker, you can  listen to Xi Jinping in the 17th Communist Party Congress in 2017. He  said that the year of China has arrived. No longer will they be made to  swallow their interests around the world. It is time for China to take  the world's center stage.   Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that says, if you want to see  one's past, look at their present situation; if you want to see one's  future, look at their present activities, look at their present  investments, look at their present actions.   I think the actions speak loud and clear, because the human rights  abuses that started in the 1920s when 70-plus million people lost their  lives, this is something that has happened over and over again.   If we look back then and we look at modern-day China, it is estimated  and predicted that China is about to complete the installation of 2.7  billion CCTV cameras around their country. What they are using this for  is facial recognition tied up with artificial intelligence. They have  over 25 million people today whom they monitor 24/7, around the clock,  365 days a year, and they are giving people what we call good citizen  scores.   If your good citizen score isn't high enough, Mr. Speaker, then you  don't travel on airplanes and you don't travel on buses. You don't  travel anywhere. You have no freedoms because you have become a threat  to the Chinese Communist Party. That is today.    Xi Jinping and his Communist Party has offered this to the Russian  dictator, Putin, who wants this technology. He has offered this to the  ayatollahs of Iran. He has offered this to any despotic government and  country that wants to control their citizens, that is afraid of freedom  of expression and freedom of thought.   He has also offered this to Maduro in Venezuela. This is something  that they are going to use to control people to suppress freedom,  liberty, and free thought.   Again, I talk about how blessed we are in this country because we  have a country that empowers the individual.  [[Page H4302]]  I know as history looks back at this--and there may be some rocky roads  ahead, but I know the side that empowers their people and that believes  in a Creator will come out on top of this because what I know is you  can't suppress the innate qualities and genetics of a plant, of a breed  of cattle, or of any animal, and you can't suppress human freedom,  thoughts, and the innate quality to be free.   So I feel confident that over time the Chinese suppression, the  Chinese Communist Party will collapse, and this picture where you see  the people getting ready to be run over by the tank will be replaced by  this picture and this statue being rebuilt, the statue of the Goddess  of Democracy and Freedom in Tiananmen Square. The future will show this  as what China is doing in the future of people protesting peacefully  for the freedoms that they have.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to end with, on this day, being the 30th  anniversary of a horrendous chapter of suppression and murder in human  history, that if it is not for us speaking about this, it won't be  talked about around the world. China will do everything they can to  erase this kind of history from the history books, and it would be a  shame for this to go away.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
