 Madam President, today I rise to celebrate International  Roma Day, which occurred yesterday, April 8, 2019. Last week, Senator  Wicker, the Helsinki Commission's Senate cochairman, and I introduced a  resolution that celebrates Romani American heritage.   As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly  Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism & Intolerance, I have  long worked to improve the situation of Roma throughout the OSCE  region.   The resolution we introduced on April 4 does four things.   First, it recognizes and celebrates Romani American heritage. Roma  have come to the United States with every wave of European migration  since the colonial period. In the United States,there may be as many as  1 million Americans with some Romani ancestry, whether distant or more  recent. Romani people have made distinct and important contributions in  many fields, including agriculture, art, crafts, literature, medicine,  military service, music, sports, and science.   Second, it supports International Roma Day and the Department of  State's robust engagement in activities to honor that occasion. On  April 8, 1971, the First World Romani Congress met in London, bringing  together Roma from across Europe and the United States with the goal of  promoting transnational cooperation among Roma, combating social  marginalization, and building a positive future for Roma everywhere.  April 8 is now celebrated as International Roma Day around the world.  U.S. Ambassadors and our Embassies across Europe are frequently asked  to participate in April 8 celebrations across the region. I commend the  important work they are doing as they demonstrate U.S. commitment to  inclusive societies not only on April 8 but throughout the entire year.   Third, this resolution commemorates the 75th anniversary of the  destruction of the so-called Gypsy Family Camp at Auschwitz. Experts  estimate that 200,000 to 500,000 Romani people were killed in death  camps and elsewhere throughout Europe. On August 2 to 3, 1944, Nazis  murdered between 4,200 and 4,300 Romani men, women, and children in gas  chambers when the Nazis decided to liquidate this camp. A number of  governments have taken important steps in recent years to commemorate  the genocide of Roma, to remember the victims, and educate future  generations. Germany took an important step when it opened a memorial  in Berlin for Sinti and Roma victims of national socialism. I also  commend the Czech Government for its decision to remove the pig farm at  the site of the Lety concentration camp and address remaining issues  regarding the proper memorialization of that sensitive site.   Finally, this resolution commends the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum  for its critically important role in promoting remembrance of the  Holocaust and educating audiences about the genocide of Roma. The U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Museum is the preeminent Federal institution  dedicated to serving as a living memorial to the Holocaust. I am  honored to serve as a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum  Council and I welcome the initiatives of the museum to ensure that  Romani victims are remembered and support related scholarship.   I am pleased that Senator Wicker has joined me in introducing this  resolution and urge other colleagues to join us in celebrating Romani- American heritage.
