 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in favor of the legislation. I want to thank the honorable  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for his leadership on this and  also salute Representatives Kustoff and Kilmer for their introduction  of this legislation.   It is important legislation, Mr. Speaker, because it extends  protections under current Federal law for religious real property. We  know there is no religious free exercise for our people if they are too  afraid to go to church or to synagogue or to the mosque.   Currently, section 247 of the Federal criminal code prohibits both  the damaging of religious property because of the property's religious  character and the intentional obstruction--by force or threats of  force--of anyone's exercise of their religious beliefs.   H.R. 1730 clarifies that not just force but threats of force against  religious property are included in this prohibition.                                time  1730    In addition, the bill provides that the damaging or obstructing of  such property that results in damages exceeding $5,000 constitutes a  felony punishable by up to 3 years in prison.   Finally, H.R. 1730 clarifies that real property covered by the  statute includes property leased by a nonprofit, religiously affiliated  organization.   The importance of the bill, of course, is underscored by the recent  upsurge, as Mr. Goodlatte said, in bomb threats, hate crimes, and  vandalism committed against churches, synagogues, mosques, and other  communities of faith, a wave of hate that is now etched in the public's  mind by the shocking events in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August,  which began at a local synagogue.   The Hate Crimes Statistics for 2016 released by the FBI indicate that  anti-Semitic hate crimes increased 20 percent from the prior year.  There has been an alarming surge committed not just against synagogues,  but against churches and mosques in 2017.   We know that violent attacks against religious facilities have always  accompanied waves of racial terror in our history. In the 1960s,  African-American churches in many parts of the country were vandalized,  fire bombed, and burned during the struggle for civil rights in the  South. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of arsons committed against  African-American churches. In response, Congress passed the Church  Arson Prevention Act in 1996 to make it clear that such behavior was  also on the wrong side of the law.   Yet, in 2017, here we are again, facing another rise in hate crimes.  We must do more to prevent and fight these threats to our most basic  First Amendment freedoms that our people have, including the right of  our citizens to practice their religion of choice.   While some may disagree with the religious practice of others, what  they may not do is use physical obstruction, force, or threats of force  to deny other people the right to worship as they choose. No American  should ever have to choose between their faith and their personal  security and the safety of their family. Therefore, I strongly support  H.R. 1730, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Jewish Committee and a letter from the Anti-Defamation League.                                    AJC, Global Jewish Advocacy,                                   Washington, DC, November 1, 2017.      Hon. Robert Goodlatte,      Chairman.      Hon. John Conyers,      Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: I write       on behalf of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the global       Jewish advocacy organization, in strong support of H.R. 1730,       the Combating Anti-Semitism Act of 2017 (which we understand       will be renamed the Protecting Religiously Affiliated       Institutions Act of 2017).        This critically needed bipartisan legislation, introduced       by Rep. David Kustoff with Rep. Derek Kilmer as chief       cosponsor, addresses long-standing gaps in Federal hate       crimes law. H.R. 1730 amends the Church Arson Prevention Act       of 1996 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 241) (CAPA), which covers attacks on       religious real property, to bring all religiously affiliated       institutions--such as community centers--under the scope of       its protections. The bill also amends CAPA so as to encompass       threats against, as well as acts that result in damage or       destruction to, religious real property. Further, H.R. 1730       enhances the penalty for intentional damage to religious real       property, which is at the moment only at a misdemeanor level       unless there is bodily injury to a person.        In addition to closing these gaps in the law, enactment of       H.R. 1730 will send a signal of zero tolerance for hate       crimes against people of faith. Hate crimes against religious       institutions are on the rise in our country. Since January       2017, at least five mosques have suffered arson attacks,       while dozens of Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and other       religious institutions have been vandalized. These attacks       are intolerable. They infringe on the Constitution's       protection of the free exercise of religion. Moreover, crimes       against religious institutions are intended to create an       atmosphere of fear that deters community members from       attending worship services and social involvement. They pose       a danger to the religious freedom and security of all       Americans. In light of the violent anti-Semitic and racist       white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia,       this legislation is more important than ever. We as a nation       must take action in response.        For these reasons, AJC strongly urges your support for, and       speedy action on, the Combating Anti-Semitism Act.            Respectfully,      Richard Foltin.                                   ____           ADL, Anti-Defamation League,                                       New York, NY, April 6, 2017.      Hon. David Kustoff,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Kustoff: On behalf of the Anti-      Defamation League, I am writing to commend you for your       leadership in introducing the Combating Anti-Semitism Act of       2017 to help ensure that our government is taking every       possible step to protect members of America's religious       communities.        Rising anti-Semitic incidents and the recent spate of bomb       threats and vandalism against Jewish community institutions       and cemeteries have sent a chilling message to the Jewish       community.        When Members of Congress stand up to take action,       communities targeted by hate motivated incidents and threats       feel less vulnerable and isolated. This expression of       solidarity and act of reassurance, in turn, shines a       spotlight on anti-Semitism and bigotry and helps to promote a       more effective response.        We look forward to the swift passage of this bill to       reassure faith communities that the government is using all       possible tools to deter future threats and to prosecute the       perpetrators.        Anti-Semitism and bigotry are affecting countries all over       the world, and the U.S. is no exception. But the rigor of       America's response, the solidarity we demonstrate for each       other across diverse communities, and the leadership of       lawmakers like you is a model for the world.            Sincerely,                                               Jonathan Greenblatt,                                                               CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer), the distinguished coauthor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Washington an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Washington an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), my colleague on the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my distinguished colleague.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1730, the Protecting Religiously  Affiliated Institutions Act of 2017. I thank Congressman Kilmer for his  vision and leadership on this critical issue.   This legislation would strengthen current Federal law to prohibit  threats against religious property, increase the penalty for damaging  religious property, and expand protected religious property to include  not just houses of worship, but also religiously affiliated nonprofits,  like Jewish community centers.   Over the past few years, there has been a frightening rise in  incidents of racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia in the  U.S. and around the world. All too often, the perpetrators of hate  target houses of worship and other religious centers.   From the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin in 2012, to Charleston's  Emanuel AME Church shooting in 2015, to the mosque attack in London  this summer, and the firebombing of a synagogue in Sweden just this  past weekend, these violent, cowardly bigots go after what is most  sacred to the communities they so odiously abhor.   While the hateful incidents that result in loss of life are  undoubtedly the most tragic, any threat or attack against religious  property can shake communities to their core.   The Jewish community of south Florida, sadly, knows this firsthand.  [[Page H9777]]  Last year, a man planned to bomb a synagogue in Aventura in my  congressional district during Passover. He was caught, thankfully, but  incidents like this proliferating around the country are instilling  fear, causing unease, and requiring additional security measures to be  deployed. Sadly, in south Florida, this was not an isolated incident.   Mr. Speaker, I will say that, although not specifically an attack  against a Jewish institution, I remember my children, then in  preschool, attended preschool at our local JCC and, after the 9/11  attack, my husband racing to their school to take them out of school  that day because of the panic that was instilled that automatically  occurs in every Jewish family's life with children in a Jewish  institution when there is a terrorist attack. We are constantly on edge  as to whether or not our community is next.   It is deeply disturbing that the people in my community who attend  synagogues and visit our Jewish community centers do so knowing these  domestic terrorists intentionally want us to feel uneasy about it.  Their mission is to instill fear in the hearts of Jews, Muslims, and  other religious minorities so that we will not feel at home in America.    And they are not relenting. The most recent annual report on hate  crimes by the FBI showed that there was nearly a 5 percent increase in  incidents last year. It is the first time in 10 years that America has  experienced consecutive annual increases in reported hate crimes.   More than half of the religiously based hate crimes were anti-Jewish,  and a quarter of them were anti-Muslim. We cannot let bigoted threats  and vandalism become the new normal.   We must pass this legislation to make it 100 percent clear that, in  the view of Congress, when it comes to religious bigotry, there are not  good people on both sides.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the  gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We must pass this legislation to make anti- Semitic and Islamophobic cowards think twice before they spread fear,  while hiding behind a computer or a phone.   We must pass this legislation to ensure that America is always a  refuge from religious persecution. I deeply wish this legislation were  not needed, Mr. Speaker, but, sadly, it is. I urge my colleagues to  support this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment protects every citizen's right to  free exercise of religion, and we, in Congress, must be zealous and  vigilant partners with the Constitution in that enterprise.   From Charleston, South Carolina, to Charlottesville, Virginia; from  suburban Maryland, where racial bias incidents are up 80 percent in my  congressional district in 2017, to California, Oregon, and all over the  country, America has seen a surge in threats and violence against  individuals and religious real property in our country, all in an  effort to deter our citizens from practicing their faith, or simply to  assault or kill them for doing so.   There has also been a rise in threats made by telephone, in person,  by email, or by phone all over the country, including to churches,  synagogues, and mosques. In the first 7 months of this year, there were  63 reported incidents against mosques across 26 States, spanning from  Florida to Hawaii. Clearly, Congress must act. We have excellent  legislation in H.R. 1730 to expand our law to include threats of force,  as well as to toughen up the penalties for this kind of conduct.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
