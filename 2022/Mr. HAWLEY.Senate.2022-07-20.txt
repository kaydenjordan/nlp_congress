 Mr. President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       ACTS-SCK-DO      SUBJECT: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.           Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International           Airport on 26 August 2021.        (3) Gate Operations.        (a) Occupation of Abbey Gate. At approximately 0800 on 19       August, Golf Company, reinforced by Fox Company platoons,       arrived at Abbey Gate and found U.K. and other foreign forces       standing in the inner corridor (exhibits 77, 89). Golf       Company attempted to open the gate to process evacuees and       enable U.K. Forces to move to the Barron Hotel (exhibits 77,       89). This attempt failed because the large and desperate       crowd in the outer corridor nearly breached the gate and       forced Golf Company to stop in less than an hour (exhibits       77, 89). On 20 August during the period of darkness, Golf       Company, reinforced by Fox Company platoons, moved the crowd       approximately 150 meters south passed the entrance of the       Barron Hotel (exhibits 77, 83, 89). 24th MEU engineers       emplaced several shipping containers to form an obstacle,       known as the Chevron, in the road (exhibits 77, 83, 86, 87,       89). The Taliban were employed to man the outside of the       obstacle and conducted initial screening and crowd control       (exhibits 77, 83, 89). Later on 20 August, crowds in the       canal breached the southern end of the fence separating the       canal from the outer corridor (exhibits 83, 172). Marines       identified the need to clear the nearside of the canal and       keep crowds on the opposite side (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 83).        (b) Steady State Gate Operations.        (i) After the establishment of the Chevron and clearing the       nearside of the canal, 2/1 established a steady state       operation of screening evacuees and movement to the PAX       Terminal (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 89). Steady state was between       21-25 August. Marines on the canal would search for persons       with documents (passports, immigration forms) meeting the       current eligibility requirements for evacuation (exhibits 77,       83). Marines at the Chevron would do a similar screening       (exhibits 78, 79). After pulling them into the outer corridor       perimeter, they would conduct a cursory search of the       potential evacuees, and place them into the holding area       (exhibits 77, 83). 2/1 Marines established the holding area       in the outer corridor traffic lane, against the HKIA exterior       wall (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 83). When DoS Consular       officers were available, Marines would escort evacuees from       the holding area to the search area in the inner corridor       (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 83). After thoroughly searching the       potential evacuees, Marines would escort them to an area       further into the inner corridor to be screened by the       Consular officer (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 83). The Consular       officer would determine if the evacuees met the eligibility       criteria and approve moving the evacuees forward to the PAX       Terminal, or reject them, and the Marines would return them       to the canal (exhibits 56, 57, 60, 61, 77, 79, 80, 82). The       FST would assist in the searches and the escort of rejected       civilians back to the canal (exhibits 77, 83, 107). Corpsmen       were staged a CCP in the inner corridor and treated       casualties at the canal or Chevron (exhibits 77, 83, 98).        (ii) U.K. Forces conducted NEO from the Barron Hotel, but       also provided personnel for security on the canal and the       Chevron (exhibits 53, 56, 76, 77, 127). U.K. support to       steady state gate operations reduced as the NEO progressed       (exhibits 77). Other partner nations provided no assistance       with security at Abbey Gate (exhibits 56, 57, 60-63. 77, 79-      88). Partner forces utilized Abbey Gate to escort their own       consular officers or to pull evacuees from the crowd       (exhibits 77, 79-89). Partner nations often did not       coordinate their activities with Marines at Abbey Gate, and       did not adhere to the established processing or security       procedures (exhibits 79-89).        (c) Increased Crowds and Attack.        (i) On 25 August, Echo Company recognized an increase in       the size and desperation of the crowd (exhibits 53, 56). The       Echo Company [TEXT REDACTED] was concerned with the crowd       pushing past the jersey barriers at the base of the sniper       tower and not having space to operate (exhibit 56). In       response, Echo Company cleared the crowd on the nearside of       the canal (exhibits 56, 60-62). Echo Company positioned       Marines approximately 150 meters down the canal, running       northeast, to maintain control of the nearside (exhibit 56,       77). At approximately 1600, Golf Company relieved Echo       company and assumed the same positions along the canal, the       outer corridor, and inner corridor (exhibit 77) [TEXT       REDACTED] received several updates concerning SVIED attacks       at gates and determined the positions down the canal       presented unacceptable risk to force and isolated Marines       from support, to include CASEVAC (exhibit 77). Golf Company       withdrew the Marines back down the nearside of the canal and       crowds backfilled the space almost immediately (exhibits 77,       83). [TEXT REDACTED] stopped the flow of evacuees and took       the defensive posture previously mentioned (exhibits 77, 83).        (ii) The next day, crowds were even larger and more unruly       (exhibits 53, 56, 77, 83). Golf Company was forced to push       additional Marines to the canal to keep them from crossing       the jersey barriers at the base of the sniper tower (exhibits       53, 76, 77). Echo Company assumed inner gate responsibilities       so Golf Company could maintain the positions on the canal       (exhibits 56, 57). The crowds grew so desperate, they began       to crush people against the sniper tower walls and jersey       barriers (exhibits 53, 75, 77, 105). Golf Company Marines       consolidated at the base of the tower in response (exhibits       53, 76, 77, 83, Brit Video). At 1736, the single explosion       occurred, and detonated directly across from the platoon       gathered at the base of the tower (exhibits 5, 53, 76, 77,       83, 89). Shortly after, Abbey Gate closed, the 1/82nd IBCT       took over security of the Gate, U.K. Forces passed through       for the final time from the Barron Hotel, and gate operations       ended (exhibits 53, 56, 77, 124, 127).        (4) Preventability of the Abbey Gate Attack. The attack was       not preventable at the tactical level without degrading the       mission to maximize the number of evacuees. Given the       priority of effort, time, resources, partner nation       requirements, and terrain restraints, the only mitigation       possible would have jeopardized the flow of evacuees and       potentially risk mission failure.        (a) The priority for the Marines at Abbey Gate was       maximizing the flow of evacuees through the gate to the ECC       (exhibits 11, 15, 18, 56, 77, 88). Any time spent emplacing       obstacles was time not spent searching and screening civilian       evacuees. Additionally, many force protection measures that       could have been implemented, such as additional T-Walls or       HESCO barriers, would have inherently reduced the flow of       evacuees. Closing the gate was also not an option because of       U.K. efforts to conclude evacuation operations at the nearby       Barron Hotel (exhibits 18, 54, 121, 127). Closing the gates       would have isolated U.K. Forces and jeopardized the JTE force       flow and timeline, potentially initiating renewed armed       conflict with the Taliban (exhibits 15, 18, 21, 23, 125).        (b) Leaders at Abbey Gate on 26 August made frequent       decisions (multiple times daily) to increase the force       protection posture. Electronic countermeasures were already       emplaced to prevent enemy coordination and radio controlled       device use (exhibit 65). Several times during the 18 hours       prior to the attack, the company commander stopped the flow       at the gate and had Marines take covered positions (exhibits       77, 83, 84). Medics were consolidated in the inner corridor       to ensure their safety and quick reaction to any attack, and       additional medical assets were surged forward (exhibits 66,       77, 98). An Afghan interpreter was recruited to pacify the       crowd using PSYOP capabilities (exhibit 107). ISR was       increased and the Taliban were tasked to screen for the       specific threat (exhibits 18, 125). Leaders struck the       balance of protecting the force and maximizing the flow of       evacuees as best as possible under the circumstances.                                 d. Readiness         (1) Key Findings.        (a) Most units that deployed to HKIA in support of the       Afghanistan NEO, with the exception of USFOR-A FWD and JTF-      CR, had adequate manning levels for the assigned mission.       USFOR-A FWD and JTF-CR staffs were task-saturated due to the       nature of the NEO. The effects were further exacerbated by       the fact that many of their personnel were forced to expend       significant energy trying to find specific evacuees, or       groups of evacuees, at the gates of HKIA, on behalf of  [[Page S3538]]       various U.S. government officials, senior military officers,       or special interest groups.        (b) All units deployed to HKIA in support of the       Afghanistan NEO had trained on their respective mission       essential tasks (METs) prior to deployment. In some cases,       this included NEG-specific training, while in others it did       not. Leaders at all levels stated no training could       adequately prepare them for what they experienced at HKIA.        (2) USFOR-A FWD.        (a) Manning. USFOR-A FWD, led by RADM Pete Vasely, USN,       Commander, USFOR-A FWD, and Brigadier Thomas Day, United       Kingdom, Deputy Commander, USFOR-A FWD, was originally task       organized and manned as a SOJTF in anticipation of taking       over the NSOCC-A mission. In June 2021, they transitioned       Into Diplomatic Assurance Platform-Afghanistan (DAP-A), with       a focus on the medical, flight, and security requirements of       USEK (exhibit 20). In July 2021, RADM Vasely took command       from General Miller, and assumed the functions of Resolute       Support Headquarters (RSHQ) and USFOR-A, albeit with a       drastically reduced footprint due to a reduced boots on the       ground (BOG) force cap of 650 being implemented. In addition       to USFOR-A FWD's organic staff, they had TACON of one company       from 2nd IBCT, 10th Mountain Division, and two companies from       3rd IBCT, 10th Mountain Division (exhibits 20, 21).        (b) Training. USFOR-A FWD trained to deploy as a SOJTF, and       did not train to assume the role of RSHQ and USFOR-A, nor did       they train to conduct a NEO. While deployed, USFOR-A FWD       participated in the 28 June Operational Planning Team (OPT)       at USEK, focused on pre-NEO planning. USFOR-A FWD then       participated in the CENTCOM-led NEO tabletop exercise (TTX)       on 29 June, and a National Security Council (NSC)-led NEO TTX       on 6 August (exhibits 20, 21).        (3) 82nd Airborne Division.        (a) Manning. 82nd Airborne Division HQ, led by MG       Christopher Donahue, initially deployed with a small team of       six staff members, and arrived at HKIA on 18 August. The       remainder of the Division HQ staff arrived on 20 August,       bringing the 82nd's total manpower to 106 personnel (exhibits       125, 152). The 1st IBCT, 82nd Airborne Division (1/82 IBCT),       led by [TEXT REDACTED] deployed as part of the IRF, began to       arrive at HKIA on 15 August, and had roughly 1000 soldiers on       hand by 16 August. The number of personnel TACON to 1/82 IBCT       would swell to 2360 throughout the NEO (exhibits 130, 152).       The 1/82 IBCT HQ was comprised of 65 personnel, and it had       TACON of elements from 1/504 PIR (515 personnel), 2/504 PIR       (378 personnel), 2/501 PIR (504 personnel), 3/319 Artillery       (257 personnel), 307th Brigade Support Battalion (BSB) (56       personnel), 127th Airborne Engineer Battalion (24 personnel),       50th Expeditionary Signal Battalion (4 personnel), 16th       Military Police Brigade (150 personnel), and 1/194 Armor       Regiment (412 personnel) (exhibits 152, 153).        (b) Training. The 82nd Airborne Division HQ is trained to       deploy rapidly, as part of the IRF, and did so in support of       the NEO. While deployed to HKIA, the Division HQ participated       in MASCAL TTXs and Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) drills, as well       as Rules of Engagement (ROE) ROC drills with subordinate and       adjacent units (exhibit 125). 1/82 IBCT began its IRF       preparation training in March 2021 during its Joint Readiness       Training Center (JRTC) rotation. During the IBCT's time at       JRTC, units rehearsed civic engagement, conducted mock       interagency engagements, utilized role players, and trained       on entry control point operations. They did not train on       crowd control or NEO (exhibits 121, 123). The 1/82 IBCT       conducted Leader Professional Development sessions, where       they executed tactical decision games focused on NEO       (exhibits 121, 123). The brigade also trained to secure       airfields (exhibits 121, 123, 124). 2/501 PIR executed three       deployment readiness exercises (DREs), where they practiced       deploying out of Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina       (exhibit 123).        (4) JTF-CR.        (a) Manning. JTF-CR activated in anticipation of the       Afghanistan NEO, and initially had a joint manning document       (JMD) with 187 personnel associated with it. The JTF sent       three Liaison Officers (LNOs) forward to Afghanistan in May       2021 to coordinate with USFOR-A, USEK, and HKIA.       Additionally, the JTF sent a quartering party comprised of       three Marines to HKIA to begin preparations for receiving the       JTF in the event of a NEO (exhibit 15). On 19 July, JTF-CR       sent an EEAT comprised of 49 personnel to HKIA to assist DoS       with processing SIV applicants for travel to the U.S., and to       continue preparations for receiving the JTF at HKIA in the       event of a NEO (exhibits 15, 18). By the third week of July,       JTF-CR had 55 personnel on the ground at HKIA, and would send       an additional 28 personnel forward from Bahrain on 4 August       (exhibit 15). By 26 August, the JTF-CR staff was back down to       59 personnel, as some staff members had redeployed. JTF-CR       staff personnel were chosen for their versatility, so they       could multi-task, and the JTF opted to place a heavy emphasis       on planning ability, due to the anticipated requirement of       multiple, competing planning efforts throughout the execution       of the NEO (exhibit 15). When the NEO began, the JTF-CR was       forced to employ most of its staff as a security force, due       to multiple breaches in the HKIA perimeter and a limited       number of security forces being on deck at HKIA (exhibits 15,       18).        (b) Training. JTF-CR was certified as a JTF in 2019       (exhibits 15, 18), and again in 2020 (exhibit 18). In       addition to its certification via exercises and training, the       JTF had activated three times within the past year, to       include its planning response to the Beirut Port explosion in       August 2020, and its deployment in support of Operation       OCTAVE QUARTZ off the coast of Somalia in the spring of 2021       (exhibit 18). JTF-CR participated in NEO TTXs with CENTCOM at       the end of June, and the NSC on 6 August, but JTF-CR staff       members considered both to be ineffective, due to faulty       planning assumptions (exhibits 17, 18). During NEO execution       at HKIA, JTF-CR conducted MASCAL rehearsals with the Role II       clinic and USFOR-A FWD, which ultimately paid dividends on 26       August (exhibits 15, 16, 18). Multiple leaders from JTF-CR       stated that no training could have truly prepared service       members for the tasks they executed at HKIA throughout the       NEO (exhibits 17, 18).        (5) 24th MEU.        (a) Manning. The 24th MEU, led by [TEXT REDACTED] began       sending Marines into HKIA as part of its quartering party in       mid-July, and its CE began flowing into HKIA on 15 August. At       full strength, the MEU had 1249 Marines and Sailors at HKIA,       the bulk of which resided within BLT 1/8 and CLB-24 (exhibits       100, 101, 104). BLT 1/8 deployed 996 Marines and Sailors       across three rifle companies, a weapons company, an artillery       battery, a light armored reconnaissance company (-), an       engineer platoon, and a reconnaissance company (-) (exhibits       100, 104). CLB-24 deployed to HKIA with 225 Marines and       Sailors, task organized to support 24-hour ECC operations,       with roughly 70 Marines supporting three, 8-hour shifts each       day. CLB-24 personnel provided combat service support to       other units across HKIA, when they were not operating at the       ECC. CLB-24 also task organized a FST, comprised of 35 female       Marines and Sailors, with augmentation from BLT 1/8. CLB-24       had SPMAGTF's Combat Logistics Detachment-21 (CLD-21), and       Marine Wing Support Detachment-373 (MWSD-373) attached to       support ECC operations (exhibit 101).        (b) Training. 24th MEU completed the standard pre-      deployment training program focused on the MEU's 13 core       METs, including NEO (exhibits 100, 101, 104). The unit       conducted an additional, four-day NEO training package,       sponsored by Expeditionary Operations Training Group (EOTG)       in January 2021, which included DoS and civilian role player       participants (exhibits 100, 101, 104). In June 2021, while       ashore in Jordan, 24th MEU's CE and BLT conducted embassy       reinforcement and NEO training at the U.S. Embassy in Amman       (exhibits 100, 104). In July, the MEU offloaded in Kuwait to       posture for a potential NEO in Afghanistan, and throughout       the month of July and into August, the CE, BLT, and CLB       trained daily on various aspects of NEO, to include embassy       reinforcement, fixed site security, ECC operations, and NEO       Tracking System operations (exhibits 100, 101, 104).       Additionally, the FST Marines and Sailors trained on proper       search techniques to be employed at an ECC or ECP (exhibits       101, 107). MEU leadership agreed that the NEO training they       conducted did not adequately train their Marines and Sailors       for the conditions they faced at HKIA (exhibits 100, 101,       104).        (6) SPMAGTF.        (a) Manning. The SPMAGTF deployed a ``heavy package'' to       HKIA with components of the GCE, comprised of 2nd Battalion,       1st Marines (2/1), the Logistics Combat Element (LCE),       comprised of CLD-21, and Aviation Combat Element (ACE),       comprised of MWSD-373. Additionally, the SPMAGTF ``heavy       package'' included an STP and two EOD teams (exhibits 55, 65,       66). 2/1 deployed its entire battalion, with the exception of       one platoon from Golf Company, which provided escort security       aboard SPMAGTF flights to/from HKIA, two platoons from Fox       Company, which remained at the Baghdad Embassy Complex (BEC)       in Iraq to provide security, and their Combat Engineer       Platoon, which stayed at the BEC to support force protection       improvements there (exhibits 53, 54, 55, 56, 77, 78, 79, 81).       As a result of the Engineer Platoon not deploying to HKIA, 2/      1 was forced to depend on CLD-21's engineer section, whose       focus at HKIA was ECC operations, and the BLT's Engineer       Platoon, whose focus was supporting the BLT at North and East       Gates.        (b) Training.                            ____________________
