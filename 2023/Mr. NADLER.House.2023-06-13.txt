 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which  would ignore the considered judgment of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives and make stabilizing braces, a favorite tool  of mass shooters, widely available without a background check.   Today is one of those clarifying moments when the priorities of the  Republican majority are on clear display. Instead of taking up  legislation to reduce gun violence in America, we are advancing a bill  to ensure that more deadly weapons are in the hands of mass shooters in  this country. What a disgrace.   Mr. Speaker, gun violence continues to take the lives of more than  100 Americans every day. It changes how safe we feel in our schools and  in our houses of worship. It reduces vibrant cities to somber  headlines. It takes our loved ones, old and young, and leaves us with  another anniversary of lives cut short and a community forever changed.   Today, rather than stand up against gun violence, the majority plans  to pass this bill so that they can yet again stand with the gun  industry.   Rather than support the law enforcement officers who are on the front  lines of protecting our communities, the majority is attempting to  weaken law enforcement by rolling back a rule created by the ATF meant  to protect us from dangerous weapons. The ATF is the law enforcement  agency tasked with keeping guns out of the wrong hands and keeping our  gun laws in line with congressional intent through rulemaking.   In 1934, Congress passed the National Firearms Act, creating  additional requirements to own certain especially dangerous firearms,  like short-barreled rifles, which were widely used by violent  criminals. Congress included short-barreled rifles because they combine  the firepower of a rifle with the concealability of a smaller gun.   In recent years, the gun industry discovered a way to circumvent the  restrictions of the National Firearms Act by selling stabilizing  braces, an accessory that allows a pistol to be fired from the  shoulder, turning it into a deadly yet concealable short-barreled  rifle.   In 2020, under the Trump administration, the ATF concluded that  stabilizing braces were being widely used to create short-barreled  rifles and published guidance regarding their use. House Republicans  cried foul. Just 4 days after the guidance was published, 90 House  Republicans sent a letter to the ATF and the DOJ expressing their  opposition, and just a few days later, the guidance was withdrawn.    A few months later, under the Biden administration, the ATF revived  its efforts to regulate stabilizing braces and published the final rule  in January to ensure that our laws stay in line with the intent of  Congress, dating all the way back to 1934, when Congress decided that  deadly, concealable short-barreled rifles should be subject to  heightened regulation.   Republicans will stop at nothing to block the ATF from taking this  simple lifesaving measure, even though they know that blocking this  rule could have deadly consequences.   Mass shooters used guns with stabilizing braces to kill 9 people  outside a bar in Dayton in 2019; to kill 10 people, including a  responding officer, in a grocery store in Boulder in 2021; to kill 5  people in an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year; and just  this past March, to kill 6 people, including 3 children, in a school in  Nashville, the nineteenth school shooting this year.   The Nashville shooting occurred the day before the Judiciary  Committee initially planned to mark up this resolution, so the  majority, apparently sensitive to the optics, if not the substance, of  marking up this resolution, postponed the markup.   Three weeks later, they decided that enough time had passed since  three more families woke up without the child they had taken to school,  and they were ready to advance a bill to enable more mass shooters to  inflict death and destruction in our communities. I guess they thought  that we had forgotten the lives lost in that terrible tragedy. We will  never forget them or the countless others who lose their lives to gun  violence every day.   Now, today, the majority seeks to pass this bill on the House floor,  despite the deadly consequences. How many more lives will be lost  because Republicans refuse to acknowledge that these weapons are a  favorite of mass shooters for their ability to make a gun both deadly  and concealable? How many more people have to die before Republicans  will value the lives of our children over the profits of the gun  industry?   During the last Congress, Democrats put forth a range of solutions to  prevent gun violence, to support law enforcement, and to solve violent  crimes, but our colleagues across the aisle continue to push for  unfettered access to every firearm and accessory imaginable.                                time  1445    As Republicans continue to seek freedom from gun regulation, we will  continue to seek communities free from gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we will certainly go home and explain to the  people why we support the ATF's absolutely necessary actions to defend  the safety of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman says that the cause of gun violence in  this country is homicidal maniacs. We have 78 times as much gun  violence per unit of population than any other country in the world.   Does the gentleman think that we are 78 times as mentally ill and  that we have 78 times as many gun maniacs in this country as anywhere  else per unit of population?   That is a slander on the American people.   The obvious cause is we have guns run amok.                                time  1515    Mr. Speaker, Republicans have claimed this rule affects forearm  braces. It does not. If a disabled veteran needs a forearm brace to  shoot a pistol, he or she can still get one without registering it.   The only firearms affected by this rule are those that have a brace  that is ``designed, made, and intended to be fired from the shoulder.''  If a veteran or anyone else wants a covered brace, all they have to do  is register it. It was even free to do so until June 1. The ATF waived  the fee to encourage compliance.   All this rule does is close a loophole so that all short-barreled  rifles are subjected to the commonsense requirements of the National  Firearms Act: Registration and a background check.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   We have heard the majority claim over and over that this rule is  going to come as a surprise to the gun industry and to those who have  purchased stabilizing braces. This is simply not true.   There are dozens of videos online of people promoting the use of  braces to create short-barreled rifles that circumvent the National  Firearms Act. One brace promoter even said the resulting short-barreled  rifle could easily fit into a briefcase or a backpack.   Let's be clear. The majority is defending the widespread availability  without a background check of a brace that allows more rifles to easily  fit into a backpack. The majority has seen these promotional videos. We  watched  [[Page H2842]]  them in our hearing and in our markup, yet they continue to seek to  invalidate this rule and claim it will come as a surprise.   The fact is that those who profit from the sale of these braces have  long known that they were circumventing the law. The ATF wrote to one  brace manufacturer multiple times over the last 10 years. In 2018, 5  years ago, the ATF, under President Trump, told the brace manufacturer  that it was engaging in false advertising by claiming devices were ATF  approved, when in fact the ATF had not even evaluated those devices.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a July 18, 2018, letter from the  ATF to SB Tactical, a brace manufacturer, stating that they must cease  the false advertisement of products as ATF approved when they had not  even been evaluated, much less approved by ATF.           U.S. Department of Justice,             Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,                                                    Martinsburg, WV.      SB Tactical,       Saint Petersburg, FL.        Dear SB Tactical: This letter is to inform SB Tactical that       certain products currently marketed and sold by SB Tactical       have not been evaluated nor approved by the Bureau of       Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Firearms       Technology Industry Services Branch (FTISB). It has come to       the attention of FTISB that all of SB Tactical ``braces'' are       being marketed as evaluated and approved by ATF as ``pistol       stabilizing braces,'' although, in most cases no evaluations       or classification have ever occurred.        FTISB has found the following statement on the boxes of       unevaluated SB Tactical models:        ATF Compliant--ATF has reviewed this product and determined       that attaching a Pistol Stabilizing Brace to a firearm does       not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the       firearm to NFA control.        To date, FTISB has evaluated only two SB15 Tactical       submissions: the SB15 brace and the MPX PSB brace. FTISB       approved both of these models for use as ``stabilizing       braces,'' and classified them as not designed or intended to       be used as shouldering devices. However, these       classifications were based on the samples as submitted. Any       change in the submitted design could change FTISB's       classification.        Currently, SB Tactical markets more than 20 different       designs of ``pistol stabilizing braces.'' While some of these       new models are similar to the original evaluated models,       several are advertised as being based off shoulder stock       designs. FTISB does not approve ``stabilizing braces'' which       are similar or based off shoulder stock designs.        These are the submitted SB Tactical braces approved by ATF:        SB15 (Original submission)        MPX PSB        SB Tactical braces not submitted nor approved by ATF:        SBA3, SBPDW, SB-MINI, SBL, SBM4, SOB, SBX-K, SBV, SBM47,       SOB47, SBT5, SBT5A.        SBT5KA, SBTEVO, SBT805, SBT, SBTI, VECTOR PSB, UZI PSB,       TAC14-SBM4, 590-SBM4, TAC14-SBL, 590-SBL.        SB Tactical must cease false advertisement of products as       ATF approved which have not been evaluated nor approved. If       SB Tactical would like to get an official determination for       these products, they may be submitted to FTISB for evaluation       and classification.        In order for FTISB to evaluate these products and make an       official determination, please submit the samples to: Chief,       FTISB.        In order for FTISB to perform an evaluation, any submission       must be on a complete firearm, with the ``stabilizing brace''       installed.        Please contact us if you have any additional questions       regarding this matter.            Sincerely yours,                                              Michael R. Curtis,                                 Chief, Firearms Technology Industry                                                   Services Branch.     Mr. Speaker, the ATF, the agency specifically tasked with  regulating dangerous weapons and keeping them out of the wrong hands,  underwent a careful review process that began under the Trump  administration.   The agency determined that gun owners were exploiting a loophole that  allowed stabilizing braces to be used to assemble a short-barreled  rifle without being subjected to the existing regulations for such  highly dangerous weapons. The ATF then issued a rule, using the  standard administrative process, to close this loophole and to protect  our communities.   There should be nothing controversial about this rule, but  Republicans want to overturn this sensible regulation and put more  stabilizing braces on the streets and in the hands of more mass  shooters.   I remind Members that mass shooters have already used stabilizing  braces to kill 9 people outside a bar in Dayton in 2019; to kill 10  people, including a responding police officer, at a grocery store in  Boulder in 2021; to kill 5 people in an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado  Springs last year; and just a few months ago to kill 6 people,  including 3 children, at a school in Nashville.   Once again, Republicans are putting the interests of the gun industry  over the safety of their communities.   I urge all Members to oppose this dangerous legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chair, today, we are considering a bill that would  require both houses of Congress to vote to approve, and for the  President to sign, a motion of approval for any major rule in progress  from our executive branch.   We are considering this bill just a week after a splinter group of  the far-right Republicans voted down a rule and held our legislative  calendar hostage all to prove a point about a debt ceiling that already  has passed Congress and has been signed by the President.   Even before this radical move, I had no doubt that the REINS Act  would grind to a halt the most impactful actions by our regulatory  state. Now, after seeing what just a handful of Members will do just to  make a point, I am certain that we cannot let bad measures like this  one move forward.   The REINS Act would frustrate the purpose of government and put our  constituents in harm's way.   Even if the underlying policy behind the REINS Act was a good idea,  which it emphatically is not, I would still argue against it because it  is unconstitutional. By allowing the regulation to be blocked from  being implemented if even one Chamber declines to pass an approval  resolution, the REINS Act is essentially a legislative veto, which the  Supreme Court has already held to be unconstitutional.   The goal of this legislation, quite simply, is to stop the regulatory  process in its tracks, regardless of its impact on public health and  safety.   The bill purports to give Congress control of the rulemaking process,  but Congress already has this power and it exercises it in a number of  ways. Congress can delegate authority to agencies with specificity,  thus limiting the scope of the agency's authority. It can impose  restrictions on rulemaking through appropriations. It can influence  rulemaking through oversight activities. If all of these measures are  insufficient, we also have the blunt tool of the Congressional Review  Act, which allows Congress not only to overturn a rule but also to bar  the agency from ever passing a substantially similar rule.   The REINS Act is not only redundant, it also creates insurmountable  procedural hurdles that would stall the approval of rules of major  impact, rules that would be highly beneficial to the public's health  and safety.   It is important to remember why we have regulations in the first  place. Congress sets broad policies but we delegate authority to  executive agencies because we do not have the expertise to craft  technical regulations ourselves.   Who here knows how many parts per billion of arsenic should be  allowed in our drinking water? Is 10 the proper amount? Should it be 5  or 15? None of us here knows the answer, but the dedicated  professionals at our Federal agencies, many of whom have decades of  experience and vast technical expertise, undertake a careful process  with numerous procedural safeguards to protect our health and safety.   The recent smog and pollution much of the East Coast experienced last  week as a result of the Canadian wildfires is a great example of why we  need an informed regulatory state to act on our behalf. Decades ago,  many cities had similar levels of pollutants in the air, clogging our  lungs and causing harm to our children and the environment as we saw  last week.   Thanks to expert-informed policies like those regulations instituted  under the Clean Air Act, we rarely have days like we saw last week when  our most vulnerable citizens must take shelter inside to avoid  breathing the air.   Regulations ensure that our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe  to drink, our food is safe to eat, and the lifesaving medications we  depend on are safe and effective.   I feel much better about leaving regulatory decisions to the careful  study of agency experts rather than to Members of Congress who want to  substitute their judgment, subject to the whims of politics.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will note that we have letters  representing over 180 public interest organizations, health experts,  and labor unions opposed to the REINS Act because of the harm this bill  presents to our country's health and welfare.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the letters of opposition.                                                     March 9, 2023.        Dear Senator/Representative: The following undersigned       organizations representing the public health, medical and       patient advocacy communities, write to you to state our       strong opposition to S. 184 and H.R. 277--the Regulations       from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023 (REINS       Act), and we ask you to oppose this harmful legislation.        The REINS Act is a threat to public health. It would add       major roadblocks to health-protective regulations by       requiring Congress to approve all ``major'' rules issued by       federal agencies within a 70-day window. This includes public       health rules from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid       Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food       and Drug Administration, among other federal agencies that       protect the health and safety of American citizens. Under the       REINS Act, the default would be Congress blocking important       and critical protections including clean air, public health,       safety and healthcare measures that have already been       authorized by current law.        The REINS act would unilaterally weaken the implementation       of public health and safety safeguards that require the       promulgation of significant rules that benefit millions of       Americans. These include rules that are statutorily required       to prevent deaths, illness and injury and to protect the       public health. Additionally, the REINS Act would give       Congress the power to prevent a ``major'' rule from being       effectively implemented simply by taking no action. This step       delays safeguards and means that agencies would not only have       to reckon with a significantly longer time frame to pass any       meaningful rules, but also that the health and safety of the       public would remain in limbo and under threat. As we've       tragically witnessed in East Palestine, Ohio, federal rules       are imperative to ensuring the health and safety of the       public.        The REINS Act would also hinder the ability of federal       agencies to act and respond to threats swiftly and       effectively. While there are some exceptions that allow a       rule to be implemented for one 90-day period without       Congressional approval--it is not enough.        The REINS Act is a threat to our nation's health. We urge       you to oppose the REINS Act and other similar legislation.            Sincerely,        American Lung Association, Allergy & Asthma Network,       Alliance for Nurses for Healthy Environments, ALS       Association, American Heart Association, Asthma and Allergy       Foundation of America, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,       Climate Psychiatry Alliance, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Nadler,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nadler, and Members of       the Committee: On behalf of the American Federation of       Government Employees, which represents over 750,000 federal       and D.C. government workers across the country, I write to       urge you to oppose the following legislation being considered       for markup in the House Judiciary Committee this week.        Please oppose H.R. 277, the ``Regulations from the       Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2023,''       introduced by Representative Kat Cammack (R-FL). This bill       would require Congress to approve any federal rule or       regulation the Office of Management and Budget determines to       have an economic impact of $100 million or more according to       before it is imposed on the American people.        Federal agencies should have delegated authority to ensure       regulations keep the American public healthy and safe.       Government regulations foster job growth and ensure that       workplaces are healthy, safe, and accountable. Federal       agencies, in conducting rulemaking, are simply implementing       programs and regulatory systems that were already approved by       Congress and signed into law. Involving Congress in the       details of these processes will result in paralysis, the       politicization of rulemaking, and poorer outcomes for the       health, safety, and wellbeing of the American public.        Please oppose H.R. 357, the ``Ensuring Accountability in       Agency Rulemaking Act,'' introduced by Representative Ben       Kline (R-VA). This bill would require that any agency rule       promulgated under notice and comment procedures must be       issued and signed by an individual who was appointed by the       President and confirmed by the Senate. This bill would       paralyze the functioning of agencies during periods when they       have acting heads, and could further complicate and       politicize the confirmation process for agency heads.        Unnecessary restrictions on government rulemaking will no       doubt restrict the process and prevent the full force of       oversight to ensure the American people have a strong and       productive government supported by federal workers who are       valued and respected.            Sincerely,                                               Julie N. Tippens,                                                           Director,      Legislative Department.                                   ____                                              United Steelworkers,                                                     March 10, 2023.      Statement for the Record of Anna Fendley, Director of State and     Regulatory Policy, The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber,       Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers   International Union (USW) for the House Committee on the Judiciary's     Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and  Antitrust hearing on ``Reining in the Administrative State: Reclaiming                       Congress's Legislative Power''         The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber,       Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers       International Union (USW) is North America's largest       industrial union representing 1.2 million active and retired       members. We welcome the opportunity to comment and submit       this statement on the subject of today's hearing.        We strongly believe that the Administrative agencies play       critical roles in implementing the laws that Congress passes       through regulations. Regulations are imperative for       protecting public health, welfare, and safety, as well as our       shared environment. For our members, regulations allow them       to work and live in safer, cleaner, more prosperous       communities across the country. Regulations also help level       the playing field among businesses and encourage innovation.        Legally, Congress grants federal agencies authority to       promulgate and enforce regulations where necessary using       their policy, scientific, and technical expertise. The       current rulemaking process requires that professional experts       work diligently to collect and process complex information.       Additionally, agencies must solicit and incorporate input  [[Page H2870]]       from a broad range of interested stakeholders when designing       new rules.        For example, USW members who work in oil refineries and       chemical plants and their communities are protected by strong       process safety management regulations. Our members who work       in gas utilities and on pipelines are protected by       regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety       Administration (PHMSA). Steelworkers who make steel for       automobiles have more job security because fuel economy rules       incentivized their employers to innovate and invest in making       stronger, lighter steel. These are just a few examples of the       benefits to USW members.        It is also imperative to note that the current regulatory       process isn't perfect. However, legislation like H.R. 277,       the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of       2023 (REINS Act), represents an extreme threat to public       health and safety. This legislation would obstruct the       ability of federal agencies to enact rules by inappropriately       injecting congressional dysfunction and political       considerations into the regulatory process. H.R. 277 would       require both houses of Congress to approve every major       regulation within 70 session or legislative days before it       can take effect. By doing nothing or through partisan       gridlock, Congress could stop all major regulations from       being finalized, including those that are not controversial.       Thus, this risks blocking agencies' efforts to fulfill their       statutory mandates to pursue public protections and       significantly wasting federal government resources.        We believe that improving and strengthening the regulatory       process is critical to ensuring that our federal agencies are       transparent, accountable, and effective at delivering strong       regulatory protections for consumers, workers, public health,       and the environment. That is why we encourage the       Subcommittee to evaluate legislative proposals that provide a       roadmap for reforming the regulatory process, such as the       ``Stop Corporate Capture Act'', which is being reintroduced       for the 118th Congress today. This legislation would reduce       special interest influence on the rulemaking process,       increase transparency around federal agency decision-making,       clear procedural bottlenecks that delay regulatory       protections, empower the public to hold agencies accountable       for enforcing the rules, and build a foundation for       consideration of social equity in the rulemaking process.        The American people and American businesses need smart and       sensible regulations to ensure that all players in our       economy are held to the same standards. We stand ready to       assist the Subcommittee in its important work to ensure that       our regulatory process is transparent, assessible, and       protective of the public. Thank you.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill to committee. If the House rules permitted, we would  have offered the motion with an important amendment to the bill. The  amendment would have ensured that vulnerable groups like veterans and  their health will not be harmed by the politicization and delay of  critical executive branch rules under the REINS Act.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the proposed text of the  amendment.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On June 13, 2023, page H2871, in the third column, the following  appeared: Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the proposed text  of the motion to recommit.      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Chairman, I  include in the Record the proposed text of the amendment.    ========================= END NOTE =========================           Mr. Nadler moves to recommit H.R. 277 to the Committee on       the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to       the House forthwith with the following amendment:        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not take       effect until the date on which the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs certifies to Congress that implementation of this       Act, and the amendments made by this Act, will not delay the       provision of benefits or health services to veterans by the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs.     Mr. Chair, although the REINS Act will harm everyone, we  must at least ensure that those who serve in our Armed Forces are not  further harmed by this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, this legislation is just the latest effort by  Republicans to dismantle and destroy the regulatory process, a process  that protects our health and safety each and every day.   Regulations ensure that we have clean air to breathe, clear water to  drink, and safe food to eat. They ensure that children's toys and cribs  are safe, that medications are safe and effective, and that the planes,  trains, and automobiles we depend on for transportation will keep us  safe. They ensure that consumers are protected from fraud and  discrimination, that workers are treated fairly, that veterans are  fairly compensated for their service, and so much more.  [[Page H2872]]    However, Republicans want to stop this process in its tracks and put  our health and safety at risk, just as they stopped our process of  legislating last week, all to prove a point to leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will not repeat myself. For all the  reasons I gave a couple of minutes ago, this is a very bad bill. It is  very dangerous legislation for the peace and health and safety of the  people of the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to oppose it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
