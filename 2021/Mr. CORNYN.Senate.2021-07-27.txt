 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  speak for 5 minutes and, following me, the Senator from Wyoming be able  to speak for 8 minutes.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about the life and legacy  of our friend, Mike Enzi, and his sudden loss.   I saw Mike via Zoom just last week at the Senate prayer breakfast.  Mike got up a little earlier than the rest of us to be able to join us  over the internet from Wyoming. But he liked participating in the  prayer breakfast. And as we were reminded by some of our colleagues--I  think Senator Lankford may have mentioned it--Mike could always be  depended on if somebody was a last-minute cancellation, which happened  from time to time.   Of course, it had only been a matter of a few months since Mike had  retired, marking the conclusion of a storied career in public service.  Mike literally did it all. He served in the military and at every level  of government, from the mayor's office in Gillette to the State  legislature, to here in the U.S. Senate. And he always put the people  of Wyoming first.   Mike was pretty unique in this place because he never sought the  spotlight. In many ways, it seemed like he was allergic to getting any  sort of attention from the press or otherwise. Whether he was in the  midst of a high-pressure negotiation or celebrating a big legislative  victory, Mike did not run to the TV cameras or reporters in the  hallways. He preferred to work quietly behind the scenes, effectively  resolving differences in a quiet, thoughtful way. And once he  succeeded, he didn't claim the credit for himself. He claimed credit  for others.   During Mike's 24 years in the Senate, he certainly had a lot of  successes to celebrate, and he let me in on his winning formula not  long after I got here. At the time, he and the liberal lion of the  Senate, Teddy Kennedy, were chairman and ranking member of the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I think they may have swapped  out as majorities changed; one became chairman, and the other became  ranking member.   But I asked him how Mike, the staunch Western conservative that he  was, could work so productively with somebody who shared very different  views. And he told me it is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. You are not  going to agree or disagree with 100 percent of what someone has to say,  but if you focus on the 20 percent or that that you will never agree  on, you overlook the 80 percent that you can agree on.   Well, as simple as it may sound, it is a winning formula for success  here in the Senate, and more of us should practice the 80-20 rule. At a  time when more attention is paid to what divides us than what unites  us, I hope the legacy of Mike Enzi and the 80-20 rule will remain a  constant in the Senate.   As we honor the life and legacy of our good friend, Mike Enzi, there  is another favorite saying of his that has been on my mind. He used to  say: You have to have an attitude of gratitude.   Well, Mike was always grateful--grateful to God, grateful to live in  this great country, grateful to the people of Wyoming for the  opportunity to serve them, and, of course, grateful for his  [[Page S5093]]  wonderful family and their endless love and support.   Sandy and I send our condolences to Mike's wife Diana, their  children, grandchildren, and the entire Enzi clan. We are grateful to  them that they shared their beloved patriarch with us for so many  years.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Albert  Trevino on his retirement from the U.S. Border Patrol, after 26 years  of faithful service to the American people.   Albert started his law enforcement career right out of college in  1987, with the police force in his hometown of Harlingen, TX. In  Harlingen, he served as patrol officer for the police department for 5  years before being promoted to an instructor and background  investigator.   In 1995, he joined the U.S. Border Patrol, ready to face greater  challenges. He first served in El Paso, before securing a transfer back  to Harlingen several years later to patrol and protect his hometown  community.   During his career, Albert has had the opportunity to serve on the  prosecutions detail working with the U.S. Attorney's Office on  prosecuting criminal aliens, has been a post academy instructor in both  immigration law and Spanish for his fellow agents, and has assisted the  inspector general's office on background investigations. In the course  of his career, Albert has helped apprehend literally thousands of  illegal border-crossers and dozens of narcotics smugglers.   Many of us in the Senate know Albert through his work as an elected  official with the National Border Patrol Council. He was first elected  to office in the Rio Grande Valley Sector Local in 1999 and then as a  national vice president in 2011. As national vice president, he has  chaired the legislative committee for 10 years, and for many of us here  in Washington, Albert has been the face of our Nation's Border Patrol  agents. He has represented them faithfully and, in doing so, has helped  support the agents who keep Americans safe. It is no overstatement to  say every Senate office engaged on border security issues over the last  decade has likely worked with Albert on an issue. His efforts on  Capitol Hill were instrumental in the passage of the Border Patrol Pay  Reform Act in 2014, that gave Border Patrol agents a stable pay system  for the first time in 40 years.   I have had the pleasure of working with Albert on legislation to give  Border Patrol agents wage parity with other Federal law enforcement  agencies by restoring Fair Labor Standards Act overtime. I had hoped we  could pass this legislation before Albert retired, but will keep  working to bring this to fruition.   I would also like to recognize Albert's incredible family who have  supported him throughout his career. A successful career in law  enforcement is a team effort that involves the entire family. Border  Patrol agents work long hours under extremely harsh conditions. It is a  24/7 operation, and agents must work nights, weekends, and holidays.  Family holidays and celebrations often get missed when you have to  work; yet Albert's family has been unwavering in their support for him.  I am grateful for the commitment shown by Albert's wife of 30 years,  Edna, and their children Alisa and Danny.   In closing, I would like to thank Albert for his 26 years of Federal  service to this country, to the people of the great State of Texas, and  to his community of Harlingen. We wish you and your family well in your  retirement, and we hope you see continued success in future  endeavors.                            ____________________
