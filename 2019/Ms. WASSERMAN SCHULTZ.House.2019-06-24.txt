 Mr. Chair, due to a family medical emergency,  I was unable to vote on Duncan Amendment No. 234 and Duncan Amendment  No. 235 to Division E of H.R. 3055. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 400 and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 401.                  Amendment No. 244 Offered by Mr. Grothman
