 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  transformational Build Back Better Act and the investments it will make  in our economy to help working families in our country.   I am proud that, after months of compromise and negotiation, we have  a bill today that is certain to make a difference in the lives of so  many, while growing our economy and confronting the climate crisis.   By extending the child tax cut, making childcare affordable, and  lowering drug prices, we are giving families more money in their  pockets. We are also ensuring 4 weeks of paid leave for all workers so  that nobody has to lose their job in order to take care of themselves  or loved ones; something so many families have struggled with this  pandemic.   And all these investments are completely paid for by ensuring that  billionaires and corporations pay their fair share. Those who get rich  off the backs of working families need to pay their fair share and  support them.
