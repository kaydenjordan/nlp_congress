 Madam President, per an agreement that was reached with my  colleagues, Dr. Eric Lander, the President's nominee for the Director  of the Office of Science and Technology Policy was not subject to a  rollcall vote on the Senate floor, but was instead considered under a  voice vote.   I would like to be on the record that I am opposed to the nomination  of Dr. Lander. As OSTP Director, Dr. Lander will advise the President  and the administration on all the scientific, technological, and  engineering aspects of Federal policy, including Federal research. Dr.  Lander should receive even further scrutiny for this position after  President Biden has chosen to elevate the Director of the OSTP to a  Cabinet-level position.   This nomination comes at a critical time as the Senate seeks to pass  the Endless Frontier Act, which would increase Federal scientific  research and development funding--imprudently in my opinion--by over  $100 billion. As I have weighed the nomination of Dr. Lander both in  the Senate Commerce Committee and in the weeks leading up to his  consideration by the full Senate, Dr. Lander has failed to provide the  guarantees that he supports appropriate guardrails around federally  funded research, including protections for unborn life through the  prohibition of experimenting with aborted fetal tissue, embryonic stem  cells, or live embryos.   With the consideration of the Endless Frontier Act and the greater  role that OSTP will take in directing the direction of our Federal  research and development, I am very concerned that Dr. Lander has not  assured me that he will put in place protections for the unborn or  institute appropriate ethical guardrails to protect such life.   For these reasons, I opposed the nomination of Dr. Lander.                            ____________________
