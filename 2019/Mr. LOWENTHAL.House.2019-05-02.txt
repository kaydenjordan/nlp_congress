 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 9,  the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure that the U.S. remains part of the  Paris climate agreement.   Report after scientific report has told us that, when it comes to  climate change, we are on a precipice. The status quo leads us over the  cliff. The only way back is with immediate and earnest action. That is  all of us together.   The Paris Agreement was meant to be a collective first step toward  beginning to address climate change. We have a duty to ourselves, to  our children, and to the rest of the world to not only join in that  step forward, but to lead it.   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting H.R. 9.                            ____________________
