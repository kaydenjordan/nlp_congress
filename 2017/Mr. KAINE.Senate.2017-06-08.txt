 Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Fair and Equal  Housing Act of 2017, legislation to ensure equal housing opportunities  for all Americans. This bill would protect Americans from housing  discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. No  American should be turned away from a home they love because of who  they love.   I am a former civil rights attorney. And during my practice, I  focused on fair housing and I learned that a home is more than just a  door, a roof, rooms, and walls. Your home is critical to your identity  and central to the life of every American.   And a home becomes even more important when you are searching for a  safe, stable place to live. But, say you run into problems as you're  trying to rent that dream apartment and it is not because you are not a  good tenant or a good neighbor. Instead, you learn that the apartment  you wanted is suddenly no longer available because, after you met the  landlord in person, they don't approve of your personal life or your  appearance. Or you learn your rental application cannot be processed  because you and your partner share the same sex.   Housing discrimination is real. And it is a reality for LGBT  Americans because of incomplete protections in the Fair Housing Act  (FHA), the landmark federal housing law. The FHA only prohibits housing  discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  familial status, or disability. And if someone thinks this is not a  real problem, more than 20 states and over 200 localities protect  sexual orientation and gender identity in their own housing  discrimination statutes.   This is about equality, plain and simple. I want to thank my fellow  Virginian, Representative Scott Taylor, for his leadership on this  issue. I also want to thank all the civil rights attorneys across the  nation who fight for justice on this issue every day. This is the right  thing to do.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):   S.J. Res. 45. A joint resolution condemning the deadly attack on May  26, 2017, in Portland, Oregon, expressing deepest condolences to the  families and friends of the victims, and supporting efforts to overcome  hatred, bigotry, and violence; considered and passed.                                S.J. Res. 45         Whereas, on May 26, 2017, 3 brave community members--Rick       Best, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, and Micah David-Cole       Fletcher--were stabbed as they protected 2 young women who       were the targets of threatening anti-Muslim hate speech while       riding on the Metropolitan Area Express Light Rail (commonly       known as the ``MAX'') in Portland, Oregon;        Whereas Rick Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche lost       their lives and Micah David-Cole Fletcher was gravely injured       as a result of the attack;        Whereas acts of heroism and sacrifice for the safety and       sake of others in the face of acts of domestic terrorism were       demonstrated by the deceased and surviving victims;        Whereas Oregonians and people across the United States       grieve for the families of all people affected by this       needless tragedy; and        Whereas the people of the United States stand in solidarity       against terrorism, white supremacy, hate, and intolerance:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That       Congress--        (1) condemns the deadly attack on May 26, 2017, in       Portland, Oregon, in which 2 innocent people were killed and       1 other person was injured while standing up to hate and       intolerance;        (2) offers deepest condolences to the families and friends       of Rick Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche;        (3) expresses hope for the swift and complete recovery of       Micah David-Cole Fletcher;        (4) supports community efforts to heal from this terrible       crime; and        (5) supports nationwide efforts to overcome hatred,       bigotry, and violence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Fair and Equal  Housing Act of 2017, legislation to ensure equal housing opportunities  for all Americans.
