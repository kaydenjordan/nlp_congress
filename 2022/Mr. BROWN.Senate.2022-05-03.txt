 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for up to 2 minutes  on the nomination.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in  advancing the nomination of Elizabeth de Leon Bhargava to be Assistant  Secretary for Administration of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development. Ms. Bhargava would oversee offices responsible for  recruitment and staffing, procurement, and providing administrative  support for HUD employees. She will ensure the Department takes steps  to retain the best talent and grow HUD's workforce to meet current and  future needs.   Yesterday, I came to Washington on the commercial United flight with  Secretary Fudge. She is working hard every day to serve her former  constituents. I live in her old congressional district. And to serve  this country, she needs qualified employees confirmed like Ms.  Bhargava.   For more than 4 years, Ms. Bhargava served as New York State Deputy  Secretary for Labor and Workforce, directly responsible for workforce  policy and operations affecting more than 9 million New Yorkers. She  recognizes that the program continuity depends on strong leadership at  the top and meeting the Department's urgent staffing needs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the nomination of Ms.  Bhargava to HUD.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I appreciate being recognized.   I want to start with a short little story. A month after--well, maybe  2 weeks after--President Biden took office, I was invited as the new  chair of a major Senate Committee, the Senate Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs Committee. I think the Presiding Officer was there that  day, too. We met in the Oval Office with the President of the United  States.   We sat in a semicircle, and I saw that the painting behind President  Biden was of Franklin Roosevelt. He was surrounded by busts of Harry  Truman, Rosa Parks, Dr. King, Cesar Chavez, and Robert Kennedy. He  asked us to go around the room and tell what interests us, what kind of  things we should be doing.   When it was my turn, I talked about the Protecting the Right to  Organize Act, and I talked about the child tax credit, which, after we  passed it, it was a $3,000 tax cut to 92 percent of the families in my  State and a similar percent in the Presiding Officer's State of  Michigan. Families with children received a $3,000 tax cut, the biggest  in American history.   I spoke about housing, and then I said, at the end of my little  minute and a half: Mr. President, thank you for talking about unions.   He kind of smiled and said: Of course.   When the meeting was over, after 45 minutes or so, the President  walked toward me and said: Why wouldn't I mention unions?   I said: Mr. President, I have been in this office a number of times  over the last 25 years, and I have never heard a President talk about  the unions the way you do.   That was the beginning. We then passed the recovery act and have done  so much more with the bipartisan infrastructure bill.   He has always put the emphasis on workers, putting workers at the  center  [[Page S2269]]  of our economic policy and workers at the center of our country and at  the center of our economy.   Let me illustrate. In the last 2 weeks--I know that Senator Hassan,  who is about to preside today, when she went back to New Hampshire  during these 2 weeks, she was talking to families and workers, and  Senator Peters, who is presiding, from Michigan, did the same--what  struck me is that we had four sort of Cabinet-level people from the  Biden administration who came to Ohio during these couple of weeks. I  was with three of them. With one of them, we couldn't work out  schedules.   The head of the EPA was in Ohio. Do you know what he talked about? He  talked about how we replace--Ohio, unfortunately, is No. 2 in the  country in the number of contaminated pipes connecting main water lines  going into people's homes, contaminated with lead. We are, because of  the bipartisan infrastructure bill, going to replace those 600,000  pipes. We are going to replace them with U.S., Made-in-America iron and  steel and other components, because in infrastructure, we passed the  strongest--and Senator Hassan was part of this and others. We passed  the strongest ``Buy America'' provisions ever in American history. If  you are going to spend American tax dollars, you are going to hire  American workers to do that.   Administrator Regan of the EPA talked about what that means. It means  thousands of jobs for pipefitters and other union trades people. It  also means clean water going into moderate- and low-income families'  homes in Appalachia and East Cleveland and everywhere in between. And  that means healthier children.   Then the Secretary of the Department of Labor came. The Department of  Labor Secretary with President Biden's predecessor was essentially a  corporate lawyer. I would use the word--this might sound disrespectful,  and I apologize ahead of time--a hack. Fundamentally, he was a guy who  spent his career making, I assume, millions of dollars a year working  for a prestigious law firm, busting unions, and always siding with  employers and with big corporations against workers. That was the  predecessor.    The Secretary of Labor under President Biden came out of Boston. He  was a former laborer. He was a former union laborer. Make that  contrast. Then I spent part of the time in Lakewood, a Cleveland  suburb--in the city of Cleveland and in Lakewood--and then Fremont, OH,  with the new Chair of the Export-Import Bank, talking about jobs,  talking about workers, talking about getting help competing with the  Chinese, with the Export-Import Bank, always with an emphasis on wages.   We know what has happened the last 50 years. I went to high school  and walked the halls of Mansfield Senior High School and Johnny  Appleseed Junior High School with the sons and daughters of machinists  who worked at Ohio Brass, of electrical workers who worked at  Westinghouse, of autoworkers who worked at GM, of rubber workers who  worked at Mansfield Tire, and with the sons and daughters of laborers  and operating engineers, millwrights, carpenters, pipefitters,  painters, and electricians--all making middle-class union wages that  really built a decent economy for tens of thousands of families in my  community.   I know what that meant, and then we saw corporate leaders: First they  shut down production in places like Mansfield, my hometown, or  Springfield or Toledo. They moved to Alabama or Tennessee or Arkansas-- low wages, few unions, weak unemployment compensation, sort of  inadequate unemployment workers' compensation programs for injured and  unemployed workers.   But those wages weren't low enough. So these same corporate leaders  went on a scavenger hunt to Mexico and China--all over the world--to  try to find the cheapest labor possible.   And do you know what? Far too many Presidents and far too many people  in this body helped them do that. That is why this President is so  important and why this Senate is so important--that we can fight back.   We are seeing now that the whole idea of this administration is to  begin to bring these jobs back home and treat these workers with  respect and begin, again, to rebuild the middle class.   The last Cabinet Secretary to come in who I spent a full day with was  in Chillicothe, OH, in southern Ohio. It is a small community hurt by  globalization. There is a VA hospital. It is one of the oldest VA  hospitals in the country. And these workers--there was a Commission  started by President Trump that is slating the closure of the  Chillicothe VA.   Today, Presiding Officer Senator Hassan and I were in the Veterans'  Committee asking about workers--with Senator Tester presiding and  Senator Boozman, a good bipartisan team on Veterans' Affairs--what do  we do to make sure these workers are whole, that we train workers, that  they are not burning out by all the tension and the pressure and the  anxiety they face now?   In sitting with Secretary Denis McDonough, the new Secretary of the  VA, the Biden Secretary of the VA, it was a pleasure watching him  interact with these workers, interacting with Jessica Fee, who is the  union president, at Chillicothe, the American Federation of Government  Employees. President Kelley, the international president, was there.  Ms. Simon, his assistant, was there, listening to these workers,  listening to what do we do to train enough LPNs, licensed practical  nurses? What do we do to train enough nurses? What do we do to train  enough physical therapists? And how do we keep this hospital open?  Because so many veterans care so deeply about this hospital.   So the last 2 weeks what motivates me in this job is my job really,  in so many ways, is how do you speak for those who don't have a voice?  How do you fight for those--it is always whom you fight for and what  you fight against. I am not interested in opposing Senator McConnell  because he blocks a whole bunch of stuff that we care about. I am not  interested in opposing him; I am interested in fighting against some of  the things he does.   But I am interested in fighting for these workers at the VA. I am  interested in fighting for these pipefitters who are going to lay these  clean pipes without lead contamination, making these children in  Appalachian Ohio, in East Cleveland, in East Columbus, OH--making them  more whole. I am interested in helping these workers who DOL finally  sides with instead of siding with corporate interest.   During these 2 weeks, I went to a Starbucks in Columbus, and these  workers are trying to organize a union. They know that carrying a union  card--carrying a union card means better wages; it means better  benefits; it means more control over your work schedule. Of course,  Starbucks is fighting the union, but finally we have a government that  is helping these small businesses export more. And we have a government  that is going to finally side with veterans and side with workers at VA  hospitals.   The last 2 weeks is--and for me it has been a celebration, as Studs  Terkel said in an introduction of a book called, ``Christ in  Concrete,'' a book written in the late 1930s about an immigrant worker.  It came out the same week as ``Grapes of Wrath,'' and, interestingly,  it was chosen over ``Grapes of Wrath'' for the Book-of-the-Month Club,  even though ``Grapes of Wrath'' had a little bit more staying power.   But Studs Terkel talked in his introduction about celebrating the  uncelebrated, and that is really what we should be doing here. You  celebrate those workers. It is not the corporations; it is not the  President; it is not the big shots; it is really the workers who power  this economy, the workers who make the VA work, the workers who will  lay those pipes, the workers who are the small business people  succeeding and competing with China in countries around the world, the  workers at the VA.   That is what the last 2 weeks for me was about. It is why the honor  of having this job and fighting for these workers gets me up every day.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
