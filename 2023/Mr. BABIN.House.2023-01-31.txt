 Mr. Speaker, not many have tasted true freedom like  Americans have because, in all of the world, there is no place like the  United States of America.   But if we are not careful, this unique experiment that has persevered  through depression, famine, sickness, terrorism, world wars, and a  civil war will disappear before our very eyes.   The French philosopher Montesquieu wrote that ``the deterioration of  every government begins with the decay of the principles upon which it  was founded.'' This statement is as true today as it was in 1748.   Right now, we are literally witnessing the decay of our freedoms of  speech. For years, we have watched one political party silence and  discredit those they disagree with by de-platforming them, censoring  them, shadow-banning them, and suppressing their ability to reach the  public.   We have seen this tactic used against duly elected Members of  Congress, professionals in countless fields, conservative media outlets  like Newsmax and OAN, and even a sitting President.  [[Page H562]]    The endless kowtowing to a political faction with an agenda so  radical that you either have to bend the knee or be exiled goes against  the very fabric of our Constitution. It is un-American, and it is a  disgrace.   The left treats debate or, God forbid, even a simple difference of  thought, as public enemy number one. Why is our freedom of speech so  threatening to the democratic narrative?   We cannot stand idle while our freedoms are being extinguished. As  President Reagan said, ``freedom is never more than one generation away  from extinction.''   I don't want my 17 grandchildren to spend their sunset years telling  their children and their children's children what it was once like in  the United States, when men and women were free.   We must ensure that America remains that beacon of hope, the city on  a hill, a nation with a dream that anyone can grasp if they only have  the courage to dare.
