 Madam President, I rise today with a heavy  heart to pay tribute to Pasquale ``Pat'' Battinelli, Jr., a lifelong  Connecticut resident, distinguished veteran, and friend to many. Sadly,  Mr. Battinelli passed away on April 6, 2023, at the age of 90. He will  be remembered for his steadfast dedication to his country and  community.   Pat was born in Darien before moving to Stamford as a young boy.  There, he met the love of his life, Gloria Fabrizio, at the age of 13.  After graduating from Stamford High School, Pat enlisted in the U.S.  Marine Corps. Stationed in the Philippines during the Korean war, Pat  served honorably for 4 years. In 1954, after completing his service, he  returned to Stamford where he married Gloria. The couple were married  for 68 years and raised four children.   In addition to his military service, Pat had a distinguished record  of giving back to Stamford and our State. As chief of the Glenbrook  Fire Department and commander of the Lock City Detachment of the Marine  Corps League, as well as an active member of the Knights of Columbus,  Pat has demonstrated a lifelong dedication to community service. I  personally saw Pat at work in all these positions, but also very  importantly as leader of Stamford's Patriotic and Special Events  Commission for over 30 years. In this role, he was in charge of every  parade Stamford held during his tenure, a testament to Pat's civic  mindedness and patriotism.  [[Page S1249]]    Pat was an inspiration to veterans and a shining example of good  citizenship. I was privileged to know Pat and count him as a friend. He  was selfless, loyal, and unstinting in his commitment to helping  others--a true patriot. My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest  sympathies to Pat's family during this difficult time, particularly to  his wife Gloria, his four children, and his many grandchildren and  great-grandchildren. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring  Pat's life and legacy.                            ____________________
