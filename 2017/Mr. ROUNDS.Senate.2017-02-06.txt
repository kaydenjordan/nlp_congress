 Mr. President, I rise today regarding the upcoming  confirmation on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be Attorney General  of the United States. For the past 3 years, I have had the great  pleasure of working with Senator Sessions in this body. We served  together on both the Senate Armed Services and Environment and Public  Works Committees. Within those committees, as well as on other issues  that have come before the Senate during that same time period, I have  found that Senator Sessions is extremely forthright, hard-working, and  Senator Sessions is honest. He has served Alabamans and all Americans  well during his 20 years in the U.S. Senate.   In addition to serving on the Armed Services and EPW Committees, he  also serves on the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committees, all of which  address vital aspects of our Federal system.   Senator Sessions also had a distinguished career before he was  elected the U.S. Senator from Alabama. After graduating from the  University of Alabama with a law degree, Senator Sessions practiced law  in Russellville and Mobile, AL. In 1975, he took the oath to defend the  Constitution of the United States as an assistant U.S. attorney--the  first step in a long and honorable career as a prosecutor. In 1981,  Senator Sessions was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the  U.S. Senate as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.  He served honorably in that role for 12 years. Senator Sessions was  then elected Alabama attorney general and served in that role until his  election to the U.S. Senate.   It is clear to me that Senator Sessions is exceptionally and perhaps  uniquely qualified to serve as the Attorney General for the United  States. He served as a line prosecutor and, as U.S. attorney and  Alabama attorney general, as the chief Federal and State law  enforcement authority. He has personally handled or managed a wide  variety of cases--criminal and civil, trial and appellate. Senator  Sessions also has extensive experience in the Federal system and, as a  former State attorney general, a deep respect for State and local law  enforcement and the role of States in our Federal system.   There is an attribute even more important than experience, in my  opinion, and that is integrity. Over the course of his career, Senator  Sessions has demonstrated a deep respect for the Constitution and the  rule of law, and ultimately, I believe that is what is most important  in an Attorney General of the United States.   In 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote this about the role of a U.S.  attorney, and I think it applies similarly to the Attorney General:         A federal prosecutor ``is the representative not of an       ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose       obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its       obligation to govern at all and whose interest, therefore, in       a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but       that justice be done.''    The Supreme Court continued:         [A]s such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the       servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt       shall not escape or innocence suffer.    I support Senator Sessions as Attorney General of the United States  not only because his experience makes him qualified to serve but more  importantly because his character makes him qualified to serve. Senator  Sessions will, in the words of the Supreme Court, be a certain  ``servant of the law'' and will make certain that justice is done for  all Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Within those committees, as well as on other issues  that have come before the Senate during that same time period, I have  found that Senator Sessions is extremely forthright, hard-working, and  Senator Sessions is honest. He has served Alabamans and all Americans  well during his 20 years in the U.S. Senate.   In addition to serving on the Armed Services and EPW Committees, he  also serves on the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committees, all of which  address vital aspects of our Federal system.   Senator Sessions also had a distinguished career before he was  elected the U.S. Senator from Alabama. After graduating from the  University of Alabama with a law degree, Senator Sessions practiced law  in Russellville and Mobile, AL. In 1975, he took the oath to defend the  Constitution of the United States as an assistant U.S. attorney--the  first step in a long and honorable career as a prosecutor. In 1981,  Senator Sessions was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the  U.S. Senate as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.  He served honorably in that role for 12 years. Senator Sessions was  then elected Alabama attorney general and served in that role until his  election to the U.S. Senate.   It is clear to me that Senator Sessions is exceptionally and perhaps  uniquely qualified to serve as the Attorney General for the United  States. He served as a line prosecutor and, as U.S. attorney and  Alabama attorney general, as the chief Federal and State law  enforcement authority. He has personally handled or managed a wide  variety of cases--criminal and civil, trial and appellate. Senator  Sessions also has extensive experience in the Federal system and, as a  former State attorney general, a deep respect for State and local law  enforcement and the role of States in our Federal system.   There is an attribute even more important than experience, in my  opinion, and that is integrity. Over the course of his career, Senator  Sessions has demonstrated a deep respect for the Constitution and the  rule of law, and ultimately, I believe that is what is most important  in an Attorney General of the United States.   In 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote this about the role of a U.S.  attorney, and I think it applies similarly to the Attorney General:         A federal prosecutor ``is the representative not of an       ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose       obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its       obligation to govern at all and whose interest, therefore, in       a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but       that justice be done.''    The Supreme Court continued:         [A]s such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the       servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt       shall not escape or innocence suffer.    I support Senator Sessions as Attorney General of the United States  not only because his experience makes him qualified to serve but more  importantly because his character makes him qualified to serve. Senator  Sessions will, in the words of the Supreme Court, be a certain  ``servant of the law'' and will make certain that justice is done for  all Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I rise today regarding the upcoming  confirmation on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be Attorney General  of the United States. For the past 3 years, I have had the great  pleasure of working with Senator Sessions in this body. We served  together on both the Senate Armed Services and Environment and Public  Works Committees.
