 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4372) to direct Federal science agencies and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy to undertake activities to  improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education and enhance the  research capacity at the Nation's HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4372         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``MSI STEM Achievement Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Evidence suggests that the supply of STEM workers is       not keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the       public and private sector, resulting in a deficit often       referred to as a STEM skills shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, more opportunities       for advancement, and a higher degree of job security than       non-STEM occupations.        (4) The composition of the STEM workforce does not reflect       the current or projected diversity of the Nation, with       Hispanics, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic       minorities, significantly underrepresented in the STEM       workforce compared to their presence in the workforce more       generally.        (5) A stronger national commitment to increasing the       diversity of the STEM workforce is needed to help address the       STEM skills shortage.        (6) According to a 2019 National Academies of Sciences,       Engineering, and Medicine report entitled ``Minority Serving       Institutions: America's Underutilized Resource for       Strengthening the STEM Workforce'', two- and four-year       minority serving institutions enroll nearly 30 percent of all       undergraduate students--a percentage that is expected to grow       in the coming years--in the United States higher education       system and play a critical role in providing important       pathways to STEM-related education, training, and careers for       students of color.        (7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly successful at       educating underrepresented minority students in STEM fields       and can serve as best  [[Page H9354]]       practice models for other colleges and universities to       further expand participation of underrepresented minorities       in the STEM workforce.        (8) Increased investment in STEM infrastructure at HBCUs,       TCUs, and MSIs has the potential to increase these       institutions' ability to educate even more students in the       STEM disciplines.        (9) With the demand for STEM skills exceeding the supply of       STEM graduates, success of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in educating       and training science and engineering leaders is increasingly       important for United States economic growth and       competitiveness.       SEC. 3. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REVIEW.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on H.R. 4372, the bill that is under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4372, the MSI STEM Achievement  Act, and I thank Representative Waltz for joining me in introducing  this bill and for his commitment to increasing diversity in Science,  Technology, Engineering, and Math, or STEM fields.   This bill was developed based upon recommendations in the 2019  National Academy of Sciences report entitled, ``Minority Serving  Institutions: America's Underutilized Resource for Strengthening the  STEM Workforce.''   The demographics of our country are changing, and we must do more to  address the underrepresentation of minority students in STEM to keep  our workforce competitive.   As stated in the report, the STEM readiness of students of color will  have direct implications on America's economic growth, national  security, and global prosperity. The time to act is now.   Minority-serving institutions have a long record of success in  recruiting, retaining, and graduating underrepresented minority  students in STEM. However, more investment and outreach are needed to  enable the MSIs to realize their potential.   The MSI STEM Achievement Act ensures that Federal STEM education and  research funding opportunities are more accessible to the MSIs. The  legislation directs the Government Accountability Office to compile an  inventory of Federal science agency programs targeted to MSIs and to  make recommendations of what more agencies can do to encourage  increased participation and success for the MSIs in these programs.   In addition, the legislation authorizes the National Science  Foundation to support research on the challenges and successes MSIs  have had in contributing to the STEM workforce, including approaches to  building the research competitiveness of MSIs.   And finally, the bill directs the Office of Science and Technology  Policy to develop a government-wide strategic plan and sustained  outreach program to support STEM education and research at the MSIs.   It is important to remember that these institutions are not a  monolith. Indeed, their focus on meeting the distinct needs of their  students has been critical to their success. In carrying out the  activities of this act, Federal science agencies and OSTP should ensure  that they are accounting for the diversity among these institutions and  the populations they serve. If we are to continue to prosper as a  Nation, we must do more to diversify our STEM workforce.   Fortunately, the more than 700 MSIs that enroll nearly 30 percent of  our Nation's undergraduates know how to solve this problem. The MSI  STEM Achievement Act will ensure these institutions are equipped with  the resources they need to lead the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good, bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I simply want to thank all of the Members and staff involved  in this legislation. I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4373) to provide for a coordinated Federal research  initiative to ensure continued United States leadership in engineering  biology, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4373         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Engineering Biology Research       and Development Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Cellular and molecular processes may be used, mimicked,       or redesigned to develop new products, processes, and systems       that improve societal well-being, strengthen national       security, and contribute to the economy.        (2) Engineering biology relies on a workforce with a       diverse and unique set of skills combining the biological,       physical, chemical, and information sciences and engineering.        (3) Long-term research and development is necessary to       create breakthroughs in engineering biology. Such research       and development requires government investment as many of the       benefits are too distant or uncertain for industry to support       alone.        (4) Research is necessary to inform evidence-based       governance of engineering biology and to support the growth       of the engineering biology industry.        (5) The Federal Government can play an important role by       facilitating the development of tools and technologies to       further advance engineering biology, including user       facilities, by facilitating public-private partnerships, by       supporting risk research, and by facilitating the commercial       application in the United States of research funded by the       Federal Government.        (5) The United States led the development of the science       and engineering techniques that created the field of       engineering biology, but due to increasing international       competition, the United States is at risk of losing its       competitive advantage if does not invest the necessary       resources and have a national strategy.        (6) A National Engineering Biology Initiative can serve to       establish new research directions and technology goals,       improve interagency coordination and planning processes,       drive technology transfer to the private sector, and help       ensure optimal returns on the Federal investment.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 4373, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4373, the Engineering Biology  Research and Development Act of 2019.   I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for joining me in introducing  this legislation.   The term ``engineering biology'' means the application of engineering  [[Page H9359]]  design, principles, and practices to biological systems to advance  fundamental understanding of complex natural systems and to enable  novel functions and capabilities.   Engineering biology research is used in microbes and plants to grow  food more resilient to climate change, reduce our dependency on fossil  fuels, and make more effective drugs to treat human diseases. Some  researchers are even engineering microbes for environmental cleanup.  These are some of our Nation's and world's greatest challenges, and  engineering biology is one of our greatest tools.   The economy of the 21st century will be driven by the bioeconomy.  Other countries are making significant investments in engineering  biology research and development. We must recognize that U.S.  leadership is not just about growing our economy and ensuring that our  Nation benefits from the products of engineering biology; it is also  about leading responsibly.   As China accelerates its own investments and the tools of engineering  biology are increasingly cheap and accessible to individuals  everywhere, we must also be mindful of the security implications. The  potential for misuse of this technology to cause harm makes more urgent  our need to invest strategically in engineering biology research today.   Along with authorizing a Federal engineering biology research  initiative, this bill would also establish a framework for greater  coordination of Federal investments in engineering biology; require a  national strategy for those investments; expand public-private  partnerships; focus on the education and training for the next  generation of engineering biology researchers; and address any  potential ethical, security, and societal issues associated with  engineering biology research.   It is past time for the United States to recognize the significance  of this emerging research area to our economic and national security.   I was disappointed by the lack of such recognition in this  administration's last budget request but hopeful to see the tide  turning with the convening of a recent White House summit on the  bioeconomy.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle and with the administration to ensure that the United States will  not lose its leadership position in this area.   H.R. 4373 is an important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no requests for time, and  if the gentleman is ready to close, then I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I wish to express my appreciation for Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Lucas,  Ms. Lofgren, and myself, and I have no further requests for time.   I would simply urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2051) to provide for Federal coordination of  activities supporting sustainable chemistry, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2051         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 7. PRIORITIZATION.         In carrying out this Act, the Entity shall focus its       support for sustainable chemistry activities on those that       achieve, to the highest extent practicable, the goals       outlined in the Act.       SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed to alter or amend       any State law or action with regard to sustainable chemistry,       as defined by the State.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2051, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Sustainable Chemistry Research  and Development Act of 2019.   I want to thank Representatives Lipinski and Moolenaar for  introducing this good, bipartisan bill.   Chemistry touches every aspect of modern society. As the chemical  industry continues to innovate to make our lives easier, we must do  more to minimize the risks to the environment and to public health.  Sustainable chemistry practices and principles, once widely adopted,  will provide the private sector with tools to meet societal needs while  mitigating negative impacts on the health and safety of future  generations.   Unfortunately, progress in adopting this approach has been slow. As  we learned during the Science Committee hearing on this topic earlier  this year, the key challenges include a lack of research, a lack of  Federal coordination, a lack of consensus regarding how sustainability  should be measured and assessed, and a need for improved sustainable  chemistry education.   This legislation establishes the framework for Federal leadership to  advance sustainable chemistry. Specifically, the bill provides for  improved coordination of Federal activities, including research and  development of more sustainable chemicals, processes, and systems.   The bill also supports improved education in sustainable chemistry  and expands opportunities for the Federal Government to partner with  industry to bring innovations to market.   When the Federal science agencies support our Nation's scientists and  engineers to come up with better solutions to real-world problems, our  brightest minds will always rise to the challenge.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply wish to thank our authors  and our staff, and I urge passage of this bill. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 737) to direct the National Science Foundation to  support STEM education research focused on early childhood.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 737         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Building Blocks of STEM       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The National Science Foundation is a large investor in       STEM education and plays a key role in setting research and       policy agendas.        (2) While studies have found that children who engage in       scientific activities from an early age develop positive       attitudes toward science and are more likely to pursue STEM       expertise and careers later on, the majority of current       research focuses on increasing STEM opportunities for middle       school-aged children and older.        (3) Women remain widely underrepresented in the STEM       workforce, and this disparity extends down through all levels       of education.       SEC. 3. SUPPORTING EARLY CHILDHOOD AND ELEMENTARY STEM                     EDUCATION RESEARCH.         In awarding grants under the Discovery Research PreK-12       program, the Director of the National Science Foundation       shall consider the age distribution of a STEM education       research and development project to improve the focus of       research and development on elementary and prekindergarten       education.       SEC. 4. SUPPORTING FEMALE STUDENTS IN PREKINDERGARTEN THROUGH                     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STEM EDUCATION.         Section 305(d) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-5(d)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Research.--As a component of improving participation       of women in STEM fields, research funded by a grant under       this subsection may include research on--        ``(A) the role of teacher training and professional       development, including effective incentive structures to       encourage teachers to participate in such training and       professional development, in encouraging or discouraging       female students in prekindergarten through elementary school       from participating in STEM activities;        ``(B) the role of teachers in shaping perceptions of STEM       in female students in prekindergarten through elementary       school and discouraging such students from participating in       STEM activities;        ``(C) the role of other facets of the learning environment       on the willingness of female students in prekindergarten       through elementary school to participate in STEM activities,       including learning materials and textbooks, seating       arrangements, use of media and technology, classroom culture,       and composition of students during group work;        ``(D) the role of parents and other caregivers in       encouraging or discouraging female students in       prekindergarten through elementary school from participating       in STEM activities;        ``(E) the types of STEM activities that encourage greater       participation by female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school;        ``(F) the role of mentorship and best practices in finding       and utilizing mentors; and        ``(G) the role of informal and after-school STEM learning       opportunities on the perception of and participation in STEM       activities of female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school.''.       SEC. 5. SUPPORTING FEMALE STUDENTS IN PREKINDERGARTEN THROUGH                     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN COMPUTER SCIENCE                     EDUCATION.         Section 310(b) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-7(b)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Uses of funds.--The tools and models described in       paragraph (2)(C) may include--        ``(A) offering training and professional development       programs, including summer or academic year institutes or       workshops, designed to strengthen the capabilities of       prekindergarten and elementary school teachers and to       familiarize such teachers with the role of bias against       female students in the classroom;        ``(B) offering innovative pre-service and in-service       programs that instruct teachers on female-inclusive practices       for teaching computing concepts;        ``(C) developing distance learning programs for teachers or       students, including developing curricular materials, play-      based computing activities, and other resources for the in-      service professional development of teachers that are made       available to teachers through the Internet;        ``(D) developing or adapting prekindergarten and elementary       school computer science curricular materials that incorporate       contemporary research on the science of learning,       particularly with respect to female inclusion;        ``(E) developing and offering female-inclusive computer       science enrichment programs for students, including after-      school and summer programs;        ``(F) providing mentors for female students in       prekindergarten through elementary school to support such       students in participating in computer science activities;        ``(G) engaging female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school, and their guardians (if such communication       takes place on school premises during otherwise-scheduled       conferences or formal conversations between teachers and       guardians) about--        ``(i) the difficulties faced by female students with regard       to maintaining an interest in participating in computer       science activities; and        ``(ii) the potential positive career benefits of engaging       in such activities;        ``(H) acquainting female students in prekindergarten       through elementary school with careers in computer science       and encouraging such students to consider careers in the       computer science field; and        ``(I) developing tools to evaluate activities conducted       under this subsection, including reports for evaluating the       effectiveness of activities under this section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 737, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 737, the Building Blocks  of STEM Act.   The demand for computer science skills is on the rise across all  sectors of the economy. To ensure that we have the capacity to meet  that demand, we must attract more students to study computer science. A  major challenge for increasing the number of computer science graduates  is the low participation of women.  [[Page H9363]]    Even as access to high school computer science courses increases,  female participation remains low. At high schools offering advanced  placement courses in computer science, only 23 percent of the students  taking the exam are girls.   Research shows us that interventions at the high school level may  come too late. Girls as young as 6 years old are internalizing gender- based stereotypes that discourage them from engaging in STEM  activities, including computer science.   The Building Blocks of STEM Act directs the National Science  Foundation to support research into factors that contribute to the  early adoption of these stereotypes. The bill also directs the National  Science Foundation to support the development of models for  intervention to prevent or reverse the effects of these negative and  false stereotypes.   I thank my colleagues Representatives Stevens and Baird and Senators  Rosen and Capito for their leadership on this legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my  appreciation for the leadership of Representatives Stevens and Baird;  Senators Rosen and Capito; and the ranking member, Mr. Lucas. I urge  that we pass this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4355) to direct the Director of the National  Science Foundation to support research on the outputs that may be  generated by generative adversarial networks, otherwise known as  deepfakes, and other comparable techniques that may be developed in the  future, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4355         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Identifying Outputs of       Generative Adversarial Networks Act'' or the ``IOGAN Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Research gaps currently exist on the underlying       technology needed to develop tools to identify authentic       videos, voice reproduction, or photos from manipulated or       synthesized content, including those generated by generative       adversarial networks.        (2) The National Science Foundation's focus to support       research in artificial intelligence through computer and       information science and engineering, cognitive science and       psychology, economics and game theory, control theory,       linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is building a       better understanding of how new technologies are shaping the       society and economy of the United States.        (3) The National Science Foundation has identified the ``10       Big Ideas for NSF Future Investment'' including ``Harnessing       the Data Revolution'' and the ``Future of Work at the Human-      Technology Frontier'', in with artificial intelligence is a       critical component.        (4) The outputs generated by generative adversarial       networks should be included under the umbrella of research       described in paragraph (3) given the grave national security       and societal impact potential of such networks.        (5) Generative adversarial networks are not likely to be       utilized as the sole technique of artificial intelligence or       machine learning capable of creating credible deepfakes and       other comparable techniques may be developed in the future to       produce similar outputs.       SEC. 3. NSF SUPPORT OF RESEARCH ON MANIPULATED OR SYNTHESIZED                     CONTENT AND INFORMATION SECURITY.         The Director of the National Science Foundation, in       consultation with other relevant Federal agencies, shall       support merit-reviewed and competitively awarded research on       manipulated or synthesized content and information       authenticity, which may include--  [[Page H9364]]         (1) fundamental research on digital forensic tools or other       technologies for verifying the authenticity of information       and detection of manipulated or synthesized content,       including content generated by generative adversarial       networks;        (2) fundamental research on technical tools for identifying       manipulated or synthesized content, such as watermarking       systems for generated media;        (3) social and behavioral research related to manipulated       or synthesized content, including the ethics of the       technology and human engagement with the content;        (4) research on public understanding and awareness of       manipulated and synthesized content, including research on       best practices for educating the public to discern       authenticity of digital content; and        (5) research awards coordinated with other federal agencies       and programs including the Networking and Information       Technology Research and Development Program, the Defense       Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Intelligence       Advanced Research Projects Agency.       SEC. 4. NIST SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND STANDARDS ON GENERATIVE                     ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS.         (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute of       Standards and Technology shall support research for the       development of measurements and standards necessary to       accelerate the development of the technological tools to       examine the function and outputs of generative adversarial       networks or other technologies that synthesize or manipulate       content.        (b) Outreach.--The Director of the National Institute of       Standards and Technology shall conduct outreach--        (1) to receive input from private, public, and academic       stakeholders on fundamental measurements and standards       research necessary to examine the function and outputs of       generative adversarial networks; and        (2) to consider the feasibility of an ongoing public and       private sector engagement to develop voluntary standards for       the function and outputs of generative adversarial networks       or other technologies that synthesize or manipulate content.       SEC. 5. REPORT ON FEASIBILITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP                     TO DETECT MANIPULATED OR SYNTHESIZED CONTENT.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Director of the National Science Foundation and       the Director of the National Institute of Standards and       Technology shall jointly submit to the Committee on Space,       Science, and Technology of the House of Representatives and       the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation a       report containing--        (1) the Directors' findings with respect to the feasibility       for research opportunities with the private sector, including       digital media companies to detect the function and outputs of       generative adversarial networks or other technologies that       synthesize or manipulate content; and        (2) any policy recommendations of the Directors that could       facilitate and improve communication and coordination between       the private sector, the National Science Foundation, and       relevant Federal agencies through the implementation of       innovative approaches to detect digital content produced by       generative adversarial networks or other technologies that       synthesize or manipulate content.       SEC. 6. GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``generative adversarial network''       means, with respect to artificial intelligence, the machine       learning process of attempting to cause a generator       artificial neural network (referred to in this paragraph as       the ``generator'' and a discriminator artificial neural       network (referred to in this paragraph as a       ``discriminator'') to compete against each other to become       more accurate in their function and outputs, through which       the generator and discriminator create a feedback loop,       causing the generator to produce increasingly higher-quality       artificial outputs and the discriminator to increasingly       improve in detecting such artificial outputs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4355, the bill  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4355, the Identifying  Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act.   Deepfake technology, which manipulates photos, videos, or audio clips  to produce content that seems real but is not, has become increasingly  commonplace in recent years. This increase in prevalence has been  spurred, in part, by increases in computing power, widespread  availability of images and other data, and the use of artificial  intelligence.   In many cases, the applications of this technology may be benign, but  bad actors can also use this technology to spread disinformation and  cause great harm to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.   During the Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing on online  imposters and disinformation earlier this year, one of the witnesses  showed us a demonstration of a deepfake video in which he swapped the  likenesses of two Members of Congress at the hearing.   Despite the spread and potential harm of deepfake technology, there  are currently no sure-fire methods of identifying and distinguishing  manipulated content from authentic content. The ability to  differentiate between manipulated and authentic content is essential to  maintaining our national and economic security and protecting against  malicious use of these technologies.   H.R. 4355 leverages the strengths of the National Science Foundation  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology by directing  these agencies to support research on manipulated or synthesized  content in order to help develop the standards and other tools  necessary to detect this content.   I commend my colleagues Representatives Gonzalez, Stevens, and Baird  for their excellent leadership on this bipartisan legislation. I urge  all of my colleagues to join in passing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my  appreciation for all the Members who have been working on this very  important bipartisan legislation. I urge its passage, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1545
