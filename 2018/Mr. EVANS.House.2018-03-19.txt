 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from the  great city of Brooklyn, particularly the great part of New York in  terms of Brooklyn. She always reminds me that there is not a better  place than Brooklyn. And if you haven't been there, I encourage you to  go to Brooklyn.   What can I say about my colleague Congresswoman Lawrence from  Michigan? As they both lead this effort, I compliment both of them.   I want to thank my colleagues for holding this Special Order hour to  talk about our queens, our rocks, and our Black women. I say that  because I was raised by a Black woman who was a single head of  household, better known as my mom, Jean Evans. She was someone then and  now who always was very consistent in her message in terms of stay  strong and always look forward.   As we paint a picture of the Black community in 2018, it is clear  that we have a lot to lose, because too many of our neighborhoods,  unfortunately, are still plagued by rampant poverty, dysfunction, and  crime. They are very serious issues.   But as I seek to tie together last week's Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order with tonight's theme, it is important to remember that,  when the Kerner Commission report was issued, and even today, Black  women had to deal with racism and, add to that, sexism. I am comforted  by the fact that the excellence of Black women continues to outshine  the gloom and doom that some of these problems bring. In fact, the  fastest growing category of entrepreneurs are Black women.   Fortunately, I don't have to look too far because of Philadelphia,  home of some of the most dynamic women and Black women in America.  There is a woman there who is very good, and I have known her an awful  long time, City Councilwoman Janine Blackwell, six terms in the  council, born and raised in Philadelphia. She is a seasoned advocate  for social change and has a 30-year reputation for serving community  members and the poor and underprivileged in the city of Philadelphia,  making her a leader in our city, Councilwoman Janine Blackwell.   Della Clark, president of The Enterprise Center, has played an  integral role in the creative, technical, and professional progress of  minority business development over the course of her life.   Estelle Richman, former Secretary of Public Welfare and Chief  Operating Officer of the United States Department of Housing and Urban  Development. Richman oversaw agency efforts that resulted in an  increased percentage of foster children finding permanent homes and a  drop in the waiting list for mental retardation services.   Julia Coker Graham is the president and the CEO of the Philadelphia  Convention and Visitors Bureau, where she oversees all of the  organization's departments and operational duties.  [[Page H1691]]  Prior to being named to the position, she served as the senior vice  president of the convention sales and management staff, 25 people. She  leads that organization, and she represents the face of Philadelphia.   The late C. Delores Tucker, who was the first African American to  serve in the cabinet of a governor in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   And last but not least is Sarah Lomax-Reese, president and general  manager of WURD, better known as Wurd in the African-American  community, a Black-owned radio station.                                time  2045    All of these women I have mentioned have, in one way or another,  affected me personally and have played a very key role in my life. So I  want to join with my colleagues and talk about these beautiful women-- our queens, our rocks, our great women. I thank both of my colleagues  for allowing me to have this opportunity to join this discussion.
