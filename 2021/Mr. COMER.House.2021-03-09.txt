 Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong opposition to this  bill, which would cripple American entrepreneurs and workers, just the  opposite of what we should be doing to stimulate an economy.   Workers already have the right to organize under Federal law, as they  should, but the PRO Act takes the extreme step of forcing unionization  onto workers who do not wish to be a part of a union.   And just like the recent $2 trillion spending spree, Democrats are  ramming this partisan bill through with no Republican input. We didn't  even have a committee hearing to examine its harmful effects, including  an estimated $47 billion on job creators.   Unfortunately, one of my commonsense amendments--to preserve a  longstanding ban on secondary boycotts--was blocked by the Democrat  majority.   Democrats would be wise to heed President Biden's message of unity  and work with Republicans to help our economy. Instead, they are back  this week with more partisan bills designed to appease left-wing  special interest groups. American workers deserve better.    Madam Speaker, my amendment protects the ability of  employers to receive advice from an attorney or consultant regarding  unionization without the attorney or consultant having to disclose the  relationship to the Federal Government when the attorney or consultant  will have no contact with the employer's employees.   Congress has no business forcing attorneys to report on an attorney- client relationship when the attorney will not be speaking with  employees. Even the left-leaning American Bar Association opposed the  Obama persuader rule, and I urge my colleagues to do the same by  approving this amendment and protecting the First Amendment rights of  employers.
