 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the censure  of Representative Jamaal Bowman. This is yet another predictable but no  less wasteful action.   Congressman Bowman has taken accountability for his mistake, and even  Republicans on the Ethics Committee agree that this is a waste of time.   We have got 99 problems, but a functional government of the  Republican majority is not one of them.   Republicans are disconnected, dysfunctional, discriminating, and a  disappointment to the American people. They can't pass a bill to fund  our public schools, but they will bring this resolution to attack  Congressman Bowman, a champion for students, a lifelong educator, a  duly elected Member of Congress, and a strong Black man. He honors the  legacy of the many brilliant Black men who came before him.   A quick history lesson: We are approaching the anniversary of when  Joseph Rainey became the first Black Member of the U.S. House of  Representatives in December of 1870. Just like Jamaal Bowman, he fought  for public education and civil rights, and he had to deal with double  standards and racism in Congress.   This censure is just the latest in this Chamber's racist history of  telling Black men that they don't belong in Congress.   To the Black men of this Nation, know that you belong everywhere.    Jamaal Bowman is fighting for you, and I am fighting  for you right alongside him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution.
