 Mr. Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to join me and  the members of the Nevada delegation in honoring the three precious  lives that were lost to a heinous act of gun violence on December 6,  2023, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where I  [[Page H6803]]  taught in the political science department for 35 years.   Patricia Navarro Velez, an assistant professor of accounting at the  university and a mother of four, devoted her career to educating the  next generation of business professionals, particularly among  underserved populations and minorities. She is remembered for her  infectious smile and her larger-than-life personality.   Cha Jan ``Jerry'' Chang, a professor of management information  systems and devoted UNLV colleague for more than 20 years, was known  for his even-keeled, positive, and unwavering presence. He is survived  by his wife and two children.   Naoko Takemaru was an associate professor of Japanese studies and a  noted author, academic, and award-winning educator. In her 20th year at  UNLV, Ms. Takemaru's colleagues remembered her as lionhearted in  kindness.   Today, I stand here in solidarity with my colleagues from Nevada with  a heavy heart for the victims, their families, and all of the UNLV  students, faculty, and staff who experienced this horrific event.   Mr. Speaker, we honor the lives we lost and uplift the UNLV community  during this trying time.   I ask that we not only use this time to commemorate the important and  selfless contributions of each of these individuals who were part of  the UNLV community and also to remember the heroic actions of our law  enforcement, but also to reflect on the pressing need to enact  commonsense legislation to protect our communities from the epidemic of  gun violence.   I ask all of my colleagues to consider signing on to a resolution to  this effect, which I will be introducing tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to  honor the three lives lost and to uplift the UNLV community.                            ____________________
