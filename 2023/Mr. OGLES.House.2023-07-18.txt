 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  define the phrase ``short term'' for the purposes of the Schools Not  Shelters Act as being a period of up to 72 hours.   The phrase ``short term'' has varying definitions for different  purposes in law and in different States. In many cases, the law  considers housing for as long as a year as short term.   The underlying bill prohibits housing illegal aliens in taxpayer- funded schools with an understandable exception for emergencies. If  people are seeking shelter from a storm, we don't want to lock them out  to face the elements, regardless of their citizenship or immigration  status.   My amendment protects the intent of this bill by ensuring that  Governors can't abuse this emergency exception by opportunistically  using an emergency or declaring an emergency that doesn't really exist  so that they can house illegals in schools for months on end.   My amendment still allows State and local authorities the flexibility  to offer schools as shelter in moments of true crisis, but requires  that they limit that to a few days to make sure it is a momentary stop- gap solution rather than a long-term reality.   Under the so-called leadership of President Biden, Vice President  Harris, and Secretary Mayorkas, our southern border is open. Every  State has become a border State as criminal cartels traffic aliens into  our country by the thousands.   Some sanctuary States have chosen to address this problem by housing  these illegal aliens in our schools. Using our schools, our public  schools, to house illegal aliens redirects resources the American  people set aside for our children to foreign nationals who disrespect  our laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: Schools are meant for the  purpose of educating our children. Housing those in violation of law,  illegals, can put our children at risk and turns places of education  potentially into dormitories for lawless individuals. We have Governors  who have used and abused their authorities to circumvent Federal law,  immigration law, all we are asking is that if it is going to be done,  it is for a defined period of time.   I have to admit as I have listened to debate, the violins were  playing, widows were weeping, and my colleagues were pandering. We have  people that are here violating the law. Keep that in mind. Our border  is flooded with illegals. There is a pattern of illegals committing  crime in our country. There is a pattern of gang members crossing our  border, and there is a pattern of this reckless administration for  ignoring the law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption and support for my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
