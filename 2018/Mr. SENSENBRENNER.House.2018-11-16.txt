 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bipartisan legislation. The Endangered Species Act helps species  recover, and let me tell you, it works. In 1980, there were 25 wolves  in Wisconsin. Recently, that number grew to 232 wolf packs--roughly 900  wolves.   Now that the wolf population is recovered, states must be allowed to  take over management. The rising wolf population means livestock and  hunting dogs fall prey to attacks, and as long as federal protections  remain in place, Wisconsinites cannot protect their property.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6784 because, outside of dire  circumstances, states are the most effective managers of wildlife and  the policies affecting state residents. This legislation restores power  to states, and I hope all my colleagues join me in voting for it.
