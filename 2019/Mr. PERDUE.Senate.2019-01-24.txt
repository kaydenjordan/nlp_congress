 Mr. President, today I wish to honor an incredible  man and an incredible Georgian. J. Harold Shepherd passed away earlier  this month, but his legacy will far outlast his time on earth. If you  have spent time in Georgia or anywhere in the Southeast you may have  heard of his family's work at the Shepherd Center. The Shepherd Center,  located in Atlanta, Georgia, is one of the top rehabilitation hospitals  in the country and the result of Harold's lifetime of passion for  others and the disabled community.   A fourth generation Atlantan, Harold was the youngest of six  children. He started in construction with his father at age 15, and as  a young man started Shepherd Construction Company with his three  brothers. Harold and his family members oversaw the construction of  thousands of miles of interstate highways and city and country streets,  and built all but one section of I-95 in Georgia.   Harold's proudest achievement, however, was the Shepherd Center. The  [[Page S585]]  hospital was founded after James, Harold, and his wife Alana's son,  sustained a serious spinal cord injury on a beach trip. James spent six  months at a rehabilitation hospital in Colorado, where he ultimately  regained his ability to walk. When James returned home to Atlanta, he  and his parents grew frustrated with the lack of rehabilitation care  options in the Southeast and developed a plan to open the Shepherd  Center.   What started as a six-bed rehabilitation unit is now a world- renowned, 152-bed research and rehabilitation facility spread across  three campuses. Until his passing earlier this month, Harold spent  nearly every day volunteering at the hospital and developed a  reputation for being an incredible storyteller and historian. He was  beloved by the staff at the Shepherd Center, and dedicated his life to  them, his family, and the disabled community in Georgia.   Harold is survived by his wife, Alana Smith Shepherd; his sons James  H. Shepherd, Jr. and Thomas C. Shepherd; and his grandchildren Julie  Shepherd, James H. Shepherd III (Sarah), and Thomas C. Shepherd, Jr. He  is also survived by four great grandchildren, James Harold Shepherd IV,  Josephine Shepherd, Virginia Shepherd, and Annie Shepherd.   Mr. Shepherd will be greatly missed, and I thank him for his service  to our community.                            ____________________
