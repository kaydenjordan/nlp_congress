 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the Republicans are bringing a bill  to the floor that seeks to ban trans women and girls from participating  in women's sports. This bill is morally wrong, it is cruel, and it is  discriminatory.   President Biden has already promised to veto it, but when the United  States House of Representatives passes a bill, it sends a message. If  you are a trans kid right now, the message coming from our government  is that you don't belong.   This leads to bullying, isolation, depression, and even suicide. I  want to speak to the trans kids in America today. I want to say you  belong in the American family. We are proud of you. Democrats must not  be quiet. We must speak clearly to uplift and protect trans kids. We  must recognize that a harm to trans kids threatens a harm to everyone,  and we must embrace our diversity as a unique American strength that  has the ability to unite us.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this cruel discriminatory bill  tomorrow.                            ____________________
