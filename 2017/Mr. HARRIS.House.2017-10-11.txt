 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the committee for promptly  reporting H.R. 2989 to the floor for consideration.   I rise today in support of a bill I have cosponsored with Delegate  Norton, the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act. As we  approach the 200th anniversary of Frederick Douglass' birth, I urge my  colleagues in the House to support this legislation.   The purpose of this bill is more than just honoring the birth of one  great civil rights leader. Its purpose is to recognize his lasting  impact on American Government, culture, and values. Frederick Douglass'  work stretched far beyond the fight for legal freedom into the equally  important fight for social and cultural equality.   Born on Maryland's beautiful Eastern Shore, Douglass escaped slavery  to become an author, abolitionist, and true American hero. Frederick  Douglass is a model for the values that make our Nation great:  equality, liberty, and a commitment to working hard and helping others.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to honor Frederick Douglass and the  resounding impact his work has had on modern American culture by  passing this legislation.
