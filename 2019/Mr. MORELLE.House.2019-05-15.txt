 Madam Speaker, across our Nation, we face an epidemic.  In schools, in churches, on our streets, Americans are dying from gun  violence.   We have a moral responsibility to do everything in our power to  prevent more people from suffering the loss of a loved one to the  scourge of illegal guns. That is why I have introduced the Gun Theft  Prevention Act.   Last year, more than 500 gun shops were burglarized nationwide,  releasing thousands of deadly weapons onto our streets and into the  hands of criminals. In my district, a single gun shop was broken into  twice in the same week, seven times in the span of a decade.   Yet licensed gun dealers are not required to take even the most basic  precautions, like locking their doors at night, to prevent these  dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands.   My bill requires gun shops to meet minimum security requirements,  like locked cabinets and video surveillance, creates strong enforcement  mechanisms, requires reporting of stolen guns, and authorizes 650 new  ATF inspectors.   This is commonsense legislation that will save lives, and I will work  tirelessly to ensure its passage.                            ____________________
