 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, to protect the helpless, most powerless, most innocent  among us, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8296, the abortion on  demand until birth act.   This is not about codifying Roe v. Wade. Why? Because it nationalizes  abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy--all 9 months. This would make  America as radical as China and North Korea.   The abortion on demand until birth act would legalize discriminatory  abortion based upon sex, race, and disability, including Down syndrome.  It overrides State laws that protect women from coercion. It would  weaken conscience protections to force pro-life doctors to perform  abortions and end a life.   This is especially frightening for pregnancy centers, faith-based  providers, and medical professionals who are using amazing medical  achievements in treating both mothers and their babies in the wombs as  patients. We are doing prenatal heart surgery today in the United  States of America.   The abortion on demand until birth act has nothing to do with  protecting the health of women. It has everything to do with forcing an  extreme agenda on the American people.   Rather than prey on women's vulnerabilities and fears and nationalize  abortion for all 9 months, we should be coming together to support  women and their families at every stage of pregnancy and beyond.   Every mother matters. Seventy-six percent of women seeking abortions  say they would choose life if their circumstances were different. The  focus should be on how to change their circumstances, help them access  the care and support that they need, and improve their lives.   Presenting abortion up until birth as a woman's only option is a  false choice. There are nearly 3,000 pregnancy centers in all 50  States. They outnumber Planned Parenthood by more than 2,000  facilities. These pregnancy centers, which are right now under violent  attack by pro-abortion groups, provide medical care, resources,  education, and mentoring to women. They must be protected, not  undermined and threatened by an extreme abortion agenda.   The Supreme Court has affirmed the American people's rights to speak  through their elected officials and enact laws that protect unborn  children. The question upon us today is: How are we going to respond?  How is this body going to respond to the greatest human rights issue of  our generation? That is the question. This is the human rights issue of  our generation.   Do not close your ears. Do not close your eyes. Do not close your  heart.   Is it by dehumanizing life and promoting a culture that destroys the  weakest among us? Is that how we are going to do it? Or is it by making  abortion unthinkable by leading a new era where every person's God- given, unalienable human right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness for all be the way we will define ourselves?   Let's come together. Let's protect the human rights of the unborn. We  cannot deny life to the most disadvantaged and marginalized among us.  They have no voice to defend themselves.   Madam Speaker, abortion for all 9 months is not the will of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to H.R. 8296, the abortion on demand  until birth act because all lives are worth living, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), a dynamic example of life in  her own testimony.  [[Page H6636]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I don't know of any State  laws that prevent birth control. Miscarriages are obviously a tragedy.   The question before us today is on the legislation that would allow  for abortion up until birth, 9 months. It is not the will of the  American people; it is the extreme agenda of those that are promoting  abortion.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Guthrie), the leader on the Health Subcommittee.  [[Page H6638]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a health provider saving lives  every day and a champion for life.                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I would ask what about the  marginalized Black and Hispanic babies who are more likely to be  aborted?   Abortion has had a disproportionate impact on minorities and  individuals with disabilities.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), who is another healthcare  provider. Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks has worked hard to improve the  lives of many throughout her career.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) who spent his life defending the  voiceless.  [[Page H6641]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and another medical provider.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a doctor who understands what  amazing technology is doing to save lives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), another defender of life.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), a defender of  freedom, a defender of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for  all.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time is remaining in this debate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), a defender of life.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), another defender of  life.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a defender of life.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a strong defender  of life, who is on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), another defender of life.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Madam Speaker, abortion is the sharpest, most soul-searching question  before us as a Nation. It pierces every heart. People have strongly  held beliefs and stories, and both sides are guilty of dismissing one  another.   For those of us who stand for the right to life, we must do a better  job of listening and loving. Fear and despair lead to more arguments,  anger, discord, and insecurity.    The abortion on demand bill, this bill before us today, though, is  extreme. It is abortion for any reason, at any stage of pregnancy until  birth. It is not the will of the American people.   I recently spoke with a doctor who shared with me what is possible  today. It is American technology and medical technology that allows us  now to do surgeries inside the womb.   I am a mom of three young kids, and anyone who has given birth knows  that to be able, because of technology, to see the baby develop day by  day is just amazing.   Doctors are performing prenatal surgeries and treatments to save  lives. This doctor was telling me they can perform a prenatal surgery  on 20 different organs. That wasn't possible in 1973 when Roe v. Wade  was decided. In fact, the first successful fetal surgery wasn't until  1982.   Many decades later, look how far we have come. Science has evolved.  It is my hope that we learn from this and that we reject abortion  because it is unthinkable. It is not following the science. It doesn't  reflect the latest research or modern medicine. Reject this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8297, the Ensuring  Access to Abortion Act.  [[Page H6648]]    Just like the Democrats' abortion on demand until birth act, this  bill is part of an extreme agenda to nationalize abortion for all 9  months of pregnancy. Abortion is a false choice between taking care of  a woman and taking care of a baby.   What a woman needs is support. Every life is meaningful, and our  actions are significant. Seventy-six percent of women seeking an  abortion say that they would choose life if their circumstances were  different.   Instead of promoting ways to support women and children with better  healthcare, education, financial stability, and changing their  circumstances, Democrats, including President Biden, are spreading  fear, anxiety, and misinformation. This is a blatant attempt to spread  fear and present abortion at any stage of pregnancy as a woman's only  option.   So I will be very clear:   It is already unconstitutional to prevent a woman from traveling  between States.   The pro-life movement does not support and has always rejected  criminalizing and punishing women, period.   State laws currently in effect have exceptions to save the life of  the mother.   And pro-life laws do not prevent women from getting care they need in  cases of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.   Regarding this legislation, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, I  have many questions and concerns. Its vague language, designed to  promote more abortions, undermines parental consent for minors, opens  loopholes for abuse, and eliminates medical supervision for chemical  abortions.   This bill does nothing to explicitly prevent an unrelated adult or a  sexual abuser from taking a minor out of State for an abortion without  parental consent. It would prevent healthcare professionals, social  workers, and schools in every State from reporting instances of child  abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect because they could be seen as delaying  or hindering access to abortion.                                time  1100    It also undermines parent rights. Parents can be targeted by the  Federal Government and sued for wanting to help their child just by  asking them to delay traveling to get an abortion.   If their child is 16, for example, the parents lose power to protect  their teenager from being coerced by an older man to get an abortion.   The Ensuring Access to Abortion Act undermines the health and safety  of women by preempting State laws regulating the practice of medicine.  It overrides the majority of States that have determined it is safest  for doctors to prescribe pills for chemical abortions. This puts women  and minors in danger if they experience complications.   Finally, these same provisions give sexual abusers and human  traffickers more direct access to chemical abortions in all 50 States  and ensures that doctors in States like California, where there is no  parental consent, can effectively become pill mills by prescribing and  mailing abortion drugs to children and minors and end lives all over  the country.   This is extreme.   Again, I ask my colleagues to abandon this agenda for unlimited  abortions with no restrictions. It only promotes more fear, pain, and  dehumanization of the most vulnerable, the helpless among us.   Instead, let's come together. Let's come together around human rights  of every person in this country, the born and unborn. Let's celebrate  the dignity, the value, and the potential of every person. This is our  chance to lead a new era of hope and healing in our country for every  person, for moms and babies at every stage of life.   Every life is worth living.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Flores), a new Member just elected from  the great State of Texas, the first Member who was born in Mexico, and  a great member of our Republican Conference.    Madam Speaker, just to clarify, not a  single legislature or Congress is debating making contraception  illegal. Contraception is not abortion. It prevents conception. The  scare tactic about making contraception illegal is another scare tactic  by the Democrats to advance a radical abortion agenda to end life up  until 9 months.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), a strong defender of the  right to life.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our whip and a strong defender  of life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Steube) to continue our fight for human  rights for all.    Madam Speaker, as we celebrate a record  number of pro-life women serving in the United States House of  Representatives today and an army of pro-life women all across this  country from every corner, we are fighting for the human rights of all,  especially the unborn.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cammack), one of those mighty warriors.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), another defender of the  right to life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), who is a member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee. Dr.   John Joyce is continuing our fight for  the right to life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), who is a great member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), who is a great defender of the human  right to life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), who is continuing our fight for  life.    Madam Speaker, we are working on a  privacy bill, but that is a separate bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher), a great defender of life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), a leader defending life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a defender of life fighting for  the right to life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), who is on the leadership team  in the House and a great defender for life.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, in the United States of  America, we continue our search for a more perfect Union. We all get to  be a part of that.   In our history, the Supreme Court has overruled 300 of its own cases,  cases such as the Dred Scott decision, and now, Roe v. Wade.   Abortion is a false choice between taking care of a woman and taking  care of a baby. What a woman needs is support.   Every life is meaningful, and our actions significant. Ending  abortion is the human rights issue of our generation. Every life has  value and dignity.   And to every person all across this country, may each one of us open  our eyes and see one another. May each one of us open our ears and hear  one another. May each one of us open our hearts to one another.   We are a Nation founded on the inalienable, God-given rights to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As has been noted by others,  life comes first. You can't have liberty without life. You can't have  the pursuit of happiness without life.   That should guide us and be the bedrock for our moral authority so  that abortion would become unthinkable in America.   Today before this House is a radical agenda. The Democrats' abortion  agenda is much more radical than anything that was in Roe. This is  extreme.   It nationalizes abortion for all 9 months, making America just as  radical as China, North Korea. It legitimizes discriminatory abortions  at any stage based upon baby's sex, race, or disability, including Down  syndrome. It overrides State laws that protect women from coercion.   There is no part of this that celebrates the dignity, the value, or  the potential of human life. Pew Research reports that in Washington,  D.C., in the 29 States that provide racial and ethnic data on abortion  to the CDC, 38 percent of women who underwent an abortion in 2019 were  non-Hispanic or Black, though U.S. Census numbers indicate that Black  people comprise 13.4 percent of the population.   CDC data from 2019 also indicates that Black women are five times  more likely to have an abortion than White women.   Madam Speaker, we stand on the side of life. Let's defend life. It is  the human rights issue of our generation. Reject this bill. I yield  back the balance of the time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
