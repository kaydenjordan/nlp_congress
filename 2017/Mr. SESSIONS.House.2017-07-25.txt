 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding  me this time, and I rise to applaud him for the hard work and the  responsible actions that the chairman has taken, not only to ensure  this piece of legislation is prepared, but bettered and ready to go  back to the Senate.   I think we have a forceful sanctions bill that is before the House  today, and one that targets not only Iran and Russia, but also the  North Korean regime.   As you know, the bill that was passed by the Senate risked giving  Russian energy firms a competitive advantage across the globe by  inadvertently denying American companies access to neutral third-party  energy markets where there would simply be a small or de minimis  Russian presence.   The bill before us today prevents Russia from being able to weaponize  these sanctions against U.S. energy firms. I want to thank Chairman  Royce for his hard work on this issue.   I also want to ensure that we have an understanding of the definition  of the word ``controlling'' in section 223(d) of H.R. 3364. For  purposes of clarification and legislative intent, the term  ``controlling'' means the power to direct, determine, or resolve  fundamental, operational, and financial decisions of an oil project  through the ownership of a majority of the voting interests of the oil  project.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, the young chairman, if he  agrees with that definition.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    I want to thank the gentleman for not only this  clarification, but making sure that we are most specific in what we are  undertaking.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the Shah Deniz Pipeline  and the Southern Gas Corridor projects will continue to be able to  bring gas from the Caspian Sea, which is a huge find, to our European  allies, reducing their dependency on Russian energy.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, and I would  thank him for his time on this colloquy.
