 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021,  as amended.   The Paycheck Protection Program has proven to be a successful rescue  vessel for millions of small businesses across the country. When COVID- 19 wiped out their operations, their plans, and their next steps, the  PPP provided stability and confidence to small businesses in a time of  darkness.   With over two rounds of funding, the program has provided 7\1/2\  million loans for approximately $687 billion. According to the SBA's  own statistics, the program assisted or saved roughly 50 million  American jobs from April of last year to August of last year.   This has been a monumental task for the SBA and the Department of  Treasury. However, more work needs to be done to ensure this program  can wrap up smoothly for small businesses and lenders.   Currently, PPP loans are facing lengthy delays as error codes force  multiple back-and-forth conversations between small businesses,  lenders, and the SBA. It is these cross-checks that are creating  uncertainty as to how the loans will proceed.   Complicating this even further, the PPP is set to expire 2 weeks from  tomorrow, and the SBA is reporting that the end date will prevent all  loans that are currently in the pipeline from being processed.                                time  1530    Under no circumstances should an American small business that applied  for a PPP loan have their loan discarded due to a bureaucratic  technical delay at the SBA. Simply put, if they completed their PPP  paperwork on time, their loans should be considered.   To correct this, H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension Act, provides a 30-day  exclusive window for the SBA to fully process and consider all PPP  applications that are received before the program concludes.   Additionally, given the current demand for the PPP and the billions  of dollars remaining within the program, H.R. 1799 extends the  application window for 60 days.   As a reminder, Congress reformed and replenished the PPP in December  with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, providing the program with  $284.5 billion. This funding should be reserved solely for American  small businesses and should remain available to them through a program  that is proven to be successful.   I thank Chair Velazquez for working in a collaborative manner with me  to ensure the program remains available to the hardest-hit small  businesses through May 31 and that the SBA will have enough time to  fully consider and address all error codes.   Additionally, I look forward to working with Chair Velazquez to  address other PPP issues in the coming weeks.   I applaud the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim) and the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux) for working efficiently and in  a bipartisan manner to address these issues that are creating  uncertainty across the Nation.   I urge and recommend all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1799, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.  [[Page H1376]]    Madam Speaker, through no fault of their own, small businesses were  forced to change how they operated in the face of COVID-19. Some  adapted; some had to change their product lines; and unfortunately,  some had to close.    As a response, Congress created the bipartisan Paycheck Protection  Program. Its impact and effectiveness have been instrumental to the  small business economy.   With technical difficulties plaguing applications and a fast- approaching deadline, H.R. 1799 provides a targeted, straightforward  approach to addressing these issues.   H.R. 1799 will extend the PPP for 60 days through May 31 and extend a  30-day exclusive window to the SBA in order to address all outstanding  PPP applications.   The program was always meant to be temporary assistance to struggling  small businesses. The PPP Extension Act will provide small businesses  and lenders the confidence they need while also creating a plan for a  smooth conclusion of the program.   As America continues to open up and recover, small businesses will  drive our economic recovery forward.   Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this bill  stands as one of the most impactful bipartisan pieces of legislation to  advance in Congress this year. I thank Chairwoman Velazquez for her  sincere efforts and hard work on this. I look forward to working with  her, on a bipartisan basis, on other issues for the remainder of our  term here. And I hope that this bipartisan product will serve as a  prime example of what can get done in Washington when both sides come  together and talk through the issues.   Madam Speaker, I recommend and urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1799, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
