 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the killings of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery catapulted the issues of racial justice,  police violence, and systemic racism to the forefront of this Nation's  conscience. These issues are not new. Some are even older than the  Nation itself. The anger felt by hundreds of thousands of protestors is  about that historical and pervasive injustice. It is rooted in our  decades-long failure to reform police departments and the yawning gap  between our ideal of equal justice under law and the reality of equal  justice for only some.   America is an experiment. The Founding Fathers said that. We know it  deep in our bones. An experiment means you can change, and some of the  best observers of the difference--I think de Tocqueville was one of  these--of America and the difference between us and other countries--we  are willing to change.   I am touched and moved--I was with the demonstrators on Saturday in  New York, in Brooklyn--by how many people were there--great diversity-- and how many were young and idealistic and doing things for just the  right reasons--not selfish reasons but for the betterment of the  country, to make us a more perfect union.   We must seize this moment. We cannot let it pass. This isn't about  simply renewing a national dialogue, although dialogue is always  important. It is about action. It is about making real and meaningful  progress. And the way to do that is with comprehensive police reform  legislation in Congress.   House and Senate Democrats have already drafted legislation that  would ban the use of choke holds and other tactics that have taken the  lives of Black Americans like George Floyd and Eric Garner; that would  also ban the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases, which is one of  the reasons for the death of Breonna Taylor; that would limit the  transfer of military equipment to police departments; and, crucially,  that would make it easier to hold police accountable for misconduct, as  well as institute several reforms to prevent that misconduct in the  first place.   The moment does not call for cherry-picking one or two things to do;  it calls for bold, broad change--whole-scale reform, not piecemeal  reform. I know the inclination of some of my Senate colleagues would be  to cherry-pick a few small improvements and say the job is done. It  will not be. We need to start--start--with the Justice in Policing Act,  a strong, comprehensive bill that people, particularly Senators Booker  and Harris, the CBC, spent a lot of time with experts who have studied  this issue for many, many months and years.   For too long, when major issues wash over the country, the waves of  change and progress crash against the rocks of a disinterested  Republican Senate majority.   When Americans watched in horror as another spate of mass shootings  rocked the Nation, they rose up and demanded change. President Trump  and Senate Republicans initially tried to make the right noises. Leader  McConnell promised that a debate on expanding background checks would  be ``front and center'' in the Senate after shootings in Dayton and El  Paso, but, predictably, that debate never came to pass.   That seems to be the M.O. of our Republican friends. When there is a  national crisis, major issues, people in the streets worried and  concerned and wanting change, we hear words, and then the strategy is  delay and, at the end, do nothing. We cannot go through these same  motions again.   This is about the original sin of America that we must try to deal  with head-on. There are Americans in the streets, shouting at the top  of their lungs for change, young people, idealistic people--the best of  America. The Senate must pursue comprehensive reform, not the lowest  common denominator and certainly not more empty rhetorical resolutions                            ____________________     Of course, there is another crisis in the country crying  out for action and leadership.  [[Page S2903]]    The COVID-19 pandemic didn't go away while the Nation rightfully  turned its eyes to issues of racial justice.   Yesterday, the United States eclipsed 2 million cases of coronavirus.  Another 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment this week. Federal  Reserve officials--sober, nonpolitical--are predicting that, best case,  we will end the year around 10 percent unemployment--a staggering  figure. One out of every 10.   The disease is spiking in a number of States around the country.  Arizona officials have warned that its hospitals could be filled by  next month. Texas has gone 3 straight days with record numbers of  hospitalizations. North Carolina, New Mexico, California, Oregon, and  several other States are experiencing a resurgence or peak levels of  COVID-19.   As the President continues to fixate on the stock market and Senate  Republicans are prematurely ready to declare victory, we need to wrest  the focus back to these crucial issues. So today I am requesting that  Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and other members of the administration's  Coronavirus Task Force conduct a briefing for Democratic Senators on  the recent spikes and do it next week. We need to understand why these  spikes are happening and how to adapt our national response.   The President--always interested in himself, not in the good of the  country--was too quick to sideline the Coronavirus Task Force, too  eager to pretend that everything was back to normal and better than  ever. The country needs Dr. Fauci on billboards, but the President  wants to put him on a milk carton.   The Vice President yesterday was photographed with campaign staffers  in a tight space, no social distancing, without anyone wearing a mask.  The very least the administration could do is lead by example and often  cannot even manage that much.   At the same time, we cannot forget that the issues of racial justice  and COVID-19 are intricately related. The COVID-19 pandemic  disproportionately kills Black Americans. Communities of color have  less access to quality healthcare, greater food insecurity, greater  percentages of poverty, and a disproportionate number of our frontline  essential workers--41.2 percent--are African American and Latino. The  majority of African Americans are renters and dedicate more than 50  percent of their income to rent.   The truth is, an emergency bill on COVID-19 is a racial justice issue  too. Hazard pay for essential workers is a racial justice issue too.  Healthcare is a racial justice issue too. Rent assistance and  forbearance from eviction is a racial justice issue too. These are all  items that must be discussed in another COVID relief bill, and it is  past time to get to work.   African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities are taking the  economic hit from the coronavirus on the chin, but Senate Republicans,  led by Leader McConnell, are reportedly unwilling to consider another  emergency relief bill until late July. How many more workers will lose  their jobs between now and late July? How many renters will be kicked  out of their homes between now and late July? How many State and local  government workers will lose their jobs, as State and local governments  meet their budget deadlines on July 1 and don't have the dollars to  deal with them? How many of them will lose their jobs? Waiting until  late July is callous, it is cold, and it is wrong for our economy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Republican majority seems to have a  whole lot of time to push rightwing judges. That is what they want to  do next week. And both of the judges that they nominate--to show the  hypocrisy of those who talk about wanting to help and compare it to  their actions, both of those judges have an antipathy to our healthcare  law. In the middle of a public healthcare crisis, the Republican  majority thinks they can get away with stuff like this, but they can't.  Americans are catching on. One of the nominees, Cory Wilson, has an  alarming record on voting rights in the middle of a national reckoning  on racial injustice, and you are all going to vote for him? This guy  has opposed voting rights, and you are going to vote for him. They  oppose healthcare. You are going to vote for them. And then they are  going to give nice speeches on how they want equality. The two have to  add up together                            ____________________     The Republican majority also seems to have time to chase  all of President Trump's wild conspiracy theories about how he was  wronged by law enforcement--the poor, beleaguered President Trump. My  goodness. That is what is happening in Judiciary today. Republican  Majority Leader McConnell can devote time to that, but they can't  commit to time on the floor about how Black Americans are being wronged  by law enforcement.   In order to bring a small appearance of fairness to this ridiculous  Judiciary Committee vote today, Democrats will be requesting subpoenas  for Trump campaign associates like Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, George  Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, among others. These men have at one  time or another pled guilty to offenses related to Putin's interference  in the election. Let's hear what they have to say, or should this be  just a one-sided kangaroo court to please President Trump?   If the Republican conspiracy caucus wants to waste the Senate's time  dredging up old conspiracy theories about the previous election, let's  at least get the straight story. Let's at least hear witnesses who  might have something different to say. This is not a dictatorship. This  is not how courts or hearings are supposed to work, I would say to the  Republican chairman, and it is beneath his dignity and the dignity of  the body to conduct such sham, kangaroo court hearings.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
