 Mr. Speaker, in that vein, some of us are here to  pontificate, and others of us are here to solve problems.    I rise today for those who have been the victim of this oversight.  From the period of 1993 to 2006, Americans filed for the consolidation  of student loans, not realizing that they may fall prey to an  unfortunate situation: domestic abuse; economic abuse; an unresponsive  partner; or divorce, which plagues 50 percent of this population.   Under the leadership of my friend and colleague, Congressman Price,  we have a solution. We have a bill, the Joint Consolidation Loan  Separation Act, which is bipartisan and which we should pass to help  people.   To those who have been victims--and I consider you victims--we offer  our extension of empathy, but we also offer our extension of a  solution. We have a good program here to allow you to reengage with the  Department of Education to make sure that you have fairness with your  loan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to come together to pass this bill.
