 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 22.   This morning, I listened very carefully to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle talk about this bill, many of whom I have great  respect for their expertise in energy. I have, however, heard terms  like ``political,'' ``political games,'' ``partisan.'' While this may  be their perspective, I wish for just a moment that we could transport  all of us to my district to see the perspective there, which is one of  great hypocrisy.   On the one hand, instead of utilizing the vast American resources we  cleanly produce, including in Utah, the President chose to use this  country's strategic reserve to try to lower prices.   On the other hand, in fact, the President did this while attacking  energy jobs in Utah by suspending energy development on Federal lands  and raising the royalty to produce oil, two contributing factors to  rising gas prices.   Not only did this release from the reserve barely make a dent in the  cost of gas and weaken our national security, but it also directly  strengthened our number one geopolitical adversary, China. Under no  circumstances should our reserve be used to fund our adversaries.   Regardless of our views in this Chamber on the use of the reserve by  the Biden administration, we should all agree our emergency supplies  shouldn't be sent to our adversaries.
