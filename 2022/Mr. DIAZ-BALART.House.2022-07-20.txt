 Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, let's be clear, this is not the time to  provide unilateral concessions to a designated state sponsor of  terrorism. This amendment is simply a bailout for the anti-American  terrorist regime of Cuba, a regime that brutally oppresses the Cuban  people and continuously undermines U.S. national security interests.   It aids adversaries such as Russia, the Maduro regime in Venezuela,  and terrorist groups such as FARC and ELN, just to mention a couple.   Remember, the law allows for unlimited quantities of food and  medicine and other basic necessities that are already allowed to be  sent and to be sold to Cuba. What we must not do is leave the American  taxpayers on the hook to subsidize the Cuban terrorist regime.   This is not the time to bail out an enemy of the United States, which  harbors fugitives from U.S. justice, which allows Russian spy ships to  dock in its waters, that ruthlessly oppresses the Cuban people,  imprisoning even children for just speaking out for freedom.   This amendment, by the way, would also ensure that American farmers  are not paid because we all know that the Cuban regime does not pay  back its debts. This would, again, put the American taxpayer on the  hook to help the Cuban regime.   Let's be clear, a vote against this amendment is a vote for freedom.  A vote against this amendment is a vote for the American national  security interests. A vote against this amendment is a vote for human  rights and freedom for the Cuban people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gimenez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
