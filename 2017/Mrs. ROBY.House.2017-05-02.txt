 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Let me say how grateful I am for the leadership of Chairwoman Foxx in  the Education and the Workforce Committee. She and her staff have been  instrumental in advancing this bill.   I also want to thank my friend, my colleague from Alabama, Bradley  Byrne, who serves as the chair on the Workforce Protections  Subcommittee. He has been a champion for commonsense policies in the  workplace, and I appreciate his hard work.   Mr. Speaker, today's workforce is more diverse than ever, especially  as it concerns working parents. More than 70 percent of mothers today  work outside of the home; and that is different from 50 years ago, when  that number was less than 30 percent.   But while the workforce has changed quite a bit, our policies and  laws that govern the workplace have not. As a working mom myself, I  understand all too well how challenging it can be to balance career and  family. Ask any working parent, and they will tell you just how  precious their time is. They will tell you that they just need one more  hour in the day to be able to take care of their family and all of  those responsibilities that come with it.   I always say, Congress can't legislate another hour in the day, but  we can update our laws to allow more choice and fairness in how  employees use their time. That is why I am proud to bring to the floor  H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does three important things: it removes  outdated and unnecessary Federal restrictions on the use of comp time  in the private sector; it provides flexibility for working moms and  dads who need more time to spend taking care of their family  responsibilities; and it demonstrates how commonsense conservative  principles can help Americans in their everyday lives.   Here is how it works: an hourly wage employee would be able to  voluntarily enter into an agreement with their employer to put a  portion of their accrued  [[Page H3041]]  overtime towards paid time off instead of extra cash. An employee could  simply use the time-and-a-half overtime that they earned to take a paid  hour and a half off of work instead of the extra money if that is what  they wanted.   Ask yourselves: Should a working dad be forced to use up all of his  vacation time in order to get involved in his child's school?   Should a military mom, with her husband deployed, have to dip into  her sick leave to make sure her kids have the support they need?   Should someone with aging parents who require extra care have no  option allowing them to devote more time and attention to their loved  ones when they need it most?   Under the Working Families Flexibility Act, those working moms and  dads could have the option of using their accrued overtime toward paid  time off, allowing them to take care of these responsibilities without  losing the paycheck that they count on.   Mr. Speaker, for anyone who works in the public sector, this comp  time system probably sounds familiar. That is because, since 1985,  government employees have had access to comp time benefits.   Why should the rules be different? If it is good enough for the  government employees, why is it not good enough for the private sector?   H.R. 1180 fixes this disparity by allowing for greater choice and  fairness over how workers use their time. I have sponsored this bill  for three straight Congresses now, so I am well aware of the criticism  from the labor unions and their allies. They try to say this bill is  somehow antiunion or antiworker. This is simply untrue. Of course, the  truth is, many Big Labor groups will reflexively attack any proposal  that would change a single word of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Ironically, labor unions themselves can, and often do, negotiate  similar agreements for their members already.   So I want to just go over a few of these criticisms quickly. Critics  of this bill, as has already been stated in this debate, will tell you  that it will somehow result in employees working longer hours for less  pay. That is not true. The decision to receive comp time is completely  voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payment for overtime  hours is always free to do so.   Workers can withdraw from a comp time agreement whenever they choose.  An employee who changes their mind or just can't work out with their  employer when to use compensatory time can say, ``You know what? I  would rather have the cash payments that I accrued in my overtime,''  and the employer must provide that within 30 days.   All existing protections in the Fair Labor Standards Act are  maintained, including the 40-hour workweek, and how overtime  compensation is accrued.   Critics of this bill also say that it will allow employers to control  when workers take their comp time. That is also not true. It is up to  the employee to decide when to use his or her comp time. It is their  time.   My time is running out. There are other myths, and I hope during this  debate that we will be able to go through what is myth, and what is  fact, and I am happy to address that at any time.   I want to thank again the chairwoman for her support, for her  willingness to move this bill through committee.   We have got big issues in this country to deal with right now: health  care, funding the government, tax reform. And as we continue to work on  those issues--and we will--nothing should stop us from doing what we  can right now to help make life a little easier for moms and dads. The  Working Families Flexibility Act does that by helping Americans better  balance the demands of family and work. After all, this is their time.    Mr. Speaker, in response to the gentleman's comments that  he just made, it is well worth repeating: this bill actually  strengthens protections for workers and increases penalties for abuse.  It contains in it strong anticoercion provisions.   We have to be factual about what is actually in the bill. This bill  prohibits an employer from directly or indirectly, as suggested by the  gentleman, trying to intimidate or coerce workers. Employers found to  have coerced employees would be liable to those employees for double  damages.   Of course, in response to the previous statements, all existing  enforcement remedies, including action by the U.S. Department of Labor,  are available to workers if an employer failed to pay cash wages for  overtime hours or unreasonably refuses to allow workers to use their  accrued comp time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I would like to point the gentleman to page 4  of the bill, in section 4, beginning on line 21: ``An employer that  provides compensatory time under Paragraph 1 to employees shall not  directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce or attempt to  intimidate, threaten, or coerce any employee for the purpose of . . .  '' And then it goes through ``requiring any employee to use such  compensatory time.''   If you turn to page 7 of the bill, under section 3, remedies,  subsection F, it directly addresses the damages.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say in addition: You are  saying that it is the same remedies under the current law. But you have  to remember, the cash-out provisions are also a strengthening of  employees' rights under this bill; that at any time that the employee  wishes to cash out, within 30 days, the employer must honor that and  provide the accrued overtime and cash wages.
