 Mr. Speaker, during the last few weeks, my office has  heard from literally hundreds of concerned Illinoisans about TrumpCare.   I have heard from a heart attack survivor, whose prescription  medication would go from affordable to $1,000 a day under this plan.   I have heard from Americans ages 50 to 64--I happen to be in that  group--who are worried about paying an age tax of five times more than  others.   Just in the last 24 hours, I have heard from two more groups that are  standing against TrumpCare. And, no, they are not partisan political  groups.   The first is the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, which  represents more than 200 hospitals in the State of Illinois. They  oppose TrumpCare because it means taking health coverage away from  hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans, while killing the jobs of another  60,000 hardworking people in my State.   The second group is the National Farmers Union. They understand that  TrumpCare's drastic cuts could force hundreds of rural hospitals to  close their doors.   So I am left wondering, who exactly supports TrumpCare? Instead of  throwing 24 million Americans off their coverage, let's work across the  aisle to improve health care for all, not just the richest among us.                            ____________________
