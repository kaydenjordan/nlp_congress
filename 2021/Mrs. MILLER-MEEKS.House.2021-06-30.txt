 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  an Iowa trailblazer from my district.   LaMetta Wynn, Iowa's first African-American female mayor, passed away  last week at the age of 87 in Lincoln, Nebraska.   LaMetta was an incredible woman who spent her life in service to her  community of Clinton, Iowa.   For 30 years, LaMetta worked during the day at Rock Island Arsenal  and night shifts as a registered nurse.   LaMetta's service as an elected official officially began when she  ran for Clinton School Board in 1983. For 12 years, LaMetta served on  the school board, eventually becoming board president, all while  raising 10 children.   In 1995, LaMetta was elected mayor of Clinton, a position she held  for 12 years before retiring in 2007.   In 1996, Newsweek picked LaMetta as one of the 25 most dynamic mayors  in the country.   Madam Speaker, I thank LaMetta for her service to the State of Iowa,  and I will keep her loved ones in my prayers.                            ____________________
