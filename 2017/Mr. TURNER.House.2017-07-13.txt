 Mr. Chairman, I join with Chairman Wittman in expressing  opposition to this amendment.   As he has indicated, the Navy has no indication that they have a  military requirement for icebreakers. Right now we are trying to  reverse the effects of sequestration. We are fighting against budget  cuts. When you use money for something other than what it was intended  for, it is a budget cut, and that is what this would be. No one is  talking about raising the top line of the overall defense budget, but  they are talking about using the funds otherwise for something that is  not defense.   I want to join with everyone who is speaking on this issue of the  importance of the Coast Guard and certainly its impact and certainly  the issues of icebreaking, but shipbuilding for the Navy and for our  military should be concentrated on our military. Certainly the funds  that we are appropriating to the Department of Defense should remain in  the Department of Defense, and, therefore, I rise with Chairman Wittman  in support of the opposition.                                time  1545    Mr. Chair, in closing, I want to say that--going to Admiral  Richardson's words--Admiral Richardson clearly states that the mission  of icebreaking is a Coast Guard mission. There is not a disagreement  there, but the disagreement is using resources that are within the  Defense budget in order to do that.   If you are going to put the responsibility for building icebreakers  and maintaining and operating them with the Coast Guard, yet you are  going to put the money in the Department of Defense budget where there  is no control, there is no oversight, that is a catastrophe waiting to  happen.   If this is going to happen, it should happen within the Department of  Homeland Security's budget or there needs to be a debate about where,  ultimately, the Coast Guard needs to be located. But to put money in  one area of the budget and expect that it is going to be managed  properly and applied properly with someplace where there is not even  jurisdiction, I think is problematic.   Again, it is clear where the missions are. It is clear where the  responsibility lies between the Homeland Security Department, the Coast  Guard, the Navy, and the Department of Defense.   I want to make sure we are building more cutters and icebreakers, and  if we are going to do that, let's make sure we do it in the proper way.  I think there are ways to construct language to make that happen, but  this is not the way to do it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
