 Mr. Speaker, on April 9, La Soufriere volcano on the  Caribbean Island of St. Vincent began a series of explosive eruptions.  The volcano has erupted several times since that date.   The eruptions have blanketed the island nation with clouds of  volcanic ash and hot gas and are so large that they have reached the  neighboring island of Barbados, 110 miles away. The eruption has  resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.   Electric outages, destroyed crops and forests, wildlife killed, and  water shortages are some of the immediate issues. The 16,000 evacuated  residents present dire health issues as people are moved to congregant  areas in a community that has had very little vaccination to date.   This natural disaster, along with other struggles brought on by  COVID, will cause St. Vincent and the Grenadines to struggle for the  next few years. It presents an opportunity for American action with  humanitarian disaster relief, support for COVID vaccinations, and  future technical assistance.   I am asking this body to use its influence and legislative actions to  support St. Vincent, to keep out China and its influence, along with  Venezuela, in support of our brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
