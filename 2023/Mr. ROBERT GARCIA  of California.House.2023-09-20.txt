 Madam Speaker, just last week on the House    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The American people deserve answers. Why did Jared Kushner receive $2  billion, with a b, from the Saudi Government just 2 months after  leaving the White House?   Here are the facts.   First, we know that Donald Trump's son-in-law was unqualified to work  in the White House, but Jared was placed at the heart of government  overseeing Middle East policy.   Kushner personally intervened to secure a $110 billion arms deal with  Saudi Arabia. He supported the Saudis through the brutal war in Yemen  even after they murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, who we all know  was an American resident.   The Saudi Crown Prince, shown here with Jared and Ivanka, reportedly  bragged to other heads of state that  [[Page H4415]]  Kushner was ``in his pocket.'' Jared delivered for the Saudis over and  over.   We now know today that when Jared left the White House just 2 months  later, the Saudi Royal Family gave $2 billion to the Kushner hedge  fund, and Jared pockets another $25 million per year in fees directly  from the Saudi's.   Now advisers to the Crown Prince said publicly that this made  absolutely no financial sense, and they pushed back, but the Saudi  Crown Prince went forward, and Jared Kushner is receiving that enormous  benefit to this day.   Madam Speaker, I have been calling out the Trump and Kushner crime  family for months, and we should not stop speaking out until we get the  investigation that we deserve. Americans need to trust that White House  officials are looking out for our national interest.   The Kushner-Saudi deal is the biggest corruption scandal right now in  American politics. We need subpoenas, investigations, and reforms so  that this type of grift never happens again.                            ____________________
