 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Women's Health Protection Act.   Nearly 50 years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed the right of every  woman to make decisions about her own life, her own body, her own  future.   Now that right is under horrible threat by a shameful and  unconstitutional law in Texas that bans abortion after 6 weeks of  pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant. That is a law  in defiance of the Federal law. It turns private citizens into snitches  to turn women in. That is reminiscent of the Third Reich. And if that  sounds staggering, it is because it is.   Every day, women in our country face deeply personal decisions of  whether to continue their pregnancies. They should be able to make  their own decisions, free from politicians' interference.   The Women's Health Protection Act is exactly that. It protects women.  It ensures that every woman has equal access to comprehensive  reproductive healthcare. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.
