 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a voice for the farmers and  ranchers of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District and our Nation.   I promised to listen to their concerns and their needs, find real  solutions, and serve their voice here in Congress. Today, I am proud to  stand before you as I introduce our very first bill, the Amplifying  Processing of Livestock in the United States Act. We call it the A-PLUS  Act.   This is our first bill, and as a member of the House Agriculture  Committee, I am dedicated to finding commonsense solutions for our  farmers and ranchers, whom I represent.  [[Page H472]]    The good people of Missouri have asked that we introduce this  legislation, which releases the livestock industry from unnecessary and  decades-old regulations.   The A-PLUS Act increases packer competition for livestock and meat  processing capacity at the local level. It fixes local supply chain  issues, and it supports small businesses.   I am committed to our farmers and our ranchers and will always serve  their voice here in Congress.                            ____________________
