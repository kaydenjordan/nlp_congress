 Mr. Speaker, just weeks into this administration, and  after endless promises of unity, the President has issued over 40  radical executive orders, ranging from rejoining a failed climate pact  to taking steps to dismantle the Nation's border security.   Governing via executive order, the administration has unilaterally  launched a coordinated assault on American energy and a war on  agriculture.   By revoking the Keystone XL pipeline project, the administration sent  more than 10,000 skilled workers to the unemployment line, disrupted  our safest and most efficient form of energy transportation, and  increased the cost of transporting grain for farmers and  agribusinesses.   The President also issued extremist moratoriums on new oil and gas  leasing and drilling on Federal lands, which only serves to increase  American reliance on foreign energy, eliminate good-paying jobs,  further stifle economic growth, and drive up the cost of fuel and  electricity for every American.   This backward agenda is sacrificing the energy independence  achievements made by President Trump and Republicans these past 4  years. Sadly, the Biden Democrat Party energy policy is putting America  last.                            ____________________
