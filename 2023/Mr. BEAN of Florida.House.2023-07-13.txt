 Mr. Speaker, how would you explain to General  George S. Patton that an American President believes a drag show  digital ambassador gives our military a strategic advantage?   It sounds absurd, but what is even more absurd is it is true.   The United States military is the greatest fighting force in the  world. America's warfighters risk their lives so we can all be free.  They are driven by patriotism and a sense of service and honor.   Yet, since the outset of this administration, we have seen our  servicemen and -women, the source of our strength and national  security, sacrificed on the altar of wokeness. Meanwhile, our  adversaries are aggressively undermining American interests around the  globe as danger knocks on our front door.   As we speak, Mr. Speaker, China is creating an outpost just over 90  miles from the Florida coast. It is all part of China's long game.   It is why they have been stealing our stuff, intellectual property  from Americans, buying farmland near our military bases, invading our  airspace with a spy balloon, and infiltrating our education system.   While this administration has been obsessed with culture wars, China  has been focused on defeating America.   While West Point was teaching cadets about preferred pronouns, China  has been focused on defeating America.   While this administration was funneling taxpayer dollars to host drag  queen story hours on military bases, China has been focused on  defeating America.   Our military exists to provide for the common defense of our Nation,  not parroting woke insanity. These far-left policies, Mr. Speaker, have  harmed recruitment, retention, and morale.   It has undermined our military readiness and wasted precious time and  taxpayer dollars, but House Republicans have a plan to chart a new and  different course.   The 2024 National Defense Authorization Act puts an end to taxpayer  dollars funding critical race theory teaching, guts diversity, equity,  and inclusion programs, and eliminates taxpayer-funded drag shows,  story hours, and digital ambassador programs. It prevents the  authorization of a military Green New Deal.   Under the leadership of Speaker McCarthy, House Republicans are  focused on honoring the legacy of our Nation's veterans, like the  72,000 who call the Fourth District of Florida home, and ensuring our  military is lethal and ready because woke politics won't stop a single  bullet or a communist invasion.   We, the people, deserve a military that doesn't cater to any other  credo other than America first.                            ____________________
