 I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute  to Denise D'Ascenzo, the longtime anchor at WFSB Channel 3 Eyewitness  News, the CBS station in Hartford, CT. She was a trusted journalist, a  devoted mother and wife, and a dear friend. Sadly, Denise passed away  suddenly on December 7, 2019. She will be remembered for her tireless  grace, integrity, and humor.   Denise was born Washington, DC, and grew up in Rockville, MD, where  she became editor-in-chief of her high school newspaper. She attended  Syracuse University, where she got her first break in television at  WIXT-TV doing the nightly weather forecast. Also at Syracuse, she met  the love of her life and future husband, Wayne. After Syracuse there  were stops at television stations in St. Louis and Cleveland, before  moving to Connecticut in 1986 to join WFSB.   In Connecticut, she provided special coverage of political  conventions, the U.S. visit of Pope John the II, 9/11, the arrest of  the DC sniper, and the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary  School. Denise had a passion for health and medical reporting, taking  viewers inside operating rooms, cardiac catheterization labs, and  neonatal intensive care units, as well as onboard Life Star, the  critical care helicopter service. She was a leading voice in raising  awareness for conditions such as breast cancer, heart disease, obesity,  and preventive healthcare.   During her 33 year career at WFSB, she was honored with 2 Edward R.  Murrow Awards, 7 Associated Press Awards, 11 Emmy's, and a national  Gabriel Award. She was recognized for her work with a number of  charities, including the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Mary's Place,  and the Channel 3 Kids Camp. In 2013, Denise was elected to the Silver  Circle by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for her  significant contributions to broadcasting. In 2015, she became the  first woman to be inducted into the Connecticut Broadcasters  Association Hall of Fame.   Connecticut has lost a broadcasting legend. We all also lost a dear  friend who came into our homes with dignity and decency to tell them  the news of the day. She was deeply dedicated to uncovering and  conveying the truth of every story. She was there for almost 30 years  to guide us through tragedy and triumph, and we miss her immensely.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Denise's  family during this difficult time, particularly to her husband,  daughter, and coworkers. May their many wonderful memories of Denise  provide them solace and comfort in the days ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dan  Freedman on the occasion of his retirement. Throughout his impressive  32 years as a correspondent in the Hearst Washington Bureau, Dan set an  example of tireless, honest reporting. He undertook the monumental task  of covering the Connecticut and New York delegations with rigor and  expertise. Even as the media environment grows more  [[Page S7205]]  partisan, Dan has remained fair and dedicated to the facts.   Dan has helped build an essential professional foundation for  countless reporters, mentoring hundreds of newcomers and interns and  holding everyone--including himself--to the highest standards. Regarded  with immense respect by his colleagues, he routinely challenged himself  in order to set a better example for his team and raise the  expectations for outstanding reporting.   In DC, legislators trust Dan to deliver a truthful and balanced  story. This integrity is essential for the people of Connecticut who  rely on reporters like Dan to inform them about the Nation's Capital  with a focus on the stories that matter most to them and their  communities. Constituents need to know their voices are being heard,  and Dan is there to ask the tough questions and to deliver the most  complete and honest reporting possible.   During an over four-decade career in journalism, Dan did it all-- everything from dodging bullets in wars and insurrections in Central  America to covering eight Supreme Court confirmation hearings and even  a stint on the George W. Bush Presidential campaign in 2000. His  unfailing commitment to his profession was recognized in 2018, when he  won the David Lynch Memorial Award for Regional Reporting. Dan's  outstanding record of thoughtful, honest, and determined reporting sets  a model and demonstrates the critical role of reporters in keeping  people throughout the country well informed.   I applaud his lifetime of dogged devotion to bringing the truth to  light through fair, fact-filled pieces, and I know my colleagues will  join me in thanking Dan for his extraordinary contributions to regional  reporting.                            ____________________
