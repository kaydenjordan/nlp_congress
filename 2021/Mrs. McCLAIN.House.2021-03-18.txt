 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I am absolutely  furious. Every single day, 5,000 new illegal aliens cross our southern  border. Every single day, more men, more women and children are  smuggled across our border and being trafficked. Every single day, the  drug cartels and human traffickers are raping and abusing our women and  children. One out of three of these women and children are being raped.   I ask the administration this: How is that not a crisis?   Madam Speaker, for almost 2 months, our Nation has refused to call  this a crisis, what is occurring at our border. You cannot solve a  problem unless you first admit there is a problem; and we have a  problem. This bill today does nothing to solve that problem or even  acknowledge that we have a problem.   We, as a Congress, need to say in unison: We have a crisis at our  border.
