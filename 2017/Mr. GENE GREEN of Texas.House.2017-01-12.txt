 Mr. Speaker, after years of attacking the  Affordable Care Act, Republican's repeal plan will have cold, hard  consequences for millions of Americans; not just the millions on the  insurance exchange, but also those of our constituents who receive  insurance through their employer coverage.   Beginning now, on a State-by-State basis, hospitals, doctors, patient  advocates, and faith groups will be stepping forward to express the  negative impacts of repealing the Affordable Care Act.   The Affordable Care Act has improved Americans' lives in the areas of  healthcare coverage, consumer protections, costs, and quality.   Millions will lose health coverage. The individual insurance market  will be in shambles. Hospitals in our States will lose billions and the  economy will be hurt.   Without health insurance, people with chronic diseases will lose care  and become sicker. Without healthcare coverage, people with chronic  diseases die.   It is bad for patients, budgets, and the healthcare system as a  whole. Every major law that has passed Congress needs to have oversight  revisions to make sure it is as effective as intended.   Congress can amend any law, but doing so in a way that will cause  millions of Americans to be without insurance is just wrong.   No repeal without a replacement.                            ____________________
