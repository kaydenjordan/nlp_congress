 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  outstanding educator Capri Salaam, the 2023 Arkansas Teacher of the  Year.   As a social studies teacher at North Little Rock Middle School, since  2015, Capri has become known for her innovative teaching practices, her  ability to connect with students, and her efforts to stay involved in  their lives even after they leave her classroom. She reflects her love  for education and her students in the unique ways she connects with her  class and engages with history. She also demonstrates extraordinary  compassion and support beyond her classroom by investing in their well- being, ensuring students have access to ACT preparation programs,  financial aid workshops, and tutoring programs in high school. As a  teacher to seventh and eighth graders, she appreciates seeing students  grow emotionally, physically, and mentally during this critical age as  they become young adults.   Capri's dedication to the field of education is not only evident in  her teaching styles, but also in her passion for continuing to learn.  In addition to receiving a bachelor of arts in English from the  University of Central Arkansas, Capri has a master of arts in teaching  in middle school education and a master of science in special  education. She is also working on earning a learning systems technology  education graduate certificate from the University of Arkansas at  Little Rock and is licensed to teach social studies along with English  and special education.   Outside of the classroom, Capri also continuously finds ways to be  involved in her community. She is a member of the Junior League of  North Little Rock and volunteers for Special Olympics, the Fellowship  Baptist Church Special Needs Clothes Closet, and the North Little Rock  Ole Main Clean-up.   Arkansas is fortunate to have an exceptional teacher like Capri  representing the many great teachers in our State, as well as serving  as a role model to future generations of educators. Capri demonstrates  what it means to go above and beyond for her students. I congratulate  her for this achievement and the positive impact she is making on the  community and the entire State. Her passion and commitment offer an  excellent example for others to follow. I am confident her efforts are  inspiring future generations in the classroom and beyond.                            ____________________
