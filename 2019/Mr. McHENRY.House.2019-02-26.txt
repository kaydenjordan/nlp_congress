 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 93.                             personal explanation     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the former chairman and the  ranking member for bringing this package today, and the bipartisan work  that we are advocating for here on the House floor.   I rise in support of this important bill for two reasons, two reasons  directly related to western North Carolina, where I am honored to  represent.   First, it has a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. This is a very important program that uses offshore  energy  [[Page H2215]]  resources to fund protected lands that are of national importance: our  rivers, our scenic byways, our lakes. Clean water in western North  Carolina, access to the great outdoors has been a great driver of our  economy, and LWCF has helped fund the preservation and protection of  those areas.   Second, I stand in support of this important bill because it  reauthorizes the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area.   These two pieces of legislation, the LWCF reauthorization, and the  Blue Ridge National Heritage Area, are two items that I have sponsored  independently of this package, and I am glad they are a part of this  resolution before us.   The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area ensures the preservation of the  unique cultural history of western North Carolina and provides access  to our land surrounding the Blue Ridge Parkway.   So those two important areas are just a small part of this larger  package that has been hammered out in a bipartisan way. I commit it to  my colleagues, and I ask for a ``yea'' vote.                                time  1745
