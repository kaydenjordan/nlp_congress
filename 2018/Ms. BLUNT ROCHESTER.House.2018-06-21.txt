 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to again vote against the partisan GOP farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, I traveled across my State and heard countless stories  from Delawareans of all backgrounds: farmers, emergency food providers,  and working families. I want to share one story.   During Kids Day at the Lewes Farmers Market, every child who attended  with a SNAP participant was given $5 in tokens to spend on fresh fruits  and vegetables. One boy, clutching his tokens, asked: ``Is this enough  to buy a peach?'' The organizers told the boy it was enough to buy a  whole basket. He looked up and said: ``Good, because I have never  tasted a peach.''   That is what the farm bill is about. It is about connecting people  from farm to fork.   This bill is too important for one party to go it alone. I hope my  colleagues will vote again against this bill so that we can get back to  truly working on a bipartisan farm bill that strengthens the rural  economy, our farm safety net, and ensures that all children have the  opportunity to taste a peach.                            ____________________
