 Madam Speaker, yesterday, I was honored to join Rosa  Parks' family, alongside Senator Gary Peters and local community  advocates, to rename the Grand River Post Office near her home in  Detroit the Rosa Louise McCauley Parks Post Office.   I am so proud to recognize the mother of the civil rights movement  and a beloved resident of our community in Detroit, Mother Rosa Parks.   It was truly a personal honor to partner with Mother Parks' family to  keep this freedom fighter's legacy alive in yet another powerful way.   I cannot wait for the child to walk in to see the name on the post  office and ask: ``Who was that?''   It was a privilege to lead this effort in Congress, with the support  of the Michigan delegation, to commemorate this incredible civil rights  leader.   As we know, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her  seat on a Montgomery bus to a White passenger. Her refusal was not only  an act of courage and a protest against racial segregation and  oppression, Madam Speaker, it was an assertion that our Black neighbors  deserved human dignity.   Her act of defiance ignited the Montgomery bus boycott, a pivotal  moment in the civil rights movement.   In 1957, Mother Parks left Montgomery, Alabama, to move to the most  beautiful, Blackest city in the country, the city of Detroit. She lived  there for nearly 50 years and served our community tirelessly as a  congressional staff member for the late Congressman John Conyers.   Despite efforts that we are seeing today around the Nation of those  who want to erase history leaders like Mother Rosa Parks, Dr. King,  Malcolm X, and so many others, we will continue to uplift those who  bent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.   Today and always, Madam Speaker, we stand on the shoulders of Mother  Parks and the countless others who fought for equality and justice for  all. I am inspired every single day by her bravery and strength. Her  legacy serves as a powerful reminder to every single one of us that,  with courage and determination, there is power to change the course of  our history.   May Mother Parks always remind us that we cannot remain silent when  we encounter injustice, discrimination, or racism, but that we must  always take a stand and speak out, even when our voice shakes, to  continue to build on her most beautiful movement to build a more  equitable, loving, and just world.   Madam Speaker, we know that our struggle against racism and white  supremacy is a lifelong pursuit. As Mother Parks wrote: ``Freedom  fighters never retire.'' As her memory continues to guide us, may her  legacy never die.   I am so grateful for the opportunity to honor Mother Parks alongside  the McCauley and Parks families and hope that the symbol of our  appreciation is felt by those who loved her.                                time  1030                  American Indian Health and Family Services     Madam Speaker, I was blessed to have grown up in southwest  Detroit. This is where over 20 different ethnicities live, and every  neighborhood has their own flavor in how they show up for each other.   This is why I am so grateful that I secured $1.5 million in funding  for American Indian Health and Family Services as they expand their  healthcare and mental health services to our families.   This healthcare center is tucked in a residential street between  homes where people can walk to get the services that they need.   Expanding their efforts will change lives in a meaningful way, and I  am so proud to have been part of that.                        Auto Insurance Discrimination     Madam Speaker, auto insurance discrimination continues to  keep our residents in a cycle of poverty. Your education level, your  ZIP code, and marital status doesn't determine your driving ability and  neither does your credit score. Yet our neighbors, especially in  Detroit, regularly face higher insurance rates--up to $5,000 per month  in some cases.   Someone with a perfect driving record and poor credit can pay up to  two or three times more than those with a higher credit score, even  with a driving under the influence violation.   We must stop these predatory and discriminatory practices by auto  insurance companies.   I am so grateful to partner with Congresswoman Watson Coleman and  Congressman Takano in introducing the Prohibiting Auto Insurance  Discrimination Act. This is how we can push back against corporate  greed and those that use proxies to discriminate.                            ____________________
