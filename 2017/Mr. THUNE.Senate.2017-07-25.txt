 Mr. President, today I recognize Devin Martin, one  of my Washington, DC, interns, for all of the hard work he has done for  me and my staff at the Senate Republican Conference.   Devin is a graduate of Huntley High School in Huntley, IL. Currently,  he is attending the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, SD, where  he is majoring in journalism and political science. Devin is a  dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most out of his  experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Devin Martin for all  of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the  years to come.                            ____________________
