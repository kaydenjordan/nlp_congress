 Mr. Speaker, it is not easy to summarize 32 years  in Congress, but I will try.   Politics comes from the Greek word ``polites,'' meaning citizens, and  they are the source of our country's strength.   What I remember most, what was especially meaningful, what made me  feel fortunate were the colleagues I served with, the people I worked  with, and the constituents we helped.   To my colleagues, thank you for your public service. You didn't have  to leave families behind or spend extra hours every week in a car or on  a plane, but you did it with a genuine desire to advance America's  worthy interests.   To my staff members, past and present, in the D.C. and Texas offices  and on the committees I chaired, thank you for your dedication and for  advising me on legislation and votes and for assisting thousands of  constituents.   To my constituents, thank you for trusting me to represent you all  these good years. It has been a wonderful honor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 5509) to direct the  National Science Foundation to provide grants for research about STEM  education approaches and the STEM-related workforce, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innovations in Mentoring,       Training, and Apprenticeships Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) To remain competitive in the global economy, foster       greater innovation, and provide a foundation for shared       prosperity, the United States needs a workforce with the       right mix of skills to meet the diverse needs of the economy.        (2) Evidence indicates that the returns on investments in       technical skills in the labor market are strong when students       successfully complete their education and gain credentials       sought by employers.        (3) The responsibility for developing and sustaining a       skilled technical workforce is fragmented across many groups,       including educators, students, workers, employers, Federal,       State, and local governments, civic associations, and other       stakeholders. Such groups need to be able to coordinate and       cooperate successfully with each other.        (4) Coordination among students, community colleges,       secondary and post-secondary institutions, and employers       would improve educational outcomes.        (5) Promising experiments currently underway may guide       innovation and reform, but scalability of some of those       experiments has not yet been tested.        (6) Evidence suggests that integration of academic       education, technical skills development, and hands-on work       experience improves outcomes and return on investment for       students in secondary and post-secondary education and for       skilled technical workers in different career stages.        (7) Outcomes show that mentoring can increase STEM student       engagement and the rate of completion of STEM post-secondary       degrees.       SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5509, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5509, the IMT Apprenticeships Act, was introduced  by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy with my support and that of the  ranking minority member of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee. It increases our STEM workforce and improves our national  competitiveness.   The IMT Apprenticeships Act directs the National Science Foundation  to fund initiatives that support innovative partnerships between  academic institutions and local industries. These programs combine  formal education with work experiences such as apprenticeships, pairing  local employers with the STEM industry.   This bill also requires the NSF to conduct research on market  analysis innovations and America's skilled technical workforce.   I would like to thank Leader McCarthy, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice  Johnson, and Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune for their efforts on  this bipartisan bill. The IMT Apprenticeships Act enhances America's  STEM competitiveness and contributes to our future economic prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 7) to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the  authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter  into leases of non-excess property of the Administration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                    S. 7         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NASA Enhanced Use Leasing       Extension Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO LEASES OF NON-                    EXCESS PROPERTY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND                     SPACE ADMINISTRATION.         Section 20145(g) of title 51, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``December 31, 2018'' and inserting       ``December 31, 2019''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 7, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act  of 2018 facilitates commercial access to NASA infrastructure and  facilities.   NASA's enhanced use lease authority gives NASA a crucial tool to  partner with the private sector. For instance, NASA used EUL authority  to lease SpaceX, the historic Apollo and Space Shuttle launch Pad 39A,  promoting the transition from all-government space activities to  commercial ventures.   I would like to thank Senator Roger Wicker for his initiative on this  bill which allows NASA to continue to implement this key authority  while Congress works out a long-term solution to NASA's use of excess  property.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2200) to reauthorize the National Integrated Drought  Information System, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2200         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

[[Page H10423]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on S. 2200, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2200 has broad bipartisan support, and I urge all  Members to support this legislation.   This bill reauthorizes and enhances priority NOAA programs,  especially the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act. The  Weather Act, signed into law by President Trump 2 years ago, already  has made tremendous advances in the accuracy and timeliness of weather  forecasting and the rapid integration of the private sector.   S. 2200 accelerates advances in model development and data  assimilation, increases the use of innovative computing technologies  and leasing strategies, promotes targeted research for the next  generation of weather satellites, and further engages the growing  commercial weather industry through reauthorization of the Commercial  Weather Data Pilot program.   I would like to thank Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune for his  leadership on this bill, which enables NOAA to protect lives and  property and advance the economy of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to  thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for all of her good  work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee over several  years' time.   I also want to express my appreciation to her for being instrumental  in the number of bipartisan bills that the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee has brought to the House floor. In fact, as of  today, 33 of the 35 Science, Space, and Technology Committee bills that  have passed the House floor have been bipartisan bills.   Ms. Bonamici has worked on any number of those bills to help make  sure that they are bipartisan, and to the extent that those bills have  been changed, they have been improved because of her input. So I really  want to thank her for her friendship over the years and for her  contributions on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee over the  years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from Oregon for those very  nice comments. They are much appreciated.   I also want to take just a minute to thank the ranking member of the  full committee, Eddie Bernice Johnson, my colleague and friend from  Texas. We also would not be here without her effort over the many, many  years and her help in making sure that 33 of the 35 bills that the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee has passed on the House floor  were, in fact, bipartisan.   I also want to congratulate her on being the next chairman of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee. I know she brings a lot of  intelligence and a lot of commitment and will do great work on behalf  of the country as chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
