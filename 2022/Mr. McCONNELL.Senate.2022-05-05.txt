 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in Albany, NY, a grandmother of four  reported recently that rising prices have forced her and her husband, a  retired New York police officer, to cut back on eating out. ``I feel it  in the pocketbook,'' she said.   In Grand Rapids, MI, one young family reported that, before inflation  took off, ``the paycheck went a little bit further.'' Now, on  essentials like gas and groceries, ``there's no wiggle room.''   In Springfield, MO, a food truck owner said that he and his wife are  having to take business farther and farther from home despite gas  prices.   Stories like these aren't exceptions; they are the rule. Working  Americans have been absolutely swamped by rising prices.   Two-thirds of Americans told one recent survey that inflation has  been difficult or even a hardship for their families. Fewer than one in  five says the Biden administration's policies have done anything to  improve economic conditions, and yet, as we speak, with the economy  already scuffling, Washington Democrats are proposing more reckless  spending and the biggest tax hike in American history. For example,  President Biden is considering trying to buy up his sinking approval  ratings by magically waving away $1.6 trillion in student loan  obligations.   So let's put a few things into perspective.   More than a third of Americans did not pursue education beyond high  school. Of the Americans who did receive additional schooling, barely  one in four holds any student debt at all. In fact, an outright  majority of the $1.6 trillion in Federal student debt is held by  professionals with advanced degrees.  [[Page S2344]]  Working people who chose to avoid taking on debt should not have to  bail out high-earning doctors, lawyers, and dentists or adults who  borrowed six figures for an Ivy League master's.   President Biden wants to effectively funnel money away from people  who decided to learn a trade, away from people who chose community  college, away from people who made tough sacrifices to actually pay off  their loans in order to buy more enthusiasm from one of the Democrats'  loudest and farthest left constituencies. Young liberal professionals  with elite degrees and massive earning potential get a giant handout,  and working people in rural America get the bill.   As one scholar from a left-leaning think tank puts it:         Almost a third of all student debt is owed by the       wealthiest 20 percent of households [while] only 8 percent by       the bottom 20 percent.    He concludes:         Student debt is concentrated among high-wealth households,       and loan forgiveness is regressive whether measured by       income, educational attainment, or wealth.    Even among the small slice of Americans who do have some student  debt, the majority owes less than $20,000. Ah, but the senior Senator  from Massachusetts has proposed a cap that would cover debt up to 2\1/ 2\ times that amount. She is laser focused on giving the future lawyers  and future doctors of Cambridge, MA, this massive gift before this  November.   You literally have Democrat State attorneys general writing the  administration, demanding the Federal government ``exercise its  authority to cancel federal student loan debt for every [single]  borrower.''   Student loan socialism would be a giant slap in the face to every  family who sacrificed to save for college; to every graduate who paid  their debt; to every worker who made a different career choice so they  could stay debt-free.   Now, a little more than a year ago, President Biden was saying:         I don't think I have the authority to do it by signing with       a pen.    Speaker Pelosi affirmed that view, saying:         People think the president . . . has the power for debt       forgiveness--he does not.    Even the former general counsel at the Obama Education Department  concluded:         The Executive Branch likely does not have the unilateral       authority to engage in mass student debt cancelation.    But, apparently, lackluster poll numbers have the President  considering breaking the law and plowing ahead anyway.   So think about this very concretely. Democrats want construction  workers, police officers, and small business owners in Kentucky to  effectively eat the student loans of surgeons, corporate lawyers, and  people in New York City who chose to borrow $180,000 for a master's  from the Columbia film school, with no plan whatsoever for paying it  back.   In addition to making inflation even worse across the board, this  jubilee for the elites would do nothing to combat runaway costs in  higher education. Mindless subsidies would just make the runaway costs  even worse. I would like to see one single Democrat visit the working  people in Kentucky and defend this proposal with a straight face.    Democrats' policies already have working Americans facing the worst  inflation in more than 40 years as well as the risk of a recession. But  instead of trying to help middle-class families, Democrats are cooking  up massive bailouts for Ivy League graduates. You can hardly dream up  something more unfair.
