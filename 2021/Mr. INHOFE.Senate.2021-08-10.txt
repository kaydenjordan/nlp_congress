 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3331 and ask  that it be reported by number.    My friends, the amendment--my amendment--is designed to  protect a very small population but a very significant population: the  babies with Down syndrome.   Over two-thirds of the unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in  the United States are aborted. Some countries, like Iceland, are  eradicating their entire population of individuals with Down syndrome  through abortion.   Now, I think we agree that an individual should not be discriminated  against due to his or her chromosome count.   This is not partisan. It is not extreme. Seventy percent of  Americans, including 56 percent of pro-choice Americans, oppose  abortion on the basis of a Down syndrome diagnosis.   This amendment uses the budget mechanism to help protect the most  vulnerable among us and who are being systematically targeted through  abortion.    I urge my colleagues to lay aside their party differences  and think about the lives and the lives--    I ask for the yeas and nays.
