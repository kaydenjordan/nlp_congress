 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   On January 27, 1945, Auschwitz was liberated by the Allied forces.  The camp enslaved 1.3 million people during the Nazi regime.   Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the 6 million Jewish  victims and the millions of other innocent lives lost. We support the  survivors who bore witness to this tragedy. Their scars endure. We  refuse to forget the hate that led to this unspeakable tragedy.   As new generations of Americans come of age, the lack of knowledge  and understanding surrounding one of the greatest crimes in human  history deepens. Across the world, we are witnessing a resurgence of  anti-Semitism.   We hear dangerous and destructive lies that deny the Jewish  experience. We see more hatred in our discourse and more violence in  our communities. We see five people attacked while celebrating Hanukkah  and 11 worshippers murdered at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.   Today, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, we honor and  remember the victims of the Holocaust, and we reaffirm our fight  against this evil.   Today, on this Holocaust Remembrance Day, I urge my colleagues to  vote in favor of H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, so that we  can hold true to the promise of ``never again.''
