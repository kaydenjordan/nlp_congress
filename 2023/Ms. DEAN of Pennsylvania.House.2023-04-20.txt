 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor exhausted  and fearful--fearful for women who watch every month as their rights  are stripped away, fearful for my daughters-in-law, my granddaughters  and yours as we deal with the fallout of the Supreme Court's Dobbs  decision, removing decades of freedom, privacy, and dignity.   After the Dobbs decision, we warned that other freedoms would follow.  Now, a Texas Federal judge is openly undermining the FDA; a Federal  judge, not a doctor. Control and cruelty is the point, and they are  only getting started. Today, it is an abortion drug. Tomorrow, it is  IUDs or hormonal implants, then birth control medications. All of these  things, which are used to prevent pregnancy or end one, are lifesaving  medical tools that can treat a  [[Page H1890]]  variety of painful, devastating conditions, including miscarriages.   Judges have no right to overrule the personal and professional  choices of women and their doctors. Politicians have no right to take  options and freedoms away.   I trust FDA's 23-year approval. Mostly, Mr. Speaker, I trust medical  professionals, and I trust women.                            ____________________
