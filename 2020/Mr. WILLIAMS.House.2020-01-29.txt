 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3621.   As a business owner and lender, I know firsthand the value that  complete and accurate credit reports have in making sound business  decisions.   For any business that relies on financing, risk-based pricing is  essential in order to offer each customer the lowest rate possible.  Every time a deal is broken, the cost gets passed along to the next  customer.   Your handshake is worth something. When you are trying to get a loan,  people need to know that your signature is worth something as well.   In Texas, a deal is a deal, and you must always live up to your end  of the bargain. For those customers who have been financially  responsible and always paid their debts on time, they are rewarded with  lower rates. For those borrowers who have not paid their debts on time,  financial institutions are forced to price in this inherent risk.   Whether a person is buying a car, a private jet, or a cow, the lender  needs to be paid back in order to be able to continue offering lines of  credit to responsible people in their community.   Mr. Chair, I am concerned that this bill would take us down a path  where lenders are receiving incomplete credit reports that have been  scrubbed of all negative information. In other words, hiding  information results in greater risk for the lender. This would make  borrowing money more expensive for all customers since financial  institutions will have a worse picture about who will be able to repay  their debts and who will not.   Again, I remind you we say and always should remember: A deal is a  deal.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
