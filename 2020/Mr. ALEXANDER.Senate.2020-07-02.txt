 Mr. President, it is my honor to be here today to see  a marine Presiding Officer and a marine making a speech.   We are grateful for Senator Sullivan's service to our country and his  service in the Senate as a diligent, patriotic, hard-working, good- humored Member of the Senate. I am glad I had a chance to hear his  remarks.  [[Page S4201]]    I was trying to think of where in the world to go on my 50th  birthday, and I went to Anchorage, AK, to go fishing at Halibut Cove. I  had a wonderful time and have a great memory. So the Senator represents  a really terrific State.    Mr. President, just 3\1/2\ months ago, a sneaky,  dangerous virus turned our country and the world upside down. It is  hard to believe that it was just 3\1/2\ months ago--mid-March--that we  were headed toward March Madness in basketball; that our economy was  roaring; that unemployment rates for about every category were as low  as they had been in a long, long time. America felt really good about  itself. By the time we would have gotten to the Fourth of July, it  would have been a terrific celebration except that here came this  dangerous, sneaky virus that turned our lives and those in countries  all over the world upside down.   I want to comment this afternoon on some aspects of where we are in  terms of COVID-19 based upon five congressional hearings this month  that I have either chaired or attended in our HELP Committee or the one  I participated in today in Senator Blunt's Appropriations Committee on  Health. Of course, Senator Murray, of Washington State, is the ranking  Democrat on both of those committees.   Of course, much of the talk is about vaccines. Even though we have  appropriated $3 trillion and another astonishing $3 trillion in credit,  that is not going to really solve the problem. The only cure for this  disease, this virus, will ultimately be through testing, treatments,  and vaccines. It is appropriate that we talk about vaccines because our  country is moving more rapidly than it ever has in producing a safe and  effective vaccine for a new virus.   As Dr. Francis Collins--the head of the National Institutes of  Health--told our subcommittee this morning, it usually takes,  historically, 5 to 10 years to create a vaccine. Here, the goal of the  administration's warped speed effort to create a vaccine is to have 300  million doses ready by the first of this coming year--in other words, 6  months from now. That is its aspirational goal. The administration is  not sure it will get there, but you don't get anywhere if you don't set  high goals. We know that as a country. So it has set an enormously  ambitious goal.   We are taking steps that are like none we have ever taken before,  such as Congress has appropriated money, has approved, and is starting  to build a manufacturing plant for a vaccine before we know that it  works. Now, we don't do that before we know that it is safe, but we  will do it before we know that it works. We can be sure that, in some  cases, we are going to lose that money, but it is better to cut 6  months or a year off of the amount of time before the vaccine comes and  take that financial risk. I think all of us would agree with that.   Instead of talking about vaccines today, which are next year's  solution, let me talk about two aspects of COVID-19 that are this  year's solution--in fact, that are this fall's solution. One is  diagnostic tests to find out whether you have the disease or not, and  one is treatments, which is medicine that can be given to you to reduce  the chance that you might be seriously ill or will even die.   That is appropriate in the first place because, in not very many  weeks, America will be headed back to school and to college. In Metro  Nashville, TN, public school begins on August 4. All across the  country, most colleges and schools will be back in business by Labor  Day. There were 75 million students who were casualties of COVID-19.  They were sent home from school or college in mid-March--100,000 public  schools, 35,000 private schools, and 6,000 colleges. Graduations were  canceled. Sports championships and once-in-a-lifetime events were  canceled.   In our country today, two-thirds of married parents with children  work outside the home, and most single parents work outside the home.  Suddenly, their children were home. Teachers were not really prepared  for such wholescale remote teaching, and parents were not prepared for  homeschooling. So ever since mid-March, students have been in limbo.   We are looking forward to doing whatever we can to help make sure  that those 75 million students in schools and colleges can go back to  school and college this fall and go back safely. That is the importance  of tests and treatments. That is the first.   Now, there is another one, and it is not trivial. This is a sports- hungry country. We love our sports, and everybody has a different sport  one likes. The question I asked Dr. Collins this morning was: Are we  going to have enough COVID-19 tests so we might be able to watch some  football this fall or some basketball this winter? I had read that the  National Hockey League was going to test every player every day in the  National Hockey League.   It is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. It is not standard for there to be widespread testing at  schools and colleges, even though the president of Brown University  told our committee she would like to test all students on their way  back to Brown.   The fact is, if we are going to be able to go back to school, back to  college, back to work, out to eat, maybe even watch a sports game,  maybe even, in some cases, attend a sports game, we are going to need a  lot more quick, reliable tests. Let me talk about those, just for a  moment, in terms of going back to school and going out to eat and,  perhaps, being able to watch a little football this fall.   Admiral Giroir testified this month before our committee that our  country has done 30 million tests--more than any other country. We are  doing that at about the rate of 500,000 tests a day, and he says that  we will have four to five times that many in September.   Now, I hear about problems in this place or in that place about  people not getting tests or that it takes too long for the results to  come back from the labs. The fact is, that what is going on now is  every State in the country is developing a plan for July through  December on how many tests States like Indiana, Tennessee, and Alaska  might need in working with the Federal Government, and the Federal  Government has been supplying Tennessee with what Tennessee needs.    In our State, for example, which is 1 of the States that is in the  top 10 of having frequent testing, the Governor has said: If you want a  test, you can have a test. Go down to your public health department,  and you will get one for free. Now, whether they will be able to  continue that, we will see, but that is what we are doing today.   Despite that, when 75 million students try to go back to school and  college, I imagine principals and administrators will want to test  teachers frequently, older people frequently, and everybody in some  classes if one student gets sick, maybe everybody in an elementary  school if several students get sick, and maybe the parents and  grandparents of the children if the children bring home the disease. So  we are going to need a lot more tests.   This is why Senator Blunt and I and others worked together in the  last legislation to support what we called the shark tank at the  National Institutes of Health. This was an unprecedented effort at the  National Institutes of Health, led by Dr. Francis Collins, who led the  Human Genome Project and is one of the most distinguished scientists in  our country.   This is a project to see if we can find a new way to create tens of  millions of diagnostic tests that are what they call point-of-care  tests. That means you can take them instantly; that you can get a  result within an hour or so; and that they are inexpensive and  reliable. You don't have to ship them off. You would probably do this  with saliva. So you might put a lollypop in your mouth and let that  saliva on the lollypop indicate, one way or another, whether you have a  positive or a negative result.   Dr. Collins' goal--and he said this is a very aspirational goal--is  to be able to produce a million of those tests a day by Labor Day. This  would change our lives in many numbers of ways. This would mean that  Brown's president could surely test all students, not just once when  they go back but more often. It would mean many sports teams could test  every player every day if that is what it required.   It would mean that we would probably have more tests than we would  need.  [[Page S4202]]    What would that do?   It would, one, help to contain the disease so we could identify who  has this disease so we could quarantine them and the people they have  exposed instead of quarantining all of us and keeping us from going  back to school, out to eat, and going to work.   It would contain the disease, and it would build confidence. If you  are working in a plant with 500 people and you know that 6 people have  had to be tested because they had been tested and were found to have  been positive, you are going to worry about that. Yet, if you know that  you could get a free test today and any time you wanted and could get  the result in an hour, I believe you would have more confidence in  going to work or in going to school or in going out to eat or even in  playing on a football team whether you are in college or in high  school.   So we are pulling for Dr. Collins' shark tank and his effort to  produce these new ways of testing. They have had an unprecedented  outpouring of applications. He said most of them come from smaller  companies. They are down to 26, I believe is the number, and they are  putting them through this rigorous test. His goal is a million new  tests a day.   That is important for principals to know and teachers to know and  those who are hoping to play a little football and watch a little  basketball this fall--that there might be plenty of quick, reliable  tests to help contain the disease in your community and to be confident  that you are in a safe place.   And then what is the second thing we could expect?   We heard about treatments. As Senator Kennedy says in his inimitable  way, people aren't scared of the virus because they are afraid they  might get sick; they are afraid they might die. And they might,  particularly if they are in a vulnerable population or older age.   There is no medicine for this virus, or at least there wasn't until  recently. Now there is one, Remdesivir, which the United States has  bought a huge amount of, which has been shown to reduce by 32 percent-- according to Dr. Fauci, who testified at our hearing yesterday--reduce  by 32 percent the amount of time it takes you to recover from COVID-19.  According to the experts who testified, there are other plasma  medicines and steroids that have shown to be helpful. That exists  today.   So if you are a parent or a grandparent or a teacher or administrator  worried about children going back to school, you are probably not very  worried about the children catching COVID-19 because, generally  speaking, they haven't seemed to get sick from COVID-19--all around the  world. It has been older people who do. But the children might come  home and bring it to the parent or the grandparent. As I said, this is  a sneaky, dangerous virus. You can give it to somebody without showing  any symptoms of having it. But if you get it, there are already two or  three treatments that your doctors, your hospital can prescribe to  shorten the time that you recover and to reduce the chance that you  might die.   Dr. Collins said that by the time we get to the fall, he expects  there will be more of these treatments approved by the FDA. There are  different kinds of treatments, and he didn't go into all the specifics,  but one kind he mentioned was the so-called antibody cocktail. This was  developed during the time of Ebola, and it was approved by the FDA. It  helped us get rid of the Ebola disease before it came to the United  States and caused a lot of trouble here.   This antibody cocktail--``monoclonal antibody'' is the longer name of  it--is not approved yet. It is not proved to be safe or effective yet,  but because it was once before, there is a cautious optimism that it  will be approved for COVID-19--a version of it--and that those will be  ready by the fall.   If it does work out that this treatment is safe and effective and  approved by the Food and Drug Administration, there are several  companies that have these antibody cocktails, and they should be able  to manufacture large numbers of them.   I guess my point is, we talk a lot about vaccines. We spend every day  hearing about the deaths, the hospitalizations, and what is going on,  and this spike or that spike, but as we think about 75 million students  going back to school and college, going back to work, whether we will  see some football or maybe basketball later, the two aspects that are  needed to determine that are tests and whether the shark tank will  produce enough of them and treatments, and both seem to have a good  possibility of being there for us in the fall.   We had a hearing last week that focused on this question: How do we  sustain what we have built in this pandemic? In fact, one Senator  lectured me a little bit and said: Why are we worrying about the next  pandemic? We are in the middle of this one.   And my answer was, because for the last 20 years, we forgot about the  last pandemic as soon as it was over, and then we got to the next  pandemic, and we weren't as ready as we should be.   We have had four Presidents and several Congresses that passed nine  laws to try to get us ready, and then here comes this sneaky, dangerous  virus, and we find some gaps in our preparation. It is not President  Trump's gap. It is not President Obama's gap. It is our gap because we  didn't do some of the things we should do.   One of the things I believe each of us should do in this Senate is be  willing this year, this summer, to take the lessons we have learned and  sustain what we built, not just to complete our work on this pandemic  but to be ready for the next one.   For example, do we have enough manufacturing capacity for the  vaccines in the United States? Well, we didn't. Now we are building it.  Are we going sustain it?   No. 2, what about our stockpiles? We filled them up, and then they  were depleted--the stockpile here, the stockpile in the States.  Hospitals needed money. They sold off their stocks, and so they were  depleted. We have now built them up, but are we going to sustain that  for the next pandemic or just say: OK, we beat COVID; let's go and  worry about something else.   What about data? We are not getting all the data we want in the way  we should be getting it from the Centers for Disease Control. Are we  just going to forget that, or are we going to do something about that  now?   Hospital preparedness. Hospitals weren't really ready. They did a  magnificent job of getting ready, but we lagged on hospital  preparedness. We have built that up again. Are we going to sustain it,  or are we going to let it drop off once more?   Our State and local public health. Almost all of our public health  efforts in this country are State and local. We are not a small  European country where everything is centralized. We are a great big,  complicated, diverse country where parts of Indiana are very different  from parts of Tennessee and Alaska and New York or wherever we are  from, and as Governor Leavitt, who testified before us, said, for 30 or  40 years, we have gradually disinvested in our public health system. We  are not building that up, but are we going to sustain it?   So that is my hope, that when it comes to building up this  manufacturing capacity here in the United States, increasing our  stockpiles to the levels they should be, beginning to collect the data  in the way it needs to be, preparing our hospitals to receive patients,  building up our State and local public health--are we going to sustain  that while we have our eye on the ball, or are we going to do what we  have done for the last 20 years and slide off into a short memory?   Senator Bill Frist, who was majority leader of this body, said that  he made 20 speeches in 2005 and 2006 about what we needed to do to be  prepared for the next pandemic, which he said is surely coming. They  did some things, but most of the things that he said needed to be done  weren't done. We could do them today if we would just have the resolve  to do them.   Governor Leavitt said that before a pandemic, those who do what he  and Senator Frist did, which was to say we need to do all these things,  are called alarmists, and then after a pandemic or in the middle of it,  they are called inadequate to the task.   Then there is the last point I would like to make, and it is about  politics. The COVID-19 virus--this sneaky, dangerous enemy--is a  science matter, not a political matter, but it has become too much of a  political matter.   Take the issue of masks. We have gotten into a situation where  whether  [[Page S4203]]  you wear a mask depends on your attitude toward President Trump. For  many Americans, it seems that if you are pro-Trump, you don't wear a  mask, and if you don't like Trump, you do wear a mask.   I suggested that the President might occasionally wear a mask just to  signal to his followers that it is a good idea; recommended by every  single health expert to wear a mask--certainly for the protection of  everybody else.   Another way to say it is that our athletic director at the University  of Tennessee, Phillip Fulmer, said: If you really, really want to watch  some football, wear a mask. What he means by that is that it would help  contain the disease in our area so the football players can play  safely.   Well, yesterday the President made it clear. He said masks are good,  and he is happy to wear them when he needs to. Of course, the fact is,  he doesn't need to most of the time. He is tested every day. People  around him are tested. And--as I am not wearing one right now--he is  speaking most of the time. But there are times when I wear my mask.  When I leave the floor, I wear the mask. When I go back down the hall,  I wear the mask. When I am in a smaller room, less than 6 feet away  from somebody, I wear a mask, and I expect others to do that as well.   Every expert who testified in the six hearings I attended this month  said there are three things to do: Wear a mask, wash your hands, and  stay 6 feet apart when you can. If all of us do those things, we are  much more likely to be able to go back to school, back to college, back  to work, out to eat, and maybe even watch a little football.   Vanderbilt University did a survey in the middle of May, and what  they found was surprising. Most of the attitudes of people in Tennessee  weren't about male versus female or east versus west or any other  difference; it was about Republican or Democrat. Republicans didn't  want to wear a mask very much; the Democrats mostly did. Republicans  were eager to go out to eat; Democrats were a little slower.  Republicans weren't as worried about catching the disease; Democrats  were pretty worried. The debate got too politicized.   I thank President Trump for what he said yesterday. He has 70 or 80  million people as his social media followers. If they get the idea that  wearing a ``Make America Great Again'' mask is good for the country, I  bet millions will wear it. If they do, the country will be safer, the  economy will be better, and we will be able to go back to school and do  the other things we want to do.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  my opening statement from our hearing yesterday   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Opening Statement     COVID-19: Update on Progress Toward Safely Getting Back to Work and                       Back to School--June 30, 2020         All of our witnesses today are participating in person, and       some senators are participating by videoconference.        I'd like to say something about masks:        The Office of the Attending Physician has advised that       senators and witnesses may remove their masks to talk into       the microphone since our chairs are all six feet apart.        So that's why my mask is off--because I'm six feet away       from everyone else. But like many other senators on this       committee, when I'm walking the hallways or on the Senate       floor, I'm wearing a mask.        People wear masks because the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention advises the use of ``simple cloth face       coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who       may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to       others.''        Unfortunately this simple lifesaving practice has become       part of a political debate that says: If you're for Trump,       you don't wear a mask. If you're against Trump, you do. That       is why I have suggested the president should occasionally       wear a mask even though there are not many occasions when it       is necessary for him to do so. The president has millions of       admirers.        They would follow his lead. It would help end this       political debate. The stakes are too high for it to continue.        Around here, senators and staff wear masks--because we       don't want to make each other sick. I was exposed to COVID-19       by a pre-symptomatic staff member on my way to Dulles Airport       and, as a result, self-quarantined for two weeks. The senate       physician told me one reason that I did not become infected       was because the staff member was wearing a mask and that       greatly reduced the chances of exposure.        It's also a pretty good way to make a statement. I like to       wear my plaid mask. Dr. Fauci uses his mask to demonstrate       his loyalty to the Washington Nationals. Senator Kaine is       either a cowboy or a bandit.        If you want college football to return this fall, like I       do, listen to the words of Coach Fulmer at the University of       Tennessee who told fans how they can help make that happen:       ``If you really really want sports, football, and all those       things, then wear a mask and keep social distancing,'' he       said last week.        The United States is in the middle of a very concerning       rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in many states,       and the experts in front of us today have told us that       washing our hands, staying apart and wearing a mask are three       of the most important ways to slow the spread of the virus.        I am grateful to the Rules Committee, Sergeant at Arms, the       press gallery, the Architect of the Capitol, the Capitol       Police, and our committee staff, Chung Shek and Evan Griffis,       for all of their hard work to help keep all of us safe.        Among the casualties of COVID-19 are the 75 million       students who were sent home from schools and colleges in       March.        Add to the casualties the teachers who weren't prepared to       teach remotely and the working parents who suddenly had       school children at home and who weren't prepared to home       school. Add the lost sports seasons and once in a lifetime       graduation ceremonies. Then there were unprecedented dilemmas       for administrators and inadequate school budgets. Being sent       home from school does not rank with the sickness and death       the virus has caused. The United States has over 2.5 million       cases of the virus and over 126,000 deaths according to Johns       Hopkins University.        While states and communities continue to take action to       help keep people safe, nothing was more disruptive to       American life--and nothing would head it back toward       normalcy--than for those 135,000 public and private schools       and 6,000 colleges to reopen safely this Fall.        Earlier this month this committee heard from college       presidents and school leaders about their plans for safely       reopening this fall. This hearing is an opportunity for an       update and to hear from the nation's top health experts on       how headmasters, principals, superintendents, chancellors and       college presidents can open their schools safely just a few       weeks from now.        This committee last heard from today's four witnesses on       May 12, when three of the four were quarantined and most of       the senators participated virtually. That was one of the       first virtual senate hearings in history and surely the best       watched virtual hearing. Every network carried the two and       half hours of statements and questions and answers from       senators.        The question before the country today is not about whether       to go back to school or college or child care or work, but       how to do it safely. Even though COVID-19 has not, in       general, hurt young children and college-age students nearly       as much as older or more vulnerable Americans, there is some       health risk. But in my view the greater risk is not going       back to school.        Guidance for reopening schools from the American Academy of       Pediatrics tells school administrators: ``the AAP strongly       advocates that all policy considerations for the coming       school year should start with a goal of having students       physically present in school.''        The American Academy of Pediatrics adds: ``The importance       of in-person learning is well documented, and there is       already evidence of the negative impacts on children because       of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away       from school and associated interruption of supportive       services often results in social isolation, making it       difficult for schools to identify and address important       learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or       sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal       ideation. This, in turn, places children and adolescents at       considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.       Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school       closures, there has been substantial impact on food security       and physical activity for children and families.''        Dr. Lloyd Fisher, the incoming president of the       Massachusetts chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics       told reporters last week: ``While for most children COVID-19       has not had the devastating and life-threatening physical       health effects that have occurred in adults, the negative       impact on their education, mental health and social       development has been substantial,'' he said. ``Nothing can       take the place of the daily face-to-face interaction our       children experience when attending school in person.''        Many American colleges--overall considered the best in the       world--will be permanently damaged or even closed if they       remain, in Brown University president Christina Paxsons       words, ``ghost towns.''        Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue, wrote in a       Washington Post op-ed that for Purdue, ``failure to take on       the job of reopening would be not only anti-scientific but       also an unacceptable breach of duty.''        So today, in addition to hearing more about the concerning       rise in cases and hospitalizations in some states in the       U.S., I would like to ask our witnesses in their statements       and answers to questions to put themselves in the place of a       superintendent  [[Page S4204]]       of one of America's approximately 14,000 school districts, or       the principal or headmaster of one of the 135,000 schools, or       the president or chancellor of one of the 6,000 colleges, and       help them answer the question of how to reopen schools       safely.        So Dr. Fauci, I hope that in your opening statement or in       answers to questions you will suggest the steps a       superintendent might take to open school safely, and how not       only to keep children safe but to keep safe the adults--      teachers, parents and grandparents--with whom they come in       contact.        Dr. Hahn--Will there be treatments or medicines this fall       that will help speed recovery from COVID-19 or reduce the       possibility of death? I believe the fear of going back to       school--or going anywhere these days--is in large part       because of the fear of severe illness. If that risk can be       lessened by new treatments, it should increase confidence in       going back to school.        I'd also like to commend Dr. Hahn and the work FDA did to       get tests on the market as quickly as possible to help       understand the spread of the virus. Since then, FDA has       worked out which tests have not worked as well as they       should, and taken steps to remove them from the market.       That's what is supposed to happen during a pandemic.        Admiral Giroir--at our last hearing you said you expected       there to be 40-50 million diagnostic tests available each       month by September. Is that still true? And exactly how does       a school district go about making sure it has those tests?       And who pays for them? What are the prospects from the       ``shark tank'' at NIH that there will be new fast,       reliable and inexpensive tests available for more       widespread testing?        Dr. Redfield--you are continuing to work on additional       guidelines about going back to school and college safely. Are       CDC employees available to help states work with school       districts or college administrators to develop their plans?       And what advice do you have about the arrival of the flu       season this fall at the same time as COVID-19?        This is a lot to discuss but there will be time during the       next two and half hours to answer most of those questions.        Let me highlight three areas that have come up in our four       earlier hearings this month that I think need clarification.        First, contact tracing. There is no doubt contact tracing       is crucially important to identify anyone who might have been       exposed so that person doesn't, in turn, expose someone else.       According to an NPR report on June 18, states already have       hired at least 37,000 contract tracers. State health       officials and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security issued       a report estimating a need for at least 100,000 contact       tracers.        Several reports have suggested that the federal government       should appropriate funds to pay for these contact tracers.       The reality is: Congress already has.        On April 24, Congress appropriated $11 billion, which has       been sent to states and tribes for the expenses of testing.       The legislation explicitly said that money could be used for       contact tracing. This is in addition to the nearly $755       million from the first emergency appropriations legislation       signed into law March 6 that went out to states for       coronavirus response and can be used by states for contact       tracing.        This is also in addition to the March 27 legislation in       which Congress provided at least $1.5 billion in the CARES       Act for states, territories, and tribes to use for COVID       preparedness and response, some of which can be used for       contact tracing. The CARES Act also included $150 billion to       states, but a significant amount of that $150 billion has not       been spent because it is restricted to expenses related to       COVID-19.        For example, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has told me that       he is reserving as much as $1 billion of what Tennessee       received so he can determine what flexibility he has in       spending the money. Washington state has not spent as much as       $1.2 billion. According the Missouri State Treasurer,       Governor Parsons has not spent about $1 billion.        According to the report by state health officials and Johns       Hopkins, an average salary for a contact tracer would be a       little more than $35,000. That adds up to about $3.5 billion       for 100,000 contact tracers. So Congress has already sent to       states enough money to hire all the contact tracers that are       needed.        Second, who pays for testing. In the CARES Act, Congress       voted to make all COVID-19 tests available to patients at no       cost. That meant insurers would cover diagnostic tests, which       detect whether a person is currently infected with the virus,       and also antibody tests, which indicate whether a person has       had COVID-19 in the past and now may have immunity to future       infection. Guidance from the Labor Department, the Treasury       Department, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid       Services last week said insurers are only required to pay for       tests without patient cost sharing if a doctor orders it. I       agree with that.        But given that the CDC specifically recommends doctors       order tests in 2 situations--when a person has signs or       symptoms of COVID-19, or recently had contact with someone       known or suspected to have COVID-19--who pays for testing at       other times?        I believe Congress will need to take further action. For       example, if a school wants to test its students randomly,       perhaps that school should coordinate with their state to       become a part of the state testing plan, making all tests       free to students and teachers. Congress may need to provide       more money to states to cover that.        If an automaker wants to test all its employees at a plant       every two weeks, perhaps the automaker should pay for that       testing or become part of a state testing program using funds       already provided by the federal government.        Third, flu shots. CDC has said more people need to get flu       shots this fall so health care workers can better distinguish       between COVID-19 and the flu. CDC says a priority is for all       children over the age of 6 months be vaccinated for the flu       so they don't become sick and pass it to more vulnerable       populations who could have more severe consequences.        On January 24, Sen. Murray and I hosted our first       bipartisan briefing on coronavirus at a time there were only       4 cases in the U.S. Since then this committee has held 4 more       briefings. This is our 8th hearing on coronavirus and U.S.       preparedness.        Last week's hearing was about steps to take this year,       while our eye is on the ball, to better prepare for the next       pandemic. I have issued a white paper outlining five       recommendations for Congress to prepare Americans for the       next pandemic, and that paper has received more than 350       substantive comments that are available to every member of       the committee.        At the end of this hearing, I'm going to ask each witness       what are the 2-3 actions that Congress could take this year       to prepare for the next pandemic, some of which undoubtedly       could help with this pandemic.        But this hearing is about what happens now as       administrators prepare to reopen schools and colleges.        Experts underestimated this virus and there is still much       we don't know about it. But we do know the basic steps to       take to reopen schools and colleges in 2020 before there is a       vaccine and those are: social distance, wear a mask, wash       your hands, test, contact trace, and isolate those exposed or       sick. And hopefully by the fall there will be treatments to       make the consequences of the disease less severe.        I look forward to hearing from our distinguished witnesses       how school leaders and college presidents can safely reopen       135,000 schools and 6,000 colleges, and also learning the       latest developments on testing and treatments that we can       expect during the year 2020 before vaccines arrive.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Blunt and Senator  Murray for their cooperation this month in this series of six hearings  that we have had on COVID-19.   I think it is very important for the American people to know that  while there is a vaccine down the road, the tests are coming, the fast  tests, and the treatments are coming. They should be here by the fall.  That is what the experts say. It is not what I say; that is what the  experts who testified before us say.   The experts all said the following: If you want to contain the  disease, if you want to go back to school and back to college and back  to work and out to eat and maybe even see a little football, stay 6  feet apart, wash your hands, and wear a mask.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
