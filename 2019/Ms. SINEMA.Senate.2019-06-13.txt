 Mr. President, I rise today regarding the U.S. Senate's  passage of S. 1749, the Protecting Affordable Mortgages for Veterans  Act, by unanimous consent. The Protecting Affordable Mortgages for  Veterans Act aims to preserve access to affordable VA mortgages for the  millions of veterans and brave men and women in uniform in Arizona and  around the country.   Last year, Congress passed S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, a bipartisan regulatory relief  package for community financial institutions. Among other issues, this  package sought to crack down on ``mortgage churning,'' a predatory  practice wherein lenders push veterans over and over to repeatedly  refinance their home, even when there is no clear benefit to doing so.  With each refinance, the lenders take a fee. Veterans, on the other  hand, enter into a cycle of debt where fees and interest rates cost  more than the initial mortgage payments.   To stop these predatory lenders and the practice of churning, S. 2155  put into place new requirements that must be met in order for a  refinanced loan to obtain VA guaranty and securitization from Ginnie  Mae, the U.S. Government corporation that helps lenders make more  affordable mortgages to veterans, first-time home buyers, and low- income borrowers.   Unfortunately, these new requirements were inconsistent with Ginnie  Mae loan seasoning requirements. With implementation of reform, the new  rules left approximately 2,500 VA-guaranteed loans ineligible for  Ginnie Mae pooling, a move which seriously constrained lending.   The unintended consequence of this measure put VA home loans out of  reach and threatened to drive up future borrowing costs. The Protecting  Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act would correct this issue and  maintain liquidity in the veteran home loan market so that veterans and  their families can secure the safe, affordable housing they deserve.   When they return home, veterans who defend our freedom with dignity  and honor should receive the thanks of a grateful nation and  opportunities to succeed as they transition to civilian life. That  means delivering quality care at the VA, improving job and education  opportunities, and ensuring affordable housing is within reach for  Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Acclimating  to civilian life is challenging enough without the threat of being  scammed by predatory lenders.   I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Tillis, for  working with me over the last several weeks to craft this bill. I also  want to thank Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, Chairman Isakson,  and Ranking Member Tester for their steadfast support in moving this  fix expeditiously. Even in an era of divided government and historic  gridlock, we are getting things done for Arizona.   Now that this legislation has passed the U.S. Senate, I urge my  colleagues in the House to quickly pass S. 1749 so it can be signed  into law. Let's keep working together, Democrats and Republicans, to  stand up for our veterans.   Thank you.                            ____________________
