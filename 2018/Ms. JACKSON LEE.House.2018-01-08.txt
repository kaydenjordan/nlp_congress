 Mr. Speaker, freedom is not partisan.   Yesterday, on the corner of Post Oak and Westheimer in Houston,  Texas, I stood with Iranian Americans, linking arms with them as they  protested and petitioned for a free and democratic Iran. I told them  that the cries of hunger and economic needs, and the cries of young  people who wanted freedom in Iran were my cries, and that we believed  in democracy, freedom, and peace, and that we would not leave them  alone.   So, again, I say to them: We stand not as Democrats and Republicans,  but as Americans, wanting for a free government that allows the  people's voices  [[Page H8]]  to be heard, and that despotic governments have no place in a society  that relishes and thirsts after freedom.   I want to thank the law enforcement officers who stood by in the  cold--yes, the cold in Houston--and allowed for a peaceful protest in  this time of honoring them a national law enforcement commemoration.  Again, I want to thank them, for they go to places where they are  needed and they allow democracy to reign. I will say democracy will  reign in Iran, and Iranian Americans are not alone in their quest for  freedom, democracy, and peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Evans for  the mighty leadership that he has given and for the service that he  gives to his constituents in Philadelphia. I accept his challenge, and  I accept the challenge of my chairman, Cedric Richmond, who told a  story that hopefully will be an inspiration and a guide for all of  those who believe that they are not yet mature enough to serve, to  give, to offer to the beloved community that Dr. King so aptly speaks  of.   What can I say about John Lewis, whose moral guidance, but whose  bloody brow, was never bowed. I thank Congressman Lewis not only for  the straight talk but the loving talk. To my colleagues who are here, I  know that each will have a moment, so allow me to take just a moment to  be able to offer my tribute and commemoration of Dr. King's life. What  a powerful year we face in 2018, and I am so grateful to have left  2017.   I believe that this gives a fresh look to America. I looked at the  movie ``Remember the Titans,'' and maybe you saw that with Denzel  Washington, and it reflected a racial conflict with football players  just outside of Washington in Virginia. It is a moving story of how  when you get young people together, we can break the chains of racism  and differences. It brought tears to my eyes, because in 2017, we went  that journey again, and I was hoping that we would come in this year,  the commemoration year, to accept Dr. King's challenge of a beloved  community.   I salute my community of Houston. Some say there was no civil rights  movement, and I beg to differ with them. Dr. King came one time, and  the clergy gathered, most of them gathered, those who were afraid; we  know that most were not. They were all ready to have a big rally, and  wouldn't you know it, a bomb threat. But our Houstonians were ready to  march and to be out front in spite of the fear of a bomb.   I believe that every community that Dr. King was either invited to or  that he went to, there were people of courage who were willing to stand  up and embrace freedom in the face of devastating potential disaster.   So let me just say that my greatest claim for this legacy is my fight  as a  [[Page H12]]  younger person to be part of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. It will be my greatest honor to have been able to work for  the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to walk in that office on  Auburn, that I believe may not be to meet Ralph David Abernathy because  it was after the death of Dr. King, to know James Orange, and to know  the brother that walked with the wooden leg, and to know Andy in a way  that they were still engaged in Dr. King's work.   I am reminded of the message that he has given to us. And as Chairman  Richmond said, he was young, and he asked the question: ``Life's most  persistent and nagging question is''--he said--``what are you doing for  others?'' And I think we as members of the Congressional Black Caucus  and the adjunct of the foundation that works for young people, we have  no doubt in what we are doing for others.   But Dr. King gave us the words: ``I would like somebody to  mention''--as he talked about his death on February 4, 1968, this is  what we should be doing in 2018. We should be talking about what we are  doing in commemoration. ``I would like somebody to mention on that day  Martin Luther King, Jr., tried to give his life serving others.'' And  he said: ``I want you to say on that day''--that I might have lost my  life--``that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.''   So as I close, I want to remind those of us who have not yet made our  journey to something that brought us closer to Dr. King that this body,  this group of Republicans and Democrats, this administration, we need  to unshackle ourselves. This question of race needs to be thrown under  the bus of the beloved community. And we need to be able to dream like  Dr. King did and say--but he learned to use his imagination when he saw  this separation and his dreams to see right through those ``White  Only'' signs--to see the reality that all men and women, regardless of  our place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal.  What a visionary.   And so I close with his braveness in two points: his answer to the  question about who are we as a nation and what this citizenship should  mean. And he simply turned us back to the Declaration of Independence  and said that we simply should have citizens who can live out the words  written in the Declaration of Independence that have a place in this  Nation's Bill of Rights. We simply want to be like others.   And he took this courage to his death, for at the end of his life, he  was not ashamed to go to Riverside Church and stand against the Vietnam  war while others looked aghast, afraid. Why are you stepping out of  your box? Dr. King said: I believe in the beloved community, a dreamer  with works and actions.   And so I close in that faithful journey that he made that we will be  commemorating all converging in Memphis, Tennessee, and the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees who were forged and  born in the shadow of two sanitation workers who were killed in the  line of their duty, and Dr. King felt compelled to be there.   When do we feel compelled: on the tax bill, on CHIP, on fully  qualified healthcare, on affirmative action? When are we taking this,  in essence, to the mat? Because that is what Dr. King did. He took it  to the mat. And he went to the mat in the face of violence, and he told  us, in his last words, that he had been to the mountaintop. He had seen  the promised land. And he did not know if he would get there someday,  but he knew that we as a people would pine away to that pathway.   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, next Monday, January 15, the nation observes for the  33rd time the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday.   Each year this day is set aside for Americans to celebrate the life  and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to America.   The Martin Luther King Holiday reminds us that nothing is impossible  when we are guided by the better angels of our nature.   Dr. King's inspiring words filled a great void in our nation, and  answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by  its noblest principles.   Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough just to talk the talk; he  knew that he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible.   And so we commemorate on this holiday the man of action, who put his  life on the line for freedom and justice every day.   We honor the courage of a man who endured harassment, threats and  beatings, and even bombings.   We commemorate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom  for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his  leadership, but kept on marching and protesting and organizing anyway.   Dr. King once said that we all have to decide whether we ``will walk  in the light of creative altruism or the darkness of destructive  selfishness.   ``Life's most persistent and nagging question,'' he said, is ``what  are you doing for others?''   And when Dr. King talked about the end of his mortal life in one of  his last sermons, on February 4, 1968 in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist  Church, even then he lifted up the value of service as the hallmark of  a full life:         I'd like somebody to mention on that day Martin Luther       King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others,'' he said.       ``I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life .       . . to love and serve humanity.    We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  was, above all, a person who was always willing to speak truth to  power.   There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King's moral integrity and  consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War being waged by the  Johnson Administration, an administration that was otherwise a friend  and champion of civil and human rights.   Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15,  1929.   Martin's youth was spent in our country's Deep South, then run by Jim  Crow and the Ku Klux Klan.   For young African-Americans, it was an environment even more  dangerous than the one they face today.   A young Martin managed to find a dream, one that he pieced together  from his readings--in the Bible, and literature, and just about any  other book he could get his hands on.   And not only did those books help him educate himself, but they also  allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic experiences  of blatant discrimination, and the discriminatory abuse inflicted on  himself, his family, and his people.   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we celebrate here today  could have turned out to be just another African-American who would  have had to learn to be happy with what he had, and what he was  allowed.   But he learned to use his imagination and his dreams to see right  through those ``White Only'' signs--to see the reality that all men,  and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their  creed, are created equal.   Through his studies, Dr. King learned that training his mind and  broadening his intellect effectively shielded him from the demoralizing  effects of segregation and discrimination.   Dr. King was a dreamer and his dreams were a tool through which he  was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society,  and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red and  brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and prosper.   But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was not an idle daydreamer.   He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join  in his nonviolent effort to lift themselves from poverty and isolation  by creating a new America where equal justice and institutions were  facts of life.   In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote,  ``We hold these truths to be self evident, that all Men are Created  Equal.''   At that time and for centuries to come, African-Americans were  historically, culturally, and legally excluded from inclusion in that  declaration.   Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' Speech,  delivered 54 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each  citizen of this great nation that we still hear today.   His request was simply and eloquently conveyed--he asked America to  allow its citizens to live out the words written in its Declaration of  Independence and to have a place in this nation's Bill of Rights.   The 196os were a time of great crisis and conflict.   The dreams of the people of this country were filled with troubling  images that arose like lava from the nightmares of violence and the  crises they had to face, both domestically and internationally.   It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and  the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Malcolm X,  Presidential Candidate Robert Kennedy, and the man we honor here today.   Dr. Martin Luther King's dream helped us turn the corner on civil  rights.   It started when Dr. King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, with 4, Rosa  Parks and others,  [[Page H13]]  which lasted for 381 days, and ended when the United States Supreme  Court outlawed racial segregation on all public transportation.   But the dream did not die there.   It continued started with a peaceful march for suffrage that started  in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965--a march that ended with violence at  the hands of law enforcement officers as the marchers crossed the  Edmund Pettus Bridge.   Dr. King used several nonviolent tactics to protest against Jim Crow  Laws in the South and he organized and led demonstrations for  desegregation, labor and voting rights.   On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City, he spoke out  against the Vietnam War, when he saw the devastation that his nation  was causing abroad and the effect that it had on the American men and  women sent overseas.   When the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King was stolen from us,  he was a very young 39 years old.   People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few can remember  why he was there.   On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a  strike by the city's sanitation workers.   The garbage men there had recently formed a chapter of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better  wages and working conditions.   But the city refused to recognize their union, and when the 1,300  employees walked off their jobs the police broke up the rally with mace  and Billy clubs.   It was then that union leaders invited Dr. King to Memphis.   Despite the danger he might face entering such a volatile situation,  it was an invitation he could not refuse.   Not because he longed for danger, but because the labor movement was  intertwined with the civil rights movement for which he had given up so  many years of his life.   The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never  overshadow his life.   That is his legacy as a dreamer and a man of action.   It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace.   It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled.   I hope that Dr. King's vision of equality under the law is never lost  to us, who in the present, toil in times of unevenness in our equality.   For without that vision--without that dream--we can never continue to  improve on the human condition.   For those who have already forgotten, or whose vision is already  clouded with the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the  immortal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:         I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the       sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders       will be able to sit down together at the table of       brotherhood.        I have a dream that one day even the State of Mississippi,       a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering       with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an       oasis of freedom and justice.        I have a dream that my four little children will one day       live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color       of their skin, but for the content of their character.        I have a dream today.        I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its       vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping       with words of interposition and nullification--one day right       there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be       able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as       sisters and brothers.        I have a dream today.        I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted,       every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough place       will be made plain and the crooked places will be made       straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and       all flesh shall see it together.    Dr. King's dream did not stop at racial equality, his ultimate dream  was one of human equality and dignity.   There is no doubt that Dr. King wished and worked for freedom and  justice for every individual in America.   He was in midst of planning the 1968 Poor People's Campaign for Jobs  and Justice when he struck down by the dark deed of an assassin on  April 4, 1968.   It is for us, the living, to continue that fight today and forever,  in the great spirit that inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
