 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and sincere  gratitude that I rise today to recognize Lane Lofton.   A Mississippi native, Lane grew up in the South with his parents,  Lynne and Bill Lofton, and his brother and sister, Will and Lydia  Lofton. Not ready to part with his Southern roots quite yet, he  attended Samford University in Alabama, where he began his life in  politics.   Lane moved from the Alabama district operations for House  Representative Bobby Bright to D.C. in 2009. It was probably the best  move ever because it was in Washington that Lane met and married the  love of his life, Anna York Lofton. They both have immense love for  their two French bulldogs, Duey and Shirley.   After nearly a decade of service in government relations, Lane  interviewed to be my chief of staff about 2 years ago. I remember it  like it was yesterday. It was at the end of a very long day of  orientation, and he was the last interview of the day. I remember  saying to myself after he left that we must have saved the best for  last. Either that or it was a long day and I was overly tired and  easily impressed, although I firmly believe that it was the former.   The fact is that there is no one else I would rather have by my side  over these last 2 whirlwind years than Lane Lofton.   Together, we entered the 116th Congress with the Nation's longest  government shutdown and ended it with a global public health and  economic crisis. But no matter the problems at hand, Lane worked  diligently every single day to support our office as we passed landmark  legislation, fostered relationships across the aisle, and then  sometimes he just reminded me to fix my tie.   A tried and true public servant, Lane has always put the needs of  others first, especially the 20-person office that he managed. That  team can attest that, every single day, even when Lane had a bad day,  he never showed it. He came to work every day with an ear to listen, a  voice of reason, and a smile on his face. He sets an incredible example  of selflessness in the work that he takes on, and he has been an  invaluable mentor for our younger staffers.   I look forward to watching the future successes that Lane will find  in his personal and professional life. I think that his next challenge  will be one of his biggest because Lane and his wife, Anna, will  welcome their first son in February. I could not be more excited to  watch their young family grow.   Welcome to the No Sleep Club, Lane, and welcome to finding a level of  love and devotion that you did not know you were capable of.   From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your service to the  Lowcountry and for becoming a lifelong friend.                            ____________________
