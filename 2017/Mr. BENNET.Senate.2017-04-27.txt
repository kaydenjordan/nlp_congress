 Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I just want to  say, while the Senator from Arizona is still here, what a privilege it  is to hear somebody come to this floor and actually speak about facts  as they actually are--economic facts, facts related to immigration. If  we had more people in the Senate who spoke on the floor the way the  Senator from Arizona just did, there is nothing we wouldn't be able to  accomplish together. It is a privilege to serve with him. It is a  privilege to hear the clarity with which he spoke about these important  issues. So I want to thank him through the Chair for that speech.
