 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado  for hosting the Special Order.   I will also tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is actually good to be able to  talk in this Chamber without that thing on my face. It is messing up  the enunciations.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have talked at length about all of the  examples and all of the damaging aspects of cancel culture, and I don't  want to go through and reiterate those points.   I think the purpose--what I want to take this time to do, Mr.  Speaker, is to actually have a pleading with the people of our country.   You see, if you look at the history of world governments, even go  before our own Government, the ability to speak has been sacrosanct in  order for the ability to be free.   You see, there was a time, under the brutality of European kings,  where you could dare not speak a word against the Crown. If you did,  you were slaughtered, you were maimed, you were put into chains, you  were put into slavery.   The very idea of freedom of speech canonized in our Constitution just  wasn't created by our Framers; it is something our Framers understood  and they studied from their view of world history. And that very  protection is the one thing, the most paramount thing, that the Members  of this body, whether they be in our House, the Senate, or the person  who occupies the White House at any point in time in American history,  can never abridge or infringe.   The reason for that is very simple: Because the thoughts that roll  around in your mind are yours alone. They are your thoughts. They were  given by God. They were given by your own intellect. And your ability  to express them should never be taken away or shamed by a government or  by a sect or a substructure of any society, let alone American society.                                time  2000    You see, Mr. Speaker, we have come to a very dangerous point in our  politics. This has nothing to do with Social Security and Medicare  which, by the way, for the American people, are going to go insolvent  in somewhere between 5 and 7 years.   This isn't about our issues talking about guns and supporting the  Second Amendment. This isn't about if you want to talk about green  technology or embracing fossil fuels or actually embracing nuclear  power, which is what we should be doing as a country. This isn't our  views on what we do with respect to foreign policy and who our  adversary might be.   This goes to the very core of our country. It goes to the very core  of our culture. It goes to the very core of whether our society will  have the ability to sustain itself for another 200 years into the  future.   But I will promise you this, Mr. Speaker, it will not be possible if  we have one group of Americans telling another group of Americans that  what they say should no longer be heard simply because they don't agree  or even if they are offended or even if what somebody says is so vile  that unilaterally every American finds it to be distasteful and doesn't  want to hear it.   You see, the very thought of any individual must be protected at all  times. It is what separates our country from the other countries of the  world today and the other societies on our Earth in years past. It is  what creates the very foundation of a republic of people to be able to  grow, to see, to do, to be their best, because they are free, and there  is no government that can oppress them.   The only example I am going to cite tonight is the example of  somebody who is actually not on my side of the political aisle. She is  a reporter, Alexi McCammond. And Alexi, just so you know, I am not  bringing your situation up to make a political point. Far from it. You  see, she was a journalist. She was on MSNBC and an NBC contributor. I  don't think she would probably like my politics too much. But because  of something she said when she was a freshman in college on social  media, she was targeted. She was canceled. She had reached a pinnacle  in her career through her hard work. I don't even know her, but I know  that she was able to accomplish something. But because somebody in her  company, because of somebody at Teen Vogue decided they didn't like  what she had said, she became the new target.   Mr. Speaker, and frankly, my fellow Americans, we cannot continue as  a society if we are quick to shut each other down before we actually  decide to open up our ears and listen. There are so many debates on  this very floor that are going to take place, not just in this  Congress, but in many Congresses to come. There are going to be  disagreements in our society, whether you are talking about policing or  racism or the past or the future, but the one thing that must remain in  our Republic is tolerance.   You see, Mr. Speaker, we have to adopt a standard; not a subjective  one, but an objective one. But here is the truth: We already have had  that standard. We have already adopted it. It is the objective standard  that you are free to speak in the United States of America. And whether  it is Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram or YouTube or Snapchat or TikTok,  or The Washington Post or The Washington Times, whether you want to  talk about The  [[Page H2191]]  New York Times or you want to talk about redstate.com, you want to talk  about MSNBC or FOX News, Morning Joe or Sean Hannity, we must be free  to speak at all times because the battlefield of ideas is the only  thing that is going to propel our Republic forward. It is the only  thing that is going to allow young kids to grow and actually increase  their intellect and to be able to transform our economy in ways that  none of us in this Capitol today can even fathom. It is the very basis  of what makes our Nation the greatest nation. It is what makes us  unique. It is what allows us to be able to fight it out every day on  this floor, verbally, of course, Mr. Speaker.   My fellow Americans, we are all in this together. Mr. Speaker, we are  in this together. We can't cancel each other. We can't move people out  of the public square because we find their ideas even vile or  distasteful. I may not like what you have to say, Mr. Speaker. We may  disagree on votes on this very floor, but the one thing I will always  respect, the one thing I will always defend is your ability to say it  and your ability to vote that way. My only ask is that you do the same  for people on my side of the political aisle.
