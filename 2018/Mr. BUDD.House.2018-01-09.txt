 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Garrett) for organizing this in support of those protesters in Iran. It  is the ongoing protests that started late last month in Iran that are  significant not just for their people, but also for the world.   While these protests started because of a dire economic situation in  Iran, with upwards of 40 percent of its youth unemployed, it has grown  to be a nationwide movement that is about much more than just the  economy.   Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen the Iranian people flood  the streets in favor of fundamental freedoms, economic opportunity, and  a government that represents their interests, not Hezbollah's. There  are even reports of people chanting, ``We don't want an Islamic  Republic,'' or, ``We will die, but we will take Iran back.''   This has been a long time coming. A State Department report in 2016  found that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism in the whole  world. Whether it is providing financial support to Hezbollah or  providing arms to Islamic rebel groups in Yemen, the Iranian  Government's priorities are obviously more focused on wreaking  international havoc than they are on addressing the pressing issues  within their own country.   And while we are talking about issues with Iran, the protesters are  pleading for fundamental freedoms. For example, married women aren't  even allowed to travel outside the country without permission from  their husbands. They also risk being put in jail or even to death if  they take off their hijab in public.   But brave women throughout Iran have been unmasking themselves during  the last couple of weeks in protest. To many in our country, this may  seem insignificant, but videos of these women and their courage have  been shared millions and millions of times around the globe.    Mr. Speaker, those who dislike President Trump have criticized his  approach to foreign policy, but these same people fail to praise his  strong defense for freedom when it comes to Iran.   As soon as the protests started, President Trump put out a statement  that said the Iranian people are hungry for food and for freedom. He  also said that it is time for a change, and I couldn't agree with him  more.   This is the opposite of the Obama administration that preached moral  authority and, yet, sided with the corrupt Iranian regime and the  corrupt Iranian Government when anti-regime protesters took to the  streets back in 2009.   So now that President Trump has proven his credibility on the global  stage by siding with the protesters, the question is: Now, where do we  go from here?   Well, Mr. Speaker, first we should increase the sanctions on the  Iranian Government in response to their crackdown on protesters for  freedom in recent weeks.   President Trump should also strongly consider pulling out of the  nuclear deal that was struck by President Obama in 2015.                                time  1730    We have already seen the Iranian Government break parts of the  agreement, and we should have a zero tolerance for these breaks because  the consequences are just too grave.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Iran are bravely speaking out against  their government and they are calling for change. For the United States  to continue to be a shining example of freedom and liberty, we must  continue to vocalize our support for these protesters in Iran and make  sure that they know that we have their back.   Again, I thank my colleague, Mr. Garrett from Virginia.
