 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to vote in favor  of the H.R. 7010, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act.   America's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic depends on  getting individuals comfortable with safely going back to workplaces,  shops, and restaurants. H.R. 7010 represents a continued commitment to  providing economic assistance to America's small businesses while our  economy works towards this goal.   Throughout east Tennessee, the Paycheck Protection Program is  ensuring employers can pay their workers and cover operating expenses.  H.R. 7010 will allow greater flexibility for this relief by extending  the PPP loan forgiveness period from 8 to 24 weeks, eliminating  duplicative program requirements, and providing small businesses with  additional time to pay back loans as they get back on their feet.   Members of the Committee on Small Business have a strong reputation  of reaching across the aisle to work together, and I applaud the  efforts of Mr. Roy and Mr. Phillips to craft clean legislation that  meets the needs of small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill that delivers results  for America's small businesses during this difficult time. It is great  to see Chairwoman Velazquez and the ranking member, and I thank them  for their leadership.
