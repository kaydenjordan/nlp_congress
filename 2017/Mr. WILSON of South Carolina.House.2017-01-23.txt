 Mr. Speaker, Friday marked a positive  new era for American families, as Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the  45th President of the United States, with Mike Pence serving as the  48th Vice President.   President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence will work alongside  Speaker Paul Ryan to create jobs, replace ObamaCare with a patient- centered alternative, and promote a national defense so that American  families can be protected, policies that were clearly outlined in his  inaugural address.   In an op-ed published in Forbes, President Trump's speech was  described as ``revolutionary.'' The article went on to detail how ``he  has defined a new role for the government, for the public, for  patriotism, for America first.''   President Trump confirmed: ``This is your day, your celebration . . .  What matters is that your country is ruled by you, the people.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. The hateful  protesters who assaulted my inaugural guests from New Jersey with water  balloons will fail again, as President Trump with Speaker Ryan prevail  creating jobs.                            ____________________
