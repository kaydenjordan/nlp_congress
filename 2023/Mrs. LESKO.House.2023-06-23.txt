 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Davidson for sponsoring this bill  and allowing me to talk.   The Biden administration's mortgage rule is the most recent in a long  line of upside-down, absolutely crazy policies by this administration.   Recently, the Federal Housing Finance Agency increased loan-level  pricing adjustments for Americans with good credit scores and decreased  the fees for the majority of Americans who have poor credit scores.  That makes no sense. It is upside down, and it incentivizes people not  to have good credit scores.   Americans who have good credit scores and have been fiscally  responsible should not be forced to effectively subsidize the loans of  people with bad credit, especially in the middle of a cost-of-living  crisis with still-high inflation rates and rising home prices.   The Middle Class Borrower Protection Act repeals this terrible policy  and ensures that Americans are not unfairly punished for being fiscally  responsible.   I have young adult children, and they struggle. They are not wealthy,  as some of my Democratic colleagues have said, but they have struggled.  They live paycheck to paycheck, but they try to have good credit  scores.   One of them said to me: Jeez, with this crazy Biden policy of wanting  to punish people with good credit scores so that they have to pay more  to subsidize people with poor credit scores, why the heck should I work  to have good credit scores?   That is what this administration is doing. This is like socialism.  This is insane. That is why I support Mr. Davidson's bill. That is why  I support Americans who strive to be fiscally responsible.
