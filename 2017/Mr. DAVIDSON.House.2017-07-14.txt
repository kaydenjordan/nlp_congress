 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment No. 80  as en bloc No. 4.   My amendment encourages collaboration between the FAA and DOD on  unmanned aircraft systems so that the FAA may leverage the unique  capabilities and insights of the DOD. These are important activities as  the FAA moves forward with incorporating unmanned systems into the  national airspace.   The efforts highlighted in my amendment are already ongoing  activities between the FAA and the DOD, but more work needs to be done,  as documented in a 2014 joint report to Congress.   The Air Force Research Laboratory located at Wright-Patterson Air  Force Base, AFRL, in particular, has expertise in these sense-and-avoid  technologies. AFRL is planning to conduct unmanned aircraft research  activities at Springfield, Ohio's, Air National Guard base in Ohio's  Eighth District, upon FAA approval.   I am proud of our airmen and the work conducted at both Springfield  and Wright-Patterson and to offer this amendment to help the FAA make  good use of the capabilities located there.   I also rise in support of my amendment No. 120 as part of this en  bloc package.    My amendment is critical for ensuring Congress reclaims  its war-making powers by prohibiting funding for U.S. operations in  Yemen that are not in compliance with the 2001 AUMF. I am concerned  about any U.S. operations in Yemen that are outside the scope of the  current AUMF and have no identifiable authorization from Congress.   My amendment is very simple. If the military operation is within the  scope of the 2001 AUMF, it is permissible. If it has not been  authorized by Congress, then it is not permissible.   I look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues in the  Senate to ensure this provision is adopted in the final NDAA conference  report.
