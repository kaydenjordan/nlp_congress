 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I, along  with Senators Hagerty, Peters, and Portman, be recognized to speak for  up to 5 minutes each before the scheduled recess.    Madam President, I was not intending to speak. As the  Presiding Officer knows, I was presiding, and she was kind to spell me.   Yet, as I was hearing colleagues talk on the floor about the state of  our country, what I was hearing from my Republican colleagues were  words like ``malaise,'' ``funk,'' ``disaster,'' and I was seeing  visuals of a house on fire. So I was compelled to stand and just offer  a few extemporaneous remarks.   I don't think America is a disaster. I don't think America is on  fire. I don't think America is in a deep, unyielding malaise. I have  heard colleagues talk about the situation in the world and use the  ``appeasement'' word. I have heard language, both in committee hearings  this morning and here on the floor, that I would characterize as a kind  of a ``blame America first'' attitude. If something is going on--if a  dictator like Vladimir Putin acts in a horrific way--it has got to be  America's fault. It has got to be Joe Biden's fault. I don't think our  instinct should be to blame America first when dictators in the world  undertake despicable actions.   What I have noticed in these comments today in trashing our President  and in trashing the country--sort of a cherry-picking of evidence--is  that my colleagues have brought up some things that are really very  legitimate concerns. Inflation is a very, very legitimate concern that  has to be addressed. Yet I have listened to these speeches, and not one  has talked about record job growth. Not one has talked about strong GDP  growth. Not one has talked about dramatic increases in the wages and  salaries of low- and moderate-income people.   Is that because my colleagues are unaware of those things?   No. They know these things. They are just choosing not to discuss  them because what they want to do is to paint a picture of an American  malaise, an American funk, an American disaster. That is not what this  country is. Yet my colleagues are very willing to paint a false picture  by omitting key evidence.   I listened to the speeches this morning, and not one mentioned that  COVID deaths and hospitalizations are coming down dramatically and that  the CDC now has said, in most of my Commonwealth and in most of the  country, you needn't wear masks indoors. I would think they might have  mentioned that because part of the reason for this recent progress is  the vaccinations; it is the vaccines that were developed in the  previous administration. They could have taken a little credit for it,  but, no, they didn't mention it at all. COVID is coming down. There is  strong economic growth, strong job growth, strong wage and salary  growth.   Around the world, a NATO that the previous President trashed when he  was cozying up to the dictator Vladimir Putin is demonstrating to the  entire world that, when it is resolved to unify, the power of American- led alliances is a huge force for good in this world.   So I am just trying to grapple with the one-sided presentation of  American disaster, American malaise, American funk. Here is the way I  understand it.   The last 2 years have been brutal. The death toll due to COVID is now  nearly 950,000. It will eclipse a million. I am 64 years old as of a  couple of days ago. It has been the hardest 2 years in my life and for  our country with the death, the illness, the economic devastation, the  job loss. It has been brutal here, and it has been brutal all around  the world, and it is not completely in the rearview mirror yet.   I suspect what you are going to hear President Biden say tonight-- this is my intuition; I don't have knowledge. He is going to  acknowledge the incredible pain we have been living under in this  country and around the world for the last 2 years--nearly unprecedented  in a century. He is going to point out that there are still significant  challenges and that there is still too high a percentage of Americans  who haven't taken advantage of these vaccines.   Yes, inflation is a problem, and there are problems that we have to  deal with, but when you look at strong job growth and strong wage  growth and strong GDP growth and when you look at declining case  numbers, I will tell you what I see. I see the beginnings of something  that we often see in American life--an American comeback. We are  comeback people. We are comeback people.   A friend of mine once said: Tough times don't last. Tough people do.   We are tough, tough people.   As I travel around Virginia--and I was traveling around Virginia last  week--I don't fundamentally see funk or malaise or ``poor, poor,  pitiful me'' or blaming America for the woes of the world or blaming  Joe Biden for the reality of a tough situation we have been living  through. I see people with their chins up and their heads held high,  who will acknowledge that we have challenges and that we have got  problems to solve but who believe that we are on our way to a better  chapter after a very difficult last couple of years.   That is the can-do spirit I see around Virginia. That is the can-do  spirit, I believe, that has always characterized Americans, not a ``we  are on fire''; ``it is a malaise time''; ``it is a funk time.'' No. I  see a can-do spirit and the beginnings of an American comeback underway  after what has been the most painful 2 years during my 64 here on the  planet.   I don't know, if I am right, whether that is good news or bad news  for my colleagues who are here on the floor, painting the negative  picture. I would think it would be good news. But if it were good news,  why wouldn't I have heard some acknowledgment of job growth or wage  growth or GDP growth? Why wouldn't I have heard acknowledgment about  COVID cases coming down?   We do need to work together. The Presiding Officer inspired all of us  with her work on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which, as I was  traveling around Virginia last week--and I am sure most of us were  doing this in our States--my mayors and my State officials and my local  economic development officials were talking with excitement about what  this will mean in terms of the rebuilding of American communities where  we haven't invested in infrastructure for a very long time.   I don't think this is a moment when the leadership class of this  country should be amplifying pessimism about  [[Page S854]]  this country. I think it is a moment when the leadership class of this  country should be amplifying an optimistic, can-do message that I think  is in accord with the values of Virginians and the values of Americans.  I suspect that that kind of a message--the acknowledgment of the  difficult reality but the foundation being laid for the beginnings of  an American comeback after 2 tough years--is the message that we are  going to hear from President Biden tonight.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
