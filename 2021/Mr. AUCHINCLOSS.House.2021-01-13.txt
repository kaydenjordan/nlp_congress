 Madam Speaker, a mob desecrated our Capitol, killed  a police officer, and attempted to overthrow our government on the  orders of the President of the United States. Immediate impeachment is  our duty under the Constitution that compels us to defend against  enemies, foreign and domestic.   As a Marine officer, I defended our democracy from foreign enemies.  As a Member of Congress, I am solemnly resolved to defend it from  domestic ones.   With this vote, we strike a blow for moral leadership.
