 Mr. Chair, I rise as a cosponsor of this  amendment, which would prohibit closure of the U.S. Forest Service Job  Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.   Closing the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers makes absolutely  no sense. These 25 centers are among the highest-performing centers in  the country. Despite claims to the contrary, they contribute directly  to the missions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.  Forest Service by training thousands of students each year in  conservation work and firefighting.   At a time when the Forest Service has been struggling to hire  dispatchers and firefighters to prepare for the upcoming fire season,  it is irresponsible, to say the least, to close these centers and lay  off 1,100 Job Corps employees.   Mr. Chair, as the co-chair of the bipartisan Job Corps Congressional  Caucus with Congressman Phil Roe, I applaud Representatives DeFazio and  Newhouse for their outstanding efforts to stop the U.S. Department of  Labor and the U.S. Department of Agriculture from going forward with  this reckless and ill-advised decision.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment.
