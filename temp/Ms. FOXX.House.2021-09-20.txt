 Madam Speaker, any attack against the sanctity of human  life tears the moral fabric of this great country.   H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand until birth act, is yet another  scheme levied against the most vulnerable group in this country, the  unborn. This legislation would impose abortion on demand for any reason  until birth. What's more, it would override past and future pro-life  laws at both the State and Federal levels.   Madam Speaker, the unborn deserve a voice in the people's House who  stands for them, and I am proud to be one of the many in this body who  do so. Let us never forget that life is a precious gift from God, and  that gift should never be squandered under any circumstances.                            ____________________
