 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi Arnold E.  Resnicoff who led us in the opening prayer today.   Rabbi Resnicoff is an American conservative rabbi who served as a  military officer and military chaplain. He served in Vietnam and in  Europe before attending rabbinical school, and then went on to serve as  a U.S. Navy chaplain for almost 5 years. He promoted the creation of  the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and delivered the closing prayer in its  1982 dedication.   In 1984, President Ronald Reagan spoke on his eyewitness account of  the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.   After retiring from the military, the rabbi served as the National  Director of Interreligious Affairs for the American Jewish Community  and then special assistant to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the  U.S. Air Force, serving at the equivalent military range of brigadier  general.   Across his career, he received several awards including: the Defense  Superior Service Medal, the Department of the Air Force Decoration for  Exceptional Civilian Service, and the Chapel of Four Chaplains Hall of  Heroes Gold Medallion.   He has always been a spiritual inspiration, and now inspires me to  Google how far the golf balls were hit on the Moon.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Resnicoff to the House  of Representatives today, and personally thank him for his leadership  and for offering the opening prayer.                            ____________________
