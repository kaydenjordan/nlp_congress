 Mr. President, I come before my colleagues in the Senate  to urge in the strongest possible terms that the Republican leadership  here accept its responsibility and not allow the Government of the  United States of America to shut down. Republicans control the Senate.  They control the U.S. House. And a Republican is in the White House.  Please do not shut the government down.   A government shutdown will be extremely distressing and difficult for  millions of people in every State in our country who utilize government  services. A government shutdown will be extremely painful for millions  of Federal employees who depend upon their paychecks to provide for  their families. A government shutdown will make it much more difficult  for U.S. military personnel, the men and women who are putting their  lives on the line to defend us, to do their jobs.   The American people do not want a government shutdown. I do not want  a government shutdown, and I believe that most of my Republican  colleagues do not want a government shutdown. It is imperative that  President Trump understand that despite what he said in May, that  statement is wrong. When he said our country needs a good shutdown,  that is wrong. Our country does not need a good shutdown. What we need  is an annual budget that addresses the many needs of the American  people.   Just last night, this is what a spokesperson from the Pentagon  stated:         We have been working under a Continuing Resolution for       three years now. Our current CR expires tomorrow, 19 Jan.       This is wasteful and destructive. We need a fully-funded FY18       budget or face ramifications on our military.    This afternoon, I say to Senator McConnell, the Republican leader  here in the Senate: Please do not shut the government down. You know,  Senator McConnell, the political reality as well as anybody in our  country. In the Senate, you need 60 votes to pass this budget  agreement. You don't have 60 votes. Please, sit down with Democrats,  and start negotiating in good faith. Please, do not shut the government  down.   More and more Democrats are sick and tired of kicking the can down  the road, tired of our not addressing the major crises that are facing  this country, tired of running a $4 trillion operation, which is what  the U.S. Government is, on a month-to-month basis.   Yet it is not just the Democrats who are demanding that we finally  have an annual budget. It is the Republicans as well. My  understanding--what I have heard from the news media--is that there are  now five Republicans who are prepared to vote against this continuing  resolution and even more who have voiced deep concerns about the lack  of an annual budget. They know and I know that just passing another  temporary budget is totally irresponsible and is abdicating the job  that we were elected to do.   What the American people understand--what every businessperson in  this country understands, what every family in America understands--is  that you cannot run a government, given the many crises that we face,  on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our  responsibility. Finally, we must address the problems that are facing  the American people.   Last night, the Pentagon told us correctly--and I state again that  this is what was said: ``We need a fully-funded FY18 budget or face  ramifications on our military.''   Let's not forget that we are 3\1/2\ months into the fiscal year.  There are 3\1/2\ months that have come and gone, and the Republican  leadership here has still not given us an annual budget.   It is not just the military that faces a crisis situation because of  the lack of an annual budget. Today, 27 million Americans get their  primary healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost  prescription drugs through the community health center program. In my  State of Vermont, one out of four Vermonters gets his primary  healthcare through a community health center. There are 3\1/2\ months  that have come and gone since the beginning of this fiscal year, and  the Republicans have not yet reauthorized funding for the community  health center program, which is now facing a severe crisis in terms of  recruiting and retaining the doctors, nurses, and other medical staff  it needs to maintain the quality of service it must maintain.   What doctor or what nurse is going to go to a community health center  when he or she doesn't even know if that facility is going to receive  funding? There are 27 million Americans who depend upon community  health centers. As I understand it--and I am glad--the Republicans are  now prepared to reauthorize the CHIP program. There are 9 million kids  who need that program. In the 3\1/2\ months that have come and gone,  finally, they are talking about reauthorizing CHIP. That is good, but  you cannot forget the community health centers.   The community health center program in this country is 50 years old.  It was developed in the 1960s. It is supported by virtually every  Democrat and, I think, the vast majority of the Republicans. Yet it has  not been reauthorized. This is a crisis that cannot be kicked down the  road. It has to be addressed and addressed now.   On Veterans Day, everybody here goes running all over the country,  giving great speeches about how much they love the veterans, but the  Veterans Health Administration cannot continue to provide decent,  quality care to those of our veterans who put their lives on the line  to defend us when they have over 30,000 vacancies. In Vermont and  around the country, the VA provides good, quality care, but you cannot  provide care in a timely manner when you have 30,000 vacancies at the  VA. This issue cannot be kicked down the road. It must be addressed  now, not next year.   As everybody knows, in Louisiana and in Vermont and all over this  country, there is a horrible, horrific opioid and heroin epidemic that  is sweeping this country. It has hit my State of  [[Page S324]]  Vermont hard. It has hit States all over America. Last year, 60,000  people in our country died as a result of opioid or heroin overdoses.  We need to help State governments, local communities, families, and  police departments to address the opioid and heroin epidemic. This is a  crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It must be addressed now,  not through a continuing resolution that absolutely ignores this  crisis. It must be addressed now.   Last year, unbelievably, some 10,000 people with disabilities died  while awaiting decisions for the applications they made to the Social  Security Administration for their disability benefits to be approved.  People with disabilities apply for benefits. They wait, they wait, and  they wait. Last year, 10,000 people with disabilities died while  waiting for decisions. Many of them died because the Social Security  Administration is, today, grossly underfunded, understaffed, and simply  not able to deal with the volume of claims they have received.   It is not just people with disabilities. In my State of Vermont--I  hear this every day--there are older Americans who are not getting the  quality of service they need from the Social Security Administration.  Our job is to adequately fund the Social Security Administration so it  can protect the needs of senior citizens and people with disabilities  in our country. This is a crisis that cannot be kicked down the road.  It has to be addressed now, and this continuing resolution, which I  presume we are going to vote on later today, does not deal with it.   Mr. President, 1\1/2\ million Americans are in danger of seeing their  pensions cut by up to 60 percent. These are truckdrivers, construction  workers, machinists, and others who have worked their entire careers  with the expectation that they would receive a decent pension when they  retired. We have a responsibility to protect the pensions of these  hard-working Americans and keep the promises that were made to them.  This is another crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It has to  be addressed now, and the continuing resolution that is going to come  before us has not one word to say about that.   Then we have a child care crisis in this country. Millions of working  families can't find quality, affordable child care. We have a student  debt crisis in this country--40 million people, many of them deeply in  debt, unable to get on with their lives for the crime of having gone to  college. That is a crisis that we have to deal with. We have an  infrastructure crisis in this country. All over America, roads,  bridges, water systems, waste water plants are collapsing. How do we  continue to ignore those crises? At a time of massive income and wealth  inequality, when the rich are getting richer and everybody else is  getting poorer, our job in Congress is not just to give tax breaks to  billionaires. Our job is not just to try to throw 32 million Americans  off the health insurance they have or deny the reality of climate  change or to end net neutrality or make racist comments about countries  throughout the world. Our job is to represent the needs of ordinary  Americans. We cannot continue to ignore these problems. We cannot  continue to kick the can down the road.   Once again, I say to the majority leader: Let us begin to negotiate  in good faith. Let us reach decisions that will improve life for the  American people, not simply ignore their needs.   When we talk about the crises facing this country, we are also  talking about a crisis precipitated by President Trump in September of  last year. As a result of President Trump's rescinding of President  Obama's Executive order on DACA, some 800,000 young people in our  country are today living in fear, uncertainty, and anxiety. If we do  not act--and act now--it is possible that many of these young people  will lose their legal status and be subjected to the possibility of  deportation. This must not be allowed to happen.   This issue to my mind is one of the great moral issues of our time.  These young people, who were brought into this country, some at 2 years  of age, 3 years, 5 years of age, are people who have lived virtually  their entire lives in the United States of America. They are working,  they are in school, they are in the military, and 20,000 of these young  DACA people are now teaching in schools throughout the country.   It would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history or  our history in general if we said to these young people, who know no  other country but the United States of America, that they could be  deported from our shores. It would be an unspeakable crime, and we must  not allow that to happen. That is not just the opinion of Senator  Bernie Sanders; that is the overwhelming point of view of the American  people, of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.   A poll just came out last night from CBS. The poll showed that 87  percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal  status of the Dreamers--87 percent--and that poll is consistent with  poll after poll after poll. The people of the United States across the  political spectrum are saying that we cannot turn our backs on these  Dreamers. The vast majority of people believe we must provide a path  toward citizenship.   There is now bipartisan legislation that has been written by Senator  Durbin, Senator Graham, and others, and I say to Senator McConnell: If  87 percent of the American people think we should provide legal status  to the Dreamers, let us do our job. Let us pass this legislation. This  is not a profile in courage. This is what the American people want, and  let us do what the American people want.   As we well know, terrible, terrible hurricanes struck Texas, Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands months and months ago, and people  there are still suffering. Many people in Puerto Rico today still do  not have electricity. Then there are devastating wildfires and mud  slides that have taken place in California. How long does it take for  this Congress to respond to the crises facing our fellow Americans?   What I say is, we were elected to do our jobs in representing the  American people. That is what we are paid to do. We cannot run a  government on a month-to-month basis. Senator McConnell does not have  the 60 votes he needs, and now is the time for him to sit down with the  Democratic leadership and negotiate a serious agreement on the budget  situation, on parity between defense and nondefense spending. Negotiate  a serious agreement on DACA, providing legal status and a path toward  citizenship for our 800,000 young people; negotiate a serious agreement  on disaster relief.   The truth of the matter is, we can do it. We can do it. The  differences of opinion are not that wide, but we cannot do it and will  not do it unless we finally sit down and start negotiating in a serious  manner. That is what I implore Senator McConnell to do.   With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
