 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague and friend and  all the members of the Armed Services Committee for allowing me to  encourage my colleagues to support amendments 723 and 731 of the NDAA.   Amendment 723 offers whistleblower protections in investigations  considering evidence. We certainly want to protect those who are  courageous enough to come forward, including preventing undue, adverse,  and retaliatory personnel actions by their employers within DOD.   Amendment 731 is the Bereavement Leave for All amendment. This  commonsense, plain and simple amendment will expand the definition of  family members in bereavement policies to include nonbiological family  members such as foster and adopted children.  [[Page H3454]]    Again, this is common sense and goes to just keeping families  together in their very time of need. We do not want families in a  situation where they lost a loved one and they are not allowed leave  because they are not a blood child.   It is my hope that my colleagues support both amendments that afford  our servicemembers and civilians the same protections and rights that  we would want in their positions.
