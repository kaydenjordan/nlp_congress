 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3233. On  September 11, 2001, I was a freshman in Congress. We suffered attacks  that day because of a failure of imagination. Since then, I have  dedicated myself to getting ahead of the curve, to seeing over the  horizon, to preventing another such devastating surprise. Yet, on  January 6, I, along with so many others, was caught by surprise.   In the past 5 months, I have reflected. What signs did we miss? Were  we unprepared for a tide of American rioters? Why were some citizens  actually taking the big lie about the election seriously enough to  actually commit violence?   The January 6 commission will answer these and many other difficult  questions and deliver a complete record for posterity of what could  possibly have happened to bring about such a betrayal of our democracy.   We will not defeat darkness with darkness. We need light. We will not  defeat lies with lies. We need truth. This commission will bring forth  the truth and it is only the truth that can truly heal the rift that is  tearing our country apart.  [[Page H2579]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for  their leadership.
