 Madam President, along with my colleague Senator  James E. Risch, I congratulate Seth Beal, who is  [[Page S1380]]  retiring after more than 30 years of serving as a commissioner for  Butte County, ID.   Seth Beal has dedicated so much of his time and talents to serving  others throughout his communities. He was appointed to the Butte County  Commission on June 6, 1988. Seth has said that efforts that established  far-reaching benefits for his communities have been the most satisfying  parts about his job. This includes the establishment of the rural  addressing of Butte and South Custer Counties. He also assisted with  Federal legislation providing for small community and arid landfill  design. He was involved with ensuring that local counties could access  Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, payments because of the local presence  of U.S. Department of Energy facilities. Another highlight of his work  on the Butte County Commission is the commission's establishment of the  Butte County Elected Scholarship, which awards three scholarships per  year to Butte County High School seniors.   Through his work and public service, Seth has helped improve his  local communities and supported area youth. In addition to his service  on the county commission, Seth has served as an assistant football  coach for 8 years at Butte County High School. He has served as bishop  and stake president in the Idaho Falls Temple Presidency. He has also  been involved with the purchase and renovation of buildings that  provide improved facilities for the county.   In addition to his extensive service on the Butte County Commission,  he has served in numerous other leadership positions that include  service on several boards, including the Idaho County Risk Management  Program for 20 years; GEM PLAN, the county's insurance plan, for 14  years; East Central Idaho Development Association for 12 years;  founding member of the Regional Development Alliance and 21 years of  service; 7th Judicial District Commissioner for 24 years; District 6  elected officials chairman for 5 years; Idaho National Lab Citizens  Advisory Board member for 7 years; founding member of the 3-B Juvenile  Detention Center; and founding member of the Energy Communities  Alliance.   Seth Beal, congratulations on your retirement after more than three  decades of serving on the Butte County Commission and in many other  leadership positions. Your thoughtful and committed leadership all  these years is a prime example of what makes our communities so great.  Thank you for your dedication and extensive service on behalf of our  fellow Idahoans.                            ____________________
