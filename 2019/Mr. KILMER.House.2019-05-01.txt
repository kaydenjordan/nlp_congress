 Mr. Speaker, there is no denying it, climate change is  real, and Congress has a moral obligation to act.   The communities that I represent in Washington State are already  experiencing the impacts. Coastal Tribes are in the process of trying  to move to higher ground. Changing ocean chemistry is impacting our  marine life and the industries that depend on it.   The Department of Defense has called it a threat multiplier that  makes our world less safe.   And, today, Congress will take an important, tangible step toward  addressing climate change by passing the Climate Action Now Act, a bill  that reaffirms America's commitment to the Paris climate agreement and  directs the administration to develop a comprehensive plan to meet the  significant emission reductions that we as a Nation, and nearly every  Nation in the world, committed to back in 2015.   We know that making progress is not only about protecting our  environment, but also about protecting our economic interests and our  national security.   The American people are not just demanding action, but leadership, to  counter the impacts of climate change.   This legislation is an important first step toward meeting our long- term carbon emission goals, and I am proud to cosponsor it and vote in  favor of it.
