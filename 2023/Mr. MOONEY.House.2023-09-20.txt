 Mr. Speaker, recently, I introduced my plan, H.R. 3190,  to crack down on Mexico for its failure to stop the flood of fentanyl  across our border.   The Mexican President continues to falsely state that fentanyl is not  manufactured or consumed in his country, but the numbers do not lie.  The DEA said in December that most of the fentanyl trafficked by the  cartels is being mass-produced at secret factories in Mexico with  chemicals sourced largely from China.   There were 14,000 pounds of the drug seized last year at the southern  border. Fentanyl continues to pour across our border because of the  disastrous open border policies of President Biden.   My plan will cut off U.S. taxpayer funding for economic aid to Mexico  until President Biden certifies Mexico is working with the United  States to secure its border and stop the inflow of fentanyl. Mexico  should not be rewarded with U.S. taxpayer dollars while they are  sending fentanyl across the border.   I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to  hold Mexico accountable.                            ____________________
