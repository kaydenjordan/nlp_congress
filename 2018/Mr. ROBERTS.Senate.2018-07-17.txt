 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the life of  Rocco Siciliano, of Beverly Hills, CA. This combat-decorated veteran of  World War II served his Nation as an infantry platoon leader in the  10th Mountain Infantry Division in Italy, earned the Bronze Star for  Valor, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, and the Army Special  Commendation Medal. He and thousands of his fellow countrymen served as  soldiers in the liberation of Europe under Supreme Allied Commander  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a fellow Kansan and personal hero of  mine. Rocco later served in President Eisenhower's administration,  first as an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Labor from  1953 to 1957, then as Special Assistant to the President for Personnel  Management policies from 1957 to 1959. This leads me to the reason I  rise today.   Rocco Siciliano, after decades of service to our Nation in many  significant roles and having secured many accomplishments over his  illustrious career in both the public and private sectors, was elected  chairman of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission in 2001.  Joined on the commission by fellow decorated World War II combat  veterans, Senators Daniel Inouye and Ted Stevens, Rocco led the  commission whose congressionally mandated mission is to create a  national memorial to our 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Rocco  successfully led the Commission for 14 years before stepping down as  chair in 2015. As Rocco's successor as chair of the Commission, I feel  I must recognize him for his significant accomplishments. During his  tenure, Rocco guided the commission through the processes of memorial  site selection and the design competition. His remarkable and steadfast  work has helped the commission get us to this memorable juncture. The  memorial to Ike is under construction in our Nation's Capital, between  4th and 6th Streets on Independence Avenue, Southwest. Rocco continues  to serve as chair emeritus on the commission as one of the four  Presidentially appointed commissioners. The commission seeks to  dedicate the completed memorial to Ike on May 8, 2020, the 75th  anniversary of V-E Day.   Speaking on behalf of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission, I wish to  recognize Rocco's patriotism, leadership, perseverance, and tenacity  that have been of great benefit to our Nation. He has been a valued  colleague in this monumental endeavor, and I stand to honor him today.                            ____________________
