 Madam Speaker, even before the pandemic, American  families struggled to cover the expense of childcare, with the cost of  care for two kids consuming 20 to 30 percent of the income of most  families.   Since the pandemic began, the situation has worsened dramatically.  Hundreds of Pennsylvania childcare agencies, which operated on the  slimmest of margins to begin with, have closed permanently, and already  scarce childcare spots have become harder to find.   Since the pandemic, the lack of childcare and continuing school  closures has resulted in millions of parents, mostly women, losing  their jobs or being forced to leave work due to childcare obligations.   Families need investment in childcare now. Women can't be asked to  bear the cost of not funding these crucial programs any longer.   The Build Back Better Act is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to  meet the needs of working families.   Access to affordable childcare will strengthen the financial standing  of our families, make sure that women are not left behind in our  recovery, and help parents enter or reenter the workforce and generate  new economic activity.   Let's get this done for the American people.                            ____________________
