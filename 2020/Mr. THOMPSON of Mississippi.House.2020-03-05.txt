 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding time.   Mr. Chair, we have worked long and hard on crafting a bill that I am  convinced would be in the best interests of those TSO employees who  work diligently to keep us safe, making sure that all is well when we  fly in and out of Washington as Members of Congress, as well as the 450  airports all around the United States.   They do a good job, but they are not treated fairly.   We want to make sure, in this instance, with the amendment, that we  improve on the bill. So I rise in support of the amendment offered by  my colleague, Mr. Peters from California.   TSA takes pride in hiring veterans and reports that a quarter of its  workforce is comprised of veterans. That is a good thing.   Still, there are questions about the way TSA uses its personnel  flexibilities when it comes to recruiting and hiring veterans.   The Peters amendment would require the Government Accountability  Office to conduct a study of TSA's recruitment process, including its  recruitment of veterans. This amendment will improve the underlying  bill by ensuring that, as TSA moves forward under title 5, it does so  in a way that recruits and retains veterans.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding me the time.   Let me be clear. This bill enhances opportunities for TSOs. It  increases the possibility of them getting employment by putting them on  the GS schedule for Federal employees, so I am somewhat mystified that  a bill that is designed to bring a group of employees into a system  that all other Federal employees are in is somehow penalizing those  employees.   The very intent of this bill is to level the playing field for TSOs,  who, everybody agrees, are doing a wonderful job, so I continue to be  somewhat baffled by the arguments against it.   I support the gentleman from Maryland's amendment. This amendment  adds additional language to the bill to reiterate Congress' intent that  TSA employees should have the same protections and benefits as the rest  of the Federal workforce.   This current system that we have is not working for TSA employees.  All you have to do is talk to them. When you go through the airports,  just ask them: ``Are you happy with how you are being treated and paid  right now?'' Without a doubt, they will tell you: ``No.'' So this is to  fix it.   I compliment the gentleman from Maryland's strengthening of the  intent of this legislation. But, more importantly, the bargaining unit  that represents the employees, the American Federation of Government  Employees, which represents all the TSOs, all 46,000, they are in  support of it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to rise in  support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Kim).   Federal air marshals are an essential component of the layered  aviation security system that was created in the wake of the September  11 attacks. Every day, these quiet heroes keep the flying public safe.   As Representative Kim's amendment recognizes, there are some major  personnel changes within FAMS that need timely attention. I commend the  gentleman from New Jersey for introducing this amendment to direct TSA  to aggressively take on the mental health and morale challenges within  this subset of the TSA workforce.   Again, I compliment the gentleman for his amendment and urge support.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Cisneros).   Let me be clear. We want to do all we can for our veterans. They have  done a tremendous job defending us all over the world. The least we can  do is when they return, or, unfortunately, when they don't return  through tragedy, we take care of the families by offering them  employment.   This is a simple, commonsense amendment that I would hope there would  be no disagreement on. All this does is provide the same language that  we use for all other title 5 employees, which the intent of the overall  bill is to bring everybody under the same system.   So, I rise in support of the gentleman from California's amendment  and ask for its approval.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I compliment the  gentlewoman from Virginia in offering this amendment.   Recently, the intelligence community raised national security  concerns about the TikTok app and its ties to China. As we always and  have been continuously informed, the Chinese are trying to get  information on what we are doing every day of the week, every month,  all the year. In response to this, TSA banned the use of TikTok by TSA  employees on government-provided devices.   Representative Spanberger's amendment is to be commended for  recognizing that national security concerns about this app and  successor apps will not go away over time and for authorizing this  amendment to be codified in law.   With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee  do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Brown of Maryland,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 1140) to enhance the security operations of the  Transportation Security Administration and stability of the  transportation security workforce by applying the personnel system  under title 5, United States Code, to employees of the Transportation  Security Administration who provide screening of all passengers and  property, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the  instructions of the House in the motion to recommit, I report the bill,  H.R. 1140, back to the House with an amendment.
