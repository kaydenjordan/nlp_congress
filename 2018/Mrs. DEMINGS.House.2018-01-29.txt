 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr.  David Scott) for his leadership on this very critical issue.   Mr. Speaker, America is a great nation, and tonight we continue to  celebrate that fact. But we do know that great things don't just happen  on their own. If we take a serious look through the pages of history,  we will see the blood, the sweat, and the tears of many people. Some of  those people came on cruise ships, and some came on slave ships. But  regardless of the foundation on which our journey in America began,  many were there helping to build what we now know as a great nation.   Mr. Speaker, the American worker is intertwined in the moral fabric  of our great society. As America began to grow as an industrialized  society, so did its workforce and the need to develop fair and  equitable workplace standards.    I joined the Orlando Police Department in 1984, and on my first day  of orientation, I joined the union. I joined a great department, and I  wanted to do my part to keep it a great department. I proudly joined  the union, and I clearly understood--and it appeared at that time that  those in management also understood--that the union was working hard to  ensure that employees, both sworn and civilian, worked in a safe work  environment, were paid fair wages, and were fairly compensated in the  event of death on the job.   I was an active member of the union, and when I moved to the  management ranks, I met regularly with union leadership to ensure we  continued to have a healthy work environment, fair wages, meaningful  benefits, and safe working conditions. That has been and continues to  be the work of American unions.
