 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, 2019 is almost over, but there is a lot  that still has to be done on this floor.   A lot of bills have moved through this year. In fact, we have had 78  bills that have been signed into law so far this year.   This year, as we worked through the process, we have had quite a few  judges and nominations that the Senate has actually worked through. In  fact, by the end of this week, we will have confirmed our 50th circuit  court judge.   There is a lot of engagement, but with a week and a half left on this  floor, we still have issues like the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade  Agreement. That agreement, which is called the USMCA, has been sitting  over in the House for 14 months. It looks like the House is now going  to take it up this week or next week after 14 months of its being  there. We are pleased to see some movement there. We have to see the  final implementing language on that.   We hope to move the national defense authorization bill. That has  been waiting for months and months and months under the capable  leadership of Senator Inhofe, who is trying to negotiate with the House  to get that done. Hopefully that will get done either this week or next  week, but it is cramming into the end of the year.   We have 12 appropriations bills that are still unfinished, and we  face a deadline of December 20, or we will run into another government  shutdown, which brings me to a bill that Senator Hassan and I are  dropping today, something we have negotiated for months across party  lines to be able to have a nonpartisan solution to how we can never  ever again discuss government shutdowns.   This past week when I was flying back to DC from home, on the plane  as I was coming up, there was a Federal employee who caught me in the  aisle of the plane and said: Hey, I hear you are working on stopping  government shutdowns. Thank you.   Her next comment surprised me, though. She said she has worked for a  Federal agency for years, but she is retiring in January because she is  so tired of constantly having to prepare for, get set for a government  shutdown that may be pending in the days ahead. It has worn her out.   Someone who has great wisdom and experience and is serving in one of  our Federal agencies is retiring in January, and we will lose those  years of experience because she is tired of dealing with shutdowns. I  don't blame her, quite frankly, although I wish she wouldn't leave. I  don't blame her because year after year we end up in this same  conversation: Are we going to have another shutdown?   It seems like every year, as we approach Christmas, Federal families  across the country wonder if they are about to be furloughed and won't  get a check soon.   Federal agency leaders--those who are Senate confirmed all the way  through the process of leadership--aren't spending their time on  vision-setting and on oversight; they are spending their time in their  office having to figure out what to do in case there is a government  shutdown or working through the process of a continuing resolution  because they only get funding a few days at a time.   All of us know this is bad, but for years, we have discussed ending  government shutdowns but have never done it. Senator Hassan and I have  put together a nonpartisan bill that is a very straightforward approach  that we bring to this body and to the House to say: Let's take  government shutdowns off the table forever. Let's make this so that in  the decades ahead, we will talk about the way back days long ago when  we used to have government shutdowns. In this body now, we have had 21  government shutdowns in the last 40 years. Let's talk about the days  that used to happen but never happens again.   We have a very straightforward, simple solution. Our simple solution  is, if we get to the end of the funding cycle--at this point, it would  be December 20--we will have an automatic continuing resolution that  kicks in so that Federal families don't feel the effect of that across  the country. They are not on furlough, but Members of Congress and our  staff work 7 days a week. We have session here 7 days a week, and we  can't move to bills other than appropriations for 30 days so that we  are locked into settling the appropriations issue.   The simple resolution is, if we get to the end of the fiscal year and  our work is not done, we keep working until it is done. It is not that  hard, but we have never made the commitment to each other that we will  stay here and continue to work until it is done. What we have done  instead is one of two things. We just punt a CR, a continuing  resolution, for months at a time and say ``OK. Let's get back to this  in 8  [[Page S6953]]  weeks,'' which is what we did before, and then before that, there was a  4-week continuing resolution. So we just punt it out and say, ``We will  keep going, and we will try to figure this out later,'' which puts a  lot of chaos in agencies, or we do a government shutdown while we  argue. We go home, and Federal workers are on furlough.   Let's commit to each other that we will never do that again. We will  never put Federal workers on furlough because we can't resolve our  differences. Let's also commit to each other that when we get to the  end of the fiscal year, we will resolve the problem right then. There  is nothing different this week than there was 7 weeks ago when we first  started a continuing resolution. There is nothing different about it  other than we have just decided to go ahead and get it resolved.   When we get to the end of the problem, this Congress needs a deadline  to resolve it. Let's make it, and let's make it very simple and  straightforward: We will stay at it until we solve it--that is our  commitment--and we will hold Federal workers harmless through that  process.   Senator Hassan and I have worked on this for months. We have three  Republicans and three Democrats as we are putting this in front of this  body today. We have multiple folks who have already contacted us and  said they want to be added as cosponsors as soon as we drop it.   Well, today is the day we have introduced that bill, and we would  welcome any of the 100 of us to join us in a nonpartisan bill to end  government shutdowns forever. Let's keep working until we solve the  problem.                            ____________________
