 Mr. Chair, today I voted against H.R. 1695, the  Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act. As the founder  and co-chair of the Congressional Library of Congress Caucus, I care  deeply  [[Page H2874]]  about the services and the mission of the Library, including the U.S.  Copyright Office. It's past time to bring the Library and the Copyright  Office into the 21st Century, and I strongly support efforts to  modernize and reform existing practices. H.R. 1695, however, might  unnecessarily politicize the Copyright Office and the position of the  Register and could make its work less transparent and less neutral to  all parties. We should allow Dr. Carla Hayden to continue to guide the  modernization process by selecting a Register, a decision enjoyed by  all of her predecessors to hold the office of Librarian. While it is  unclear that H.R. 1695 would do more good than harm, I look forward to  working with my colleagues on both sides of aisle on future efforts to  reform and modernize the Library of Congress the copyright system.
