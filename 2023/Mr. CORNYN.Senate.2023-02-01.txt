 Mr. President, today, the family of Tyre Nichols will  celebrate the life of a 29-year-old man who was brutally killed by  police earlier this month. In the wake of this tragedy, we have heard  the predictable renewed calls for police reform legislation here in  Congress, something that we attempted not that long ago.   In the summer of 2020, Senators from both parties introduced police  reform bills after other high-profile tragedies like the George Floyd  murder. Senator Tim Scott, on our side--the Senator from South  Carolina--led those efforts. I was proud to work with him in crafting  something called the JUSTICE Act, which would reform, retrain, and  restore trust in America's police officers, something that I believe is  very important. This package of bills included a number of initiatives  to improve accountability and transparency and deliver real change to  our communities across the country.   I remember, after the George Floyd murder, I asked my friends, the  mayor of Houston and the mayor of Dallas, if they would assemble a  group of community leaders so that I could better understand what the  relationship was, particularly between communities of  [[Page S185]]  color and the police in those cities. It was pretty eye-opening. While  many young people and many not so young people are raised to believe  that the police are their friends and people you could depend on and  call if you are in trouble, in some communities, there is a lack of  trust and confidence in the police because of a very different  experience that they have had in those communities.   I believe there still is a broad bipartisan appetite for these types  of reforms that were included in the JUSTICE Act. I was optimistic that  we could, at the time, pass a police reform bill that was desperately  needed, but when Leader McConnell tried to bring that bill to the  floor, our Democratic colleagues blocked it. That is right. They  blocked it. They refused to allow the Senate to even debate or consider  this legislation.   Strangely enough, this package included a bill by Senator Booker and  then-Senator Kamala Harris to make lynching a Federal crime, but they  voted to block the consideration of the bill that included their bill  to make lynching a Federal crime. It just didn't make any sense to me  then, and it doesn't make any sense to me now.   This would have strengthened the use and accountability for body  cameras--I am talking about the bigger bill now, of course--improved  access to deescalation training and duty-to-intervene training, and  established two commissions to give us a better understanding and  recommendations on the challenges that needed to be addressed in the  long run. But, as I said, our colleagues across the aisle blocked it.  This important point is worth remembering now as our Democratic  colleagues renew their call for police reform.   Now, in light of the filibuster of the JUSTICE Act, I introduced a  stand-alone bill that included deescalation provisions from Senator  Scott's legislation, and I worked with my colleague Senator Whitehouse  on a bipartisan bill that was signed into law last December. So at  least that piece of the JUSTICE Act did become law. It was signed into  law by President Biden.   Deescalation training is very important. That doesn't mean that rogue  police officers will always follow their training. Indeed, these  officers, if they were trained to deescalate these conflicts, certainly  did not follow their training, and they will be held accountable, as  they should be, by the prosecutors who will bring charges against them.  But it bears repeating that Republicans tried to bring a police reform  bill to the floor 2\1/2\ years ago, and our Democratic colleagues stood  in the way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, today, President Biden  and Speaker McCarthy will sit down to discuss options to avoid a debt  crisis and rein in government spending.   The one thing that President Biden and Speaker McCarthy agree on is  that we cannot breach the debt ceiling. I guess that is at least a  start. From there, there doesn't seem to be a lot of common ground, not  yet anyway. With a potential default on the horizon, this topic has  gotten a lot of attention, but as we all know, America's debt crisis  didn't appear overnight. It has been building for decades.   As I have said before and will say again, Republicans and Democrats  have not exactly covered themselves with glory when it comes to deficit  spending and increasing the debt. Washington has spent and spent with  no meaningful steps to balance the budget. We are writing checks-- spending money--that we know people of my generation will never have to  pay back but that younger generations certainly will. That strikes me  as profoundly immoral. The national debt has skyrocketed from $3.2  trillion in 1980--$3.2 trillion in 1980--to $9.7 trillion in 2000 to  $31.5 trillion today.   I think it was Everett Dirksen who said, years ago, ``A billion here,  a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.''  Nobody ever thought to use the T-word until recently.   During COVID-19, we worked together to avert a public health crisis  and an economic catastrophe during the pandemic, and we did that on a  bipartisan basis, but in the last 2 years, our Democratic colleagues  have spent another $2.5 trillion-plus in purely partisan spending  bills: the so-called American Recovery Act and the Inflation Reduction  Act.   There has been more than $2.5 trillion in partisan spending, and the  President takes the position that he won't even negotiate on the debt  ceiling, when he is the one person whose signature is required to sign  something into law. And by his signature, he has raised the debt more  than $2.5 trillion in partisan spending in the last 2 years, and he  won't even negotiate? It strikes me as unsustainable and certainly  irresponsible.    The President was happy to take a tour across America to brag about  these costly bills, but when we hit the debt limit, he is nowhere to be  seen. He is pointing the finger of blame at the Republican House of  Representatives and at the Speaker and suggesting that, well, if you  want to cut spending, tell us where you would cut.   Let's look at spending that the President and Democrats were solely  responsible for. If we could cut back $2\1/2\ trillion of spending,  that would do a lot to address the current level of debt. But the  President's position is, it is not my responsibility. I don't really  care. And he wants to try to lay all of this at the feet of Speaker  McCarthy. It is wildly inappropriate and irresponsible.   In short, President Biden has made clear that he expects Congress to  raise the debt limit with no conditions attached, but that also means  to let this runaway spending and accumulating debt continue. That is  the part he doesn't say but is implicit in his position.   Republicans have made clear that his position is untenable. For one,  it is a matter of financial prudence. Congress can't raise the debt  ceiling just to keep spending like there is no tomorrow. We need to get  government spending in check, and the best way to do that is on a  bipartisan basis. But there is also a matter of practicality.   Republicans now control the House, meaning that the only viable path  to success means compromise. We have a divided government--that is what  the midterm elections gave us. Some of my colleagues like to say that  divided government is the best time to do hard things. I think that is  true, but if it doesn't change behavior, those hard things never get  addressed.   President Biden can roll out as many ultimatums as he wants, but the  reality is his party no longer controls all the levers of government  like it has during the last 2 years. And in order to avoid a debt  crisis, which he said is nonnegotiable, he is going to have to work  with Republicans.   Today's meeting with Speaker McCarthy is a start, but at minimum, I  hope the President will walk back his statement about not negotiating  and understand that he has no choice but to work with Republicans, just  like Speaker McCarthy has no choice but to work with President Biden.  That is the nature of a divided government that the voters gave us with  the midterm elections, and we need to get serious about workable  solutions.   Secretary Yellen has said she thinks that the government will not  default before June, which means we have approximately 4 months to work  this out. I hope today's meeting between the President and the Speaker  marks the beginning of bipartisan negotiations, and I am eager to learn  more about their discussion.           20th Anniversary of Space Shuttle ``Columbia'' Accident     Mr. President, on a final matter, today marks a solemn  anniversary for our country. Twenty years ago today, the Space Shuttle  Columbia was making its return to Earth on the heels of a mission  dubbed STS-107.   After 16 days in orbit, the shuttle was bound for Kennedy Space  Center in Florida, where members of the astronauts' families and  countless spectators gathered to watch its landing, which is always an  exciting and inspiring sight.   The shuttle was traveling across the southern part of the United  States, and as it crossed Texas on a beautiful Saturday morning,  something terrible happened. Folks along the flight path stood in their  yards, excited to watch a glimpse of Columbia returning from its 28th  mission. They watched the orbiter streak across the sky at some 12,000  [[Page S186]]  miles an hour, when, suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw the  shuttle begin to come apart.   We soon realized that the worst had happened: The shuttle broke into  several pieces as it reentered Earth's atmosphere, and all seven  astronauts aboard lost their lives.   The crew of Columbia included two Texans: Rick Husband and Willie  McCool, along with Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David Brown,  Laurel Clark, and Ilan Ramon. They were scheduled to land at Kennedy  Space Center just 15 minutes after passing over Texas.   The disaster left a field of wreckage that stretched from Fort Worth,  across East Texas, and into Louisiana. Texas is a big place, but that  means virtually the whole breadth of our State was covered with  wreckage.   The government, of course, immediately launched a massive search to  recover pieces of the space shuttle in order to determine what went  wrong. NASA officials, National Guard troops, and law enforcement at  all levels began scouring the landscape to recover pieces of the  shuttle. Divers from the Environmental Protection Agency led efforts to  recover pieces that fell into the Toledo Bend Reservoir near Hemphill.   Some 25,000 volunteers from Texas and Louisiana helped search an area  that covered 2.3 million acres. They ranged from college students at  nearby Stephen F. Austin to teams of ham radio operators who helped law  enforcement with communications. As Texans and Americans do, people  from all walks of life came together at a time of tragedy and rallied  behind a unified effort to help bring answers to a nation in mourning.   This tragedy happened just a couple of months into my first Senate  term, and I witnessed this massive response effort in action.   In the aftermath, I visited an area in Nacogdoches, which is over in  East Texas, where tents were set up by search teams. It was remarkable  to see the dedication of men and women firsthand engaged in this  effort.   Search crews battled the rain and cold temperatures as they combed  through pine forests and underbrush searching for wreckage. Recovery  teams and volunteers found everything from a 600-pound piece of a main  engine to the sole of a spacesuit boot. These discoveries, of course,  were crucial to the investigation, which helped NASA understand what  went wrong and how we could prevent similar accidents from occurring in  the future.   In the months and years since, the Agency underwent an extensive  transformation of its culture and operations to improve the safety of  future missions. Jon Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon, whose wife  Laurel was killed on Columbia said:         Their sacrifice has evolved into a safer space program.    Those changes are no consolation for the families who lost loved ones  20 years ago today, but I hope they can find some comfort in the  knowledge that these American heroes made a lasting impact on America's  space program.   I appreciate the Texans who came together in the wake of this tragedy  to preserve pieces of Columbia and provide NASA and these families with  answers that they so earnestly sought. Their efforts, then and now,  have helped make the Nation's space program safer and more successful.   As we mark the 20th anniversary of the loss of Columbia, I am proud  to cosponsor a Senate resolution to commemorate the loss of Columbia  and honor its crew. I appreciate the bipartisan support of Senators on  both sides of the aisle who have joined in this effort, and I hope the  resolution will pass unanimously today.   Today, we pay tribute to seven courageous individuals who lost their  lives aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. We remember, we honor, and we  celebrate their commitment to research, exploration, and the pursuit of  the extraordinary. We honor their legacy by continuing to push the  boundaries of scientific discovery and human space.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
