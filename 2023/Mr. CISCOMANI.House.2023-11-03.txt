 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jeremy  Tarbet, an automotive teacher in my district, who was awarded the  Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize for Teaching Excellence.   Mr. Tarbet has dedicated almost a decade of his life to teaching at  his alma mater, Canyon del Oro High School in Arizona's Sixth District,  just a few miles away from my home.   For the past 3 years, Mr. Tarbet has worked with SkillsUSA, a  technical student organization, where he encourages his students to  showcase their skills by participating in competitions.   Throughout the year, Mr. Tarbet offers three classic cars for  restoration projects, giving his students the opportunity to see  firsthand their education at work.   This award, given to only 25 teachers every year, is a testament to  his dedication to his students.   I have no doubt that he will continue to shape the future of our  students for years to come.   Congratulations, again, Jeremy, on receiving this well-deserved  distinction.                            ____________________
