 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  S.J. Res. 32. This is a CRA resolution to rescind the final rule  implementing section 1071 of Dodd-Frank. I thank Chairman Williams and  Senator Kennedy for their leadership to rescind the CFPB's harmful  proposal.   The rule is nearly 900 pages and requires lenders to report 81 data  fields. If the CFPB's proposal is enacted, small financial institutions  will be forced to devote more of their time to comply with burdensome  regulations rather than focusing on providing loans for small business  owners.   With credit tightening for small businesses due to persistent  inflation, higher interest rates, and an uncertain economic  environment, the CFPB's 1071 rule would impose higher costs for small  businesses and lead to a decrease in lending to small, minority-owned,  and women-owned businesses.   Earlier this year, the CFPB suffered a major data breach when an  employee forwarded consumer information of more than a quarter million  to a personal email account. How can we trust the CFPB to properly  manage the collection of additional data when it cannot efficiently  safeguard existing data?   I urge Director Chopra to go back to the drawing board on section  1071 and issue a rule that gets it right without punishing small banks  and small credit unions with higher compliance costs and burdensome  requirements.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  resolution and access to credit for small businesses by voting in favor  of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, under current law, American  seniors who defer enrollment in Medicare may find themselves hit with  higher fees  [[Page H6064]]  due to late enrollment charges. Permanently raising seniors' healthcare  premiums for delaying Medicare enrollment only hurts seniors who are  already struggling on fixed incomes.   That is why I helped introduce the Medicare Economic Security  Solutions Act. This is a bipartisan bill to cap these fees and address  red tape for seniors enrolling in Medicare.   As someone who is approaching the eligibility age myself--believe it  or not--protecting the benefits our seniors have earned is personal to  me.   I am proud to help lead this bipartisan and commonsense bill that  would lower costs for my constituents. I urge my colleagues to join me  on this bill.                            ____________________
