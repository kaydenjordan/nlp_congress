 Madam President, I rise at this moment to oppose the  amendment that is going to be offered by my colleague and friend from  Louisiana Senator Kennedy. This amendment would endanger the lives of  thousands, if not millions, of innocent people and prolong this  terrible coronavirus pandemic. I am sure that is the not the intention  of the Senator from Louisiana, but that is what his effort would do.  His amendment would gut a critical tool to help stop the spread of the  pandemic globally, as well as stem the economic fallout that would hurt  us here in America.   The International Monetary Fund has a fund with the ability to  release money in what are called Special Drawing Rights, foreign  exchange reserve assets that it maintains. This can be exchanged by  member nations for hard currency in times of crisis. This is exactly  what was done in 2009 amid the global economic crisis and what is being  considered now amid the pandemic and related economic downturn.   The amendment, which I am going to offer, has the support of American  business, labor, and global health, and poverty groups--for good  reason. The Special Drawing Rights are a no cost way for Americans to  help poor nations buy the vaccines they need to save lives and to stop  the spread of this coronavirus. And it would also help aid in economic  recovery.   Isn't that exactly what we should be doing at this moment?   This pandemic doesn't know any boundaries. This virus doesn't pick  and choose good nations and bad nations. Our ability to protect the  hard-fought gains against the pandemic here in the United States, after  all that we have been through, ultimately depends on getting it under  control around the world so variants and strains don't attack us anew.   I know what we have been through. If we ignore the reality, the fact  is, this pandemic came roaring at us from a city in China that most  Americans have never heard of, and now we have to decide whether we are  going to take it on directly.   You don't tell the fire department to not help with the fire at your  neighbor's house at a time of crisis. Sadly, that is exactly what the  Kennedy amendment would do.   And the one part that he is missing that is so critical is to take it  or leave it on the Special Drawing Rights. You can't pick and choose  the Nations that might or might not receive the benefits to buy  vaccines.   We can use other mechanisms and persuasion to achieve that goal, but  I am sorry to say that Senator Kennedy's approach would cut off the  Special Drawing Rights for friendly nations as well as those who are  not friendly. And that to me is shortsighted.   The way the IMF Special Drawing Rights process works, we cannot  dictate which countries will receive the benefits. Because of our  majority position at the IMF, we either stop the Special Drawing Rights  completely or let them go forward.   So the United States should stand for public health, stand for people  to be spared the suffering and death of this coronavirus, and move  forward with humanitarian aid that will help the world.   The Treasury Department is working with our allies to halt the  ability of any rogue nation that might want to exchange Special Drawing  Rights for hard currency and pushing transparency measures for how any  Special Drawing Rights are spent.   As such, I am offering a substitute amendment that makes it clear  that we want to make certain that nations do not misuse these funds.  But unlike the Kennedy amendment, it would move forward and provide  resources for countries desperately in need of vaccines to save lives.   I further support the Treasury's efforts to make sure that the SDR  allocation is used to help to stem the pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to vote for my substitute amendment and to  oppose the amendment being offered by the Senator from Louisiana.    Madam President, do I have 1 minute?    These Special Drawing Rights of the International  Monetary Fund are the only way the poorest nations on Earth could have  the money to buy vaccines to save their people. That is what it boils  down to.   But Senator Kennedy says: Well, some of this money might get into the  wrong hands.   I pray that it doesn't. I pray that they administer it properly, and  I think they will. But how would you like to have on your conscience  the fact that our amendment vote on the Senate floor is the end of the  funds for vaccines for some of the poorest countries on Earth? I would  not want that on my conscience.   Support my amendment, which makes it clear where the Americans do  stand when it comes to this issue.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2014     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, there is one fundamental flaw in what  you have just heard from Senator Kennedy, and let me read it to you:         The United States retains the right to refuse to purchase       special drawing rights from any [country].    It is voluntary--it is up to us to do it--and we don't purchase them  from a lot of countries because of that.   Let me tell you further that all we can do is stop the special  drawing rights which are providing our currency to countries to buy  vaccines. Why do we care whether some country far away had a vaccine?  Well, how far away was Wuhan, China?   We have to be in this together to try to put an end to this pandemic  crisis. Vote to defeat the Kennedy amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1710     I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr.  Manchin) is necessarily absent.    Madam President.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the remaining  votes tonight be 10-minute votes.

A bill to require the Director of National Intelligence to  declassify information relating to the origin of COVID-19, and for  other purposes; considered and passed.                                  S. 1867         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Origin Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Department of State released a fact sheet on       January 15, 2021, about the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)       which stated the following:        (A) ``The U.S. government has reason to believe that       several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn       2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with       symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal       illnesses.''.        (B) ``WIV researchers conducted experiments involving       RaTG13, the bat coronavirus identified by the WIV in January       2020 as its closest sample to SARS-CoV-2.''.        (C) ``Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian       institution, the United States has determined that the WIV       has collaborated on publications and secret projects with       China's military.''.        (2) Former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, Robert Redfield, stated in March 2021 that, ``the       most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a       laboratory'' and noted that, ``[i]t is not unusual for       respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in a       laboratory to infect the laboratory worker.''.        (3) Director-General of the World Health Organization       Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged in March 2021 that       the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have originated       in a laboratory and said this hypothesis ``requires further       investigation, potentially with additional missions involving       specialist experts.''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) identifying the origin of Coronavirus Disease 2019       (COVID-19) is critical for preventing a similar pandemic from       occurring in the future;        (2) there is reason to believe the COVID-19 pandemic may       have originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and        (3) the Director of National Intelligence should declassify       and make available to the public as much information as       possible about the origin of COVID-19 so the United States       and like-minded countries can--        (A) identify the origin of COVID-19 as expeditiously as       possible, and        (B) use that information to take all appropriate measures       to prevent a similar pandemic from occurring again.       SEC. 4. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ORIGIN                     OF COVID-19.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall--        (1) declassify any and all information relating to       potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and       the origin of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),       including--        (A) activities performed by the Wuhan Institute of Virology       with or on behalf of the People's Liberation Army;        (B) coronavirus research or other related activities       performed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology prior to the       outbreak of COVID-19; and        (C) researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who fell       ill in autumn 2019, including for any such researcher--        (i) the researcher's name;        (ii) the researcher's symptoms;        (iii) the date of the onset of the researcher's symptoms;        (iv) the researcher's role at the Wuhan Institute of       Virology;        (v) whether the researcher was involved with or exposed to       coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology;        (vi) whether the researcher visited a hospital while they       were ill; and        (vii) a description of any other actions taken by the       researcher that may suggest they were experiencing a serious       illness at the time; and        (2) submit to Congress an unclassified report that       contains--        (A) all of the information described under paragraph (1);       and        (B) only such redactions as the Director determines       necessary to protect sources and methods.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
