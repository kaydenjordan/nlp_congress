 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.  Congress has long been absent without leave from its constitutional  responsibility to authorize war before it occurs. From Vietnam to Iran,  the verdict on the War Powers Act is clear: you lose it if you do not  use it.   Congress chafes at outsized Presidential power, but has failed to  exercise its own advice and consent power on war. Iran has stepped back  for now from the brink of war, following the killing of General  Soleimani, but a strong bipartisan 69 percent of the American people  say that war with Iran is now more likely. No wonder, considering we  just deployed 15,000 more troops to the region.   Trying to get answers after the fact, as Congress did in yesterday's  briefing, yielded frustration, not answers. Unchecked executive power  unbalances the safeguards against arbitrary power the Framers built  into our Constitution.   With passage of today's resolution, we will reclaim that balance by  reinserting Congress into decisions to go to war.
