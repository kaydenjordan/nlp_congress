 Mr. President, we swore an oath to support and defend the  Constitution of the United States, including its First Amendment, which  says, in part, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an  establishment, or religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.''   We can't let statements by the President declaring the press is the  enemy of the people go unchallenged. Both parties complain about the  media, but who can argue with Thomas Jefferson, who wrote that ``our  liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited  without being lost,'' or with James Madison, who said that ``the  freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can  never be restrained but by despotic governments,'' or with President  Reagan, who said that ``freedom of the press is one of our most  important freedoms and also one of our oldest,'' or with Justice  Kennedy, who wrote that ``the First Amendment is often inconvenient.  But that is beside the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the  government of its obligation to tolerate speech.''   These words of past leaders should inspire us to act, to send a  message that we support the First Amendment, and we support the freedom  of the press.   Senators Schumer, Blumenthal, and I have introduced a resolution that  does just that. It affirms that the press is not the enemy of the  people, and it reaffirms the vital and indispensable role of the free  press, serving to inform the electorate, uncover the truth, act as a  check on the inherent power of the government, further discourse and  debate and advance our most basic and cherished democratic norms and  freedoms.   This resolution also condemns attacks on the institution of the free  press and views efforts to systematically undermine the credibility of  the press as a whole as an attack on our democratic institutions.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 607, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.                   nomination of a. marvin quattlebaum, jr.
