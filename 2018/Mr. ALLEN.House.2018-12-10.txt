 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for this  opportunity to come talk about someone we have talked about for some  time now, but we could talk about him for a very long time.   It is with a heavy heart that I rise this evening, along with my  colleagues, to recognize the life and legacy of a true American  statesman and patriot, our late President George H.W. Bush.   My association with President Bush was through my hometown of  Augusta, home of the Masters Tournament, founded by the greatest  amateur golfer of all time, Bobby Jones. The Walker Cup, played by  teams of the best amateur golfers from the United States, Great  Britain, and Ireland every 2 years, was named after President Bush's  grandfather and his namesake.   I got to know President Bush. He was the first honorary chairman of  the First Tee organization. The sole purpose of the First Tee  organization is to give those young people who do not otherwise have  the economic means to play the game of golf the opportunity to play  this great game. President Bush was also only one of two Presidents to  be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.   He led a life of utmost distinction, and the family and friends he  leaves behind will always cherish the valuable time spent with this  American hero. As he is reunited with his wife, Barbara, and daughter,  Robin, in Heaven, we will continue to learn by his example always.  Those young folks who are playing golf now and learning those values  much appreciate it as well.   Rest in peace, Mr. President.
