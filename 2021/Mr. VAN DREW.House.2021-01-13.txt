 Madam Speaker, we have been here before. We have done  this before. This has failed before. We fractured our Nation using the  same process before. Congress must be the glue that starts unifying  everyone.   By the time this process would conclude, the man they want out of  office will no longer even be the President. If we want unity, this is  not the way.   America was and is the leading light in the world. This proceeding  has continued to cloak our Nation in darkness.   Nearly half the country supports our current President. This takes  their voice away. We must be bigger and better than the most base of  instincts that have been driving our political discourse. It is  destroying us. Let's link arms with one another and begin to heal.  Let's stop this impeachment.
