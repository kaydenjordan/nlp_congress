 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget we are debating here today is a  shockingly extreme document that gives to the rich and takes from  everyone else. It calls for more than $5 trillion in spending cuts that  threaten our economic progress and our national security, and it  willfully ignores the needs and priorities of the American people.   This budget isn't about conservative policy or reducing the size of  our debt and deficits. It is not even about American families. This  budget is about one thing: using budget reconciliation to ram through  giant tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations and to do it  without bipartisan support.                                time  1415    This budget and the tax cuts it exists to support are built on a  foundation of lies. They are part of a dangerous and deceptive three- step process Republicans have used before with serious consequences for  our Nation and the American people.   This is what they do. First, my Republican colleagues call for  massive tax cuts for the rich, claiming they will generate so much  economic growth, that they will pay for themselves. Last week,  congressional Republicans announced a $2.4 trillion tax cut plan that  benefits the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Yes, I said  trillions with a T.   For example, under this tax plan, millions of families making $50,000  a year would be subject to a tax increase, while millionaires get a  $230,000 average tax cut. That is not tax reform. That is a shakedown.   In total, individuals will see their taxes go up by more than $450  billion, while corporations, wealthy pass-through entities, and rich  estates get a tax cut totaling $2.9 trillion.   One might justifiably ask why anyone would want to do that. After  all, the income disparity in the United States is greater than almost  every other country on Earth, and it is getting larger. Just a few  decades ago, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned about one- fourth of all national income. Today, it is close to 40 percent. Yet,  once this plan is fully phased in, 80 percent of the entire tax cut in  this plan goes to just the top 1 percent, while 45 percent of all  households with children see a tax increase.   You could be someone who gets a $1 million salary, owns billions in  corporate stock, be a partner in a hedge fund, or just the heir to a  massive fortune, no matter the type of millionaire you are, Republicans  make sure you will get a tax cut. No matter how many times President  Trump, Secretary Mnuchin, or my colleagues across the aisle say it and  how much they hope the American people will fall for it, these tax cuts  won't pay for themselves.   That is not just my argument. That is the conclusion of the Federal  Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, and respected economists of  all stripes.   Conservative economist and former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin  said: ``There is just no evidence that the tax cuts actually pay for  themselves.''   Even Goldman Sachs, Secretary Mnuchin's former employer, says any  growth will be minimal, maybe up to two-tenths of a percent.   Bruce Bartlett, the man who wrote Reaganomics, which codified the  trickle-down theory, told Congress last week that he now thinks it is:  ``bull.'' Well, that is half of the word he used, but you get the idea.   The historical record is clear. We went through this in the early  1980s, the early 2000s under George W. Bush, and we recently saw it  play out to disastrous effect in Kansas. Now congressional Republicans  want to try it again.   We all know the truth. The tax cuts in this plan will increase  deficits and debt by approximately $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years  alone and trillions more in the years after. These aren't special,  supernatural tax cuts. They aren't going to magically defy expert  analysis, historical precedence, and empirical evidence. This budget  will  [[Page H7779]]  blow enormous holes in the Federal budget, which brings me to the  second part of the Republican deception.   When the growth fails to happen as promised and these tax cuts keep  digging our economy down deeper and deeper, Republicans will again  bemoan the horrors of deficits and debt.   These cries will lead us to the third and final part of the plan.  They will call for congressional action, not to roll back the tax cuts  to the wealthy that caused all the damage, but for drastic cuts to  important programs that the American people need and support.  Education, healthcare, research, infrastructure, and veterans' benefits  are already threatened in this budget. It includes an astonishing $5.4  trillion in spending cuts; $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid  alone. It even assumes $49 billion in cuts to veterans' benefits.   The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for  American families cannot be overstated, but more cuts will be coming if  my Republicans get their way with this budget. We will see more attacks  on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance, on  important benefits and services that help American families get ahead,  and on key investments that keep our economy and our Nation strong.   To be clear, and with all due respect to my friend and colleague from  Tennessee, by voting on this budget, for this budget, they are  jeopardizing meals and food assistance for 515,000 hungry children in  Tennessee so that the wealthiest person in that State, who has a net  worth of $8.8 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Democrats have a different budget and a far different vision for our  country. Our priorities reflect the priorities of the American people.   We invest in programs that will grow our economy, create good-paying  jobs, and provide real support for working families; public investments  that lead to a brighter future, such as rebuilding roads, bridges, and  other vital infrastructure; retirement security for seniors now and for  millions of Americans who fear they will never be able to afford to  stop working; affordable education so that young people will be able to  compete for the careers of the future; affordable, quality childcare  for hardworking parents; and affordable quality healthcare for all  Americans.   We believe in a government that helps individuals with nowhere left  to turn and a Tax Code that helps families get ahead. Those are  American priorities, and they should be the priorities of this  Congress.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this budget and support  the Democratic alternative.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would note for my colleague from Indiana  that by voting for this budget, he will force 1,150,553 seniors,  disabled individuals, and other seriously ill people in Indiana to pay  more for lifesaving Medicare all so that the wealthiest person in his  State, who has a net worth of $8 billion, can get a massive tax break.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Moulton), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I want to note for my friend and colleague  from Florida that by voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals  and food assistance for 1,448,000 hungry children in Florida so that  the wealthiest person in his State, who has a net worth of $13.2  billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  DelBene), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this dangerous budget  proposal.   With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt  to a rapidly changing economy, our top priority in Congress should be  to help expand opportunities and sustain long-term economic growth and  security so no American is left behind as we forge new paths ahead.                                time  1430    To spur robust job growth, we must invest in our education system to  provide the training and skills workers need to be prepared for the  jobs of today and tomorrow.   We should invest in infrastructure that will put people to work and  make our communities better places to do business, and we should invest  in growing a strong middle class, the backbone of our economy.   But instead, we are debating a budget that will go nowhere in the  Senate simply so it can be used as a vehicle to give the wealthiest  Americans a massive tax cut on the backs of middle class families.   This reckless budget cuts early childhood, K-12, and higher education  programs, as well as job training and apprenticeships. It guts  nutrition assistance, which provides benefits to more than 43 million  Americans a year, almost half of whom are children. It continues the  destructive cycle of neglecting our already crumbling infrastructure,  even though we know the longer we wait, the more costly repairs will be  in the future and the less economically competitive our communities  will be.   Slashing programs that help working families in order to line the  pockets of the wealthiest Americans has never led to jobs or economic  growth, and it never will. Every dollar we spend is a reflection of our  values, which is why I am deeply disappointed that this budget  demonstrates an utter disregard for middle class Americans, a lack of  vision for what our future could look like with smart, targeted  investments, and a complete lack of empathy for the most vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Chair, I would note, for my friend and colleague,  that by voting for this budget, he will force 678,763 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in Oklahoma to pay more for  lifesaving Medicare all so that the wealthiest person in his State, who  has a net worth of $10.2 billion, gets a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlemen from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlemen from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlemen from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I want to note for my colleague that, by  voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food assistance  for 2,319,000 hungry children in California so that the wealthiest  person in his State, who has a net worth of $62.4 billion, gets a  massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Neal), the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to note for my colleague that, by voting for this budget, he  will force 2,154,337 seniors, disabled individuals, and other seriously  ill people in Ohio to pay more for lifesaving Medicare all so that the  wealthiest person in his State, who has a net worth of $6.2 billion,  can get a massive tax cut.   And just in case my colleagues on the other side are wondering where  this information comes from as to the wealthiest person in each State,  it is from that notoriously leftwing magazine, Forbes, this year.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Higgins), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Ways  and Means Committee.   Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Chairman, any budget requires an  examination of how and who pays for it and how that budget impacts the  economy.   We were told by President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that  there would be no new tax cuts for the wealthy; and that this budget,  and its blueprint, is a middle class miracle. That was last Wednesday.   One week later, this Wednesday, the facts are in. If you make  $730,000 in America, next year your income will rise by 8.5 percent, or  $129,000, or $10,750 a month.   If you make $67,000, your income will rise by 1.2 percent, or $670  next year, or a whopping $56 a month. This is no miracle. This is fraud  being perpetrated against the middle class.   We are told that tax cuts pay for themselves through the magic of  dynamic scoring. Their budget will increase the deficit by $2.5  trillion over 10 years. Where are all the deficit hawks? Where are any  of the deficit hawks?   Goldman alumnus Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the National Economic Adviser,  said that this bill will grow the economy. Goldman economists said that  their budget will have no good impact in terms of growth in the Federal  budget over the next several years.   Finally, infrastructure. The infrastructure budget for America, a  nation of 300 million people, for the next 10 years is about the same  as we spent rebuilding the roads and bridges of Iraq and Afghanistan  over the last 10 years. This is unacceptable. We can do much better.    Mr. Chair, I would like to note for my colleague that,  by voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food assistance  for 809,000 hungry children in Georgia so that the wealthiest person in  his State, who has a net worth of $12.6 billion, can get a massive tax  cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the Democratic whip.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1  minute.    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1  minute.    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Chairman, I would note for my colleague that by  voting for this budget, he will force 594,596 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in Arkansas to pay more for  lifesaving Medicare all so that the wealthiest person in his State, who  has a net worth of $38.5 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my colleague  from South Carolina, and I certainly have a great deal of respect for  his thoughtfulness. But I also must note that if he votes for this  budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food assistance for 366,000 hungry  children in South Carolina so that the wealthiest person in his State,  who has a net worth of $3 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I would note for my colleague from Illinois  that, by voting for this budget, he will force 2,066,376 seniors,  disabled individuals, and other seriously ill people in Illinois to pay  more for lifesaving Medicare, all so that the wealthiest person in his  State, who has a net worth of $8 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey), who is the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for my colleague  that, by voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food  assistance for 2,060,000 hungry children in Texas so that the  wealthiest person in his State, who has a net worth of $38.2 billion,  can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), who is a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend, my fellow  alum, for his leadership. I recognize and thank the chairwoman of the  committee.   To my good friend that was on the floor, I think he wants limited  government when disaster is not in his district.   So I think it is important as a member of this Budget Committee of  which I am so very proud of its service, as the Democrats have worked  so hard, and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, a  committee called upon  [[Page H7786]]  for domestic tranquility and domestic security, might I just add that  we are now marking up a bill just a few floors away from this House  that is asking for $15 billion to pay for a border wall in the midst of  the horror of tragedy and in the midst of a lowering number of  individuals even coming to the United States across the border, the  very border wall that was told to us would be paid for by the people of  Mexico.   But I think the important point is that my good friends who are  supporting this dastardly budget that tears at the fabric of America  are, as well, supporting a tax cut for the wealthy that will provide  $2.9 trillion of debt to the American people and increase the debt as  well as the deficit. It will mean that working and middle class  families will have taxes raised on them by $470 billion. We will see  the heavy brunt of this budget on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   Just a few hours ago, I said the American people do not need to have  the government step on them; and I can assure you, with this budget,  which cuts more than $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare, we will  step on the American people.   We will end the Medicare guarantee, and it will narrowly shortchange  soft power by cutting and decimating the State Department, the very  partner that we need to continue the security of the American people,  raising defense, of whom I support all of our military. Texas is a  military State. But it is $72 billion above cap, and that is not giving  our military personnel their due. It is going above the needs of the  military.   We need to be prepared, but this skinny budget will undermine  education and the workforce at $326 billion, energy and commerce at  $1.56 billion, homeland security by $25 billion, justice and the needs  of civil justice by $67 billion, and veterans by $49 billion.   It will cut the Community Development Block Grant, and it will hurt  Virgin Islands U.S. citizens, Puerto Rico U.S. citizens, and Texas,  that is still struggling.   Before I came to this floor, I was engaging with my State about more  disaster food stamp sites because I have people who are unhoused in the  18th Congressional District, who are needing the resources.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have individuals who our wonderful  first responders had to drag out of the raging waters in Hurricane  Harvey. I have homes that were underwater that need disaster relief. I  have individuals who are walking along highways like oceans, and then I  have children who are with families who do not have jobs because of  Hurricane Harvey, who need the Children's Health Insurance Program or  need the disaster food stamps.   This is a budget that steps on the American people. It steps on our  disaster relief, and it does not recognize what the United States  Government is. It is a refuge and a relief for the American people.   Vote ``no'' on the Republican budget.   Mr. Chair, as a member of the Budget Committee, a senior member of  the Homeland Security Committee, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations, and the proud representative of the 700,000 residents  of 18th Congressional District of Texas who are still coping with the  devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, I rise in strong and unyielding  opposition to H. Con. Res. 71, the Congressional Budget Resolution for  Fiscal Year 2018.   Why do I urge every Member of this House to vote against this  Republican budget resolution, laughingly called the ``Building a Better  America Budget,'' but which more accurately should be named the  ``Nightmare on Capitol Hill Budget''?   Let us count the ways; here are eight to start.   1. Republican budget mandates $5.4 trillion in spending cuts to top  priorities like disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research,  veteran benefits, and programs that expand opportunities for American  families.   2. Republican budget provides $2.9 trillion in tax cuts to  millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations, while raising  taxes on working and middle class families by $470 billion.   3. The budget includes fast-track reconciliation procedures to push  through cuts to programs that tens of millions of Americans count on  totaling $203 billion across 11 House committees.   4. The steep reductions in program investments proposed in this  Republican budget fall most heavily on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   5. Republican budget immediately guts investment critical to  expanding economic opportunity by lowering the already inadequate  austerity-level spending caps by an additional $5 billion in 2018 and  by even more in subsequent years.   6. Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage  because in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of  healthcare, denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions,  and raising costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.5  trillion from Medicaid and Medicare.   7. Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for  replacing Medicare's guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the  purchase of health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto  seniors and disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to  Medicare over ten years.   8. The Republican budget focuses too narrowly on the military,  shortchanging American soft-power and other essential elements of  national security by increasing defense spending by $72 billion above  the cap and hollowing out the State Department and foreign aid agencies  with cuts of $11 billion and environmental and natural resource  protection by more than $6 billion.   Mr. Chair, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it  is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation.   Sadly, this Republican budget, just like the President's ``skinny  budget'' fails this moral test of government.   America will not be made great by stealing another $1.5 trillion from  Medicare and Medicaid, abandoning seniors and families in need,  depriving students of realizing a dream to attend college without  drowning in debt, or disinvesting in the working families just to give  unwanted tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy.   Even a cursory review leaves the inescapable conclusion that this  budget represents a betrayal--of our values as a nation, and of the  promises made by the President during the election campaign.   This Republican budget is not a budget for the real world that real  Americans live in but is as much a fantasy budget as the Trump ``Skinny  Budget'' in that it pretends to achieve balance by assuming that  painless spending cuts can and will be made by the following standing  committees of Congress in the following amounts:   1. Agriculture Committee: cut $207 billion   2. Armed Services Committee: cut $33 billion   3. Education and Workforce Committee: $326 billion   4. Energy and Commerce Committee: $1.656 trillion   5. Financial Services Committee: cut $124 billion   6. Homeland Security Committee: cut $25 billion   7. Judiciary Committee: cut $67 billion   8. Natural Resources Committee: cut $59 billion   9. Oversight and Government Reform Committee: cut $282 billion   10. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee: cut $3 billion   11. Veterans Affairs Committee: cut $49 billion   12. Ways and Means Committee: cut $800 billion   13. Unassigned (i.e., Intelligence; Foreign Affairs; Small Business;  Science, Space, and Technology Committees: cut $747 billion   14. Total Cuts: $4.38 trillion   To put these reckless, irresponsible, and draconian budget cuts in  perspective, it is useful to examine what they mean when applied to the  programs depended upon by Americans to rise up the economic ladder,  plan for the future, provide for their families, and strive to achieve  the American Dream.   The elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants  (CDBG) drains resources from communities, even in times of disaster  because CDBG provides flexible grants to local communities for a wide  range of unique needs, including Meals on Wheels, housing programs, and  community infrastructure improvements.   The Republican budget targets disaster grants made by the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, which help families and businesses when  their disaster-related property losses are not covered by insurance.  [[Page H7787]]    The Republican budget makes higher education more expensive by  cutting $211 billion from student financial aid programs, like Pell  Grants, over ten years.   The Republican budget also eliminates subsidized loans, making it  difficult for students, particularly low-income students, to afford  college and compounds the damage by making it more difficult to repay  student loans by eliminating the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness and  Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs.   The Republican budget's solution to the affordable housing crisis  currently facing cities large and small all across the country is to  convert all discretionary spending on affordable housing into a block  grant, which means there will be even less assistance to help the 71  percent of extremely low income renter households who spend more than  half their income on housing.   The Republican budget cuts $154 billion from the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next ten years by  essentially converting it to a block grant, cutting off funding for  eligible individuals and requiring cash-strapped states to either fill  in the gap or take away food assistance from millions of working  families, children, and seniors.   Mr. Chair, as economists and policy experts have documented time and  again, immigration reform would expand the size of the U.S. workforce,  and in turn would increase the size of the economy and reduce deficits.   The Republican budget, however, again rejects comprehensive  immigration reform that would bring clear and just rules for those  seeking citizenship and help secure the nation's borders.   In doing so, the Republican budget squanders an opportunity to reduce  deficits by an estimated $900 billion over the next two decades, boost  the economy by 5.4 percent, and extend the solvency of Social Security.   Mr. Chair, none of us can forget the President's favorite boast and  central campaign promise that he would build a wall on our southern  border and guarantee that Mexico would be made to pay for it.   The Republican budget deprives the President of the opportunity to  make good on his foolish boast by forcing American taxpayers to foot  the bill for President Trump's $1.6 billion border wall that will do  nothing to stop unauthorized entry into the country and will not fix  our broken immigration system.   The Republican budget continues to target federal employees by  cutting their compensation and benefits by at least another $163  billion over ten years, which comes on top of the $182 billion in cuts  federal employees have already absorbed in the form of higher  retirement contributions, pay freezes, and furloughs.   The Republican budget puts U.S. transportation network on the road to  ruin by slashing transportation spending, by $254 billion over ten  years, or 25 percent below current estimates.   The Republican budget cuts hurts veterans by cutting veterans  benefits by nearly $50 billion over the next ten years, with newly  eligible veterans experiencing cuts in programs that pay for education  benefits as well as loan guarantees.   Finally, Mr. Chair, it must be pointed out that the Republican  budget's pretension to balance is based on reliance on trillions of  dollars in budget games and gimmicks to rig the numbers.   The Republican budget counts a dubious $1.8 trillion ``economic  dividend'' from cutting taxes and taking away consumer protections that  is not backed up by any credible analysis and assumes $1.5 trillion of  this ``dividend'' will go toward deficit reduction.   The Republican budget assumes, despite all precedent and evidence to  the contrary, that tax reform will be revenue neutral, even though  Republican tax plans are projected to lose between $3 trillion and $7  trillion.   Given these budgetary shenanigans, never could it more truly be said  that ``figures don't lie, but liars figure.''   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are       in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.    It is for this reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget  resolution, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal  responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also  pass a ``moral test.''   The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.   Because the American people deserve to know exactly what ills  Republicans have in store for them, I strongly oppose H. Con. Res. 71  and urge all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel,  and heartless measure that will do nothing to improve the lives or  well-being of middle and working class families.    Mr. Chairman, I would note for my colleague that, by  voting for this budget, he will force 1,895,558 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in Michigan to pay more for  lifesaving Medicare all so the wealthiest person in his State, who has  a net worth of $5.9 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), a distinguished member of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee and an alumnus of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for my colleague that  by voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food assistance  for 200,000 hungry children in Arkansas all so that the wealthiest  person in his State, who has a net worth of $38.5 billion, can get a  massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pascrell), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.    I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 30  seconds.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is reminded to direct all remarks to  the Chair.    Mr. Chairman, I would note for my colleague that, by  voting for this budget, he will force 1,519,461 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in Georgia to pay more for  lifesaving Medicare all so that the wealthiest person in his State, who  has a net worth of $12.6 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Crowley) the Democratic Caucus chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for my friend and  colleague that by voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and  food assistance for 216,000 hungry children in Minnesota so that the  wealthiest person in his State, who has a net worth of $5.4 billion,  gets a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Financial Services  Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to the Republican's 2018 budget, which would dramatically  increase our deficit and debt by trillions of dollars to give  millionaires and billionaires a massive tax cut.   Don't be fooled. This plan directly benefits President Trump, his  family, and his administration, including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,  Education Secretary DeVos, and Commerce Secretary Ross, but offers  breadcrumbs for the middle class and nothing for low-income Americans.   The craziest thing about all of this is that Republicans have been  crowing for 7 years that the deficit is too large and that it is  hurting our job growth, yet here they go abandoning their principles to  cash out their rich benefactors.   I also want to talk about some of the ways Republicans partially pay  for this tax cut for the rich. During the same week that Equifax and  Wells Fargo executives are testifying about the harm they have caused  to millions of Americans, Republicans propose gutting the Consumer  Bureau, which has successfully helped millions of our constituents  receive compensation by effectively eliminating its funding and  independence.  [[Page H7790]]    What is more, Republicans would eliminate the backup authority to  safely unwind failing megabanks without harm to our economy. Rather  than eliminate this tool, we should instead be talking about how to  break up bad megabanks like Wells Fargo, who repeatedly break the law  and harm millions of consumers. Yet, both the Consumer Bureau and the  megabank wind-down authority are sacrificed to pay for the richest 1  percent tax cut.   So I would urge all of my colleagues to reject this measure.    Mr. Chairman, I would note for my colleague that by  voting for this budget, he will force 1,895,558 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in Michigan to pay more for  lifesaving Medicare all so that the wealthiest person in his State, who  has net worth of $5.9 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I want to note for my colleague that by  voting for this budget, he is jeopardizing meals and food assistance  for 734,000 hungry children in Pennsylvania all so that the wealthiest  person in his State, who has a net worth of $3.8 billion, gets a  massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, debating this budget resolution  is a partisan and pointless exercise, and I will point out to the  chairman that it is October, after the fiscal year has expired and  after we have already passed every single appropriations bill out of  the House of Representatives, and, I might add, a continuing budget  resolution.                                time  1600    Just as when we considered it in committee this summer, this  resolution stands as a demonstration of the  [[Page H7791]]  majority's willful and disgraceful neglect of the needs of the American  people.   With so many critical legislative issues for us to discuss, the  majority has decided it is a better use of our time to discuss tax  breaks for millionaires and wealthy corporations; taking healthcare  away from 20 million Americans; blowing up our deficit with an  ineffective, immoral border wall; and gutting crucial investments in  jobs, education, and medical research.   Instead, this House should be enacting legislation to expand  background checks and ban assault weapons to combat senseless firearm  violence after this Nation witnessed, once again, the deadliest mass  shooting in U.S. history.   This House should be passing the Dream Act to protect DREAMers who  call this Nation home and protect them from this administration's  heartless deportations.   Finally, instead of wasting taxpayer dollars and our constituents'  time with this harmful budget resolution, this House should be  reauthorizing CHIP, the bipartisan-backed Children's Health Insurance  Program, which expired over the weekend and which potentially is going  to leave children who badly need healthcare insurance twisting in the  wind without it.   Congressional Republicans have chosen instead to bring this  incredibly irresponsible and extreme bill to the floor.   In stunning ignorance of reality, it assumes TrumpCare will still  pass. Just how many times must the majority be reminded that TrumpCare  is not going to become law and the Affordable Care Act is the law of  the land that Americans support?   How many times will the majority try to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion,  cut Medicare benefits, and raise insurance costs on elderly and low- income Americans?   Enough is enough. Instead of pandering to the well connected and our  worst impulses, this budget should embody America's best values, and it  is far from it.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Weber of Texas). The time of the gentlewoman  has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from Florida an  additional 30 seconds.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Sadly, this budget does not reflect our  responsibility to care for and invest in the American people.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I would remind my colleague that, by  voting for this budget, he will force 941,169 seniors, disabled  individuals, and other seriously ill people in South Carolina to pay  more for lifesaving Medicare, all so that the wealthiest person in his  State, who has a net worth of $3 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Krishnamoorthi), a distinguished member of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time both sides have  remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 33\1/4\ minutes  remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 37\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from Washington an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from Washington an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chair, typically, a budget is a  blueprint for how our government plans to meet our obligations to our  people; but not this time.   By including reconciliation instructions for their tax plan, the  Republicans are using this budget as a blueprint to give tax cuts to  the wealthiest few, without requiring bipartisan support.   Under this bill, a family making $50,000 a year could see their tax  burden go up, while millionaires will save $230,000. And who will pay  to make the rich richer? Our working families, children, and seniors.   This budget slashes priorities like education, infrastructure, and  veterans' benefits, and even guts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5  trillion.   ``You can't make guarantees,'' is how Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  responded when asked if the Republican tax plan would help the middle  class. But the thing is, you can make guarantees. If this Republican  budget moves forward, it will guarantee that inequality gets worse,  while the rest of us pay to help make millionaires into billionaires.   Mr. Chairman, I reject this budget and ask my colleagues to oppose  it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a distinguished member of the Appropriations  Committee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this budget  resolution.   A budget is a moral document. It reflects our values. This budget is  a stark reminder that the majority and the Trump administration are  waging a war on the middle class and eviscerating the social safety net  programs that help our most vulnerable citizens.   The social safety net was built on a bipartisan basis. Why is the  majority hell-bent on destroying it?   Older Americans will suffer under this budget. It cuts $1.5 trillion  from Medicare and Medicaid. It betrays middle class job seekers by  cutting job training, education programs, and other nondefense programs  by 34 percent over the next 10 years.   It decimates the Food Stamp program, SNAP benefits and assumes the  enactment of the House-passed repeal of the Affordable Care Act,  targeting American families who are struggling to get by.   If we were serious about addressing the problems that face middle  class families, we would be voting on a budget resolution that invests  in their priorities: job training, apprenticeships, paid family and  medical leave, fair trade, and equal pay for equal work.   Instead, we are considering a budget that is merely a means for the  majority to jam through their tax cuts for the wealthy and for  corporations.   The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people  now are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We should be  growing the middle class and looking for solutions that work for  America's families.   We ought to be prioritizing the needs of working families, the ones  who have entrusted us to come to Washington to fight for them and to  fight for their families. Instead, this budget puts corporate profits  first. It caters to those with the most lobbyists.   This budget is a disgrace to the promises that we have made to the  American people, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong opposition to the Republican budget proposal.   As the ranking member on the Transportation Committee, I want to  focus in a little bit on what they do to transportation.   We heard great promises from President Trump of a trillion dollars in  new investment. Nothing has come from the White House. The first  substantive action on transportation in this Congress is going to be  the Republicans in the House of Representatives cutting transportation  funding by $254 billion.   That is right. No trillion dollars of new spending. We are going to  spend $254 billion less.   They are going to eliminate all long-route trains, isolating rural  America. They are going to lose essential air service in rural America.  And, by the way, the Republicans want to toll your interstate. So if  you live in rural America, you can get in your car to go somewhere, but  now you are going to have to pay to use the highway you already paid  for.   Secondly, it eliminates critical funding for our urban areas, the  economic engines of this country. It eliminates TIGER grants for  freight and multimodal projects. It eliminates new investment in  transit, new start projects. It eliminates all investments in high- speed rail and eliminates specific funding for bicycle and pedestrian  projects. The Republicans just hate bicycles.   It also goes on--and this is totally amazing--seriously, you are  going to cut funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency?  Haven't you been watching television? I think they are already out of  money. You are going to cut funding?   We want to do away with those programs that might mitigate the  disaster of future floods and hurricanes. You are going to cut grants  for firefighters.   Then, that is not enough. We are going to roll back Davis-Bacon  protections for people who work on federally funded projects. We are  going to roll back Buy American? Really? So it is ``Buy Chinese'' in  the Republican budget. Buy Chinese.   They want to devolve the obligation to fund Federal highways to the  States. I have got news for you: we have tried that.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 1 minute.   Mr. DeFAZIO. This is Kansas and Oklahoma. This is Kansas before we  had the Eisenhower--by the way, a Republican--National Highway Program.  They built their turnpike. Oklahoma said they would build theirs. They  didn't. They were out of money. They didn't build it until they got an  80 percent Federal match.   So let's go back to the good, old days. We are going to devolve the  obligations of putting together a 21st century transportation system in  this country, knitting our country together, getting rid of congestion,  moving people and goods more efficiently, but we are going to do it on  a State-by-State basis. That is nuts. I just can't believe this.   Then, there is another little trick. The chairman of my committee  wants to privatize the airspace in the United States and reduce the  ticket tax that  [[Page H7800]]  pays for air traffic control. That would be a $10 billion windfall to  the airline industry, because they will raise prices. Then they are  going to charge you a head fee to get on the plane.   Even better, it creates $100 billion of new deficit. So this nifty  little thing here contains a reserve fund of $100 billion to try and  make up for the fact and hide the fact that they are cutting $100  billion of taxes that pay for the current system.    How are you going to pay for the next system?   The airlines will determine that, not Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Fudge), a distinguished member of the Agriculture Committee  and a fellow rabid Cleveland Indians fan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, we have had numerous letters submitted to us taking a  position in opposition to this budget resolution, and I think they are  pretty compelling, and I would like to read from some of them.   Here is a letter from the Main Street Alliance:         Main Street Alliance, a network of small business owners       throughout the country, strongly urges you to oppose H. Con.       Res. 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. This budget,       if enacted into law, would cut $3.4 trillion from Medicaid,       Medicare, Social Security, education, employment and       training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure       spending over the next 10 years. This will significantly harm       small business owners and their employees, damage local       economies, and decimate State budgets.        We urge you to protect Main Street small business owners,       working families, communities, and economies, and oppose the       House budget resolution. Reject any budget that enables tax       cuts for the very wealthy and large profitable corporations       to lose revenue, since it will force deep cuts in vital       programs that harm small business.    This letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security  and Medicare:         On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,       I urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the House fiscal year       2018 budget resolution, and the Republican Study Committee       budget. Instead, I ask you to support the Democratic Caucus,       Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Congressional Black       Caucus budgets.        The committee-passed budget resolution would slash funding       to Medicare and Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and       make it easier for Congress to cut Social Security, all to       pay for massive tax cuts for the very wealthy and profitable       corporations.    This from the American Public Health Association:         On behalf of the American Public Health Association, a       diverse community of public health professionals who champion       the health of all people and communities, I write in strong       opposition to the House FY 2018 budget resolution, H. Con.       Res. 71. This proposal does not eliminate sequestration and       would drastically cut nondefense discretionary spending. Such       cuts would devastate our Nation's public health and safety       net system and would have a disproportionate impact on our       Nation's most vulnerable citizens.        The proposal also includes the House passed repeal of the       Affordable Care Act that would force millions to lose       coverage, end the Medicaid expansion, drastically reduce       Federal funding for the Medicaid program, and lead to       increased cost and fewer benefits for millions of Americans.    This letter from the AFSCME, American Federation of State and County  Municipal Employees:         On behalf of the 1.6 million members of AFSCME, I urge you       to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget       resolution approved by the House Budget Committee and       scheduled to be considered in the full House.        This budget would impose considerable hardship on many       Americans in order to slash taxes for the wealthy and       corporations to boost defense spending. Rather than       increasing revenues for investment that creates jobs and       spurs economic growth, the proposed budget creates a fast-      track process for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit       corporations and the wealthy.        In fact, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center,       the Trump GOP tax cut would largely benefit the richest 1       percent. The budget also relies on the gimmicks of dynamic       scoring and sham accounting, hiding the true cost of       unnecessary and harmful tax cuts.    And this, from AARP:         Proposals creating a defined contribution premium support       program, restricting access by raising the age of       eligibility, or allowing hospitals and providers to       arbitrarily charge customers higher prices than Medicare can       make healthcare unaffordable for older Americans. These       proposals do little to actually lower the cost of healthcare       but simply shifts cost from Medicare on to individuals, many       of whom cannot afford to pay for their care.        Efforts to reduce or cap Medicaid funding could endanger       the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who       depend on the essential services provided through this       program.        Furthermore, caps could result in significant cost shifts       to State governments unable to shoulder the cost of care       without sufficient Federal support.        Proposals to block grant the program or impose work       requirements will make SNAP less responsive and accessible in       times of need, and without clear work requirement exemptions       for the elderly and disabled, would bar these individuals       from receiving SNAP benefits.        We ask you to reject the cuts proposed in H. Con. Res. 71.       We stand ready to work with you to develop proposals that       protect and improve Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and       SNAP.    This from the Alliance for Retired Americans:         On behalf of the more than 4.3 million members of the       Alliance for Retired Americans, I am writing to urge you to       vote against H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY       2018. This budget blueprint cuts spending by $5.4 trillion       over 10 years, disseminating numerous domestic programs,       including those that benefit older Americans.        It is shocking that the same budget that cuts services for       many low-income Americans and raises taxes on the middle       class will  [[Page H7802]]       also carry instructions to provide $2.4 trillion in tax cuts       to corporations and wealthy Americans.        These tax cuts, which will increase the deficit, sets up       the perfect scenario for Congress to slash Medicare and       Medicaid. We are not fooled by the House leadership's tax       giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Americans       and urge you to oppose this draconian budget. We will be       watching how you vote on this important issue.    This is a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs:         On behalf of the Coalition on Human Needs, I strongly urge       you to vote ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 71, the proposed FY 2018       budget resolution, and to vote for the substitute budgets       advanced by the Congressional Progressive Caucus,       Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic alternative       budget resolution. Our members understand that the economic       security of millions of American families depends on building       on the progress we have made in health coverage, jobs, basic       living standards, and ensuring that our children are well       prepared for productive lives.        But the majority's proposed budget does not build. It       breaks apart our engines of progress. It will make our Nation       weaker for decades to come.        The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be       a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars       from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security       and opportunity.        Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax credits, nutrition       assistance, education, and housing assistance, these are just       some of the services the budget would massively cut.        The budget takes trillions in funding that supports       economic security and progress and hands it to the wealthy       and corporations in the form of enormous tax cuts.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this has been a robust debate. We had a robust debate  in the Rules Committee yesterday, and we have had robust debates in the  committee markup and during hearings, as well, over the priorities of  this country.   As we close this debate tonight, recognizing there will be a few  minutes tomorrow for comments, I just want to say that, since this  could very well be the last time that I get to appear in Budget  Committee business with Chairman Black, I have truly cherished the 9  months that we have spent working together.   The chairman is a gracious, fair, thoughtful, and very, very  collegial individual, and I wish her the best in her campaign, at least  through the primary. I thank her and her very, very competent and  professional staff for all of the courtesies they have shown us during  this year and this process.   I also want to pay tribute to the Democratic staff, people who work  very, very hard every day and are brilliant in their fields and make me  sound smarter than I probably am, but I would like to read their names:  Jon Antista; Erika Appel; Ellen Balis, the staff director; Hayden  Flanery; Jon Goldman; Elliott Grantz; Jocelyn Harris; Najy Kamal; Sam  Lau; Sheila McDowell; Diana Meredith; Farouk Ophaso; Kimberly Overbeek;  Scott Russell; and Ted Zegers.   They do terrific work, and I want them to know how much I and all the  members of the Budget Committee, the minority, appreciate their work.   I would also like to thank my personal staff, led by my chief of  staff, Julie Carr, for the work they contribute to this process as  well.   In closing, there are a few comments I want to make about this  debate.   We heard several times during the day that it is really not fair to  talk about the consequences of the tax proposal that will be the end  result of this process because the details haven't been ironed out yet.  That is, you know, fair enough as it goes, but there were enough  details in the outline that we saw last week to make a pretty good  guess as to what the impact of these tax cuts would be.   Now, we have read over and over, as Republican speakers spoke, the  fact that they were willing to jeopardize the health and safety and  nutrition of their citizens to give the wealthiest people in their  State tax cuts. Most of these numbers that we read were in the billions  of dollars: $38 billion, $16 billion. These are individuals with net  worths of astounding amounts.   The outline that was publicly released last week said that the  Republicans intend, under this tax proposal, to eliminate the estate  tax. If they eliminate the estate tax, much of that money is not going  to be taxed. They will get to keep it. I don't think that they are  going to be out there creating new companies. Maybe their children will  do it if they inherit it. Maybe they have given some of it away so  those estates aren't quite as big. I suspect many of them have.   The point is, when you are talking about wealth, collectively, the  wealthiest persons in the 50 States, collectively, have $750 billion in  net worth, which means that, if they paid the estate tax, there would  be over $300 billion in money that they would save if you eliminated  the estate tax.   So while, yes, we may be off plus or minus 3 percent or 5 percent or  10 percent, the fact is that this is an enormous break for the people  who have been the most fortunate in this country. I think it is more  than fair to say, if you say you are going to eliminate the estate tax,  if you say you are going to eliminate the AMT, the alternative minimum  tax, and we can go look at President Trump's 2005 tax return, which  said he paid $31 million in tax because of the alternative minimum tax,  it doesn't take any details to know that he would have saved $31  million in that year if you eliminate the alternative minimum tax.   So, yes, the rates may vary. Ultimately, the tax bill that we have  presented to us may not lower the highest rate from 39.6 to 35 percent,  but if it does, we know the impact that that will have. We know who  will benefit most from that. It is the wealthiest 1 percent of this  country.    As I will say tomorrow when we close this debate, I am in the top 1  percent. Half of this body are millionaires. They are all going to  benefit. We are all going to benefit. Meanwhile, the people who rely on  many of the programs that will be slashed under this Republican budget  will suffer. That is not fair.   Now, Republicans will make the argument, as they always do because  this is a matter of religious faith to them, that if you give people  more money, they will magically create all this growth. Well, has that  really happened?   Out of the Fortune 500 companies, I think, in a recent study, 92 of  them paid 20 percent or less in corporate tax. Collectively, they  eliminated 300,000 jobs over a 5-year period. So they had more money  than corporations paying 35 percent. Did they use it to create more  jobs, more wealth among middle class and working families? No. They  used it to pay dividends, to buy back stock, and to increase the wages  of their CEOs.   That is what has happened in modern history every time we lower  corporate tax rates or we let them bring taxes in from overseas. They  do not create more jobs with the money that they save.   So I think it is very, very fair for us to look at this entire  process, the budget proposal, which does anticipate a tax cut--which  they claim is revenue neutral, but it is a tax cut--and the outline  that we saw last week and say: Who, really, is this going to help?   It is not going to help the people who need the help. It is going to  give more money to the people who already occupy one of the strongest  economic positions in a country with the greatest disparity of wealth  in the world.   So as we conclude this debate, I urge my colleagues to carefully  consider the alternatives that will be proposed by the Democratic  Caucus, by the Congressional Black Caucus, and by the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, and compare the values and the priorities of those  budgets to those that the Republican budget represents.   I think, on balance, anybody in good faith will say that those  budgets, not the Republican budgets, are the budgets that will create a  stronger, fairer society in this country, and those are the ones that  we should proceed to adopt.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1800
