 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, Mr. Massie, for  introducing this bill.   I am listening to some of the arguments on the Democrat side here  today, and I hear about vaccine conspiracies. I am not hearing that  over here. In fact, I am vaccinated. I have the boosters. I think it  was important to do that.    I am proud of what we were able to get done through Operation Warp  Speed. We protected many Americans. But I don't understand the argument  that this has anything to do with vaccine conspiracies.   I was contacted by a constituent, Hunter McBryde, who informed me  that this particular mandate, that almost no one else in the world has  in place, is keeping his family separated. This is keeping his kids  from seeing their grandparents.   He is from the district that I represent in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  He happened to be studying in Australia for his Ph.D. when the pandemic  started. His wife is an Australian citizen. They share three beautiful  children.   Because of this shortsighted policy, Hunter and his family have been  unable to move back home to Lancaster County to be with the rest of  their extended family here simply because of the family's vaccination  and immigration status.   I contacted the CDC on behalf of the family and was told that the  agency still believes that COVID vaccines, not testing, not  quarantining, are necessary to protect public safety, despite the fact  that President Biden has said the pandemic is over.   Mr. Chairman, 147 countries, including Canada, U.K., Italy, France,  Australia, South Korea, and many others are totally open to tourists,  regardless of their vaccination status. Another 57 nations allow  tourists to take a COVID test or quarantine if they are unvaccinated.   The worst of this pandemic is clearly over. There is no reason that  the CDC should continue to discriminate against tourists or residents  who, for health or religious reasons, do not wish to receive the COVID  vaccine.
