 Mr. President, first, I want to thank my friend from  Washington State, who has been such a leader on healthcare.   In looking at her chart, at the junk insurance amendment and all of  the groups opposing it, it reminds me of the calls I used to get prior  to the Affordable Care Act from someone who was healthy and young and  had a policy for years that was only $50 a month. He thought it was  great. Then, all of a sudden, he got sick or his child got sick.   He called me up and said: I paid into insurance all of these years,  and they only covered 1 day in the hospital.  [[Page S3987]]    I remember having that conversation with somebody--or no days in the  hospital. That is what you call a junk insurance plan.   This latest version of the healthcare bill would allow that to come  back so that somebody will have the false confidence in paying $30,  $40, $50 a month and thinking he has insurance. Then, if something  happens, he will find out it is just a bunch of junk and that it does  not cover anything. That is going to be legal again. Right now, it is  not legal to do that. With health reform, we stopped that. But that  would be legal again under this proposal, and I am deeply concerned  about that.   I am obviously rising to talk about the Republican healthcare bill. I  do not believe it is a healthcare bill, but that is what we are  debating, is healthcare or whether healthcare will be taken away. What  I would rather be doing is working with my friend who is in the chair  on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We have worked on many  things together--mental health and addiction services. I would rather  be doing that than debating what we are debating. I would rather be  focused on how we lower the cost of prescription drugs, which is the  cost I hear about the most from my constituents, or about other out-of- pocket costs for people who are in the private insurance system, the  individual insurance market.   We do have situations in which copays and deductibles are too high in  the private insurance market. Gutting Medicaid will do nothing about  that--nothing. It will just take away healthcare from tens of millions  of people. It will not change the private insurance market at all,  which is where I believe we need to focus, and I am anxious to do that  and work across the aisle in order to do that.   I want to make sure we are talking about building on healthcare  coverage, lowering costs, and tackling prescription drug costs.  Instead, this bill would take away healthcare from millions of  Americans. We know that from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office. We don't know yet how many millions under the current version,  but we know that at some point, we will get a score on that from the  Budget Office. We know it will be a lot of people who are going to lose  their insurance, and they don't need to lose their insurance in order  to tackle bringing down the cost of insurance.    So what do we know about this proposal? The versions keep changing,  but it is the same old song over and over again--a little bit of  change, a little bit of different refrain, but it is the same old song  in the end. What we know is that doctors don't like it and nurses don't  like it, hospitals don't like it, insurance companies don't like it.   People in Michigan don't like it. They have called and written and  told me in person, people approaching me in Fourth of July parades.  People are scared. They are concerned. A woman's mom is in a nursing  home who has Alzheimer's disease, and she is panicked. Three out of  five seniors in nursing homes in Michigan are there with the help of  Medicaid health insurance. Others are deeply concerned about their  family members, their children, themselves.   This is called the Better Care Act, but there is nothing better about  it. Democrats have ideas to actually make our healthcare system better,  by stabilizing our insurance markets and making premiums more  affordable. My friend Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced the  Marketplace Certainty Act. It would ensure cost-sharing payments that  were part of healthcare reform, that they would actually remain in a  stabilizing way so they could be counted on. This would offer peace of  mind to families and stability to the market.   Senators Carper, Kaine, Nelson, and Shaheen introduced the Individual  Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, which would create a  permanent reinsurance program, which we had before--before it was  changed 2 years ago--to stabilize the market and bring down premiums.   There have been things that would happen to destabilize the markets.  Two years ago, there was an action, and now with a new administration  we need to stop that and reverse it and stabilize the markets.   Senator Heitkamp has a proposal that helps more families afford  health insurance by smoothing out the individual market tax credit  cliff that is there--the tax credits that help low-income, moderate- income people be able to afford insurance--to fix that in a way that is  more beneficial to families.   Senator McCaskill's Health Care Options for All Act would allow  people who live in a county without an insurer on the exchange--they  don't have anybody in the private individual marketplace exchange, no  insurance company--to sign up for the same exchange plans we have.  There are people being covered. We hear a lot about Iowa, for instance.  Even though there may be no private insurance companies doing a private  marketplace option, Senators, Representatives, our staffs who are  required to be in, as they say, ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act,  have an exchange. So to help people immediately, we could allow the  people of Iowa to get the same option that their Members of Congress in  Iowa have and that their staffs have. That would be possible, as a way  to address this issue in the short run and to help people. I don't know  why somebody who is in Iowa or Michigan or anyplace else shouldn't be  able to get the exact same coverage a Member of Congress can get.   Here is what we do know in terms of the ideas in the bill. Our  Republican colleagues know how unpopular the bill is. A new poll found  that only 12 percent--12 percent--of Americans support this bill. It is  so unpopular they have been trying to rewrite it and get enough votes  to pass it. We keep hearing about changes, but unfortunately none of  these amendments make it better. In some cases, like the junk insurance  policies that will be allowed, they actually make it worse.   Now, the proposal that would provide $45 million to tackle the opioid  epidemic, even Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich said it would be like  spitting in the ocean. It is not enough, he said. I appreciate the  focus on that. It is a horrible epidemic. It is an epidemic in Michigan  and across the country, but it is certainly not enough to make up for  the huge cuts to Medicaid insurance--healthcare insurance, as the  Senator from Washington State indicated.   The other proposal that we understand is in the new bill, as I  mentioned before, would give insurers the freedom to once again refuse  to cover basic health services like maternity care or addiction  treatment, as long as one plan they offer, among many, would include  essential health benefits. So everything else could be junk, and there  would be one high-cost plan that would actually cover things families  need.   Insurance companies themselves know this is a terrible idea. In a  letter to Senator Cruz and Senator Lee, Scott Serota, president and CEO  of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, wrote that their plan ``is  unworkable as it would undermine pre-existing condition  protections, increase premiums and destabilize the market.'' That is  what is viewed as this great new provision in the bill.    He added: ``The result would be higher premiums, increased federal  tax credit costs for coverage available on exchanges, and insurers  exiting the market or pricing coverage out of reach of consumers.''   In other words, premiums would skyrocket for older people, people who  take prescription drug medications, people with chronic conditions.  Everyone else would be left with the junk insurance policy that doesn't  cover really anything, and they feel OK unless they get sick. We would  all be stuck with a fragmented, destabilized insurance market.   Remember preexisting conditions? This would bring them right back.   This bill is wrong for many, many people, but let me mention Felicia.  In 2011, she was an AmeriCorps member serving in Lansing who didn't  have health insurance. When she started feeling tired all the time and  losing weight, she went to the Center for Family Health in Jackson.   Felicia was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Center  for Family Health helped her get coverage through Medicaid and care at  the University of Michigan, including chemotherapy and later a stem  cell transplant.   Felicia writes:         Now I am feeling awesome. I am cancer-free, and I am       working part time while I am  [[Page S3988]]       finishing up college. I feel that I owe my life to the Center       for Family Health.    Felicia knows the importance of comprehensive health coverage. It  saved her life.   Nick and Chelsey know it too. They and their three young children are  covered by Healthy Michigan, our State's Medicaid expansion. Nick and  Chelsey are both employed full time. Chelsey also attends college full  time.   During a routine visit, doctors discovered that her oldest son was  born with an obstructed kidney, which had lost one-third of its  function by the time he was 5 years old. Thanks to the Medicaid  expansion, he was able to have surgery before his kidney lost all  function. Without the Medicaid expansion, which ends under the  Republican bill, these working parents and their three children  couldn't afford healthcare coverage, let alone surgery.   Margo knows this because she sees it every day. She manages a clinic  in Kent County on the west side of the State. She said the lives of  patients are much different today than they were a few years ago. Margo  wrote:         Seeing working people who have struggled all of their adult       lives to manage their chronic health conditions finally have       access to regular doctor visits, health education, and       prescription medications has been a tremendous relief. You       cannot imagine the sense of dignity our patients feel.    She added:         Please see it in your heart to care about the people of       Michigan who work but do not get insurance through their       employer.    So, finally, let me just say, doctors know this is a bad bill. Nurses  know this is a bad bill. Hospitals know this is a bad bill. Insurance  companies know this is a bad bill. I know that even many of my  Republican friends know this is a bad bill. Their amendments haven't  changed that. Costs go up and care goes down. Preexisting conditions  come back. Millions lose their coverage.   What we should be doing is working together to stabilize the  marketplace, reduce out-of-pocket costs, and lower the outrageous costs  of prescription drugs--by the way, not giving a tax cut to prescription  drug companies, as is in this bill, and other companies as well.   Felicia, Nick, Chelsey, and millions more like them in Michigan and  across this country deserve that much.   I sincerely hope that when it comes time to vote on whether to  proceed to this bill, that the majority of the Members in the Senate  will say no.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________
