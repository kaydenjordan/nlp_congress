 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the hardworking men  and women I represent in Elmore County, Alabama, who, this past  Saturday, experienced a devastating loss, as a tornado ripped through  the city of Wetumpka. By the grace of God, no lives were lost and only  minor injuries have been reported at this point. Still, the damage is  severe and the road to recovery is long.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, I spent time on the ground with those  impacted, and I had the opportunity to see firsthand the damage to  several churches, the police station, dozens of homes, and businesses.  I appreciate the tireless work of the local leaders and first  responders who immediately jumped to action to begin putting the pieces  back together for the people who have lost so much.   During this challenging time, it has been so encouraging to see the  community united like a family. They have come together to begin the  rebuilding process. Merely hours after the devastating storm, the  Elmore County Emergency Management Agency heard from nearly 1,000  individuals who signed up to volunteer their time and resources in the  cleanup efforts.   Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to speak  directly to the people impacted by this weekend's tornado:   My office stands ready to assist you in whatever ways we are able. My  staff and I work for you, and we want to be a resource for you during  this very challenging time. The rebuilding process won't be easy, but  if we work together and help each other whenever possible, we will get  through this together. In the meantime, my family and I will continue  to pray for those impacted by this devastating event.                            ____________________
