 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1309, the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Healthcare and Social Service Workers  Act.   A few years ago, two workers in Oregon were tragically wounded in a  workplace stabbing at an organization that provides essential support  services to youth who are facing addiction, homelessness, and  behavioral health issues.                                time  0945    Following the incident, Oregon AFSCME members organized to improve  difficult working conditions that were compromising the quality of  services for vulnerable clients as well as the safety of employees.   Unfortunately, the experience of these workers is too common.  According to a November 2018 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics, healthcare and social service workers face a  disproportionate risk of on-the-job violence and injuries.   The workers in Oregon, and healthcare and social service workers  across the country, need evidence-based workplace violence prevention  plans tailored to the needs of the populations they serve. That is why  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1309, introduced by my  colleague, Congressman Courtney.   Healthcare and social service workers help to care for our families,  friends, and loved ones. Today, we have the chance to support their  well-being in the workplace.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter in support of the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service  Workers Act from the National Association of Social Workers.         Good morning: We are writing today to encourage your boss       to vote to approve H.R. 1309, the Workplace Violence       Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act,       which is scheduled to come to the House floor for a vote next       week. This bipartisan legislation is instrumental in       promoting safer working conditions for millions of social       workers, nurses and other similar professionals who       experience unacceptably high levels of violence on the job.        The National Association of Social Workers represents the       interests of over 750,000 social workers nationwide who are       employed in wide variety of settings, including hospitals,       community clinics, schools and correctional facilities among       others. Many social workers provide services outside the four       walls of an office, such as in family homes.        As you may know, healthcare and social service workers are       nearly five times more likely to be assaulted at work than       other professionals, and the rate of violence is growing.       Between 2007 and 2017, the rate of violent injuries grew by       123% in hospitals, 201% in psychiatric hospitals and       substance use treatment facilities, and 28% in social service       settings. The costs of this violence are high: in injury       rates, in professionals being driven from doing the work they       love, in workers' compensation claims and staff shortages.       Workplace violence is also highly problematic for patients.       Safe environments are healing environments.        Currently, there is no federal enforceable violence       prevention standard covering healthcare and social services       and federal guidelines do not cover those working in public       facilities. H.R. 1309 would require hospitals, residential       treatment facilities, substance use disorder treatment       centers, clinics at correctional or detention facilities, and       other service facilities to develop and implement       comprehensive violence prevention plans and provide whistle-      blower protections for workers. These commonsense plans can       be customized to reflect the unique safety needs and concerns       of each setting.        When the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and       Social Service Workers  [[Page H9132]]       Act comes before your boss for consideration, we urge your       boss to support its passage.        Thank you for your consideration and please let me know if       you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                     Dina L. Kastner, MSS, MLSP,                                             Senior Field Organizer,                            National Association of Social Workers.     Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
