 Mr. Speaker, the American people have elected a divided  government. Our government is designed to find compromise. That is why  the House, the Senate, and the White House should be negotiating a  responsible debt limit increase right now.   If you gave your child a credit card and they kept maxing it out to  the limit, you wouldn't blindly just raise the limit, you would change  their behavior. That exact same thing is true with our national debt.   We need to lower inflation, reduce our dependence on China, and lift  Americans out of poverty. America has a $31 trillion debt, and  Washington is on the clock.   What are Democrats doing?   President Biden is skipping town to deliver a speech in Maryland  rather than sitting down to address the debt ceiling. He is giving  America's debt the southern border treatment: Ignore it and hope that  it goes away. In fact, he has been avoiding the issue for 77 straight  days and counting.   Senator Schumer is just missing in action. Rather than find common  ground with the House, Senator Schumer is having the Senate vote on a  nonbinding resolution commending and congratulating the University of  Connecticut Men's Basketball Team for  [[Page H1872]]  winning the 2023 men's basketball championship.   That is not all Senator Schumer has been doing. Last month he  approved March as Maine's Maple Syrup Month. Talk about taking on big  issues. I wonder what May's month will be about.   While President Biden and Senate Democrats waste time, House  Republicans are taking action.   Today, I am proud to announce that we are introducing the Limit,  Save, Grow Act of 2023.   This responsible legislation will be led by our Budget Committee  Chairman, Jodey Arrington, and would responsibly raise the debt limit  into next year and provide more than $4.5 trillion in savings to the  American taxpayers.   Here is how we do it.   First, we limit government spending. Our plan would return  discretionary spending to pre-inflationary fiscal year 2022 levels, and  then limit the growth of spending to 1 percent per year.   Mr. Speaker, these are the same levels we had just 4 months ago. I  didn't hear a single Democrat complain about that level of spending.   The spending limits are not draconian. They are responsible. Federal  spending exploded in the past 2 years when Democrats controlled all,  and that doesn't include the trillions of COVID-era spending.   By limiting government spending we will reduce inflation and restore  fiscal discipline in Washington. If Washington wants to spend more, it  will have to come together to find savings elsewhere--just like every  single household in America.   Second, we are going to save taxpayers money.   Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is over. House Republicans have already  passed the bill to officially end the pandemic, and President Biden  signed it into law just last week.   Our bill would actually claw back billions of dollars of unspent  COVID money that has sat for the last 2 years. The American people are  tired of politicians who use COVID as an excuse for more extreme,  inflationary spending.   If this money was authorized to fight the pandemic but was not spent  during the pandemic, it should not be spent after the pandemic is over.   Our proposals also repeal Biden's army of 87,000 IRS agents. That  will save taxpayers $70 billion, and it is going to protect families  and small businesses from a weaponized IRS.   It would end the green giveaways for companies that distort the  market and waste taxpayer money. Goldman Sachs did an analysis. They  said the savings from ending the green giveaways are as much as $1.2  trillion.   We would prohibit President Biden's student loan giveaway for the  wealthy. That would protect the 87 percent of adults without student  loans from paying the loans of the 13 percent who do.                                time  1430    Finally, we will grow the economy so we are less dependent on China.   Our proposal will restore American energy leadership, make it easier  to build things in America, make us less dependent on China, and bring  jobs back to America.   It will also help lift millions of Americans out of poverty. Right  now there are more job openings than people looking for work, in part  because the Biden administration has weakened some of the very work  requirements that then-Senator Joe Biden previously supported.   Our plan ensures adults without dependents earn a paycheck and learn  new skills. By restoring these commonsense measures, we can help more  Americans earn a paycheck, learn new skills, reduce childhood poverty,  and rebuild the workforce.   It will also protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security  because more people will be paying into it.   We will prevent President Biden's executive overreach to spend money  outside the normal process, which President Biden has abused to the  tune of $1.5 trillion in unilateral executive actions.   We should welcome and celebrate the benefits of a strong, growing  economy, for with a strong, growing economy, we will no longer be  dependent on China. We will no longer be victims to inflation, and we  can leave a better future for our kids and our grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are taking action to lift the debt  limit, limit government spending, save taxpayers money, and grow the  economy.   President Biden and Senator Schumer have no right to play politics  with the debt ceiling. Their extreme position risks provoking the very  crisis they claim to want to avoid. They need to sit down, negotiate,  and address this crisis.   Now that we have introduced a clear plan for a responsible debt limit  increase, they have no more excuse to refuse to negotiate.   I think the Senate can honor maple syrup and basketball teams and  negotiate on a debt ceiling at the same time.   We owe it to the American people to use this moment in history to  deliver the future they want, need, and deserve.   House Republicans have a plan. The Senate does not, and the President  is ignoring the debt crisis.   President Biden has a choice: come to the table and stop playing  partisan political games, or cover his ears, refuse to negotiate, and  risk bumbling his way into the first default in our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this plan to get our Nation back on track so, yes, we then can  curb inflation, end our dependency on China, and strengthen and protect  Social Security and Medicare.                            ____________________
