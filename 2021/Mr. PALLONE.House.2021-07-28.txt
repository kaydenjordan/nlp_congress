 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Barbara Lee and her  team for putting together such a robust State-Foreign Operations bill.   I think this was a major achievement.   I come here as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian  Issues, and I am extremely pleased to see $50 million in assistance to  help bolster Armenia's ongoing democratic and economic transformations.   This unprecedented commitment in funding will go a long way in  helping continue economic governance and rule of law reforms while  further strengthening America's strategic partnership with this young  democracy.   The language included in this bill also helps address the  humanitarian needs in Artsakh as a result of the 44-day war perpetrated  by Azerbaijan and Turkey last fall and directs an additional $2 million  for demining programs.   I also thank Chairman McGovern for his steadfast commitment to the  Armenian people and share my appreciation for the cosponsors of my  amendment, which will pass as part of this package.   This amendment prevents U.S. security funding to Azerbaijan through  the International Military Education and Training, IMET, and Foreign  Military Financing, FMF, programs, which is sorely needed to combat  Azerbaijan's aggression in the region.   Let me be clear, Madam Speaker, this bill sends a clear signal that  we will not aid or tolerate authoritarian regimes that threaten peace  and security, especially when those actions are aimed at a fellow  democracy.   Again, I thank Chairwoman Lee. I know she has been a supporter of the  Armenian people for many years. I have been to her district to see some  of the Armenian Americans who really love her.
