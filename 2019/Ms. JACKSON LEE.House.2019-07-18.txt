 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   This is for the children.   Can you believe that this is a minimum wage increase spanning over 6  years, and you hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This  will allow small businesses to go in gradually and then provide all of  these dollars into the economy.   This is for the children.   I just heard from a mother who works for McDonald's who cannot  provide for her children and is on food stamps.   Mr. Speaker, 41.3 percent of those in my district will benefit in  Texas in the 18th Congressional District. This will help the gender  gap. But more importantly, it will benefit 19 million children whose  parents will get a raise.   It will increase worker productivity by incentivizing people to work  harder; reduce the gender gap, as women make up a disproportionate  share of minimum wage workers; and reduce the rate at which renters  default on their leases by giving families more money to spend on their  household budgets.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statistics relating to the 18th  Congressional District of Texas.

I am standing with working people and unions. I am standing with the  American people and 41.3 percent of my district.   Let us raise the minimum wage. That is the right thing to do. It is  for our children.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 582, the ``Raise the Wage Act.''   With the passage of this bill, the House of Representatives will take  another step in making good on its commitment to working families and  individuals to put their economic interests and concerns first and  attach the highest priority to making the real economy work for  ordinary Americans who work hard, play by the rules, and are struggling  to get by through no fault of their own.   We Democrats promised to chart a new direction for America if the  voters entrusted us with the majority.   They did and with our votes today in support of H.R. 582, we are  making good on our promise.   Mr. Speaker, before I discuss the importance of this bill in detail,  I wish to commend Chairman Scott, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader  Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, and the rest of the Democratic  leadership, as well as my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus,  which is led so ably by Congressman Bass.   Because of their resolve and visionary leadership, more than 27  million workers, and as many as 34 million, will soon receive a long  overdue raise.  [[Page H7118]]    What a difference an election makes.   H.R. 582 helps the most deserving American families by raising the  minimum wage from $7.25 to $15.00 over six years, and indexing  increases after that to median wage growth.   Mr. Speaker, did you know that the value of the current minimum wage  represents a 51-year low?   Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, it would be $10.15  today, nearly $3 more per hour than it is currently.   If the wages of that worker had kept up with the pace of productivity  growth, the minimum wage would be $19.33, over $40,000 per year.   It is scandalous, Mr. Speaker, that a person can work full-time, 40  hours per week, for 52 weeks, earning the minimum wage and would gross  just $15,000, which is $6,100 below the $25,100 needed to lift a family  of three out of poverty.   In 2018, the average CEO was paid 1,140 times the amount earned  yearly by a minimum wage worker.   Mr. Speaker, since 2009 the cost of college tuition has risen more  than 40 percent and health insurance premiums have skyrocketed by 41  percent.   But during that time, the minimum wage has not increased one cent.   That is unconscionable and downright un-American.   H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act, will change this sorry state of  affairs.   Mr. Speaker, today more than ever America's hard-working families are  feeling squeezed, living paycheck to paycheck.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that prices at the pump, skyrocketing  health care costs and the rising cost of college in the face of falling  or flat wages, are squeezing hard-working Texans in my Houston-based  Congressional District as they struggle to make ends meet.   That is why I support increasing the minimum wage.   For Texas workers the basic cost of living is rising; it is only fair  that the pay for hard-working Texans does too.   Mr. Speaker, 29 states and the District of Columbia have increased  their minimum wage above the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour, but  regrettably my home state of Texas is not one of them.   For approximately 4.7 million Texans and nearly 155,800 hardworking  persons in the 18th Congressional District of Texas, passage of the  Raise the Wage Act would bring immediate, tangible, and substantial  economic benefits.   Increasing the minimum wage would give these families a much needed  additional $4,100 a year to meet critical needs such as rent, health  care, food and child care.   The increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour over the next six  years will not allow workers to live as large as the typical CEO, who  now earns 1,140 times more than a minimum wage worker, but at least it  will allow these low-wage workers to make a little better life for  themselves and their families.   Raising the minimum wage will benefit working families:   1. Benefit 19 million children whose parents will get a raise;   2. Increase worker productivity by incentivizing people to work  harder;   3. Reduce the gender wage gap, as women make up a disproportionate  share of minimum wage workers; and   4. Reduce the rate at which renters default on their leases by giving  families more money to spend on their household budgets.   Increasing the minimum wage will also provide a boost to the economy,  since lower wage workers are more likely than other income groups to  spend extra earnings immediately and researchers estimate that a 10  percent increase in the minimum wage would increase sales by around $2  billion each year.   Mr. Speaker, the earnings of minimum wage workers are crucial to  their families' well-being since the average minimum wage worker brings  home more than half (51.9 percent) of his or her family's weekly  earnings.   Raising the minimum wage helps women and workers of color.   More than 49,000, or 41 percent, of African American workers and  89,100, or 53.2 percent of Hispanic workers in my congressional  district would get a raise under the Raise the Wage Act.   The Raise the Wage Act would substantially increase the purchasing  power of 83,900, or 48.5 percent, of low-wage women workers in my  district.   Since women make up nearly two-thirds of all minimum wage workers,  the Raise the Wage Act would provide the greatest benefit to workers of  color and women.   Single mothers would benefit disproportionately from an increase-- single mothers are 10.4 percent of workers affected by an increase, but  they make up only 5.3 percent of the overall workforce.   Approximately 1.8 million Texas parents with children under 18 would  benefit.   Contrary to popular myths and urban legends, adults make up the  largest share of workers (80 percent) who would benefit from a minimum  wage increase:   More than half (54 percent) of workers who would benefit from a  minimum wage increase work full time and another third (34.5 percent)  work between 20 and 34 hours per week.   Minimum wage increases benefit disadvantaged workers, and women are  the largest group of beneficiaries:   1. More than 23 million (66 percent) of workers who would benefit  from an increase to $15.00 are women.   2. Approximately 11.2 million (28 percent) of workers who would  benefit from an increase to $15.00 are the parents of 14.4 million  children, and of these, 5.4 million (48 percent) are single parents. In  my District in Texas, 41.3 percent of the workers would benefit.   A disproportionate share of persons of color would benefit from a  minimum wage increase:   1. African Americans represent 11.1 percent of the total workforce  but are 15.3 percent of workers affected by an increase.   2. Similarly, 13.4 percent of the total workforce is Hispanic, but  Hispanics are 19.7 percent of workers affected by an increase.   The benefits of an increase minimum wage disproportionately help  those working households at the bottom of the income scale.   Although households in the bottom 20 percent received only 5.1  percent of national income, 38.1 percent of the benefits of a minimum  wage increase to $15.00 would go to these workers.   Thirty-six percent of such workers actually contribute 100 percent of  their family's earnings.   A minimum wage increase would help reverse the trend of declining  real wages for low-wage workers.   Between 2009 and 2018, the minimum wage lost 29 percent of its real  value.   In contrast, between 1989 and 1997, the year it was raised to $5.15,  the minimum wage was raised four times and recovered about one-third of  the value it lost in the 1980s.   Income inequality has been increasing, in part, because of the  declining real value of the minimum wage.   Mr. Speaker, the opponents of the minimum wage often claim that  increasing the wage will cost jobs and harm the economy.   Of course, Mr. Speaker there is no credible to support such claims.   The truth is that following the most recent increase in the minimum  wage in 2009, and the rescue of the economy by President Barack Obama  after the Great Recession, the country went on to enjoy one the more  sustained period of economic prosperity in history.   Mr. Speaker, studies have shown that the best performing small  businesses are located in states with the highest minimum wages.   The job growth for small businesses in states with a minimum wage  higher than the federal level was 9,4 percent compared to a 6.6 percent  growth in states where the federal level prevailed.   So much for the discredited notion that raising the minimum wage  harms the economy; it does not.   But raising the minimum wage helps the economy by increasing the  purchasing power of those who most need the money, which is far more  than can be said of the Republicans' devotion to cutting taxes for  billionaires and multimillionaires.   Mr. Speaker, Americans overwhelmingly side with progressive  principles of rewarding hard work with a living wage.   A post-election Hill-Harris poll found that 82 percent of Americans  favored the hourly minimum wage and a clear majority, 55 percent,  favored increasing the minimum wage to $15.00, while only 14 percent  favored keeping in place the current $7.25 wage rate.   Mr. Speaker, it is time we gave the Americans we represent a long- over due pay raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15.00 over six  years and indexing future increases to the growth in median wages so  that a full-time worker making the minimum wage can afford the basic  essentials, which is not the case today anywhere in America.   I urge all members to support this necessary and timely legislation.   Vote aye on H.R. 582, the ``Raise the Wage Act.''                                time  1045
