 Madam Speaker, due to testing positive for COVID-19 and  following recommended isolation protocols, I was unable to vote today.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall no. 122,  ``nay'' on rollcall no. 123, and ``nay'' on rollcall no. 124.                            ____________________
