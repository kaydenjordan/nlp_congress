 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6210) ensuring that goods made with forced labor in  the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China  do not enter the United States market, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6210         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Uyghur Forced Labor       Prevention Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, the       Government of the People's Republic of China has, since 2017,       arbitrarily detained as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs,       Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in a       system of extrajudicial mass internment camps, and has       subjected detainees to forced labor, torture, political       indoctrination, and other severe human rights abuses.        (2) Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region's system of mass internment camps, and       throughout the region, and is confirmed by the testimony of       former camp detainees, satellite imagery, and official leaked       documents from the Government of the People's Republic of       China as part of a targeted campaign of repression of Muslim       ethnic minorities.        (3) In addition to reports from researchers and civil       society groups documenting evidence that many factories and       other suppliers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are       exploiting forced labor, the Department of Commerce's Bureau       of Industry and Security on July 22, 2020, added eleven       entities to the entity list after determining the entities       had been ``implicated in human rights violations and abuses       in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass       arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology       surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of       Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region''.        (4) Audits and efforts to vet products and supply chains in       the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are unreliable due to       the extent forced labor has been integrated into the regional       economy, the mixing of involuntary labor with voluntary       labor, the inability of witnesses to speak freely about       working conditions given government surveillance and       coercion, and the incentive of government officials to       conceal government-sponsored forced labor.        (5) The Department of State's June 2019 Trafficking in       Persons Report found that ``Authorities offer subsidies       incentivizing Chinese companies to open factories in close       proximity to the internment camps, and local governments       receive additional funds for each inmate forced to work in       these sites at a fraction of minimum wage or without any       compensation.''.        (6) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued eight       ``Withhold Release Orders'' on certain garments, hair       products, cotton, processed cotton, and computer parts       suspected to be produced with prison or forced labor in the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.        (7) In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congressional-Executive       Commission on China (CECC) found that products reportedly       produced with forced labor by current and former mass       internment camp detainees included textiles, electronics,       food products, shoes, tea, and handicrafts.        (8) Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)       states that it is illegal to import into the United States       ``goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or       manufactured wholly or in part'' by forced labor. Such       merchandise is subject to exclusion or seizure and may lead       to criminal investigation of the importer.        (9) The policies of the Government of the People's Republic       of China are in contravention of international human rights       instruments signed by that government, including--  [[Page H4658]]         (A) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which       the People's Republic of China has signed but not yet       ratified;        (B) the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and       Cultural Rights, ratified by the People's Republic of China       in 2001; and        (C) the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and       Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children       (Palermo Protocol), to which the People's Republic of China       has been a state party since February 2010.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to prohibit the import of all goods, wares, articles,       or merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in       part, by forced labor from the People's Republic of China and       particularly any such goods, wares, articles, or merchandise       produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China;        (2) to encourage the international community to reduce the       import of any goods made with forced labor from the People's       Republic of China, particularly those goods mined,       manufactured, or produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region;        (3) to coordinate with Mexico and Canada to effectively       implement Article 23.6 of the United States-Mexico-Canada       Agreement to prohibit the importation of goods produced in       whole or in part by forced or compulsory labor, which       includes goods produced in whole or in part by forced or       compulsory labor in the People's Republic of China;        (4) to actively work to prevent, publicly denounce, and end       human trafficking as a horrific assault on human dignity and       to restore the lives of those affected by human trafficking,       a modern form of slavery;        (5) to regard the prevention of atrocities as in its       national interest, including efforts to prevent torture,       enforced disappearances, severe deprivation of liberty,       including mass internment, arbitrary detention, and       widespread and systematic use of forced labor, and       persecution targeting any identifiable ethnic or religious       group; and        (6) to address gross violations of human rights in the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region through bilateral       diplomatic channels and multilateral institutions where both       the United States and the People's Republic of China are       members and with all the authorities available to the United       States Government, including visa and financial sanctions,       export restrictions, and import controls.       SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF GOODS MADE IN THE                     XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION.

(b) Exception.--The prohibition described in subsection (a)       shall not apply if the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and       Border Protection--        (1) determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that any       specific goods, wares, articles, or merchandise described in       subsection (a) were not produced wholly or in part by convict       labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal       sanctions; and        (2) submits to the appropriate congressional committees and       makes available to the public a report that contains such       determination.        (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the       date that is 120 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 9. DISCLOSURES TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                     OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE XINJIANG                     UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION.         (a) Policy Statement.--It is the policy of the United       States to protect American investors, through stronger       disclosure requirements, alerting them to the presence of       Chinese and other companies complicit in gross violations of       human rights in United States capital markets, including       American and foreign companies listed on United States       exchanges that enable the mass internment and population       surveillance of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim       minorities and source products made with forced labor in the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Such involvements       represent clear, material risks to the share values and       corporate reputations of certain of these companies and hence       to prospective American investors, particularly given that       the United States Government has employed sanctions and       export restrictions to target individuals and entities       contributing to human rights abuses in the People's Republic       of China.        (b) Disclosure of Certain Activities Relating to the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.--        (1) In general.--Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act       of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(s) Disclosure of Certain Activities Relating to the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.--        ``(1) In general.--Each issuer required to file an annual       or quarterly report under subsection (a) shall disclose in       that report the information required by paragraph (2) if,       during the period covered by the report, the issuer or any       affiliate of the issuer--        ``(A) knowingly engaged in an activity with an entity or       the affiliate of an entity engaged in creating or providing       technology or other assistance to create mass population       surveillance systems in the Xinjiang  [[Page H4660]]       Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, including any entity       included on the Department of Commerce's `Entity List' in the       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;

SEC. 11. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 6210.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Uyghur Forced Labor  Prevention Act. The human rights atrocities the Chinese Government is  perpetuating in Xinjiang are now well-known. More than 1 million Uyghur  and Muslim ethnic minorities have been thrown in detention camps, where  they face torture, brainwashing, sexual abuse, and even forced  sterilization.   These atrocities are horrific, and the Congress has acted to hold  perpetrators of these crimes accountable by passing the Uyghur Human  Rights Policy Act. But we must not stop there.   The legislation we are considering today focuses on a specific form  of  [[Page H4661]]  abuse in Xinjiang: forced labor, an abuse of human rights which also  has grave implications for supply chains and consumers worldwide.  Importing goods made from forced labor violates U.S. law, and Americans  certainly would not want to contribute to the PRC Government's human  rights abuses by unwittingly purchasing apparel or hair products made  by a detained Uyghur.   Among other things, this legislation reaffirms U.S. policy to reduce  the number and types of goods made from forced labor, mandates reports  surrounding the U.S. Government's strategy to spread awareness of  forced labor in Xinjiang and address that challenge, and requires the  Secretary of State to determine whether the practice of forced labor in  Xinjiang constitutes crimes against humanity or even genocide.   This measure builds on what Congress has already done to hold the  Chinese Government accountable and to end the mass detention,  repression, and surveillance of minorities in Xinjiang.   I thank Chairman McGovern, Mr. Smith, and other bipartisan champions  for their consistent leadership on these issues, and I hope Congress  can, as we have before, take a strong stand against Beijing and its  crimes.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the  bill. This is a good measure. I am pleased to support it, and I am also  pleased that it has, I believe, bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 17, 2020.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 6210, the ``Uyghur Forced Labor       Prevention Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I       appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 6210, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.

The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.

Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 6210, the       ``Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.'' In order to permit       H.R. 6210 to proceed expeditiously to the House Floor, I       agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 6210 in light of the       mutually agreed changes to provisions within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Financial Services. We are also doing so       based on our mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal       consideration of H.R. 6210 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward with regard to any matters in the       Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate  [[Page H4662]]       conference involving this or similar legislation that       involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 6210.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is the author of this  important bill and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission and chairman  of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a valued member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purposes of closing.   Madam Speaker, this is a matter of whether the United States, as it  has for generations, will remain a north star around the world when it  comes to things like freedom, human rights, democracy, and rooting out  corruption.   This is an issue of human rights. Millions of people are being  subjugated right now by the Chinese Government. And despite  international contamination, atrocities continue in Xinjiang, and China  shows no signs of changing course, including recently releasing a white  paper defending these ``vocational training centers.''   The United States should use its unique position in the global  trading system to advance workers' rights and the freedom and dignity  of all people, and to signal other like-minded countries to act  accordingly.   I am very pleased to support this measure. I am glad that it has  strong bipartisan support, and I urge all the Members to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2166) to authorize a comprehensive, strategic  approach for United States foreign assistance to developing countries  to strengthen global health security, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2166         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Health Security Act       of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In December 2009, President Obama released the National       Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, which listed as       one of seven objectives ``Promote global health security:       Increase the availability of and access to knowledge and       products of the life sciences that can help reduce the impact       from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of natural,       accidental, or deliberate origin''.        (2) In February 2014, the United States and nearly 30 other       nations launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to       address several high-priority, global infectious disease       threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country       initiative intended to accelerate partner countries'       measurable capabilities to achieve specific targets to       prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats,       whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental.        (3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable       Development Goals (SDGs), which include specific reference to       the importance of global health security as part of SDG 3       ``ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all       ages'' as follows: ``strengthen the capacity of all       countries, in particular developing countries, for early       warning, risk reduction and management of national and global       health risks''.        (4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama signed Executive       Order 13747, ``Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to       Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease       Threats''.        (5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial Meeting in       Uganda, the United States and more than 40 GHSA member       countries supported the ``Kampala Declaration'' to extend the       GHSA for an additional 5 years to 2024.        (6) In December 2017, President Trump released the National       Security Strategy, which includes the priority action:       ``Detect and contain biothreats at their source: We will work       with other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early       to prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage other       countries to invest in basic health care systems and to       strengthen global health security across the intersection of       human and animal health to prevent infectious disease       outbreaks''.        (7) In September 2018, President Trump released the       National Biodefense Strategy, which includes objectives to       ``strengthen global health security capacities to prevent       local bioincidents from becoming epidemics'', and       ``strengthen international preparedness to support       international response and recovery capabilities''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) promote global health security as a core national       security interest;        (2) advance the aims of the Global Health Security Agenda;        (3) collaborate with other countries to detect and mitigate       outbreaks early to prevent the spread of disease;        (4) encourage other countries to invest in basic resilient       and sustainable health care systems; and        (5) strengthen global health security across the       intersection of human and animal health to prevent infectious       disease outbreaks and combat the growing threat of       antimicrobial resistance.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2166.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, pandemics don't respect borders and they don't care  about nationalities. We have witnessed that this year with the spread  of the coronavirus. That is why this bill comes before us at a critical  time. I want to say a very big thank you to Gerry Connolly from  Virginia for authoring this important legislation.   In the last 8 months, we have watched this pandemic spread around the  world, upending the global economy, disrupting our lives and creating  grave uncertainty about what happens next. Unfortunately, the  administration's catastrophic response to the current COVID-19 pandemic  has led to nearly 200,000 American deaths.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

There are       certain provisions in this legislation that fall within the       Rule X jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       we will not formally consider H.R. 2166. We do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Armed  [[Page H4669]]       Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claims over       the subject matters contained in the bill which fall within       its Rule X jurisdiction.

By waiving consideration of H.R. 2166, HPSCI does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subjects       contained in the bill which fall within HPSCJ's Rule X       jurisdiction. I further request that you urge the Speaker to       appoint members of HP SCI to any conference committee which       is named to consider provisions addressing such subjects.        Finally, I ask that our exchange of letters be included in       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor.        I continue to be grateful for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees, and look forward to a       prompt floor vote on H.R. 2166.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time for the purpose of closing.   As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,  and that is undoubtedly true in global health. We have seen firsthand  the dangers of a lack of preparedness.   Today's legislation will prepare a coordinated response for future  pandemics. I give a special thank you to Mr. Connolly for authoring  this important legislation and, of course, I thank Mr. McCaul of Texas  and the others who have worked in a bipartisan way to get this bill to  the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4864) to develop and implement policies to advance  early childhood development, to provide assistance for orphans and  other vulnerable children in developing countries, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4864         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Child Thrive Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to a 2019 report from the United Nations       Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation entitled       ``Levels & Trends in Child Mortality'', the annual number of       deaths among children younger than 15 years of age dropped by       56 percent between 1990 and 2018, from approximately       14,200,000 to approximately 6,200,000.        (2) According to a 2016 article published in The Lancet       entitled ``Early childhood development: the foundation of       sustainable development''--        (A) an estimated 250,000,000 children in low-income and       middle-income countries suffer suboptimal development due to       poverty and stunting alone; and        (B) children who do not meet developmental milestones are       expected to lose about 25 percent of their average yearly       income once they become adults.        (3) According to a report from the United Nations       Children's Fund (UNICEF), entitled ``The State of the World's       Children 2016: A fair chance for every child'', nearly       250,000,000 of the world's 650,000,000 primary school age       children do not master basic literacy and numeracy.        (4) According to a 2018 report from the World Health       Organization entitled ``Nurturing Care for early childhood       development''--        (A) the environment in which a child grows has a profound       impact on future learning, behavior, and health; and        (B) a country's economic diversity and growth could be       improved by investment in early childhood development.        (5) According to a 2017 UNICEF report entitled ``UNICEF's       Programme Guidance for Early Childhood Development'',       nurturing care, which is key to early childhood development,       consists of a core set of interrelated components,       including--        (A) behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge about caregiving,       including health, hygiene care, and feeding;        (B) stimulation, such as talking, singing, and playing;        (C) responsiveness, such as early bonding, secure       attachment, trust, and sensitive communication; and        (D) safety, including routines, protection from violence,       abuse, neglect, harm, and environmental pollution.        (6) According to a 2016 report published in The Lancet       entitled ``Advancing Early Childhood Development: From       Science to Scale''--        (A) nurturing care from parents, relatives, and other       caregivers and services are formative experiences for young       children;        (B) programs promoting nurturing care can improve early       childhood development outcomes; and        (C) children who do not receive nurturing care display       negative development outcomes, such as greater sensitivity to       the effects of stress or behavioral problems, especially       children who do not receive nurturing care before their       second birthday.        (7) According to the ``Advancing Protection and Care for       Children in Adversity 2019-2023: A U.S. Government Strategy       for International Assistance'', children who live without       protective family care, in abusive households, on the       streets, or in institutions, or who are trafficked, are       participating in armed groups, or are being exploited for       their labor are more likely to be exposed to violence,       exploitation, abuse, and neglect.        (8) According to a 2017 UNICEF report entitled ``Early       Moments Matter for every child'', violence, abuse, neglect,       and traumatic experiences produce toxic stress that limits       neural connectivity in developing brains.        (9) According to a 2014 working paper from the National       Scientific Council on the Developing Child at Harvard       University entitled ``Excessive Stress Disrupts the       Architecture of the Developing Brain''--        (A) situations that produce toxic stress increase the       production of cortisol in a child's brain, which disrupts its       healthy development; and        (B) chronic stress can potentially affect the expression of       genes that regulate the stress response across the life       course.        (10) According to a 2018 article in the North Carolina       Medical Journal entitled ``Adverse Childhood Experiences       (ACEs): An Important Element of a Comprehensive Approach to       the Opioid Crisis'', adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are       traumatic or stressful experiences, including emotional,       physical, or sexual abuse, domestic violence, household       substance abuse, household mental illness, parental       separation or divorce, and the incarceration of a household       family member.        (11) According to a 2016 report in Development and       Psychopathology entitled ``Childhood Adversity and Epigenetic       Regulation of Glucocorticoid Signaling Genes: Associations in       Children and Adults''--        (A) children and adults are at risk of developing       psychiatric disorders and other medical conditions if they       have had an adverse childhood experience; and        (B) adults who have had numerous ACEs die nearly 20 years       earlier, on average, than adults who have not had numerous       ACEs.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States Government should continue efforts to       reduce child mortality rates and increase attention on       prevention efforts and early childhood development programs;  [[Page H4672]]         (2) investments in early childhood development ensure       healthy and well-developed future generations that contribute       to a country's stability, security and economic prosperity;        (3) efforts to provide training and education on nurturing       care could result in improved early childhood development       outcomes and support healthy brain development; and        (4) integration and cross-sector coordination of early       childhood development programs is critical to ensure the       efficiency, effectiveness, and continued implementation of       such programs.       SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE TO IMPROVE EARLY CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES                     GLOBALLY.         (a) Authorization of Assistance.--Amounts authorized to be       appropriated to carry out section 135 in chapter 1 of part 1       of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et       seq.) for each of the fiscal years 2021 through 2025 are       authorized to be made available to support early childhood       development activities in conjunction with relevant, existing       programming, such as water, sanitation and hygiene, maternal       and child health, basic education, nutrition and child       protection.        (b) Assistance to Improve Early Childhood Outcomes       Globally.--Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act       of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the       end the following:       ``SEC. 137.

Section 135(e)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22       U.S.C. 2152f(e)(2)) is amended--        (1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:        ``(A) Coordinate assistance to orphans and other vulnerable       children among the relevant Executive branch agencies and       officials.''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``the various offices,       bureaus, and field missions within the United States Agency       for International Development'' and inserting ``the relevant       Executive branch agencies and officials''.       SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in the amendments made by this Act may be construed       to restrict or abrogate any other authorization for United       States Agency for International Development activities or       programs.     Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 4864.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As I begin, I express deep gratitude to Chairman Engel for his strong  and steady leadership on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and  specifically, with respect to this bill, for working with me to move  important legislation through the committee and the Congress.   I also thank Representative Brian Fitzpatrick for working with me on  this legislation that enjoys wide bipartisan support in both the House  and the Senate.   Finally, I recognize USAID as the country's lead agency to provide  humanitarian assistance and lead in international development. The  tireless efforts of its staff helped millions of vulnerable people  every year and advanced core United States interests.   The Global Child Thrive Act shows that the leadership in Congress is  concerned about future generations in developing countries, and we are  concerned that they be empowered to survive and succeed.   I would like to speak to the importance of this bill that we are  considering here today in the House of Representatives.   Over 250 million children worldwide are at risk of stunted growth and  damage to their brains due to the long-lasting impacts of poverty,  conflict, and displacement. Research indicates that poor health,  stress, and lack of learning impairs a child's growth and development,  with lifelong negative effects.   The Global Child Thrive Act is designed to reduce the devastating  effects of poverty through early childhood development programming.  Early childhood development, or ECD, provides for the care and  nurturing that restores a child's prospects for success in the future.  ECD interventions build a brain architecture that is necessary for  growth through reading, singing, play activities with shape and color,  and responsive interaction.   The benefits of ECD are particularly critical during this coronavirus  pandemic when children face severe disruptions in development. Hundreds  of thousands of children have already lost a family member, and  quarantines and school closures have led to isolation and increased  child protection concerns.   With so much at stake, we need to take action now.   This bill is not just my bill or a Democratic bill, but a bipartisan  bill that has garnered widespread support because saving children's  lives is not a partisan measure but a human imperative.   The Global Child Thrive Act shows that the United States is there for  the world's most vulnerable and precious possession, its children. It  also shows that we are serious about combating poverty as one of the  greatest scourges that affects human dignity.   This leadership is critical because we, as a nation, need to  demonstrate to the world that we are still the North Star of freedom,  democracy, and human rights.   We need to show that the world can trust and follow our lead in  welcoming those seeking refuge and helping marginalized populations  around the world who just want the chance not only to survive but to  thrive.   I have spoken about the need to build up what I call an  infrastructure of diplomacy. The work of USAID and international  development, and our partnerships with NGOs that implement these  programs, is an important component of that infrastructure that enables  our Nation's leadership on the world's stage.   Foreign affairs issues need the attention of our Nation because the  truth is, foreign affairs touches all aspects of our lives, including  national security, personal health, and access to essential goods. It  determines how we trust and look at the goodness of our neighbors, not  only across borders but across our own streets.   This is a good measure. It has bipartisan support, and I hope that my  colleagues will support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   It is now up to us to pass this bill that is before us today and to  send a strong signal to the Senate that passing the Global Child Thrive  Act into law is urgent.   I also, Madam Speaker, as folks have said, want to thank Catholic  Relief Services for all of their work and the work of their members and  different chapters throughout the country in helping to shepherd this  bill.   As the world toils through a devastating pandemic, now more than  ever, we must keep child welfare and the elimination of poverty front  and center if we are to lead our country and the world to a stronger,  healthier, and more resilient condition. We must stand united and be  the acting conscience of the country. It is our job to do so.   I, therefore, Madam Speaker, urge my colleagues in the House to  support this measure so we can get it to the President's desk and have  it signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5664) to amend the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act of 2000 to ensure adequate time for the preparation of the annual  Trafficking in Persons Report, require the timely provision of  information to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons  and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State  regarding the number and location of visa denials based, in whole or in  part, on grounds related to human trafficking, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5664         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Locations of united states visa denials.--The term       ``location of United States visa denials'' means--        (A) the United States diplomatic or consular post at which       a denied United States visa application was adjudicated; and        (B) the city or locality of residence of the applicant       whose visa application was so denied.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5664.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, human trafficking, better termed modern-day slavery,  has grown into a sprawling and complex billion-dollar criminal  enterprise. An estimated 25 million people are currently victims of  trafficking, having been forced into abusive situations involving  forced labor, sex exploitation, and involuntary domestic servitude.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has a long history of confronting  modern-day slavery, and the LIFT Act continues that legacy for this  committee.   Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and the ranking member of the  committee, Mr. McCaul, for authoring this bill, and Mr. Smith for his  leadership on this issue for over two decades.   In 2000, President Clinton signed into law the Victims of Trafficking  and Violence Prevention Act, now hailed as the most comprehensive  legislation on human trafficking to date. That landmark piece of  legislation came out of the Foreign Affairs Committee and was authored  by our colleague, Chris Smith.   That legislation gave the State Department the responsibility of  drafting the annual Trafficking Report, which has been a critical  resource in pushing countries to take action to combat human  trafficking.   The bill before us ensures that the State Department has adequate  time to prepare the annual Trafficking Report. It streamlines data  sharing among bureaus on visa denials for human traffickers and engages  trafficking survivors in our policymaking process.   We must continue to fight modern-day slavery and work to enact  legislation that brings us to a brighter future free of this horrific  injustice. Today's measure is a step in that direction, and I hope all  of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will join me in supporting  it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                          Committee on Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, July 30, 2020.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5664, the LIFT Act, that fall       within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting       with us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no       objection to your including them in the bill for       consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to waive sequential referral, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 31, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       5664, the LIFT Act. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Committee on the Judiciary under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 5664 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Combating human trafficking is a global challenge, and we are proud  of the State Department's critical role in that effort. This  legislation will ensure that the Department has the tools and resources  necessary to counter these heinous human rights abuses.   I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for his work on  this important issue. This is a strong bill that I am pleased to  support, and I urge my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to do the  same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
