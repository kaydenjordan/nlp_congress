 Madam Speaker, Friday, September 15, will mark the  second anniversary of AUKUS, a historic new security agreement between  the Governments of the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom  that will integrate the most sophisticated technologies amongst the  three countries, including quantum computing, undersea warfare,  hypersonics, and cyber, to name just a few, in order  [[Page H4235]]  to create a new level of joint deterrence by these longtime allies to  address a security environment that has been deteriorating for the last  two decades in the Indo-Pacific region.   Its goal is simple: to preserve an open and free Indo-Pacific and a  rules-based order at sea, in the air, and in the cyber domain. It is  not a policy of aggression. It is, rather, one of maintaining the  integrity and sovereignty of all nations in the region to achieve peace  and prosperity.   Madam Speaker, this is a big undertaking for the country of  Australia. The centerpiece is recapitalizing their submarine fleet,  which today are diesel, electric submarines that have to surface to  recharge their batteries and replace them with conventionally armed  nuclear-powered submarines.   Over the last 2 years, our three Navies' leadership have been meeting  to try to come up with a plan to execute this undertaking. Last March,  in San Diego, California, at Naval Base Point Loma, the three heads of  government--President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese from Australia,  and Prime Minister Sunak--came together and stacked hands to make a  commitment, and particularly our country, to do something that we have  not done since 1958, which is to share the crown jewels of our national  security technology; namely, nuclear propulsion.   This program, which again was announced last March, calls for the  U.S. to sell three Virginia-class attack submarines in the early 2030s,  again, as a way of allowing Australia to replace their fleet with a  more capable set of vessels that have longer reach and more capacity in  terms of executing deterrence. For the U.S. Navy and for our industrial  base here in the U.S., it will call for a much greater capacity for  submarine construction than exists today.   Madam Speaker, I represent Groton, Connecticut, which is the home of  General Dynamics Electric Boat, the general contractor for the  Virginia-class submarine program and also for the Columbia-class  program, which today are both working hard to address our own Navy's  needs. With AUKUS, this is going to add another level of production  targets that again will strain and call for more capacity.   The Biden administration last year saw this coming. They have laid  out a $2.4 billion plan over the next 5 years to increase the  workforce, supply chain, and facility to achieve this goal. We saw it  happening in real time during my break in August.   If you go back 3 years ago, the shipyard's workforce was about 17,000  people. As of last Friday, it is 21,700 strong. The investments in  supply chains that are going all over the country to 48 different  States is standing up to meet this demand signal so that this alliance,  which, again, is about preserving peace and protecting freedom, will  succeed.   The development of the workforce is very exciting to see. This last  spring, trade school graduates and comprehensive high school graduates  were going right into the shipyard. The U.S. Department of Labor  workforce investment training program, the manufacturing pipeline,  reached 4,000 graduates in the metal trades, electricians, welders,  machinists.   This is a level of job training and investment that we have not seen  for a long time. The 2023 hiring goal for Electric Boat is the largest  in the 120-year history of the company--5,750 people. As I said, last  week they hit the 21,700 mark, and they will be on target to complete  that goal by the end of December.   It is going to require more commitment. We now have people in the  Senate who are talking about increasing the Biden budget for investment  in the industrial base. Again, this will provide benefit not just for  southeastern Connecticut or southern New England, but for States all  across the country: manufacturers and small businesses that provide the  parts and pieces that go into these amazing vessels, the amazing  technology that makes these vessels go.   For the three countries of Australia, the U.K., and the U.S., this  Friday will be a proud moment in terms of advancing a goal which all of  the neighbors in the region--smaller countries and larger countries-- are supporting, which, again, is to push back against some of the  encroachment and coercive behavior that now exists in the Indo-Pacific  region.                            ____________________
