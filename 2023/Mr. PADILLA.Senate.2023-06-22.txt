 Mr. President, I rise today just a few days ahead of the  anniversary of one of the most devastating Supreme Court voting rights  decisions in our Nation's history.   This coming Sunday marks the 10-year anniversary since the Supreme  Court's Shelby v. Holder decision, when--surprise, surprise--a  conservative majority of the Supreme Court voted to dramatically erode  Americans' access to the ballot and undo 50 years of voting rights  protections.   Now, with the benefit of hindsight and my 6 years serving as  California's chief elections officer, I can say that the decision in  Shelby was not just an anomaly in our Nation's history. Since Shelby,  we have seen State after State exploit this decision to enact dozens of  laws designed to make it harder for some people to vote.   Despite the proponents' claims, the effect of these laws is to make  it harder and, disproportionately, for voters of color, voters with  disabilities, college students, and senior citizens to register to  vote, to stay registered to vote, or to actually cast their ballot.   But, unfortunately, we have seen this before. While the Fifteenth  Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1870, guaranteeing all  citizens the right to vote regardless of race, that did not stop States  from limiting access to the ballot. Poll tests, literacy tests,  grandfather clauses, coupled with the brutal violence of the Jim Crow  South, made it nearly impossible for Black citizens and other  minorities, at the time, to exercise their constitutional rights. Yes,  I know it is not pleasant to be reminded of this, but I think it is  important to keep restating these facts for the record before they end  up getting censored out of some history books in schools in different  parts of this country. The times we live in, I tell you.    These violations were so egregious and so pervasive that it would  take Congress nearly a century to address them. Congress only took  action after the marches of civil rights leaders and the chorus of  protests grew so strong that they could no longer be ignored.   The country witnessed the civil rights movement and leaders like Dr.  Martin Luther King and John Lewis call out the fundamental hypocrisy of  a nation that promised all men and women to be equal but whose  professed principles stopped at the entrance to the polling place.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a monument to freedom, but it  certainly was never intended to be temporary, let alone a final chapter  in the struggle for equality. The Voting Rights Act was actually a  reminder--a reminder that America's democracy is imperfect and that it  is each generation's job to bring us closer to being a more perfect  union.   So in June of 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down section 5 of  the Voting Rights Act in that Shelby v. Holder decision--the provision  which required States with a history of racially motivated voter  suppression to prove that any new laws or regulations would not  adversely impact minority voters before they could be implemented--that  decision undid 50 years of voting rights protections. In an instant,  the Supreme Court scrapped section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which  was a critical tool that successfully protected us against the most  egregious forms of voter suppression.   As a result of the Shelby decision, today too many eligible  citizens--eligible citizens--have fallen victim to a new set of  barriers put in place by Republican-led State legislatures. Modern-day  voter suppression efforts might be a little bit more subtle than what  we saw in the mid-20th century, but make no mistake, they are no less  effective in suppressing the vote. Purging voter rolls, limiting vote- by-mail opportunities, limiting early-voting opportunities--these are  all strategies designed to make it unduly harder for people to have  their voice heard in our democracy.   While we may celebrate the recent Supreme Court decision in Allen v.  Milligan, which was vitally important in upholding section 2 of the  Voting Rights Act and affirming decades of the Supreme Court's  jurisprudence on the Voting Rights Act, we must remember that the act  as a whole is failing to function as it was intended, as it was  originally adopted.   Make no mistake, the right to vote--the precious right to vote-- continues to be attacked. Mississippi has passed one of the strictest  voter ID laws in the country. Georgia cut 10 percent of its polling  places ahead of the 2020 elections--mostly around the Atlanta  metropolitan area--despite the fact that more than 2 million new voters  had registered. More voters deserve more opportunities to vote, not  less. In fact, since 2020 alone, 33 States have passed at least 104 new  restrictive voting laws.  [[Page S2201]]  MAGA Republicans continue to spread false claims of massive voter fraud  to cynically justify their voter suppression agenda.   It is these types of threats to our democracy that actually fueled my  work as California secretary of state prior to my joining the Senate.  As the chief elections officer for a State of nearly 40 million  people--the most populous State in the nation and the most diverse  State in the nation--I actually worked to implement automatic voter  registration, same-day voter registration, to upgrade California's  voting systems to meet higher security standards, and to expand mail-in  voting and in-person early-voting opportunities. We intentionally and  aggressively worked to make our democracy both more secure and more  inclusive, not less. That is why today there are almost 22 million  Californians on the voting rolls. That is right--there are more voters  in the State of California than the population of the State of Florida.  The voter rolls are now the most accurate and up to date they have ever  been. That is good for election integrity, and we have seen record  turnout as a result in four of the last six elections. That is the way  democracy is supposed to work.   Now California has taken a stand because our right to vote is worth  fighting for and because when it comes to defending and strengthening  our democracy, California proudly leads. Now it is time for Congress to  follow this example.   In the fight for civil and voting rights, a quote by Dr. Martin  Luther King is often invoked, and I will quote it:         The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward       justice.    Too often in our Nation's history, it has been Congress that has  obstructed our path to justice. This body has not always upheld the  legacy of the Americans who marched for the right to vote, who risked  their safety for the right to vote, who gave their lives so that we  might all have a say in our democracy.   Ten years after Shelby, it is clear that this decision has undermined  the fabric of our democracy. So it is time that we pass the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore a preclearance  requirement that helped protect the voting rights of all Americans.   I believe that what I learned in high school government class was  right. Our country is stronger when more eligible Americans  participate. That is why we must also pass and implement the Freedom to  Vote Act to set a national baseline of voter protections and access to  the ballot.   Our vote is sacred. It is how citizens exercise their voice in the  political process. It is how we hold elected leaders accountable. And  it is how we, together, shape our country's future.   It is our sworn duty, colleagues. It is our sworn duty to protect the  right to vote. So I urge all of us to join me in restoring these key  components of the Voting Rights Act. Let's pass once again landmark  legislation to protect our sacred right to vote, and let us live up to  the legacy of the civil rights movement.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate an  exceptional officer of the U.S. Navy, Rear Admiral Peter Stamatopoulos,  Commander, Naval Supply Systems Command and 49th Chief of Supply Corps,  on his retirement after 35 years of honorable service to our country.   Rear Admiral Peter Stamatopoulos provided outstanding leadership and  sound professional judgment in service to the U.S. Navy, Congress, and  this Nation. A native of California and a University of San Diego  graduate, Rear Admiral Stamatopoulos was first commissioned to serve as  a supply corps officer in the U.S. Navy in 1988. Following his precept,  ``Do Good, Do Right, Do What Is Honorable,'' he provided vital Navy  supply support throughout his career, serving in the Cold War,  Operation Desert Storm, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Determined  Response, and Operation Enduring Freedom. Under his leadership, his  team won the 2006 Adm. Stan Arthur Logistics Team of the Year award for  the noncombatant evacuation of about 15,000 U.S. citizens from Lebanon.   As commander, Naval Supply Systems Command and 49th Chief of Supply  Corps for the past 36 months, Rear Admiral Stamatopoulos led the  execution of a dynamic, worldwide Supply Systems Command consisting of  11 field commands, a 22,500-personnel global workforce, $8 billion  annual budget, and $42 billion Navy Working Capital Fund-Supply  Management inventory. Through the Naval Sustainment System-Supply and  Performance to Plan-Logistics initiatives, he improved the Navy's end- to-end supply chains and enhanced the global supply support network to  swiftly respond to the dynamic threat environment.   On behalf of all Californians, we thank Rear Admiral Stamatopoulos,  his wife Alainie, and their entire family for their continued  commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Smoke Exposure  Crop Insurance Act of 2023. This legislation will make Federal crop  insurance work better for wine grapes impacted by wildfire smoke  exposure.  [[Page S2228]]    Increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires in California,  Oregon, and Washington are threatening the long-term sustainability of  important winegrowing regions. Vineyards, winery operations, and the  communities they support are routinely facing the threat of wildfires  that can not only destroy vineyards, but can damage fruit through  prolonged smoke exposure, which can be absorbed into the grape,  creating an ashy taste known as smoke taint.   The impact has been particularly acute for California's 4,800  wineries and 5,900 winegrape growers, who have seen significant  property loss, loss of tourism, and loss of production due to smoke- exposed grapes. In 2020 alone, industry sources estimate that between  165,000 and 325,000 tons of California wine grapes were lost due to  actual or perceived smoke damage, and financial estimates place losses  at over $600 million.   Federal crop insurance tools are not working for winegrape producers  grappling with the impacts of climate change induced wildfires. That's  why we need to pass the Smoke Exposure Crop Insurance Act.   The Smoke Exposure Crop Insurance Act of 2023 would direct the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to  research, develop, and create a crop insurance policy to better insure  against wine grape losses due to wildfire smoke exposure.   Wine grapes are vital to the economies of California, Oregon, and  Washington--the largest producers of wine grapes in the United States  and the most impacted by smoke-exposure. But crop insurance is not  working for wine grapes--current products do not fully capture the  risks associated with growing in these smoke and wildfire-prone States.   That is why we need to pass the Smoke Exposure Crop Insurance Act of  2023, to improve crop insurance for winegrape producers, wineries, and  the consumers they support to help address the impossible choice facing  producers after a wildfire: Does a grower harvest grapes knowing they  may be unusable for wine or do they take an indemnity for what may be  perfectly good grapes?   This bill gets us one step closer to answering that question.   I would like to thank my colleagues from California, Washington, and  Oregon for joining me to introduce this bill and for our partners in  the House, Representatives Mike Thompson and Dan Newhouse, for  championing this bill in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Smoke  Exposure Crop Insurance Act as quickly as possible for inclusion in the  2023 farm Bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr.          Wyden):   S. 2135. A bill to require the Agricultural Research Service to  conduct research relating to wildfire smoke exposure on wine grapes,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Smoke Exposure  Research Act of 2023. This legislation will bolster research at land- grant universities along the west coast to better understand the  impacts of wildfire smoke on wine grapes.   Increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires in California,  Oregon, and Washington are threatening the long-term sustainability of  important winegrowing regions. Vineyards, winery operations, and the  communities they support are routinely facing the threat of wildfires  that can not only destroy vineyards but even those vineyards that  escape direct wildfire damage can still suffer from prolonged smoke  exposure, which can be absorbed into grapes and create an ashy taste  known as smoke taint.   The impact has been particularly acute for California's 4,800  wineries and 5,900 winegrape growers, who have seen significant  property loss, loss of tourism, and loss of production due to smoke- exposed grapes. The 2020 wildfires alone are estimated to have cost  wineries and winegrape growers $3.7 billion both from immediate fire- caused losses as well as losses in future sales due to unharvested  grapes exposed to wildfire smoke.   Yet, there is a limited understanding of how to measure and identify  compounds that cause smoke taint and even less understanding of the  mitigation and risk management measures necessary to reduce these  impacts.   Recognizing the dearth of information and how much is at stake for  the wine industry, Congress provided $5 million to the USDA to identify  the compounds responsible for smoke taint and to develop mitigation  methods to reduce or eliminate smoke taint.   This was a great first step, but we need more. That is what my bill  would do.   The Smoke Exposure Research Act of 2023 would provide $32.5 million  over 5 years to ensure the sustainability of the wine industry in the  face of climate crisis.   Specifically, this bill would direct the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, in coordination with land- grant universities and researchers with viticulture and enology  expertise, to identify the compounds responsible for smoke taint;  establish standard sampling, testing, and screening tools for use in  vineyards and wineries; and develop new risk assessment tools,  mitigation measures, and management strategies for growers.   As researchers from the University of California Davis, Washington  State University, and Oregon State University explain in recent  research, the impact of smoke taint is not predictable.   We cannot currently predict which grapes may have suffered damage  based on anything intuitive, such as sight, smell, or even the flavor  of fresh grapes. ``Freshness of the smoke, number of times exposed,  variety of grape--the list goes on. There's so much we don't know.''   That is why we need to pass the Smoke Exposure Research Act, to  ensure we have strong science-based data for actual risk management and  mitigation tools to protect the U.S. wine industry.   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Mike Thompson, for  his leadership bolstering California winegrowing communities and  championing this bill in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Smoke  Exposure Research Act as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Young):   S. 2150. A bill to establish an Interagency Council on Service to  promote and strengthen opportunities for military service, national  service, and public service for all people of the United States, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Voluntary  Agricultural Land Repurposing Act to support voluntary efforts to  repurpose agricultural land to multibenefit uses. Enactment of this  legislation would provide new tools for States, producers, water users,  and Federal partners to adapt to long-term water scarcity at the basin  scale.   The bill would modernize existing Federal programs at the Bureau of  Reclamation to support long-term drought planning and resiliency by  stakeholders.   Specifically, the bill would authorize funding for States that choose  to pilot and implement their own multibenefit land repurposing  programs. Eligible State-run programs must be basin-scale, reduce  consumptive water use, and repurpose irrigated agricultural land for at  least 10 years. Programs must also provide one or more other measurable  benefits to the environment or community, including the restoration  habitat or floodplains connection to streams or rivers, the creation of  dedicated recharge areas, the facilitation of renewable energy  projects, the creation of parks or recreational areas, and other listed  uses. The bill would also prioritize State programs that provide direct  benefits to disadvantaged communities or were developed through a  multistakeholder planning process.   Because it may take time for States to stand up or pilot programs,  the bill would also make multibenefit land repurposing an eligible use  under the WaterSMART Program so that individual water users could apply  and compete for funding for multibenefit land repurposing projects.   Water scarcity at the basin scale demands widespread changes in water  use across the West. The Colorado River Basin's water storage shortage,  Utah's decline to record low levels of the Great Salt Lake, and  California's subsidence due to groundwater overdraft in the Central  Valley are just a few of the many examples of long-term, basin-scale  water scarcity demanding change in our water use.   Through the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction  Act, Congress has stepped up and invested billions of dollars in new  technologies to shore up our water supplies, including large-scale  water recycling and desalination. But a historic megadrought and the  climate crisis are unfortunately forcing Western States and water users  to reimagine how to allocate and govern water and forcing producers to  be more efficient with water or make do with less.   One tool to bolster drought resilience is to retire irrigation from  some agricultural lands, particularly where soils or productivity is  marginal, where non-irrigated agricultural uses can sustainably  contribute to an operation, or where important public benefits such as  fish and wildlife habitat, watershed health and aquifer recharge, or  renewable energy can be supported in a conversion from irrigated  agriculture.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Voluntary  Agricultural Land Repurposing Act as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Durbin):   S. 2179. A bill to help increase the development, distribution, and  use of clean cookstoves and fuels to improve health, protect the  climate and environment, empower women, create jobs, and help consumers  save time and money; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Atmospheric  Rivers Reconissance, Observation and Warning Act or ARROW Act. This  legislation will support critical atmospheric river reconnaissance  missions to improve forecasting for water managers across the west  coast.   Atmospheric rivers produce between 40 to 65 percent of annual  precipitation along the U.S. west coast but cause an estimated 90  percent or more of flood damage. These extreme storm events are the  primary driver of drought and major flooding events impacting the  entire western region, which is why the Federal Government alongside  researchers and water managers support a growing Federal investment  into atmospheric river reconnaissance research missions to help improve  AR forecasting.   The Air Force Reserve's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, also  known as Hurricane Hunters, fly specially equipped aircraft directly  into the eye of a storm between 8,000 and 10,000 feet above sea level  to collect valuable, real-time data that allows water managers,  disaster responders, researchers, and meteorologists to better predict  the impact of storm events such as ARs, hurricanes, and tropical  cyclones.   The ARROW Act would formalize ongoing AR reconnaissance efforts led  by the Air Force Reserve's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, which,  in consultation with NOAA, provide aircraft, personnel, and equipment  to meet the AR mission requirements during the winter season in the  west coast, from November through March.   The bill would direct the Air Force to work with NOAA to improve the  accuracy and timeliness of west coast AR forecasts and warning  services; support water management decisions and flood forecasting; and  participate in the Research and Operations Partnership, which guides  flight planning, to improve and expand the capabilities and  effectiveness of AR Recon into the future.   The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron is the only Department of  Defense organization still flying into tropical storms and hurricanes  and is a critical component of the U.S. weather forecasting apparatus.   Since fiscal year 2020, Congress has directed the 53rd to prioritize  atmospheric river reconnaissance in its National Winter Storms  Operations Plan. However, without formal authorization, growing AR  recon research will go unmet, leaving civil authorities and military  decision makers without key forecasting data to predict and respond  [[Page S2236]]  to AR landfall and to more effectively manage water supplies in an  increasingly variable climate.   That is why we need to pass the ARROW Act, to formalize the role of  the Air Force Reserve's Weather Reconnaissance Squadron as a critical  part of the U.S. storm forecasting and response infrastructure.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ARROW Act as  quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Smoke Exposure  Crop Insurance Act of 2023.
