 Madam Chair, what is a just transition to so-called  clean energy? We have been hearing the term all week from my colleagues  across the aisle. Does a just transition mean the highest inflation in  40 years or record energy prices? Does it mean handing out billions of  dollars to the green socialist lobby?   Does a just transition mean we let our Federal forests burn year over  year without maintaining them? Or does it mean we don't give Tribes the  same ability to take care of the forests as States have?   Just transition means some, but not all, can maintain the spaces  around them, and I am disappointed that my amendment was not included  in today's bill.   My amendment would have enabled Native Tribes and counties, which  have to live with the unmanaged forests around them, to have an  opportunity to help our forests be healthy.   I stand in opposition to this bill for a lot of reasons, just two of  which are not including Tribes and counties in this so-called wildfire  response package.
