 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of  this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come to the  House floor tonight to commemorate National Bible Week. This year's  Special Order marks the 79th annual celebration of a week in which we  celebrate the tremendous influence of the Bible on the freedoms we  enjoy today in America.   I am so thankful and blessed to live in a country where we have the  freedom to worship and read the Holy Scriptures without fear. Many  people across the globe live in countries where such freedoms do not  exist.   Mr. Speaker, under our wonderful system of government, people are  free to respect and study the Bible, or any other system of belief, if  they so choose--or even none at all. That is the beauty of the American  way, and it is rooted in the deep truths contained in the Word of God.   In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of  Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week. This is the time we set aside  to recognize the Bible as a foundational building block of Western  civilization, the Judeo-Christian heritage, and the ideas and  principles that shape the thinking of our America's Founding Fathers.   The Word of God has had a profound impact on my life as well. I agree  with the Psalmist when he says:         Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.    This has been true in my own life as well. God's Word has shaped my  thinking and deeply influenced my relationship with God. The Bible has  indeed been a guiding light in every area of my life and a source of  comfort and strength in a time of need.   In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from various  faiths, traditions, and denominations to speak about what the Bible  means to them. We are here, in keeping with tradition, to recognize  National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I  yield to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson),  who is the current chairman of the Republican Study Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, that reminds me of a story here from the Halls of  Congress in the beginning of our country's history.   Many of the early American settlers who came to the New World with  the express purpose of living out their faith to God and his Word,  according to the convictions of their own consciences, founded our  country. And one of the very first Congress' first acts was the  authorization of an American-published Bible.   The Revolutionary War with the British in the late 1700s had cut off  all remaining shipments of Bibles from England.                                time  1745    Our Founding Fathers understood how important it was for the American  people to have access to Bibles.   Robert Aitken, a private citizen, brought this need to the attention  of Congress, and he wrote a letter saying: ``This work is an object  worthy of the attention of the Congress of the United  [[Page H7097]]  States of America, who will not neglect spiritual security, while they  are virtuously contending for temporal blessings.''   In 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and authorized the first known  English language Bible to be printed in America. They passed a  resolution, here in the halls of Congress--or the Continental  Congress--saying: ``Resolved, that the United States in Congress  assembled highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr.  Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion, as well as an  instance of the progress of arts in this country, and being satisfied  from the above report of his care and accuracy in the execution of the  work, they recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of  the United States, and hereby authorize him to publish this  recommendation in the manner he shall think proper.''   Can you imagine doing that today? The House of Representatives  approving the printing of a Bible?   Our country has changed over the years, and I am not sure it has  always changed for the better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate his  remarks.   Next, it is with great pleasure that I would like to recognize a  personal friend as well as a colleague from Michigan. He and his wife,  Sue, have been an example to my wife and me in the sincerity of their  beliefs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, those of us who believe in the Bible are sometimes  accused of having blind faith. But nothing could be further from the  truth. There are many proofs on why we know that the Bible is actually  true. One of those is the fulfillment of prophecies.   The accuracy of the Bible is proven by so many prophecies,  foretelling future events, that have come true exactly as foretold,  especially in the Old Testament. There have been many predictions that  were given to prove, when they were first spoken, that the speaker was  divinely inspired. If and when  [[Page H7098]]  those predictions came true, it validated the words of that person, of  that prophet.   For instance, the Book of Daniel has some very detailed prophecies,  scores of these, that were literally fulfilled, that could not have  ever been done by chance. Skeptics responded and said, well, Daniel  must have been written after those events. They, otherwise, could not  have been so detailed on what happened later and that the writer of  Daniel was not being honest.   But, in fact, it was discovered afterward that the Book of Daniel was  found in its entirety in the Greeks' Septuagint and partially in the  Dead Sea Scrolls, and both of those were proven to predate the events  that were prophesied. That argument that it was written later fell  through. This means that the critics of the Book of Daniel and its  dating are the ones who are not being honest.   The rise and fall of empires, the capture and destruction of cities,  the destiny of kings, all were prophesied about in minute detail.  Fulfillment of prophecy is just one of the reasons we know that the  Bible is true.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his great  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I also thank him  for his service to our country. We have many veterans who are serving  in Congress, and Representative Bacon is one of the finest.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman; he made some  reference to here in the Capitol, some of the insignia that shows the  recognition of God.   Above the Speaker, it says, ``In God We Trust.'' That is chiseled in  the stone there.   Behind me, among all these lawgivers down through the centuries,  Moses is there in the center looking straight on, over our  deliberations. He gave us the Ten Commandments.   So I appreciate, also, those historical references.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), who  is the policy chairman of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I would like to recall an incident from my own background.   When I was a freshman in college years ago, some people talked to me,  and they said: Do you know what the Bible is about?   I said: Yeah, I know all about it.   Although, I realized after a minute went by, that that was really a  pretty presumptuous answer because I had never actually read anything  in the Bible.   Mr. Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for others who are  listening in today.   The only honest thing I could do at that point when I realized I  hadn't read any of it was to say: I am going to read the Bible for  myself.   So I started by reading the Gospel of John in the New Testament. And  when I read it, I discovered that I hadn't known at all what the Bible  was about. I learned that Jesus said things like:         I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the       Father but through me.    I ended up discovering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who  became my Lord and Savior.   Mr. Speaker, I speak from personal experience when I say that it is  better to read the Bible for one's self and not just take someone  else's word for it for what it says. My life has been transformed by  the truths that it holds.   The message of the good news of Jesus is still transforming lives  today. John 3:16:         For God so loved to world that He gave His only begotten       Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have       eternal life.    So as we celebrate National Bible Week, we celebrate the place that  faith holds in both our private and public lives. The Bible's message  of hope is a powerful one of redemption and hope, and we cherish its  message today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his heartfelt  remarks, and I wish him the best in the future.   Another reason why I believe that we can use our reason to believe in  the Bible and not just blind faith--as some accuse us of who are  believers--is archaeology. There are many archeological discoveries  which have validated Biblical accounts, even accounts that weren't  believed in the first place, but later archaeology proved them to be  true.   This gives us trustworthiness that we ascribe to the Bible during  this National Bible Week. Archaeology has time and time again shown  that Biblical personalities, locations, and events actually existed in  time and space. Claims by critics that a Biblical statement was simply  made up have been debunked by later archeological discoveries more  times than we can say.   For instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the late  forties and fifties proved the credibility and authority of Scripture.  The discovery of those scrolls shine light on the oldest record of the  worldwide flood and the longstanding authority and accuracy of all of  the events of the Bible.   Jewish archaeologist, Nelson Glueck, has said: It may be stated  categorically that no archeological discovery has ever controverted or  contradicted a Biblical reference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), who I  am going to miss greatly as he retires and goes into a new life at the  end of this year. I sat next to him in Armed Services for 13 years up  until now, and I cherish our relationship. He is someone that I deeply  trust, and I acknowledge his integrity.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I would like to  say that this country is a better place because of your service. Thank  you.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, quickly I am going to give a quote from one  of our Presidents, our Founding Father, and then John Quincy Adams, the  sixth President.   George Washington said: It is impossible to rightly govern a Nation  without God and the Bible. So he began a rich history of Presidents  leaning on the Bible for wisdom and guidance.   John Quincy Adams, the sixth President said: ``The first and almost  the only Book deserving of universal attention is the Bible.'' So those  are great quotes from some of our Founding Fathers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I would I yield  to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his great words.   In conclusion, it has been an honor to commemorate National Bible  Week this evening. I am grateful to my colleagues who joined me.   The Bible claims to be more than a mere book. It claims to be the  inspired words of God. As it says in the first book of Peter:         All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower       of grass. The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the       word of the Lord abides forever.    So I am thankful for the Word of God on my life and all the lives of  those who have spoken today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
