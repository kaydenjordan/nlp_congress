 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.   I thank the chairman, first of all, for his hard work on this bill,  and all the members of the committee and the staff. As the chairman has  pointed out, this is a bill that we have passed for 55 straight years.  It is a long and complicated bill that essentially sets the defense and  national security policy for our country, and there is a lot of good  work that has gone into this bill.   Again, I thank the members for doing that. They recognize the complex  threat environment that the chairman correctly described, and we are  attempting to address it as best we can in this very difficult  environment.   I think the thing that is most difficult that I really want to  emphasize is what the chairman said in the middle of his remarks: that  over the past 6 years we have had one government shutdown, a number of  continuing resolutions, several threatened government shutdowns, and  the unpredictability that that has presented to the Defense Department.   Now, to be clear, it has also presented a fair amount--the same  amount of unpredictability to the nondefense discretionary budget that  also has to deal with those challenges. But that uncertainty about our  budget has made it very difficult to plan, and nowhere is that more  important than at the Department of Defense.                                time  1930    As they try to lay out a strategy for national security, not knowing  from one month to the next how much money you are going to have or what  you are going to be able to spend it on is a huge problem. I will say a  little bit more about this later, because as big a problem as that is,  we haven't solved it.   As we debate this bill here today, we do not have a budget resolution  from either the House or the Senate. This is a problem we still need to  work on. However much money we wind up spending on defense, if we had a  cohesive plan and a clear idea of how much money we were going to have  over the next few years, it would be a lot easier to plan for those  contingencies.   Again, I do want to compliment the work that has been done on this  bill. Particularly, I focus a lot on unconventional threats. I think  that is the changing nature of the world. I used to chair what is now  called the Emerging Threats Committee. I want to thank Congresswoman  Stefanik and Ranking Member Langevin for their work and focusing on  cyber, focusing on supporting our special operation forces that have  borne so much of the brunt of the fight that we face in countering  terrorism.   I also want to thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Cooper for  their work on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, focusing on space, in  particular, on the importance of emphasizing that. For a long time, our  country dominated space. We didn't have to worry about it. But now a  lot of other countries are catching up and competing with us. I think  this bill reflects the importance of that.   So there are a lot of very solid things in this bill, but I want to  close by emphasizing two significant problems that we still need to  address.   One I mentioned already. We don't have a budget resolution. This bill  has $621 billion in it, as I understand it, in the base bill, and  another, I believe, $75 billion in the overseas contingency fund. We  are spending nearly $700 billion in this bill on defense. That is a lot  of money, and the chairman mentioned a lot of the very necessary  programs that it is going towards. However, that breaks the budget  caps.   In order to break the budget caps, the House and the Senate have to  vote to break the budget caps. It is July. We haven't done that. I will  emphasize that in the Senate it actually requires 60 votes to break the  budget caps.   So as much as I see the need in defense, given the complex threat  environment out there, it is very possible that $72 billion of what is  in this bill is going to disappear between now and the end of this year  unless we address the broader issue of sequestration and budget caps.   I will also emphasize that addressing that issue by gutting funding  for the nondefense discretionary budget and plussing up defense is not  going to work for a couple of reasons.   Number one, a lot of the national security needs that we have come  out of some of those other items. The proposal to cut the State  Department by 31 percent in a time when we face the complex threat  environment that was described is ridiculous. In fact, I will quote  Chairman Mattis as well, who said:         If you are going to cut the State Department by 30 percent,       you better give me five more divisions because I am going to       need them. We are not going to be able to resolve conflicts       in a peaceful way.    And also, of course, we have domestic needs that are very important  as well. We are still waiting on the infrastructure package from the  administration.   There are a lot of needs that are not being met, and we are not yet  voting to bust the budget caps. Here we have a bill that does that, but  this House has to step up and take that vote if this defense  authorizing bill is going to go forward.   The second and final point, we still don't have a national security  strategy from the White House. Now, we have a very complex threat  environment, as I have said more often than I meant to during the  course of the last few minutes--we do. We have got Russia, China, North  Korea, Iran, a variety of terrorist threats. What we have heard in our  committee for the last 6 months is a series of people from the Pentagon  coming over and saying the house is on fire. We don't have enough money  to do--fill in the blank. There are a whole lot of different things.   What we haven't heard is a strategy, and the most disturbing  conversation I had in that regard was with someone from the Office of  Net Assessment.    I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   He explained to me that we laid out a strategy in 2012 and said we do  not have the money to fund that strategy right now. So I asked him:  Well, how short are you? How much more money do you need?   He looked at me like he didn't understand what I was asking, so I  sort of explained it. The short answer: he didn't know.   How could he not know? I mean, if you can sit there confidently and  say, ``My gosh, we don't have enough money; we are way crazy short of  our 2012 strategy'' and you still can't say how short, then you don't  have a strategy. We need a strategy to make sure this money is spent  wisely.   I will close with a compliment of the chairman for something that he  has done. We should also not assume that simply spending more money at  the Department of Defense is necessarily going to make us safer. We  have to make sure we spend it efficiently and effectively. I think this  bill has a lot of very solid efforts to try to make us do that, towards  acquisition reform, towards spending the money more wisely.   It is not just a matter of spending more money. We have got to spend  it smarter, and we have got to confront the lack of a strategy, and we  have got to confront the fact that we still have not resolved our  budget resolution problem.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces.    I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Guam (Ms. Bordallo), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.   (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Military Personnel.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much  time remains on each side.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) who is the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, what I really want to focus on is the budget problem,  because that is really underlying all of this.   We have heard a lot of good speeches from Members talking about what  is in this bill, how important it is, how what is in this bill is  attempting both to meet our national security threats and, as  importantly, to make sure that we take care of the men and women who  serve our military, who fight to protect us to make sure, first of all,  that they and their families are taken care of from a financial  standpoint, but also to make sure they have the equipment and training  they need to be ready to fight the fights that we ask them to go to. I  think that is one of the great challenges.   Whatever it is we decide ought to be our national security strategy,  I think the thing we all agree on is we need to make sure we provide  the training, equipment, and support so that the men and women who  serve in the military are ready for that fight.   The worst thing we can do is create a hollow force and set up an  expectation that: You need to do all of this, but we are only going to  train you for that. So if this other stuff comes up, you are not going  to be ready.   We have talked about this a lot in our committee to make sure that we  are ready for the fight that comes. And that is where the budget  creates a very significant problem.   We have talked a lot about the Budget Control Act and sequestration.  It is pretty clear why we had the Budget Control Act and sequestration.  I was here for it. We were days away from not raising the debt ceiling  and basically not meeting our commitments to pay our bills. There are  those who figure that that can be a significant problem.    So we made an agreement. We were going to try to get the budget under  control. Sequestration was put in place, with the expectation that it  wouldn't be implemented because we would come to a grand bargain on  revenue and spending that would get our deficit under control. Well, we  didn't, and sequestration kicked in.   But as we sit here today, even if we got rid of sequestration, even  if we got rid of the budget caps, we are still $20 trillion in debt. We  are going to run a $700 billion deficit. This is projected to go  nowhere but up in the years ahead. I don't believe that is sustainable.   Now, I don't think we need to balance the budget tomorrow or next  year or even in the next 5 years, but we need to get ourselves on a  sustainable path. And we flat refuse to do that.   You don't see a lot of campaigns promising to cut specific programs  or promising to raise taxes. I love the fact that if you poll the  American people, there is a very clear consensus on what they think we  ought to do about this problem.   First of all, somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 percent of them  support a balanced budget now, by the way. Not 5, 10 years, but right  now.   You ask them: Well, here are all the places where the government  spends money. What would you like to cut?   The answer to that question is: nothing. Literally nothing.   The Pew Research folks do a poll on this every year, and in every  single category a majority of people would rather keep the money the  same or increase it, as opposed to decrease it.   Of course, if you ask them what taxes they would like to increase, by  and large, they don't want to increase taxes. It is interesting. If you  can convince people that the taxes in question will not apply to them,  for a brief moment they will be supportive of it. But then someone will  come along and convince them that at some point it might apply to them,  and then they oppose it.   So our task as Members of Congress is to balance the budget without  raising taxes or cutting spending. That, of course, is impossible. So  what we have chosen to do is put off that decision for as long as is  humanly possible.   That is why we do not have a budget resolution. Any budget resolution  this body could create would fail on probably multiple fronts of what  the public expects. It wouldn't balance the budget. It would cut  spending they didn't want to cut. It probably wouldn't raise taxes,  coming from this majority, but if it did, it wouldn't be popular. So we  have to start having an honest conversation about the budget.   We hear in the Armed Services Committee all the time about all the  needs, all the shortfalls, all the critical things we need to do. We  argue about it and argue about it, but in 6 years the Republican  majority has not put forward a plan to control mandatory spending. They  say that is the problem. No plan to do that. Certainly, they haven't  even considered the possibility of increasing revenue.   If we are this serious--and we should be--about making sure that we  have the funds necessary to provide an adequate national security, then  we should stop cowering from the budget debate.   Personally, I am all for raising taxes because I see the needs that  the chairman and everybody else has described, and I am actually  prepared to pay for them. So we need to do that. That overarching  budget problem is what has put us in this mess.   As we talk about this bill, as I said, it is $72 billion over the  budget caps. Unless we get a vote to lift those budget caps--which I  just mentioned is politically unpopular, which is why we haven't done  it for the full 6 months we have been in session this year--then that  $72 billion goes away and the Pentagon is back in chaos.   So this may be a good bill. It may be solid. It doesn't have the  backing of the budget.   Let me finally suggest that there are some things that the Department  of Defense could do. This is why the strategy is so important.   Yes, the Obama administration waited until May of 2010. They didn't  have 6 years of CRs and government shutdowns and threatened shutdowns  and the changing threat environment that we have. They had a reasonably  consistent set of problems. It was a set of problems, but they had the  same Secretary of Defense from the previous administration. They had  time to look at that.  [[Page H5542]]    We need this strategy urgently because the big question is: Are we  spending the money correctly? Is the Department of Defense spending the  money in the right way? Do we have a strategy to figure out how we  should prioritize?   We don't. With this crushing budget environment, it is absolutely  critical that we do. We need to consider the possibility, for instance,  that we might be spending some money that we shouldn't be spending.   I will often ask that question of the generals who come over and tell  us how short they are of everything. I say: Well, where are we spending  money, in your opinion, that we shouldn't be?   They never answer the question. You cannot tell me in a $700 billion  budget in a place as large as the Pentagon that there isn't somebody  over there who knows to say: Look, we shouldn't be doing this.   Just to give one suggestion, we have had the BRAC debate forever. We  have had a shrinking military, yet we have maintained the same  infrastructure. We have seen study after study from the Air Force and  others about how much excess capacity they have and money that could be  saved from doing that. But again this year, for, I submit, political  reasons, BRAC is prohibited.   So we need to get a lot smarter about how we are going to spend this  money and a lot smarter about our budget if this bill is actually going  to become reality.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I am not going to take that much  time. I agree with the chairman. This is uncontroversial and should be  adopted.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, there is nothing political  about a domestic agenda, and this isn't conditional on additional money  being spent. In fact, the chairman has got it exactly flip-flop.   The money that we are providing for the armed services at this point,  the extra money, is conditioned on cutting it from everything else. As  we saw in President Trump's budget, $54 billion-plus up for defense and  $54 billion taken away from the domestic agenda.   And it is beyond insulting to say that if you support any sort of  domestic spending, you don't care about the troops. That being  concerned about transportation and infrastructure, which, by the way,  bridges have collapsed and killed people in this country because of the  problems with our transportation and infrastructure.   The Department of Homeland Security is part of nondefense  discretionary spending. Does it not protect us? We have heard from the  President it does.   The State Department is also part of nondefense discretionary  spending, where we have heard from the Secretary of Defense that it  saves lives.   So for our committee--the Armed Services Committee to say, ``We are  all that matters, to hell with everything else; and if you care at all  about transportation or domestic agenda, you don't care about the  troops,'' that is what is an incredibly disingenuous argument.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to make two quick  points, first to the point Mr. Blumenauer made about how we are  planning on recapitalizing our entire nuclear arsenal.   Now, we have had a robust debate about how much that is going to cost  over 10, 25, 30 years. I have some sympathy for the argument that Mr.  Rogers made. It is going to be very difficult to estimate how much it  is going to cost over 25 or 30 years.  [[Page H5735]]    But I do know that if we are talking about recapitalizing our entire  nuclear arsenal, all of the submarines, all of the ICBMs, a new bomber,  it is going to cost a lot. I don't know if it is $1.2 trillion or $2  trillion. Whatever it is, it is going to be enormously expensive.                                time  2215    At a time when we face a multiplicity of threats from Russia, North  Korea, and where missile defense is critical, I do not believe this is  the best investment of our money to get caught up in the Cold War, in  the battle against Russia and their nuclear weapons, and making sure we  can counter every possible scenario. It is not an efficient use of  money.   This amendment is but one piece of it to say let's take a step back  and see if this is the best place to spend the money. Maybe it would be  better to spend it on cybersecurity. Maybe it would be better to spend  it on missile defense.   There are a whole lot of other places I think that are better than  trapping ourselves in these nuclear scenarios that require us to build  an unbelievably expensive nuclear arsenal.   Secondly, I will disagree with Mr. Rogers on one point: the more you  build nuclear weapons, the more the other side tends to build nuclear  weapons.   I cannot agree that this is not going to potentially lead to an  escalation. In fact, the reason we are so hell-bent on building the  LRSO and all of these others is because we are concerned about what  Russia and China are doing.   That is how it works. It does have that destabilizing effect. I don't  think this is the best place for us to spend our defense dollars.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I  disagree very strongly with the remarks of the gentleman from South  Carolina.   First of all, the past BRACs have saved us an enormous amount of  money. There have been five rounds. The first four saved us pretty much  exactly as much money as they said they were going to. The fifth one  was more expensive, but the fifth one was done in 2005, at a time when  we were building up the size of the military. It wasn't so much a  closure as it was a realignment. But even then, it is now saving us  money.   So if you want to argue against BRAC, argue against BRAC; but please,  let us not argue that it doesn't save us money because that is just  factually ridiculous. It absolutely saves us money.   Second, there have been a number of studies by the Air Force and  others. The Air Force has estimated that they are 20 percent over the  capacity of their installations. It would be great if we could have a   comprehensive study. I agree with that. What our bill has done every  year for the last several years is prohibit them from even thinking  about a BRAC.    So it is a brilliant argument to say, well, you can't do a BRAC  because you haven't done a comprehensive study, and then to put in the  bill you are prohibited from doing a comprehensive study. It is a nice  little tautology, but it isn't helping our military.   As we have been discussing throughout the night, we have more needs  than we have money for. We cannot afford for parochial interests to get  in the way of what is in the best interest of our troops. We need a  BRAC.   By the way, it doesn't even authorize a BRAC. It simply removes the  prohibition of a BRAC. A BRAC cannot happen unless Congress authorizes  it. So all this is going to do if this amendment passes is allow the  military to do precisely what the gentleman from South Carolina just  said they ought to do.   There is no reason to oppose this amendment, and I urge support.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  though I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I just want to say very quickly,  I still have the concerns that I have expressed about the broader  nuclear weapons issue and will talk a little bit more about that in a  minute. But you know, this is a way to at least give an option to get a  greater idea of the costs. So it may not be everything that we would  want, but it is certainly not something that we should oppose, so I do  not oppose it and would urge support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).                                time  2245     Mr. Chair, I yield 90 seconds to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5744]]         Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume just to clean up a couple of earlier debates we had on  amendments. I just wanted to make a couple of arguments.   On the nuclear weapons issue, I just want to be clear, we support a  strong and robust nuclear deterrence. We are not advocating unilateral  disarmament by any stretch of the imagination.   We are simply asking: In the budget challenge environment that we  have, is this the best use of our money to totally rebuild our entire  nuclear weapons system?   And the amendments that were offered weren't even necessarily saying  no. They are just saying this is something we ought to study and ought  to talk about.   And I will, however, disagree with one argument that was made about  how somehow it is a myth that over the last 70 years, all of our  adversaries are building nuclear weapons in response to the nuclear  weapons that we have built. I think that is a big misreading of  history.   We all recall that we were first to the table on this. And thank  goodness we were. It enabled us to end World War II. But we are still  the only nation on Earth that has actually used nuclear weapons. And  when the Soviet Union developed theirs, we had them and they didn't.  And I think it is a little ridiculous to assume that no part of their  thinking was that:         Well, if the United States of America, our prime adversary,       has nuclear weapons, we better have them, too.    And then we saw the arms race accelerate, even to the point of the  famous debate in 1960, how candidate John Kennedy talked about the  missile gap that we had. That turned out to be a total fabrication. It  wasn't true. We didn't have that gap. It was unfair to what the  Eisenhower administration was doing. But the argument from the other  side that the notion of an arms race is ridiculous is something that I  think is wrong.   Arms races do happen. And part of what we need to do in working with  our adversaries is to try to contain them in a reasonable fashion. So I  do believe that in many cases, it becomes a self-perpetuating thing. We  build them, they build them; we build them, they build them. And I hope  that part of our nuclear strategy isn't just building as many nuclear  weapons as is humanly possible, but is actually opening up lines of  communication with potential adversaries like China, with adversaries  like Russia.   Now, I will grant you that where North Korea is concerned, and as I  have said repeatedly, we have to deter them, but we have the power to  destroy North Korea, I think, hundreds of times over. We have the  capacity in terms of our weapons systems to deter them.  [[Page H5748]]    So I hope, as we look at modernizing our nuclear weapons systems, we  will consider the cost and the effectiveness of doing that. And I know  Mr. Rogers has offered his thoughtful amendment to give the Department  of Defense some opportunity to do that, but that is all we were trying  to say on that.   On BRAC, a couple of arguments were made at the end there that were  somewhat misleading. One was that Secretary Mattis had said that he  wanted to totally relook at the situation, implying that Secretary  Mattis didn't think that a BRAC was a good idea.   The Pentagon--President Donald Trump's Pentagon and Secretary Mattis'  Pentagon--recommended a BRAC round that we rejected. So make no mistake  about it, the Republican President and Secretary Mattis support a BRAC  round.   And two more minor points. It was argued that, well, we voted for  this bill 60 to 1 out of committee, so we were all in favor of it. Yes,  not all, but we were in favor of the bill. This was a small piece of  that bill. So to argue in a bill--and forgive me, I don't know how many  pages this year's bill is. I know last year's was 1,600--that in a  1,600-page bill, if you vote for it, you have got to support absolutely  everything in it is a notion that I don't think any Member would  support.   Again, I will emphasize an argument that I made with Mr. Wilson on  the notion that, well, gosh, they don't have a study, they haven't  looked at it, they haven't thought about what they are going to do,  when, in fact, it is Congress that has prohibited them legislatively--  and I don't know how many of the last few years, but several of them-- from doing that.   Let's at least let them take a look at it to give us the numbers,  because the same point as the nuclear weapons issue, as we have heard  over and over today, we have crucial readiness shortfalls.   In many ways I will agree with the chairman: we are right now not  doing right by the men and women who serve in the military by not  providing them with the training and the equipment they need to do the  missions that we are contemplating having them do. And if that is the  case, if we can find savings by not building as many nuclear weapons as  we need or by closing institutions that we do not need, then I think  that is something that we owe the men and women who serve in the  military.   And let's not kid ourselves. This is a very parochial issue. There  are a whole bunch of bases in the State of Washington. I don't want to  see any of them closed, but if the military decides that that is the  best thing to do, I am not going to stand in the way of it.   And I hope, given the dire situation that we face that has been  described by my Republican colleagues, that we would put parochial  concerns to the side and do what is best for the military, to make sure  that we are spending the money as wisely as we possibly can and to make  absolutely certain that the men and women who serve are trained,  equipped, and ready to fight whatever fight it is we ask them to go  into.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the second en bloc amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2300     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, it is not clear that it has  got a prohibition on a study, nor does it call for one.   So as we get into conference, I think it might be a worthwhile thing  to say that we authorize, ask--you know, and I am not sure if this is  something the Defense Department can do without our authorization or  not, but it is something that we should discuss as we get into  conference, to have them do that study.   I think that would be an excellent first step, but I am not sure that  we  [[Page H5749]]  cover it in this bill. Maybe we do, and we can figure that out over the  course of the next 48 hours. But if it doesn't, that is something that  I think we ought to try to do.    Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the  en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I support the en bloc package,  as well, and I yield back the balance of my time.
