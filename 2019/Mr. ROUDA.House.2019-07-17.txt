 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1847) to require congressional notification for certain  changes in status of inspectors general, and for other purposes, as  amended.

(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 3. PRESIDENTIAL EXPLANATION OF FAILURE TO NOMINATE AN                     INSPECTOR GENERAL.         (a) In General.--Subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5,       United States Code, is amended by inserting after section       3349d the following new section:       ``Sec. 3349e.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter       33 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting       after the item relating to 3349d the following new item:  ``3349e.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the Inspector General Protection  Act, which would improve the independence of inspectors general.   This bipartisan bill, introduced by Representative Ted Lieu and  Representative Jody Hice, would also address the disturbingly slow  nomination of IGs that have been the norm across multiple  administrations.   The bill would require notification of Congress 30 days prior to an  IG being placed on leave. Such notification is already required prior  to an IG being removed from duty.   The bill would also require the President to report to Congress if he  has not nominated an IG after 210 days of a vacancy occurring.   The report must include the reasons for failing to make the  nomination and a target date for doing so. The requirement will  hopefully prod the executive branch to nominate IG's in a more timely  manner.                                time  1530    Inspectors general provide critical oversight and accountability  within Federal agencies, and the positions need to be filled more  quickly than is currently the case.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu), the sponsor of  this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 736) to require the Director of the Government Publishing  Office to establish and maintain an online portal accessible to the  public that allows the public to obtain electronic copies of all  congressionally mandated reports in one place, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 736         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Redaction of Information.--The head of a Federal agency       may redact information required to be disclosed under this       Act if the information would be properly withheld from       disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code,       and shall--        (1) redact information required to be disclosed under this       Act if disclosure of such information is prohibited by law;        (2) redact information being withheld under this subsection       prior to submitting the information to the Director;        (3) redact only such information properly withheld under       this subsection from the submission of information or from       any congressionally mandated report submitted under this Act;        (4) identify where any such redaction is made in the       submission or report; and        (5) identify the exemption under which each such redaction       is made.

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the measure before us.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative   Mike Quigley for his  persistence in pursuing this good-government legislation. Hopefully, we  can get this bill enacted this Congress.   H.R. 736, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, is a  noncontroversial bill that has been approved by the Oversight and  Reform Committee many times. The bill is a commonsense measure that  would make the government more transparent and accountable. It would  create a one-stop-shop where Congress and members of the public could  access agency reports to Congress.   Federal agencies submit thousands of reports to Congress each year.  This bill will improve congressional oversight by making it easy to  find and access these reports. H.R. 736 would also give the public  access to agency reports.   Currently, members of the public often have to file requests under  the Freedom of Information Act to obtain some agency reports to  Congress. Many of these reports are not available online.   An online library of Federal reports would improve the ability of our  staffs  [[Page H5953]]  to use the information in them to make sound policy. It also would  encourage agency compliance with reporting requirements. Finally, it  would support timely access to the reports by State and local  governments, students, academics, and others, with the additional  benefit of decreasing the burden on agencies to process FOIA requests.   The Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act has been endorsed  by over 25 organizations from across the political spectrum. I have a  letter from those groups that I include in the Record.                                                     July 16, 2019.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, and       Members of the House of Representatives: We, the 27       undersigned organizations, write to express our strong       support for the bipartisan Access to Congressionally Mandated       Reports Act (``ACMRA'') and to respectfully urge you to vote       in favor of the legislation on the House floor. If enacted,       the ACMRA will strengthen Congressional oversight and improve       government transparency.        The ACMRA will establish a central repository of agency       reports submitted to Congress and will track whether agencies       have submitted required reports. This will improve Members of       Congress's access to the reports and ensure Congress knows       when they become available.        The ACMRA also directs agencies to provide the Government       Publishing Office (GPO) any report that is both required by       law to be submitted to Congress and is releasable under the       Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), subject to certain       limitations. The legislation will not change what information       is in the public sphere, but it will improve accessibility.       Nor does the legislation affect in any way what information       is provided to Congressional committees or place any burden       upon them.        Under the ACMRA, agency reports will become publicly       available on GPO's website within 30 days of submission to       Congress, and will be redacted in accordance with FOIA's       provisions, which include the removal of classified or       otherwise confidential material. Reports will be assigned a       unique identifier that will make it easy to track reports as       new editions are released.        Additionally, the Congressional Research Service will       supplement work already performed by the Clerk of the House       to identify all agency reports the law requires be submitted       to Congress. This will tell us whether an agency has complied       with its obligation to submit reports in a timely fashion.        The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs       Committee favorably reported a similar version of the bill in       April. Additionally, the legislation was repeatedly favorably       reported by both the Committee on House Administration and       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during prior       Congresses.        The ACMRA was first introduced in 2010, and we are hopeful       it will become part of this Congress's transparency legacy.        We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of the measure       and are hopeful the ACMRA will be enacted shortly.            Sincerely yours,        American Association of Law Libraries, American Library       Association, Americans for Prosperity, Campaign for       Accountability, Center for Data Innovation, Center for       Responsive Politics, Demand Progress, Data Coalition,       Essential Information, Free Government Information, Freedom       Works, Government Information Watch, GovTrack.us, Judicial       Watch.        Liberty Coalition, Lincoln Network, National Coalition for       History, National Immigrant Justice Center, National Security       Archive, PEGI Project, Project On Government Oversight, R       Street Institute, Senior Executives Association, Society of       Professional journalists, Sunlight Foundation, Taxpayers for       Common Sense, Win Without War.     Madam Speaker, legislation similar to this bill has been  introduced in the Senate and favorably reported by the Senate Committee  on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), a distinguished Member and sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1250) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 11158 Highway 146 North in Hardin, Texas, as the  ``Lucas Lowe Post Office'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H5954]]            SECTION 1. LUCAS LOWE MEMORIAL POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 11158 Highway 146 North in Hardin, Texas,       shall be known and designated as the ``Lucas Lowe Memorial       Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Lucas Lowe Memorial Post Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1250 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 11158 Highway 146 North in Hardin, Texas, as the Lucas Lowe  Memorial Post Office.   Chief Warrant Officer Lucas Lowe's life was defined by a call to  service. On July 6, 2004, Lucas enlisted in the United States Army. He  was deployed to Afghanistan for 11 months from 2005 and 2006, and Iraq  for 14 months from 2007 to 2008. Lucas later attended Warrant Officer  Candidate School at Fort Rucker, Alabama, where he also enrolled in  flight school to become an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter pilot.   On December 28, 2016, Chief Warrant Officer Lucas Lowe passed way  during a training flight with the Army National Guard. Lucas  demonstrated in his short life the kind of commitment to service that  should be an example to all of us. He leaves behind to cherish his  memory his wife, Kami; sons, Clayton, Lance, and Logan; and daughters,  Alysen and Tenley Lowe.   Naming a post office in Lucas Lowe's honor in Hardin, Texas, is a  fitting tribute to honor and remember a young man who made the ultimate  sacrifice in service to all of us.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I urge all the  Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1526) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 200 Israel Road Southeast in Tumwater, Washington,  as the ``Eva G. Hewitt Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1526         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EVA G. HEWITT POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 200 Israel Road Southeast in Tumwater,       Washington, shall be known and designated as the ``Eva G.       Hewitt Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Eva G. Hewitt Post Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.  [[Page H5955]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1526, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 200 Israel Road Southeast in Tumwater, Washington,  as the ``Eva G. Hewitt Post Office.''   Eva Hewitt was not just a business woman and postmaster, but she was  often described as the heart and soul of Tumwater.   With her husband, Charles Hewitt, Eva established the Hewitt Drug  Store which housed the Tumwater Post Office. Eva Hewitt started as an  assistant, and later assumed the role of postmaster in 1915. Following  the death of her husband in 1927, Eva Hewitt took over business  operations of the drugstore with the help of her daughter, Laura.   Eva would continue to serve as postmaster until 1942. At the time,  Eva Hewitt was the longest serving postmaster in Tumwater, where she  oversaw a massive growth in the volume of mail in the Pacific  Northwest.   Eva Hewitt also was a community leader and was widely regarded as  Tumwater's local historian. She was also active in the Daughters of the  Pioneers of Washington and was the namesake of the Eva Hewitt  Orthopedic Guild. The Hewitt Drug Store was eventually demolished for  the construction of Interstate 5.   Naming a post office to honor Ms. Hewitt's public service would help  ensure that her pivotal legacy to her home of Tumwater, Washington,  lives on.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), who is the sponsor  of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Washington for his comments and also encourage all of the Members to  support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1844) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 66 Grove Court in Elgin, Illinois, as the ``Corporal  Alex Martinez Memorial Post Office Building''.

Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2325) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 100 Calle Alondra in San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the  ``65th Infantry Regiment Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2325         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. 65TH INFANTRY REGIMENT POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 100 Calle Alondra in San Juan, Puerto       Rico, shall be known and designated as the ``65th Infantry       Regiment Post Office Building''.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 2325, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 100 Calle Alondra San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the 65th  Infantry Regiment Post Office Building.   In 1899, a year after the Spanish-American War, Congress authorized  the creation of a unit of volunteer soldiers in the new territory of  Puerto Rico. Redesignated in 1920 as the 65th Infantry Regiment of the  United States Army, this unit served admirably in World War II and the  Korean war.   In World War II, the 65th Infantry Regiment suffered casualties  defending against enemy attacks, with regiment members earning one  Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, and 90  Purple Hearts.   In the Korean war, when General MacArthur ordered the evacuation of  the Hungnam enclave, the 65th Infantry Regiment played a crucial role,  and ultimately, under the Regiment's protection, 105,000 troops and  100,000 refugees were evacuated.   These brave Americans protected the very foundation of this great  country. Naming a post office to honor the 65th Infantry Regiment who  served and sacrificed for us is but a small price of what these brave  men and women deserve from the country to whom they have given so much.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, encourage my colleagues to support  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for leading the minority discussion today, the newest Member of  Congress. It is an honor to serve with him.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
