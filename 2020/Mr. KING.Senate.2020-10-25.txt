 Mr. President, ``The American people should have a voice in  the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this  vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President''--Senator  Mitch McConnell, February 13, 2016. I don't always agree with Senator  McConnell, but I agree with him on that one. This is a violation of our  rules, of our history.   There have been 13 vacancies within the last 10 months of a  Presidential election year in American history. Nine of them were  before July 1. Of those nine, seven were confirmed by the Senate, two  were not: one under President John Tyler and the other was Merrick  Garland.   There have been only four vacancies in the Supreme Court that have  occurred after July 1 of an election year; zero of them have been  confirmed: three in three cases, including Abraham Lincoln. They  weren't even nominees; the President waited until after the election.  In one, there was a nominee; the Senate tabled the nomination. So all  of this talk that we have had about history and precedent, those are  the facts: 13 in the last 10 months, 9 of them before July 1--all were  confirmed except one 150 years ago and Merrick Garland.   I agree with Mitch McConnell on the 13th of February 2016: ``The  American people should have a voice in the selection of their next  Supreme Court Justice. Therefore this vacancy should not be filled  until we have a new President.'' He said that 8 months before the  election.   This confirmation, if it takes place tomorrow, will be 8 days before  the election. It doesn't pass the straight-face test. If there is a  concern about the will of the American people, about one-third of the  voters have already voted. This election is already one-third over, and  yet we are barrelling forward with this nomination. We shouldn't even  be here. We shouldn't even be having this discussion.   One of the reasons we shouldn't be here is that the Judiciary  Committee broke its own rules in order to vote this nomination out.  Here is rule 1 under ``Quorums,'' section III, of the Judiciary  Committee rules: ``Seven Members of the Committee, actually present,  shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of discussing business. Nine  Members of the Committee, including at least two Members of the  minority, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting  business.''   What an inconvenient rule. But I have to presume that that rule,  which has been there for years, was put there for a reason: in order to  preserve the tradition of comity and respect for the minority that this  body has often stood for.   ``Nine Members of the Committee, including at least two Members of  the minority, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting  business.'' That quorum wasn't there when this nomination was reported  out.   So we have trampled precedent. We have trampled history. We have even  trampled the rules.   And I know that my colleagues say: But it is in good cause. We need  to get this conservative Justice on the Court. It is for a good cause.   I am reminded of that wonderful play: ``A Man for All Seasons,''  about the ends justifying the means. Roper says: ``So now you'd give  the Devil benefit of law''--the rules?   Sir Thomas More said: ``Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road the  law to get after the Devil?''   Roper said: ``I'd cut down every law in England to do that!''   Then here is the point. This is what More responds:         Oh? And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned       around on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all       being flat? This country's planted thick with laws for coast       to coast--man's laws, not God's--and, if you cut them down--      and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think you       could stand upright with the winds that would blow then? Yes,       I'd give the Devil the benefit of the law, for my own       safety's sake.    That is why we have rules, for all of our safety's sake. But we are  going to violate those rules. We are in the process of violating those  rules.   I have heard a great deal of pearl clutching around here about  packing the Court. Oh, no, somebody is talking about breaking the rules  and packing the Court. Well, of course, article III of the Constitution  doesn't establish how many members of the Supreme Court there should  be. The number of the Supreme Court has been changed seven times in our  history. It has ranged from 4 to 10.   I don't want to pack the Court. I don't want to change the number. I  don't want to have to do that, but if all of this rule-breaking is  taking place, what does the majority expect? What do they expect? They  expect that they are going to be able to break the rules with impunity,  and when the shoe, maybe, is on the other foot, nothing is  [[Page S6492]]  going to happen, that the people over here are just going to say: Oh,  well, we can't change these rules   One of the things that has amazed me since I have come here is how  people feel that they can do things to one another and never have it  have any consequences, never have it come back on them. The shoe may be  on the other foot. We don't know what is going to happen next week.   The other piece of this nomination that bothers me in this process is  that there has been all this talk about qualifications. I would argue  that qualifications isn't the question; it is what kind of judge they  will be. There are thousands of people in this country who are  qualified to be a judge. There are 1,700 Federal judges--almost 2,000.  There are 30,000 State judges. There are lots of people who are  qualified, who have been to law school, who have been judges, who are  smart, who can write opinions. That is not the issue here.   The issue is, what kind of judge will this person make? That is what  is important. What is their philosophy? This is a lifetime appointment.  How are they going to decide important cases? These are important  decisions.   One week after the election, on November 10, we are going to have an  argument in the Supreme Court about the future of the Affordable Care  Act. Literally, tens of millions of people's insurances depend upon  that, not to mention the requirement in the Affordable Care Act, which  is the only legal requirement in the country to protect people with  preexisting conditions.   I am tired of people around here saying, ``I am for protecting  preexisting conditions,'' when they voted to gut the Affordable Care  Act 35, 40, 50 times. The President of the United States signs an  Executive order saying, ``We are going to protect preexisting  conditions.'' It means nothing. It is not worth the paper it is printed  on.   The only way you can protect people with preexisting conditions is to  pass a law that you can do that, and we did it with the Affordable Care  Act. If that law is struck down, 130 million Americans are at risk.  They are at risk. So I want to know what kind of decisions is this  person going to make?   The Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block. A woman's right to  choose is on the chopping block. The scope of government action, what  can we do here in this body, in this Congress, in this government, that  is on the chopping block. Election disputes are on the chopping block.  I am going to talk a little about that later.   But we have this bizarre current practice, where we have a so-called  hearing and there are all these questions, and the witness, the  prospective Justice, says: Well, I can't answer that because that might  come up when I am on the Court. I can't tell you what I think about any  of these things.   It is as if you were courting someone, you are thinking about getting  married--a lifetime commitment, just like a lifetime appointment to the  Court--and in the middle of one of your dates, you say: Well, I really  like to travel. Do you like traveling? And she says: Well, I don't  know. I can't tell you until after we are married. I am not sure. I  couldn't give you a definitive answer to that.   And then you say: Well, I love opera. Now, my favorite thing is to go  to opera. How about you?   Well, I can't answer that question. I can't tell you because that is  hypothetical, and I will tell you when you invite me to an opera after  we are married.   Then you say: Well, how about kids? I really want to have a big  family.   No, I am sorry. I can't answer that question.   That is exactly what is going on in these hearings.   Judge Barrett didn't answer much of anything. ``I can't answer  that.'' I think that is nonsense.   She can say: Here is how I think about that issue now, but I reserve  my right to change my mind in a particular case with particular facts  after I have read the briefs and heard the argument, but here is how I  think about that now.   But no. These hearings are a waste of time. We learned whether or not  she did her laundry, but we didn't learn anything about how she is  going to decide these cases for the next 30 years. This isn't something  abstract. This is going to affect individual Americans' lives; yet we  are not allowed to find out what she really believes.   But do you know what? For these last three nominees, the dark money  folks have spent about $250 million to put them over the finish line; a  quarter of $1 billion have been spent by people--we don't know who they  are--to push these nominations. These folks aren't investing that money  on spec. They know what they are getting. We may not know what they are  getting, but they damn well know what they are getting.   They didn't spend a quarter of $1 billion in the hopes that they knew  what the results were going to be; they know. They know, but we don't.  They are investing; they are not contributing.   We do have some indication of what her philosophy is in the abstract  of she won't answer questions about particular cases, but in the  abstract, we know that she says she is an originalist. She says Antonin  Scalia was her mentor. She was his clerk, so she is an originalist.   What does that mean? Well, it means if you have a provision of the  Constitution, in order to interpret what it means, you look at two  places: You look at the text, what does it say, and then you look at  the intent, the understanding of the text of those 55 men in  Philadelphia in 1787. That is it, period. That is the analysis.   Well, there are a couple of problems with that. Article I, section 8,  authorizes the Congress to raise and support an Army and a Navy. What  about the Air Force? What about the Air Force? It doesn't say Armed  Services; it says Army and Navy.   So we look to the text, Army, Navy--doesn't mention the Air Force--so  let's look at the intent. Do we think that those guys in Philadelphia  looked ahead 115 years to the Wright brothers? Of course not.   That is ridiculous. That is a ridiculous interpretation. Well, so how  do you decide that the Air Force and, more recently, the Space Force is  constitutional? Well, you do a reasonable interpretation. What was the  broad intent? To protect the country. And, therefore, the Air Force and  the Space Force are constitutional.   But by an originalist's standard, neither one passed the test--not in  the text, not in the intent. That is supposed to be the test. It is  nonsense. It is a nonsense theory.   The provision of the Air Force is pretty easy. The President has to  be 35. That is easy. There are two Senators from every State--not  three, not one--two. Those are easy.   But what about a term like ``due process''? What about due process  and the Fifth Amendment? What does that mean in a real case? Can you be  thrown in jail for life and not have access to a lawyer? Is that due  process? It was for about 150 years. It wasn't until the sixties that  right to counsel in the Gideon case became a constitutional right.   Did the courts invent that? No. They were trying to put some life  into this concept of due process. There is no way to determine exactly  what a broad term like ``due process'' meant in 1787 or in 1868 or in  2021. It takes a court to think about it and to apply some growth in  morality, ethics, law, politics, culture, to put life into a provision  like that.   There are other ones. Let's see: Due process, equal protection of the  laws. It took about 100 years to get from the 14th Amendment to Brown  v. Board of Education. So the fact that segregated schools were a  violation of equal protection of the law wasn't very obvious in 1868.  It took 100 years for us to get to the place where, yes, everybody  realizes that that was wrong.   This is one of the fallacies in the originalist theory, and Judge  Barrett was asked about this: What about Brown v. Board of Education?  What about Loving v. Virginia? I was in law school when Loving was  decided. It was illegal in Virginia to have an interracial marriage. It  was illegal in a lot of States. I venture to say it was probably  illegal everywhere in 1868.   But the Court, in 1967, decided that marriage was a fundamental  right, that it was part of the equal protection of the laws, and that  it was wrong to tell people of different races that they couldn't marry  one another.   So how does the originalist handle that case? They don't dare say  that Brown was wrongly decided or Loving  [[Page S6493]]  was wrongly decided. Do you know what they say? Do you know what she  said? It is a superprecedent. Well, come on. That is a label. It  doesn't mean anything. That is a dodge. That is intellectual  dishonesty.   If your theory works, it works. If you have to say that Brown or  Loving or dozens of other cases--Miranda, Gideon--are all  superprecedents, it doesn't speak very well for your theory. It is a  copout.   Now, if Antonin Scalia were here--whom I knew in law school, by the  way. I knew him as Nino. If he were here, he would say: Well, Angus, if  the Constitution needs amending and changing, you don't do it by the  courts; you do it through the amendment process. That is why they wrote  it.   Well, the problem with that is we would be amending the Constitution  about every 2 weeks around here. Can you imagine, if we had to do an  amendment to the Constitution, going through Congress by two-thirds and  three-quarters of the States to legalize the Air Force or to say that  due process means that you don't have to give evidence against  yourself; that you have a right to a lawyer; that you have a right to  be told what your rights are, as is the case in the Miranda decision?   The Space Force. We passed the Space Force last year. We would have  had to also do a constitutional amendment. No. If that were the case,  if we had to do a constitutional amendment every time there is a change  in something in the Constitution, in the meaning of a term in the  Constitution, the Constitution would be as long as the United States  Code. It just doesn't make sense.   The real problem with the originalist theory--and this is Judge  Barrett, and I know she is intelligent, capable, law professor, judge-- for only 3 years, by the way, but 3 years. The real problem is, the  originalist theory to which she subscribes--and she says she subscribes  to it--allows no room for moral or ethical growth. Everything is frozen  in 1787--or 1868 if you are talking about the 14th Amendment.   Jefferson got this. Jefferson wasn't one of the Framers. He was in  France at the time the Constitution was written, but he certainly is  one of the Founders of the country, the author of the Declaration of  Independence, and a successful President.   He wrote an interesting letter in 1816 on exactly this point, exactly  this point. Here is what Jefferson said:         I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried       changes in laws and constitutions   That is the way I feel.         But . . . laws and institutions must go hand in hand with       the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more       developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new       truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the       change of circumstances, institutions--    That means us.       --must advance also to keep pace with the times.    Listen to this. He concludes this:         We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which       fitted him as a boy as civilized society to remain ever under       the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.    Now, I don't think our ancestors, the Framers, were barbarous, but  they hadn't really thought about things like right to counsel, right to  be aware of what your rights were under the Constitution as a criminal  defendant. They certainly weren't aware of the awful, awful impacts of  racial segregation and racial segregation in the schools. They weren't  aware of those things.   Jefferson is right. We have to be able to allow our institutions to  change as we become more developed, more enlightened. As new  discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions  change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance  also to keep pace with the times.   Now, I understand the problem with judicial legislation. I don't want  to convert the Supreme Court into an unelected third branch of the  Congress that has lifetime tenure. I get that. The Supreme Court, in  its interpretation of the Constitution, can't be totally unmoored from  the text of the Constitution or the intent of the Framers, but it has  got to take a broader view of what these vague terms like ``due  process,'' ``equal protection of the laws,'' ``privilege and  immunities''--what those things meant and what they mean today as we  have grown and learned--as we have grown and learned.   The other piece of this originalist philosophy and the one that I  think may have the greatest effect as it takes root on the current  Supreme Court is not necessarily in the cases that we are talking about  like Roe v. Wade. It is more cases like the Affordable Care Act or the  Environmental Protection Agency or the FDA or any effort whatsoever  around here to do something about climate change.   This is a straightjacket for the powers of the Federal Government.  That is really what it is all about. That is why those guys invested  $250 million. They want to cripple, strangle, and squeeze the Federal  Government so that it can't act on behalf of the American people. That  is what is going on here. They don't like the regulatory state. They  want to repeal the new deal.   Some originalists even question Social Security and Medicare, beyond  the powers of the Federal Government. That is what is going on here.   Yet, they have a narrow, crabbed view of the powers of the Federal  Government, but these originalist folks have a broad view of the powers  of the State government to impose on your personal rights.   I have always thought of the Constitution as being an elaborate  Vegematic which slices up power so that it isn't concentrated in any  one place. That is what the Constitution is all about. The fundamental  issue of all political science is quis custodes ipsos custodiet, an  ancient Roman question: Who will guard the guardians?   We create a Constitution to give power to people over our lives, and  then how do we control them from abusing us? History tells us it will  always happen. Lord Acton, in the 19th century, said power corrupts and  absolute power corrupts absolutely. Power corrupts. Absolute power  corrupts absolutely.   And the Framers knew this. They were geniuses in terms of  understanding human nature, so they created this elaborate Rube  Goldberg scheme to make it hard to make laws. And, boy, did they  succeed, as we well know. But even after they created this scheme with  two houses and vetoes and conference committees and two-thirds and  treaties and all of this complex institution to make laws, they were  still scared. They were still afraid of the powers of a rampant  majority. They were still afraid of what their government would do to  them.   So they passed the Bill of Rights--the Bill of Rights. I have always  thought of the Bill of Rights as a kind of force field around us as  individuals, things that they can't do to us. They can't take away our  freedom of religion. They can't take away our freedom of speech. They  can't go after the press. The government can't do these things.   The originalists have a narrow view of what the Federal Government  can do to help us, but they have a broad view of what the States can do  to trample on those individual rights. They want to throw us back to a  time when every State has its own rules on these fundamental rights.   I don't think individual Americans' rights should depend on  geography. They shouldn't depend on where they live. Fundamental human  rights that are in the jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court over the  last 150, 200 years should not be kicked back to the States to be  compromised or minimized.    Finally, what is going on here is an undermining of confidence. We  take this whole thing for granted--these magnificent halls, the marble  columns, the speeches, the votes. It has always happened; therefore, it  always will.   No. We are an experiment. We are an experiment that has been going on  for a little over 200 years. In human history, we are a blip. We are an  anomaly. Democracy is very unusual and very hard, and it depends on  trust. If you stop and think about it, it depends on trust.   When my town clerk in Brunswick, ME, says ``Here are the votes--Trump  87, Biden 104,'' I trust that those are the right numbers. I trust. If  I don't, then that way lies chaos.   What this Senate is doing right now is one more drip in the  undermining of confidence in this institution. It is no secret that  confidence in Congress has plummeted over the last 25 or 30 years, and  we are doing it. We are adding one more brick to that wall of lack of  confidence in this process by violating our  [[Page S6494]]  history and our rules to barrel through to a confirmation that I think  is inconsistent with the rules and principles of this body and our own  personal obligations.   This is a blow to the Senate. What this process says is that anything  goes as long as you have the votes. We don't care about the rules of  the Judiciary Committee. We don't care about the history and traditions  of the Senate. If you have the votes, ram it through.   This body is built on some restraint, on some rules of comity and  restraint and responsibility and thinking of what happens next.   You are going to win this. You have the votes. You are going to put  this judge through--but at the cost of just pulling one more support  out from underneath the edifice of this magnificent government. It is  not only a blow to this institution; it is a blow to the Court. It is a  blow to the Court, and here is why.   Of all the things that Judge Barrett said and didn't say in her  hearing, the one that disturbed me the most was her failure to commit  to recusing herself if a matter comes before the Court shortly after  her confirmation involving this election of her patron, Donald J.  Trump.   That is a gimme. Do you know why? Because all the Court has is its  credibility. The Court doesn't have an army. It doesn't have the power  of the purse. All it has is its integrity, its reputation for fairness.  If you go out that door and look up, it says ``Equal Justice Under  Law.'' That is what it is all about.   The judicial canons speak to this issue very directly. Often in our  lives we all want to avoid impropriety, but the judicial canons go even  further: 2A of the judicial canon says that a judge must avoid the  appearance of impropriety. What could appear to be more improper than a  judge appointed by a President of the United States, and 10 days later  she votes on a matter that will involve his election?   He has already told us he wants this election to go to the Supreme  Court, and he has already told us he wants his Justice there. That is  corruption in realtime. That is impropriety right in front of our eyes.  That answer alone should have disqualified her if she didn't have the  integrity to say: Of course I won't vote on an election matter  involving this President. Of course I won't.   But she didn't. As far as I'm concerned, that is a disqualification.  Now, I am not a Supreme Court Justice. I wasn't on the law review. I am  an old country lawyer from Brunswick, ME. But I know impropriety when I  see it, and this is it. This is it.   The Constitution is a wonderful document. It has served this country  well. The evolution of jurisprudence through the U.S. Supreme Court,  with fits and starts, has generally served this country well. But to  put a Justice on this Court under these procedures, under these  circumstances, who we are pretty sure is going to take positions  antithetical to those of the majority of Americans and could take  positions that will be profoundly damaging to a majority of Americans  is an abdication of our responsibility.   I understand that the majority has the votes. I deeply hope that,  tonight or tomorrow morning, some Members of the majority will wake up  and have an attack of conscience and say: I can't do this. It is not  right. It is not right. I can't sacrifice the reputation of the Senate,  compromise the reputation of the Supreme Court, undermine the  procedures and history of this body. I can't do it.   I hope four Members of the majority will find it in their hearts and  minds to take that position. I am not optimistic, but I think we all  need to go into this decision, and I think all those who vote tomorrow  have to understand what they are doing and what it means and what it  will mean to the people of this country.   We could have done better. We should have done better. We owe it to  the American people to do better than this.   I yield the floor.
