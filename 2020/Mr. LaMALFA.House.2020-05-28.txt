 Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness today, acknowledging the  news I received late last night of the loss of our former colleague  from Texas, Mr. Sam Johnson, a great American.   I had the pleasure of knowing him personally. His story is amazing of  his life serving our country. Of course, he is known as being a Vietnam  POW, held 7 years in what is known as the Hanoi Hilton.   He wrote a book about his exploits, including that part, called  ``Captive Warriors: A Vietnam POW's Story.'' I would highly recommend  everybody get that and then pass it along.   My sweetest memory of him is Leader McCarthy invited a group of about  10 of us Members to go have dinner with him one night and just sit and  listen to this man talk about his life, not only the negative of being  a POW, but what we always saw here in his positive, upbeat spirit all  the time.   This guy was a true cool guy. He was a Thunderbird aerobatic team  member and also later directed the Air Force Fighter Weapons School,  which is known as the Top Gun version of the Air Force.   This was an all-around great American. We will miss him badly.                            ____________________
