 Mr. Speaker, the murderous regime in  Tehran has a very clear policy: death to America, death to Israel. That  is why Iran trains, arms, and funds militia groups to fight its proxy  wars throughout the Middle East.   In Iraq, these militias destabilize the country, weaken Baghdad's  central authority, and do Iran's bidding. These militias directly  threaten American interests in Iraq.   Many of them have American blood on their hands, but they are not  being held accountable for their actions by our government. That is why  I introduced H.R. 361, the Iranian Proxies Terrorist Sanctions Act,  with my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Brad Sherman,    Steve Chabot, and  Tom Suozzi.   This bill will finally sanction two notorious Iranian-controlled  proxy groups in Iraq, including those responsible for the September  2018 attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and U.S. Consulate Mosul.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
