 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1693) to eliminate the disparity in sentencing for cocaine  offenses, and for other purposes, as amended.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1693.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1693, the Eliminating a Quantifiably Unjust  Application of the Law Act of 2021, or the EQUAL Act, would eliminate  the unjust sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder  cocaine offenses.   This long overdue bipartisan legislation would allow defendants who  were previously convicted or sentenced for a Federal offense involving  crack cocaine to petition for a sentence reduction.   In 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created  mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses and introduced the 100:1  sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses.  This meant that a person who distributed 5 grams of crack cocaine  received the same 5-year mandatory minimum sentence as a person who  distributed 500 grams of the powder cocaine.   A person who distributed 50 grams of crack cocaine received the same  10-year mandatory minimum sentence as a person who distributed 5,000  grams of powder cocaine. It soon became evident that this sentencing  disparity also created a significant racial disparity.   Mr. Speaker, 4 years after Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act,  the average Federal sentence for Black defendants was 49 percent higher  than the average sentence for White defendants. In the ensuing decades,  the Sentencing Commission and many members of the law enforcement  community strongly and repeatedly criticized the 100:1 ratio and urged  Congress to address the disparity.   As early as 1995, the Sentencing Commission began urging Congress to  rectify this unfairness. Besides the troubling racial disparities in  sentencing, the Commission also expressed concern over the significant  differences in punishment between street-level dealers of crack cocaine  and the powder cocaine suppliers who sold the cocaine in the first  instance.   Unfortunately, Congress failed to act on the Commission's proposed  amendment to the sentencing guidelines to equalize the penalties for  crack and powder cocaine.   From 1997 to 2007, the Commission continued to warn Congress about  the unjustified ratio, noting that ``there is no legislative history  that explains Congress' rationale for selecting the 100:1 drug quantity  ratio for powder cocaine and crack offenses.'' It provided evidence for  its findings that the penalties exaggerated the relative harmfulness of  crack cocaine, swept too broadly, most often applied to lower-level  offenders, and mostly impacted communities of color.   Congress, however, took no action, prompting the Commission to pass  an amendment to the sentencing guidelines in 2007 as a partial and  modest remedy to the ``urgent and compelling'' problems associated with  the ratio. In doing so, the Commission ``unanimously and strongly  urged'' Congress to take actions on its recommendations and to provide  a comprehensive solution.   In 2010, Congress finally acted by passing the Fair Sentencing Act,  which did not eliminate the disparity, but which significantly reduced  the ratio from 100:1 to 18:1. But the Fair Sentencing Act applied only  to pending and future cases, leaving thousands of incarcerated people  without a path to petition for relief. The First Step Act of 2018 made  the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, providing a pathway to relief for  some, but not all, individuals affected by the sentencing disparity.  [[Page H5478]]    It is now past time to finish the job. The crack cocaine and powder  cocaine disparity has greatly contributed to the rise of mass  incarceration, devastated communities of color, and severely undermined  public confidence in our criminal justice system.   The EQUAL Act would finally equalize the treatment of powder cocaine  and crack cocaine--two forms of the same drug--by eliminating the  sentencing disparity. It would also provide a path to retroactive  relief from a disparity that is not rooted in science, does not promote  public safety, and fosters racial disparities.   I commend Representative Hakeem Jeffries,  Bobby Scott, Kelly  Armstrong, and   Don Bacon for introducing this important bipartisan  legislation, and I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Michigan an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, the EQUAL Act of 2021 represents an  important step in our efforts to reform the criminal justice system. I  thank Representatives Jeffries, Scott, Armstrong, and Bacon for their  leadership in introducing this important legislation and for assembling  a broad and bipartisan coalition of stakeholders in support of the  bill, including the Department of Justice and advocacy groups that span  the entire ideological spectrum.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan bill today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
