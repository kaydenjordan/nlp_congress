 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Erin Doty and celebrate her  great accomplishments as my legislative director for the past 8 years.   She led my legislative strategies to great success. Under her  leadership, we passed 47 bills into law. Some of our most memorable  bills are the Safe Step Act, the Protecting People from Surprise  Medical Bills Act, the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in  Customs and Border Protection Act, and the Honoring our PACT Act.   Erin has a heart of gold, a relentless commitment to social justice,  and a  [[Page H3965]]  special talent to make sure I never missed a vote. She was unwaveringly  dedicated, often staying very late for votes, despite me insisting that  she go home to rest.   Erin is a wonderful human being, a good friend, and a trusted  adviser.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Erin for her service on behalf of the American  people, especially the people of California's 36th and now 25th  District. We miss you dearly and we wish you luck and look forward to  your future endeavors.                            ____________________
