 Mr. Speaker, almost 50 years ago, the Supreme Court  incorrectly decided that the right to end an unborn child's life  existed in the U.S. Constitution. On that day, the United States became  one of only six countries that allow abortion on demand throughout the  entirety of pregnancy, putting us in the same category as Communist  China and North Korea.   Now, almost 50 years later, we might be on the precipice of the Court  correcting their egregious mistake. Unfortunately, due to the actions  of a rogue actor with no regard for the laws or institutions of our  country, Justices must withstand attempts to dissuade them from  changing that ruling. Inexcusably, those attempts to intimidate the  High Court's opinion have even turned violent.   In fact, since that rogue actor, who I believe broke the law and  should be held accountable to the full extent of the law, leaked  Justice Alito's draft opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson, a fence had to be  constructed outside the Court to prevent attempts from leftwing  agitators to ``burn it down.''   There was also a reported attempt to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh,  which was thankfully foiled by our brave law enforcement officers.   As we are all surely aware, anti-life demonstrators have held  protests for weeks outside the homes of Justice Clarence Thomas, Amy  Coney Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh, which is a direct violation of 18  U.S.C. 1507.   Instead of breaking up these illegal demonstrations and putting an  end to the intimidation and mob rule so prevalent on the left these  days, President Biden's Justice Department has allowed them to proceed  unabated.   This, in my mind, sounds like an endorsement of lawlessness or at  least a two-tiered justice system. This administration doesn't seem  interested in enforcing laws that aren't politically expedient, whether  it is at the southern border or elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I am 100 percent pro-life. I signed  an amicus brief in support of overturning Roe v. Wade, and I remain  hopeful that the Supreme Court will, indeed, finally overturn it. The  number of lives lost since Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided is truly  unfathomable. Countless lives have been lost that will never be granted  the privilege to walk on God's Earth with those listening to this  speech today.   For years, we have prayed. Finally, those prayers may potentially be  answered.                                time  1030    If so, that does not mean our work is done. While the power to  legislate with regard to abortion policy will be returned to the  legislative bodies where our Founders intended such power to reside,  much work remains at every level of government--State, local, and  Federal--to ensure Progressives don't pass legislation that provides  for taxpayer-funded abortions, something that polls show 58 percent of  Americans do not support.   I promise to work day in and day out to ensure that every child is  guaranteed the same right to life we all enjoy today. I will be a voice  for the voiceless throughout the remaining time I have in Congress and  even well after, much like my time before I arrived here in Washington.  Because after all, if there is no life, there is no liberty or pursuit  of happiness.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Tennesseans are fed up with prices at the  pump. They are paying double what they were a year-and-a-half ago  because of the attacks on American energy that began on day one of the  Biden administration. Now, the President has asked Congress to consider  a gas tax holiday. How curious.   This is what Washington does when there is a big problem. Politicians  pretend they are looking out for you, but they are just looking out for  their own poll numbers.   Those aren't my words, Madam Speaker. That is a quote from President  Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, on the campaign trail in 2008. He  said a gas tax holiday would threaten Federal highways and possibly  cost jobs while only saving families pennies a day. He called the idea  an election-year gimmick, not a real solution. I agree.   A real solution would be supporting policies that return our Nation  to energy independence.                            ____________________
