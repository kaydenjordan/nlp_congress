 Mr. Speaker, I express my support for H.R. 7666, the  Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.   In over 20 years as a pediatrician, I saw steadily escalating levels  of mental illness in my patients. There was a big uptick after 2007  that many associate with ubiquitous social media use. Of course, the  pandemic further accelerated rates of depression, anxiety, eating  disorders, and self-harm. We are seeing 9-year-olds with eating  disorders and 10-year-olds with suicidal ideation. This is alarming.   We all agree that our children need help, but resources are limited.  There just aren't enough behavioral health specialists out there to  meet the need, particularly in rural areas like some of those I  represent.   There are ways to extend the reach of people who have dedicated their  lives to supporting our mental health, to leverage those resources so  they stretch a little further. One example is the Partnership Access  Line, or PAL, that I was able to access as a pediatrician. If I was  seeing a patient with a more complicated behavioral health concern,  something really beyond the scope of a general pediatrician, I could  get a psychiatrist on the line and in-the-moment advice on how to treat  that patient.   Another example is integrative care, where a mental worker works  alongside physicians and other healthcare providers, providing support  as needed throughout the day for patients who are struggling with  mental illness.   These programs and more are supported in the package of bills we will  be voting on this week, including mine, the Supporting Children's  Mental Health Care Access Act.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  excellent bill.
