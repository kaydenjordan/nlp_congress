 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Holocaust  Remembrance Day. Today, we honor and remember the 6 million Jews and  countless others who were murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the  families who were torn apart.   As a founder and cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish  Relations, I am committed to ensuring that our country never forgets  this history and that we educate younger generations about this  atrocity.   Today and every day, we must speak truth to power. ``Never again'' is  more than a slogan. It is an unwavering commitment to combating anti- Semitism and hate wherever they exist.                            ____________________
