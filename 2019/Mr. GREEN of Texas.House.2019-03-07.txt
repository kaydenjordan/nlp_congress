 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentle, yet courageous,  lady from California for leading this floor discussion debate, if you  will. I thank the Rules Committee for allowing this rule, this  amendment to be in order, and I also would like to thank my staff for  the stellar, outstanding job they have done to help bring this  amendment to the floor.   Madam Chairwoman, on November 19, 1863, the 16th President of the  United States of America standing near the battlefield at Gettysburg  proclaimed that ``government of the people, by the people, for the  people, shall not perish from the Earth.'' That is what our bill, H.R.  1, is all about, government of the people, by the people, for the  people.   Madam Chairwoman, you cannot have government of the people, by the  people, for the people without the precious right to vote. The right to  vote is something that people have fought for in this country. Dr. King  marched for it;   John Lewis went to jail for it, the Honorable   John  Lewis, a Member of this House; Schwerner, Goodman, Chaney died for it.   The right to vote, H.R. 1, is about protecting the right to vote.  This amendment is one that will help us to inculcate new, young people  into the voting process. The amendment simply allows those who are in  high school to receive voter registration information while they are in  school on the school campus.                                time  1315    It does not change the laws related to registration and qualification  to vote. It merely allows the principal at a school to go to the young  people and provide them with voter registration information so that  they may decide. It does not impose upon them a duty to register, but  it does give them the opportunity to. This is a good thing in a country  where we believe that government of the people and by the people shall  not perish from the Earth.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Chair, I close with these words. This is a  participatory democracy. If it is to function efficaciously, then the  right to vote must be protected.   I join my colleague on the other side in his position that all votes  should be counted and that every person who has the right to vote  should be in a position to vote. This amendment helps to assure that  young people will start to participate in the participatory democracy.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
