 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  resolution to repeal the Biden administration's waters of the United  States rule.   Since President Biden was sworn into office, the regulatory actions  of his administration have cost the private sector nearly $360 billion  in compliance costs and an estimated 220 million man-hours in new  paperwork requirements. Later this month, when this rule is finalized,  these numbers will get even higher.   Yesterday, the Committee on Small Business held a hearing to speak  directly with the people who are going to be affected by this damaging  regulation. We heard from Ms. Katherine English of Florida, who became  a water attorney to ensure her family farm that has been in operation  for over 100 years, could continue to thrive. She told us that this  rule is so complicated that she will not know if even simple land  adjustments on her own private property would open her up to fines from  the Federal Government.   We also heard from Mr. Frank Murphy, from the great State of Texas,  who develops real estate. He shared that this new rule will cause him  to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in redundant environmental  reviews and could delay many projects indefinitely.   For any business, certainty is key, and unfortunately, this rule is  leaving many people in the dark on if they will be in compliance with  the new regulations.   I support this resolution because it is giving a voice to the small  businesses that have been ignored by the unelected bureaucrats at the  EPA and Army Corps of Engineers. That is why this resolution is  supported by over 100 business groups. Congress must act and listen to  the voices of Main Street America on how this regulation will kill jobs  and damage the American economy.   In God we trust.
