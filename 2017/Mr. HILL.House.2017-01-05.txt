 Section 10:   ``No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;  grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;  make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts;  pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the  obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise  in strong support of this resolution. We need to close ranks in the  House of Representatives. We need to, as colleagues, support what for  decades has been the cornerstone principle of American diplomacy  towards Israel and Palestine, and that is direct negotiation between  these two countries. That is the only way that peace can be achieved.  The fact that our Ambassador to the United Nations went against decades  of precedent by abstaining from this vote is appalling. It is another  vote for tyrants and terrorists.   All of us need to close ranks to support a two-state solution between  Israel and Palestine. I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle tonight, Mr. Engel and Mr. Royce, in opposing this  mistake that has been made by our U.N. Ambassador and by the U.N.  resolution itself. Both are wrong. Both our decision to abstain and the  drafting have been destructive.   I am proud to have this resolution in the House to once again undo  this harm and support our ally.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.
