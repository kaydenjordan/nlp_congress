 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman   Mike Rogers for his  leadership and for including language to improve the safety of U.S.  servicemembers in the NDAA.   My provision would establish new Joint Safety Council requirements  for each military branch to develop a plan to identify corrective and  preventative actions following major accidents and mishaps.   Earlier this year, I introduced the Military Equipment Quality and  Safety Reform Act, or MEZr Act, which includes a similar mandate.   My effort to improve safety and transparency in the wake of major  accidents is motivated by the tragic death of my constituent and F-16  pilot First Lieutenant David Schmitz, whose call sign was MEZr.   Just over 3 years ago, Lieutenant Schmitz was killed during a  training exercise when his ejection seat malfunctioned while he  attempted a nighttime landing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers for including this language in  the bill and working to protect our men and women in uniform.                            ____________________
