 Madam Speaker, I rise today as the granddaughter of  immigrants in support of the American Dream and Promise Act. We need a  pathway to citizenship for Dreamers who arrived in the United States as  children and know this country as their only home; for TPS recipients  who, like my grandparents, sought refuge in the United States when  crises in their home countries put their very lives at risk.   These are doctors, nurses, first responders, who cared for us during  the pandemic. Many have served bravely as members of our military.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for our friends  and neighbors who yearn to become citizens of the country they already  call home.
