 Madam Speaker, it has been very clear from the beginning  that this impeachment proceeding has never been about an honest search  for the truth. If it were, our Democratic friends would not have polled  to see what to charge the President with.   Calling an opinion a fact does not make it so, and repeating it over  and over does not make it more true. When one produces a committee  report with fabricated findings based on no fact witnesses and then  quotes from it like it is authoritative, it is no more valid than  having a campaign pay for a foreign entity to create a private dossier  and then selling it to a FISA court in order to spy on a campaign.   This has always been a verdict in search of a crime, an impeachment  [[Page H12179]]  birthed at a resistance movement. It is time to end this charade and  get back to doing the work we were elected to do.
