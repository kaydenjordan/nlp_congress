 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  17-year-old Cole Gordon, an active and beloved community member who  tragically passed away on September 22, 2019, in a car accident.   Cole was a lifelong resident of Friendswood, Texas, and would have  been a graduate of Friendswood High School class of 2020. He was  planning on attending Western Texas College in Snyder, Texas, to pursue  a degree in agribusiness.   Cole was a member and 3-year officer of the Friendswood FFA, Future  Farmers of America. He interned the last two summers on the Lackey  Livestock farm and volunteered with the Lighthouse Charity Team, right  by the side of his dad, Scott.   Cole had earned many ribbons, banners, and buckles showing livestock  all over Texas, and even at the World Pork Expo in Iowa. He had great  plans to ``go big'' for his senior year, raising six pigs for stock  shows all over the Nation. But it is his incredible dedication to  service that will never be forgotten.   Before Cole gained his passion for livestock, he spent most of his  time volunteering. He volunteered with the Friendswood Fire, Police,  and Emergency Medical Services Departments, along with the Rotary Club  of Galveston, the Galveston County Emergency Response Team, and the  Friendswood Chamber of Commerce.   The Rotary Club stated that Cole ``exemplified the creed of service  above self in serving 9 years of volunteerism with the Rotary Club  Galveston.''   His service throughout his entire life supported nearly 750  charitable events, helping to serve approximately 500,000 people.   Mr. Speaker, Cole made a lasting impact on the 14th Congressional  District of Texas. He has not and will not ever be forgotten.   Today, we honor and we recognize the extraordinary life and service  of Cole Easton Gordon.                            ____________________
