 Mr. Speaker, this is a town where  investigations can last for years, and sometimes, they cost millions.  There are other investigations that are insignificant, little things.  They are just meant to check a box so we can move onto the next task.   Yes, I think we all know that, in D.C., there are two types of  investigations, investigations that are for show and investigations  that are for real. Well, in cattle country, we need an investigation  for real.   Times have been tough, really tough for cattle producers, especially  the last couple of years. The producers that I know, they don't ask for  guarantees or handouts. All that they want is a fair chance to earn a  living. Unfortunately, prices have been soft, and those producers  aren't sure that the market is accurately applying margin to our  feeders and to our ranchers.   Following the Holcomb fire, the market experienced extreme  volatility. The producers that I know, smart and savvy professionals,  are telling me that what happened in that aftermath did real damage to  the viability of their businesses and to their way of life.   That is why I was grateful to see USDA, under the Packers and  Stockyards Act, open up an investigation into the cattle market. An  investigation like that does not happen every day, and it has folks in  South Dakota anxiously awaiting the results. I know that I am.   What I have seen so far, what I have heard so far from USDA, gives me  a good feeling that they are conducting this investigation for real,  that they are working hard to gather and analyze the pertinent data.  They want to get to the bottom of this. They want to determine to what  extent, if any, there were unfair trade practices or market  manipulation.   That kind of a determination, Mr. Speaker, won't be easy. It will  require real effort, real persistence, a real willingness to dig deep.   As I said at the beginning, there are two types of investigations in  this town, those that are for show and those that are for real. It  looks like USDA is conducting this investigation for real, and thank  goodness for that, because our cow-calf folks deserve that, our feeders  deserve that, and, Mr. Speaker, our country deserves that.                            ____________________
