 Madam President, today I introduce the S.T.A.N.D. with  Taiwan Act of 2022, which would mandate comprehensive and devastating  economic and financial sanctions against the Chinese Communist Party,  key sectors of China's economy, and leaders in the Chinese Communist  Party, if the Chinese People's Liberation Army initiates a military  invasion of the island democracy of Taiwan. Representative   Mike  Gallagher of Wisconsin introduced an identical bill in the House today  as well.   I am hopeful that when my colleagues come back from recess, the vast  majority of Senators here, Democrats and Republicans, will end up  joining me in supporting this important bill.   Last March, in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I posed  this  [[Page S372]]  question to the INDOPACOM commander, Admiral Davidson:         Given the Chinese Communist Party's recent but long list of       coercive and even violent actions--a hostile suppression of       freedom in Hong Kong, threatening nuclear war with Japan,       hand-to-hand combat with Indian soldiers in the Himalayas,       economic blockades of Australia, genocide in its own Xinjiang       province, [and aggressive naval actions in the South China       Sea]--how do such actions impact your analysis [Admiral       Davidson] on if and when China would invade Taiwan?    His response to me in this hearing made news around the world. He  called these recent actions by President Xi ``alarming,'' and then he  said:         I think the threat [of an invasion of Taiwan] is manifest       during this decade, in fact, in the next 6 years.    Six years--that is not a lot of time. The Senate needs to focus on  this issue much more. Indeed, this issue is not unrelated to the  actions of another dictator--Vladimir Putin--who is right now  threatening and likely to invade one of his neighbors--Ukraine.   Now, some see the defense of Taiwan as a luxury we cannot afford in  an age of sharpened and great power competition and China's global  economic strength. I reject that view. Importantly, so does American  law, particularly the Taiwan Relations Act, which this body passed in  1979 by a vote of 90 to 6. Among other things, it states the following:         The United States will consider any effort to determine the       future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . a threat       to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of       grave concern.    The free world cannot be neutral in the contest between freedom and  authoritarianism that is once again underway around the world,  especially in the Indo-Pacific region.   American alliances, power, and ingenuity helped build a world that  provided more freedom and prosperity to more people than ever before.  Think about this fact: The U.S. democracy, bolstered by our strong  military, has done more to liberate humankind from oppression and  tyranny--literally hundreds of millions of people--than any other force  in human history.   The Chinese Communist Party knows exactly what it wants to  accomplish--to make the world safe for its authoritarian government, to  export its dictatorship model to other countries, to separate America  from its democratic allies, and to erode U.S. leadership around the  world.   A world governed by Xi Jinping's totalitarian vision would be a world  unsafe for America and other democracies around the world. That is why  Taiwan is so central to the free world and its future. It is a  thriving, prosperous Chinese democracy that holds free elections and  bounds its power by the rule of law. For that reason, it threatens the  CCP's central premise, which is that one man ruling in perpetuity by  crushing all dissent knows what is best for 1.4 billion people.   The Chinese Communist Party has already crushed Hong Kong, once a  bastion of liberty, and the free world barely raised its voice in  protest. Should America and the world stand by as China does something  similar to Taiwan, a peaceful democracy of 25 million people who have  voted for an entirely different future, that would not simply undermine  the security of the Western Pacific, as the Taiwan Relations Act says.  A violent military takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party  would be a sea change in how the world is ordered. It would change the  history of the 21st century in ways that the guns of August of 1914  changed the 20th century.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S372, January 20, 2022, second column, the following  appears: Should America and the world stand by as China does  something similar to Taiwan, a peaceful democracy of 25 million  people who have voted for an entirely different future? That would  not simply undermine the security of the Western Pacific, as the  Taiwan Relations Act says, a violent military takeover of Taiwan  by the Chinese Communist Party would be a sea change in how the  world is ordered.      The online Record has been corrected to read: Should America and  the world stand by as China does something similar to Taiwan, a  peaceful democracy of 25 million people who have voted for an  entirely different future, that would not simply undermine the  security of the Western Pacific, as the Taiwan Relations Act says.  A violent military takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist  Party would be a sea change in how the world is ordered.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Taiwan is not some peripheral sideshow in terms of global great-power  competition; it is the frontline between freedom and tyranny, like West  Berlin was during the height of the Cold War. It matters everywhere.   Last month, the magazine the National Review highlighted many of  these issues in an excellent issue which laid out the arguments for and  against whether the U.S. military should come to Taiwan's aid if the  island democracy was invaded by the Chinese military. Should our  country militarily defend democratic Taiwan after the CCP launches a  military invasion of the island? This is a vitally important question  which was front and center in the National Review last month. As the  National Review points out, there is much disagreement on this issue.   There are powerful arguments on both sides, as this issue admirably  demonstrates, but I believe there is much less disagreement on whether  the United States should take actions now to deter a Chinese Communist  Party military invasion of Taiwan in the future. Indeed, taking actions  now to promote deterrence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is an area  where I believe there is broad bipartisan agreement and support in the  U.S. Senate.   Deterrence comes in many forms, and with regard to Taiwan, I believe  there are three crucial layers of deterrence, as depicted here.   First is Taiwan's ability to militarily defend itself, the so-called  hedgehog approach right here, where Taiwan musters sufficient self- defense capabilities to make a Chinese military invasion very difficult  and very costly.   The second layer of deterrence is America's capability and will to  defend Taiwan militarily should the President of the United States  decide to do so once there is an invasion by the Chinese.   Over the past several decades, through many different crises in the  Taiwan Strait, this layer, the American layer of deterrence, has proven  to be decisive in keeping the Taiwanese people free. Our deep network  of allies in the region augments this level of deterrence.   As it relates to deterrence in Taiwan, it is really often discussed  only in these two layers, but there is a third layer that is depicted  here, which in terms of the present circumstances might be the most  important, and that is the use of other instruments of American power  beyond our military, such as our global economic and financial  strengths, to deter China from an invasion.   That is exactly what my bill, the S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022,  is all about. The full name of this bill is Sanctions Targeting  Aggressors of Neighboring Democracies--aka S.T.A.N.D.--with Taiwan.   It is a simple bill but a very powerful one, especially in terms of  its deterrent effect. It states that if the Chinese Communist Party  initiates a military invasion of Taiwan, the United States shall impose  a comprehensive suite of mandatory economic and financial sanctions.  The bill lays out these comprehensive sanctions, some of which are  listed here, in great detail. These sanctions would be crippling to the  Chinese Communist Party, its leaders, and key sectors of China's  economy.   The bill also calls on the United States to coordinate such  comprehensive sanctions with our allies around the globe, with the goal  of making the CCP an economic pariah globally if President Xi chooses  to militarily invade Taiwan.   The bill's goal is to make very clear to President Xi today the true  cost of what such a military invasion of Taiwan would be, thereby  heightening deterrence, which we all in the U.S. Senate support.   I believe the S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022 should receive broad  bipartisan support. In many ways, it reinforces the goals, policies,  and directives of the Taiwan Relations Act, which continues to have  overwhelming support here in the U.S. Senate.   The defense of Taiwan is an issue that has been weaved in and out of  the careers and professions of countless Americans, including my own.   Over 25 years ago, in 1995 and 1996, I was a Marine infantry officer  deployed to the Taiwan Strait as part of a Marine amphibious task force  and two U.S. carrier strike groups, all in response to the Chinese  Communist Party's aggressive military provocations on the eve of  Presidential elections in Taiwan--the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, this  period is now called. That was an important and decisive demonstration  of American commitment and resolve to an emerging democracy and partner  that is still remembered today on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.   More recently, I was part of another demonstration of American  commitment and resolve when I traveled to Taiwan with Democrat Senators  Tammy Duckworth and Chris Coons to provide vaccines--close to a  million--from the United States for the Taiwanese people in the face of  the Chinese Communist Party's aggressive attempts to prevent the  citizens of Taiwan from receiving these lifesaving Western medicines.  [[Page S373]]    I am now a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve, working again on  these issues in the INDOPACOM theater.   Let me conclude with this: American commitment and resolve for Taiwan  has been part of our law, heritage, trade, economics, and military  deployments for decades and should be for decades to come. The  S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022 is the next logical step to  demonstrate America's commitment to Taiwan, this time emphasizing the  deterrent power of our economic and financial strengths.   It is our values of freedom, innovation, the rule of law, individual  rights, and openness that the Chinese Communist Party is most afraid  of. We must be ready as democracies to defend these values or risk a  world increasingly governed by autocracy, surveillance, aggression, and  permanent conflict. The S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act will help us do just  that.
