 Madam Speaker, since being signed into law, the Violence  Against Women Act has become a crucial part of legislation to aid  victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence. VAWA provides lifesaving  programs to help survivors navigate domestic violence and abuse  situations.   Madam Speaker, in my district, I heard from innumerable counselors,  activists, advocates, and attorneys about the toll the COVID-19  pandemic has taken on families, but especially families who have to  experience domestic violence. Being locked in a situation with your  abuser, with your attacker, was incredibly dangerous, and there has  been terrible trauma inflicted.   We need to pass VAWA now. There is no reason not to support people  who are victims of domestic violence. This is an enormous step forward.   I am grateful to the leaders who brought this forward, and I rise in  support.
