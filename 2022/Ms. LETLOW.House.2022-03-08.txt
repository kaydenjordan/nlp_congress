 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 70.   Like countless Americans, I am deeply shocked by the recent threats  against our Nation's historically Black colleges and universities. As a  former educator who spent my career working on college campuses, I  firmly believe that every student has the right to learn in a safe  environment and free from threats and intimidation.  [[Page H1348]]    I am proud to say that my State of Louisiana is home to some of the  Nation's most iconic HBCUs, including Grambling State University,  Southern University, and Xavier University of Louisiana. I am saddened  to know the emotional anguish that students, faculty, and staff went  through last month when threats were made against Southern and Xavier.   Today, we send a clear message to those that want to use fear,  intimidation, and hatred against our Nation's HBCUs: We will never just  stand by and let you terrorize our students, our next generation of  leaders, and our future.   So many Members of this Congress are united, both Republicans and  Democrats, and we are proud to support America's HBCUs with this  resolution.
