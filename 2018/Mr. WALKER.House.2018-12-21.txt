Statutory constraints limit the       ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve       higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.        ``(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the       willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys.       Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and       therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the       economy.        ``(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of       the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau       of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will       improve their ability to track more accurately the large and       rapidly changing nature of United States business. In       particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better       ensure that businesses are consistently classified in       appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce       statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the       entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and       correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.        ``(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and       Trade in Services Survey Act  [[Page H10524]]       (Public Law 94-472), which allowed the Bureau of the Census,       the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor       Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act       not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135       industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the       data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how       data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data       products.        ``(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of       business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of       Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics       continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for       respondents to statistical surveys.       ``Sec. 3576.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act  sponsored by Speaker Ryan would improve government data collection and  transparency, while bolstering privacy protections, to better inform  policymaking.   This bill previously passed the House on suspension. Mr. Speaker, I  urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2276) to require agencies to submit reports on outstanding  recommendations in the annual budget justification submitted to  Congress.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2276         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government, or GAO-IG,  Act would improve transparency and oversight of the executive branch.  This bill enjoys bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3031) to amend chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code, to  improve the management of Federal personal property.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3031         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018  would improve inventories and accounting of Federal Government property  bought with taxpayer dollars. This bill has bipartisan support. I urge  all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.

SEC. 10. FUNDING.         Until such time as funds are appropriated to carry out this       Act, the President shall use such sums as are available for       discretionary use to carry out this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of  2018 would ensure the integrity of records of civil rights cold cases  and ultimately allow public access to them. This important legislation  has bipartisan support.   I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
