 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Suicide Awareness  Month.   For families deeply affected by suicide like my own--this issue is  very personal.   When I came to Congress, I decided to turn grief into a purpose by  co-chairing the bipartisan Mental Health Caucus.   I have worked with my colleagues to author and pass legislation to  expand pediatric mental health care, effectively implement the new 988  suicide lifeline, and reduce the shortage of mental health  professionals, but there is still much more to be done.   Stigma surrounding mental illness still persists in the country big  time. We are just beginning to understand the pandemic's true impact on  behavioral health. If we are to make meaningful progress to reduce  suicide, we need to focus on areas that produce the most in the least  amount of time.   The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, along with a growing  segment of the medical community, has recognized the need to expand  suicide risk screenings within our healthcare community systems. By  having more patients receive these screenings, healthcare professionals  can better identify and treat at-risk individuals.   Madam Speaker, suicide prevention is an issue near and dear to my  heart, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this  important, lifesaving work.                            ____________________
