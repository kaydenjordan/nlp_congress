 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  opposition to the bills we are considering today which would short- circuit the approval process of fossil fuel projects at the expense of  our environment and private property owners.   In my home State of New Hampshire, Granite Staters are all too  familiar with the problems of siting natural gas projects and the  disruption this can cause for small rural towns.   In 2015, energy giant Kinder Morgan proposed a large natural gas  pipeline project that would have cut through 17 New Hampshire towns in  my district which are home to numerous environmentally sensitive areas  that would have been negatively impacted by this project.   Throughout the review process, I heard from thousands of my  constituents whose concerns were not being heard by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission.   Thanks to the commitment and tireless efforts of these advocates,  Kinder Morgan eventually pulled the plug on the project, but there is  so much more that needs to be done to give average citizens a seat at  the table during FERC's review process.   The bills we are considering today would do nothing to elevate the  concerns of impacted communities during the FERC proceedings, and these  bills aim to jam through risky pipeline projects while constraining  other agencies from concluding important environmental reviews.   We all know that FERC acts as a rubber stamp for fossil fuel  projects, and the bills we are considering today further narrow the  opportunities for private landowners to push back against projects and  try to protect their land from eminent domain.                                time  1600    At a time when pipeline expansion has increased dramatically, we  should be working on bipartisan solutions that increase public  participation during FERC proceedings. That is why I have cosponsored  legislation to create an Office of Public Participation within FERC  that would level the playing field for average citizens and give them a  seat at the table.   H.R. 2910, which we just debated, does nothing to achieve this goal  and will only lead to more communities being left in the dark during  FERC proceedings.   H.R. 2883 would eliminate the need for a Presidential permit for  cross-border energy projects and dramatically narrow the environmental  review to the narrow portion of the project that crosses the border.  These cross-border projects are oftentimes hundreds of miles long. It  simply makes no sense to conduct an environmental review on the small  portion that crosses the border. That is just common sense.   For the good of our environment, for the good of our communities and  public lands, I urge my colleagues to oppose these harmful pieces of  legislation.
