 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 326.   ``Mirabile dictu.'' Wondrous to relate.   Mr. Speaker, it is finally on the floor.   I just heard a revision of history from my friend from Ohio. We were  prepared to bring this resolution up on the floor in July. This has  nothing to do with it. It wouldn't have even mentioned President Trump  and Secretary Pompeo's strange acknowledgment of settlements that are  recognized as illegal in international law.   This resolution is not, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin)  would have you believe, lacking in a recitation of all the grievances  and incidents that continue to plague Israel and the Palestinian  people. This is a prescription for a solution, which apparently my  friend from New York is not interested in.   A two-state solution has been the policy of Republican and Democratic  administrations. If you want to call it partisan, you take the blame,  because you on the other side of the aisle are the ones who have  blocked it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend, for  yielding.  [[Page H9302]]     Mr. Speaker, it is the Republicans who steadfastly have  refused even to entertain being engaged in the drafting of this  resolution. So, yes, if you want to call it partisan, you own it. It is  your partisanship, not ours.   This is a restatement of United States policy. This is a prescription  for a solution, a path toward a solution that would bring peace to both  Israel and the Palestinian people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.
