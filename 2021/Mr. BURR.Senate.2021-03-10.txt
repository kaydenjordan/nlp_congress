 Madam President, I rise today to support the nomination of  Michael Regan to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency. One look at Michael's resume should make it clear to my  colleagues that he is immensely qualified for this position, not only  in qualifications but in his demeanor.   Michael is a proud North Carolinian who, over the last 4 years, has  ably served as secretary of the North Carolina department of  environment. You will consistently hear from those who have worked with  him in this role that whether they agreed or disagreed on a given  policy, he always listened and looked to find agreement.   This type of praise is not easy to come by on environmental matters,  but it is exactly what we should ask of any nominee to ensure everyone  gets a fair hearing at their Agency. That is exactly why North  Carolina's agricultural community supports his nomination.   It is our job to ascertain whether a nominee has the knowledge and  experience to do the job that the President has nominated them for,  but, too often, we overlook whether a nominee has the right character  to lead an organization. In this case, there is no question that  Michael Regan has that character.   I have had the pleasure to get to know him over the last several  years and to see firsthand his sincerity and love for his family. I  know when a man of this caliber is confirmed, he will bring those same  qualities to the Agency he leads, bolstering the EPA and ensuring that  communities reliant on agriculture for their livelihood will be  listened to.   In closing, Michael Regan is a good man. He is the right man to lead  the Environmental Protection Agency. And I would urge you and urge my  colleagues to confirm him to be the next Administrator of the EPA   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
