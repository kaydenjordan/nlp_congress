 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 415 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 415         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3004) to       amend section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act       relating to reentry of removed aliens. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from July       3, 2017, through July 10, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  It shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order to consider concurrent resolutions providing       for adjournment during the month of July, 2017.        Sec. 5.  The Committee on Appropriations may, at any time       before 5 p.m. on Thursday, July 6, 2017, file privileged       reports to accompany measures making appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.        Sec. 6.  The Committee on Armed Services may, at any time       before 5 p.m. on Thursday, July 6, 2017, file a report to       accompany H.R. 2810.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of  H.R. 3004, also known as Kate's Law.   It should be instructive, also, Mr. Speaker, to recognize that H.R.  3004 had a companion bill that we debated on the rule yesterday--not  voted on, we will vote on these today--that was a companion bill to  this that is a very important bill. These are both effective law  enforcement tools that need to be made available not only to protect  the people of the United States, but, in particular, people who live in  many of the jurisdictions that are being denied that support by  effective law enforcement because of political policies that are being  instructed by city councils and mayors across the country.   Mr. Speaker, on July 1, 2015, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez shot and  killed Kate Steinle at Pier 14 in San Francisco, California, while she  was walking with her father. Mr. Lopez-Sanchez claims that he does not  fully recall the murder, as he took strong sleeping pills prior to the  incident.   Mr. Speaker, this senseless and cowardly murder should never have  happened. Mr. Lopez-Sanchez is and was an unlawful criminal alien who  had previously been deported five times from the United States of  America.                                time  1230    He had numerous felony convictions in the United States of America,  including for the possession of heroin and the manufacturing of  narcotics in the United States of America.   Despite his lengthy history of criminal acts dating back to 1991, Mr.  Sanchez was able to illegally reenter the United States again and again  and again with minimal consequences, showcasing serious fault lines in  one of our systems of deterrence: our border.   For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and the spread of  dangerous sanctuary policies have failed the American people and cost  lives. The death of innocent Americans, such as Kate, Sarah Root, Grant  Roanebeck, and too many others across this country, is simply  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today. The American people have  had enough. And I believe Congress has heard from the people, and we  have heard enough and had enough.   The bottom line is we now have a President, Donald J. Trump, who not  only heard this same story as he went around the country running for  President, but had a different answer, because I assure you, the major  candidates running for President on the Republican and Democratic  ticket heard this same content. One person stepped up to the plate. He  is now our President: Donald J. Trump.   The American people are sick and tired of turning on their TVs or  radios or newspapers and seeing yet another senseless murder committed  by a previously deported criminal alien. Their deaths are especially  devastating since I believe they could have been prevented if our  immigration laws had been carefully enforced or we had, really, what I  call the national deterrent: the will to stop these senseless acts.  Kate's Law gets close to doing just that.   The underlying legislation that the House will be able to vote on in  this rule and in the legislation today enhances the current maximum  sentences for illegal reentry. The bill raises the maximum sentence for  criminal aliens who reenter the United States to between 10 and 25  years in Federal prison, depending upon the criminal's history.   For all those who are attempting to politicize this legislation--and,  yes, they are--I would encourage them to read the bill. Mr. Speaker, I  have that bill in front of me as we speak, and it is really not too  much of a lift. It is half of a page and four other pages.   Members of Congress do have time to read the bill. Members of  Congress do  [[Page H5309]]  have time to understand why we are here today. And it is more than just  that is just the way it is. It is, in fact, a reality that has become  all too known by every single American, and especially moms and dads,  moms and dads and uncles and grandparents who hurt when our children  are hurt.   So regardless of your position on general immigration reform, I would  hope that you would join us today, join us today in agreeing that we  should do everything we can to discourage murderers and criminal  aliens.   Disagreeing one way or another on immigration policy is not what this  is about. This is about where even there is the slightest potential  that there could be citizens who would be harmed, we need a second  look, a second opportunity, and a chance to address the issue.   The American people, I believe, need and deserve stronger deterrence  of those who have come here illegally and have already proven that they  are willing to break our Nation's most serious laws.   These are not huddled masses yearning to be free or families  attempting to come here for a better life. These are bad people, and we  call them criminals. They have violated the criminal conduct code here  in the United States of America. They are people who we know are  capable of terrible crimes, who, via their own criminal actions, have  made sure that they have taken away the right that others had and, in  doing so, have harmed the lives of our citizens.   The American people spoke clearly in November. President Donald J.  Trump understood that. This is a criminal matter; this is not a  politics issue; and the time of letting the worst criminals back in our  country over and over and over again must stop. The process begins  again today.   Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), a distinguished Member of this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I have several more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  young gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King), one of the leading voices in Congress, not only on  this issue, but also issues of great importance and it's Americanism:  that our country is a great country, and that we live in the greatest  country in the world. There isn't one time that I am not around this  gentleman that he does not speak about American exceptionalism, the  rule of law, and the important attributes of our country that make us  world leaders.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), a gentleman who my party prays for on a daily basis.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the dialogue today with the  gentlewoman, my friend, from New York, the ranking member of the  committee, not only for her professional conduct today, but also for  her day-to-day service to the Rules Committee as both she and I work  through these difficult issues that face our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today has a lot to do with two  bills that were taken out of a larger immigration bill. Yesterday, we  heard a debate on H.R. 3003, and today, on H.R. 3004. They are, in  sense, companion bills. Balancing acts is what I would refer to them  as, acts about addressing two very specific problems that are in our  country that are very interrelated.   These are law enforcement bills. Make no mistake about it. These are  not political. These are law enforcement bills. These are law  enforcement bills that are designed to make sure that we effectively  codify into Federal law the viewpoint that cities cannot harbor  criminals, rapists, murderers, or people who are robbing and killing  people as they choose--multiple times--and cities turning a blind eye  to not even recognize requests from other cities that might want these  people, but also from the Federal Government.   The second bill that we have got is one that says that what we are  going to do is not only not fund these cities that are sanctuary  cities, but we are going to deal more effectively with these criminals  in the system. That is Kate's Law.   Both of these bills, H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003, effectively balance  each other because, as Members of Congress, we hear from people back  home, many times, not just families from people who are impacted, but  really citizens who are worried about our country dividing itself on  this issue of criminals.   Make no mistake about it, these are criminals. Make no mistake about  it, this is a law enforcement bill. Make no mistake about it, the  United States Congress needs to ensure that our cities and States  follow the laws, the Federal laws that we know have been, not only  cleared by Congress, but signed by the President of the United States.  They will be subject to review by the courts. We will be very pleased  to take that review also.   Because, in fact, what we are doing is protecting American citizens.  We are answering the call. And I would say, we are also making sure  that we support the President of the United States, President Trump,  who spoke very clearly on these issues, not only during the campaign,  but he was elected therein.   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  legislation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 415 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:  [[Page H5315]]         Sec 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       685) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage       domestic insourcing and discourage foreign outsourcing. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and       Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 685.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
