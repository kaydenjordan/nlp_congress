 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding time. Let me first say that the administration  enthusiastically supports the work of Chairman Graves and Ranking  Member Larsen for the great work that they have done.   This is good for America. This is good for Houston, Texas, and it is  good for Texas. I have two airports in the region, including Hobby  International Airport and Bush Intercontinental Airport, and Ellington  Field that see some commercial flights.   It is good that we will get between $3.35 billion and $4 billion to  help in the airport funding program of which I saw about 40 to 80  million come to our Bush Intercontinental Airport in the last couple of  weeks.   It is important to have the flexibility to deal with environmental  issues, and, of course, it is extremely important to have a $45 million  training program for a pipeline for pilots, aviation maintenance, and  aviation manufacturing. Why? Because schools like Texas Southern  University that uniquely has one of the only HBCUs training of pilots  program will be able to do more and fill that pipeline with pilots.   In addition, we respond to the assaults that have been occurring  against employees and crew, and respond by an employee assault  prevention response plan, which is extremely important.   We did this during 9/11, but now we are looking at more secondary  cockpit barriers that will be more important. As well, we want to make  sure that we have a task force of air carriers.   This bill is for airlines and airports, but it is for the traveling  public, as well. It deals with air law enforcement, aviation labor  unions, and others to be able to work together.   I am excited about the Bessie Coleman Women in Aviation Advisory  Committee to encourage more young women to become pilots, as we need  more pilots every single day.   The matter that I worked on as a member of the Committee on Homeland  Security, finally we set standards for foreign aircraft repair  stations, so that when our American airlines are overseas, they are  subject to the same standards of American repair stations. We were very  concerned about that after 9/11.    Mr. Chairman, let me dwell on an amendment that I  offered to get through the backlog of pilots that are now well after  they have been off for some medical reason and the backlog of getting  them back into the stream of flying is taking long. We need to look at  that because these are perfectly able pilots, but they are still on  medical leave.   I also want to ensure that we have mental health relief for our  pilots, like 29-year-old Chris Daniel, who was doing well, but after  the pandemic began experiencing depression. Chris' doctor suggested  treatment for his depression, but as a pilot, he was too afraid to go.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 3935, the  Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in America Aviation Act of 2023.   The Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act  helps maintain America's gold standard in safety, fosters innovation,  strengthens and diversifies the U.S. aviation workforce, and invests in  resilient and sustainable infrastructure.   This is an important bill that I offered an amendment to help improve  through the Rules Committee, the Jackson Lee Amendment.   While the Rules Committee did not make my amendment in order, it is  important to highlight what it would have done and what is still needed  to assist and strengthen aviation in our country.   In particular, the Jackson Lee Amendment would do the following:   Implement the creation of the Aviation Medical Innovation and  Modernization Working Group and a report on recommendations from the  Working Group on the evaluation of the conditions an Aviation Medical  Examiner can issue. Improve and reform to the Special Issuance process,  including whether, after initial medical certification by the FAA,  renewals can be based on a medical evaluation and treatment plan by a  pilot's treating medical specialist with concurrence from the pilot's  Aviation Medical Examiner, in addition to other measures that will help  ease the process and remove the backlog for when pilots return from  medical leave.   It would pilot a mental health task group to develop and provide  recommendations related to supporting the mental health of aircraft  pilots.   Finally, my amendment requests a report that would provide  recommendations for best practices in detecting, assessing, and  reporting mental health conditions and treatment options as part of  pilot aeromedical assessments.   The Jackson Lee Amendment would have strengthened this legislation by  keeping the health and safety of airline pilots at the forefront.    Mr. Chair, let's help our pilots be strong medically  and mentally, and let's make this the best aviation system in the  world.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article from Scientific  American.                 [From Scientific American, Nov. 22, 2022]    We Need To Change the System That Keeps Pilots From Seeking Mental                                Health Care                          (By William R. Hoffman)         By 29 years old, Chris Daniel felt he had it all: a wife,       two beautiful children and fulfillment of his lifelong dream       of becoming a U.S. airline captain. But in the spring of       2022, after years of flying, Chris knew something was not       right. Shadows from his past  [[Page H3716]]       were reemerging, strained by post-COVID travel demand and       long, taxing weeks on the road. Years earlier, Chris's       physician had suggested that his low mood and trouble       sleeping might be symptoms of mild depression. But like many       pilots, he balked at the idea. If a doctor diagnosed       depression or if he sought help, Chris assumed he would never       be able to fly again. Seeking help seemed unthinkable because       losing flying was akin to losing everything; being a pilot       was who he was.        Chris's story is not unusual. While mental health symptoms       are common in airline pilots, getting help can affect their       ability to work in a big way. Airline pilots are required to       meet certain medical standards in order to maintain an active       flying status, and disclosing a new symptom or condition to       the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) puts them at risk       of losing, usually temporarily, their ability to work and       fly. This is particularly true for mental health symptoms.       The FAA bars pilots from the cockpit if they report seeking       regular talk therapy for even mild anxiety or depression;       this may last for months and sometimes even years based on       the assumption they pose an unacceptable risk to safety. In       fact, pilots find themselves among only a handful of       professions that require disclosure of any encounter with the       health care system, including mental health visits.        While it makes sense to ground a pilot in distress, the       current system often fails to recognize the dynamic and often       situational nature of mental health symptoms and often drives       pilots from seeking care. Time off the job can have negative       repercussions such as loss of pay and need for recurrent       training, and the expenses of additional medical evaluations       required by the FAA often fall onto the pilot. All of these       together result in a population of pilots working the fleet       who are suffering in silence and fearful to get the help they       need. We must rethink the system that drives pilots from       attending to their mental health and change what seeking       mental health care services means in aviation.        Data my group and others have gathered are beginning to       reveal the scope of this problem. Our findings demand       attention. In our recent study of more than 3,500 U.S.       pilots, 56 percent reported behavior that we classify as       avoiding health care (for example, getting health care       outside the traditional system to avoid its documentation)       specifically because they feared the loss of their clearance       to fly. Interestingly, 26 percent of pilots reported that       they had withheld information during their FAA health       checkups for the same reason: the fear of losing their       medical clearance. This is sometimes called ``losing their       wings.''        In a sister study, more than half of pilots in our sample       had something they felt needed to get checked out--maybe it       was mental health related, perhaps a knee injury, or even       just a rash--but waited or decided against it because they       worried about their career. While our studies focused on       overall health care, we suspect this finding also applies to       mental health.        Many pilots have reasonably good access to health care.       This includes health insurance, paid time off and sometimes       other union protections. Instead, these data suggest a       barrier exists because pilots are asked to weigh the benefits       of seeking help against the professional costs that they       alone bear. How bad does mild anxiety need to become to       warrant a prolonged absence from work? For most pilots,       very bad.        The growing demand for pilots in our travel-hungry, COVID-      endemic world is likely to make this problem more       complicated. The Bureau of Labor and Statistics projects       18,100 new pilot jobs each year for the next decade,       precipitated by the continued growth of air travel. As       compensation has soared in 2022, more is being asked of       pilots, including longer and more frequent trips to keep pace       with passenger demand, This is in the context of other       airline professions--such as maintenance and administrative       staff--facing major personnel shortages, placing further       strain on a system already operating at its limits. Higher       demand on pilots can lead to additional time away from family       and friends, leading to an even greater need for mental       health care services. Simply put, pilots' need for mental       health care is likely to only grow in the coming years.        While on the surface it might seem that increasing the pool       of pilots would ease the situation, more pilots won't fix the       existing challenges in the system. Flight training programs       are expanding, and some airlines are taking the unprecedented       step of establishing their own training programs. But, while       class sizes are growing, they are being filled by a younger       and more diverse generation of student pilots who may not be       as willing as their predecessors to quietly suffer. In fact,       emerging data suggest the willingness of current pilots (who       are still largely in the 40-to-60 age range) to avoid health       care for job security may not be as true for the next       generation.        ``Younger pilots are different from past generations and       are more willing to identify as needing help when it comes to       their mental health,'' John Dulski, 21, an aviation student       at the University of North Dakota and advocate for aviation       mental health reform, told me during a recent phone call.       ``Many are more willing to choose to get care at the risk of       stepping away from flying.'' The answers to why such a       phenomenon is occurring remains an open question that our       research group is trying to understand. Could it be related       to social media lowering the stigma of mental health or the       influences of growing up through the pandemic? We hope future       research will reveal the answer.        A new generation of Gen Z airline pilots more open to       stepping away from flying to seek mental health care services       may only further strain the shortage of pilots. But more       importantly, it should call for industry to rethink what it       means for an airline pilot to be mentally fit and what       services they should be able to receive while still working       the fleet. We can all agree that safety in aviation should be       the foundation for meaningful change. Certainly, a pilot with       a severe mental health condition shouldn't be flying. But the       opportunity lies for pilots with mild symptoms. These are       high performing professionals who are perhaps facing one of       life's usual stressors--a divorce, a family death or even       just the chronic stress of the job. How might we rethink a       system that enables this group to seek mental health care       services in hopes of sidestepping a diagnosis that could go       on to fully pull them from flying?        One answer is clear. The FAA should change policy to permit       pilots with mild symptoms to seek professional regular, and       if needed prolonged, talk therapy without loss of their       medical certification. Such a change would have major       benefits for people on both sides of the flight deck door,       including treatment to prevent symptom worsening, and regular       pilot assessment by a professional mental health provider.       Recognizing that mental health is on a dynamic spectrum and       that many pilots could benefit from talking to a professional       mental health provider at some point in their career has the       potential to keep pilots flying healthy while also increasing       safety in the system. Pilot unions and airlines should fuel       this movement by raising awareness about the problem their       pilots face and by lobbying for an alliance of stakeholder to       determine how best to safely enact this change. While credit       is due to the FAA for recently making several positive policy       changes related to mental health, there is still work to do       and time is of the essence.        Chris Daniel never did get help for his mental health       symptoms, and despite an excellent flying record, he died of       suicide in June 2022. While we believe suicide is relatively       rare among pilots, this extreme outcome is in part why we       must create positive change. With the use of appropriate       supervision and reevaluation, aviation's safety culture       should shift to thinking of mental health care services as a       marker for wellness and prevention instead of risk and       disease. This change would not only benefit pilots, but also       the 2 million U.S. passengers who trust the aviation system       every day.                               IF YOU NEED HELP         If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts       of suicide, help is available.
