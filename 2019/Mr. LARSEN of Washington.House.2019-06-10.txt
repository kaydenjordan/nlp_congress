 Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago, Democrats  and Republicans engaged in the annual Congressional Soccer Match, and  we are taking a very brief amount of time here to announce the outcome  of that Congressional Soccer Match. In a few moments, I will recognize  my Representative friend from Nebraska.   This is an important timing of this particular recognition because  tomorrow the U.S. Women's national team kicks off at 3 p.m. to defend  their World Cup title. For those in the Pacific Northwest, that is  noon. I am encouraging everyone to watch that game if it is possible.   So we are here to recognize the Women's national team, but also to  recognize the winners of this year's Congressional Soccer Match, the  Republicans.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor), who is also on our team and the other co- chair.
