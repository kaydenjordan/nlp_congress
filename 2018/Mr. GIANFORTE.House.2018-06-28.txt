 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring this body's  attention to a war on coal that jeopardizes our Montana communities,  jobs, and economy.   Environmental extremists want to eliminate the diversity of Montana's  energy generation. Their radical agenda threatens our Montana way of  life, particularly in eastern Montana.   This week, the Montana Chamber Foundation released a report that  reveals the alarming impact a continued war on coal would have in  Montana.   If Colstrip's Units 3 and 4 were closed prematurely, the impact would  be devastating to Montana. Montana would lose about 3,300 jobs. Our  State's population would shrink by 7,000 individuals. Montanans would  lose over $5 billion in income and all Montanans would face higher  electricity prices. Also, the loss of this source of reliable baseload  power would threaten the stability of our electric grid.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end this war on coal once and for all.  Montanans, our communities, and our economy require that we not raise  the white flag.                            ____________________
