 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, what you are about to hear from our Republican friends  for the next 30 minutes is the following: a mixture of theology and  science fiction. And then they are going to take you to revisionist  history.   This is the most regressive piece of tax legislation that has come  from the Ways and Means Committee in the 25 years that I have been a  member.   This is not about simplification. When you have a chance to look at  the phase-ins and the phaseouts, you will be passed out by the time  they get to the expiration dates.   They say it is about simplicity; it was going to be on a postcard.  You are going to need to carry a billboard around with you to  understand what is in this actual bill.   And here is the best part: when Secretary Mnuchin said, Mr. Speaker,  that under no circumstances would people at the top get tax relief.  Well, I guess if you are formerly in the 39.6 percent tax bracket,  which is summarily lowered to 37 percent, that that is dressed up as no  tax relief for people at the very top. But then again, to help out with  their argument, then they double the exemption on the estate tax, which  will go from $11 million to $22 million.   The people at the bottom in this, they are going to argue: Everybody  gets a tax cut. Well, here is where we go to revised history.   In 2001, President Bush said everybody gets a tax cut. The Federal  budget of $1.3 trillion included a tax cut for everybody. The people at  the bottom got a hundred bucks, and the people at the top got hundreds  of thousands of dollars. This is a creative replay of exactly what  happened.   And then in 2003, they came back and cut taxes again for people at  the very top and blew a huge hole in the Federal deficit, which had  been estimated at the time, after Clinton left on January 19, 2001, to  project surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Instead, the  Federal deficit mounted to $6.1 trillion.   So here is the simplicity of their proposal today. They are borrowing  $2.3 trillion to give a tax cut to people at the very top of American  society. That is not in dispute.   In addition to borrowing the money, recall that the Federal Reserve  Board said they are projecting, already, three increases next year in  interest rates. We don't know what this is going to look like by the  time they get done, but this, today, is more about ideology than it is  about public policy  [[Page H10202]]    Think of it this way as well: This was done in 1 month. In 1 single  month, the entire revenue system of the United States is being  transformed.    I yield myself an additional 1 minute, Mr. Speaker.   Not one public hearing was held on this bill. And when they say  today, ``Oh, we had 5 years of public hearings,'' we did not have one  hearing on this bill--not one. No witness testimony was sought. No  committee was convened for the purpose of a hearing. And then when we  went to conference, we were all granted an opening statement, and we  got to question the nonpartisan Director of the Joint Committee on  Taxation.   Mr. Speaker, more than anything else today, this is a missed  opportunity where both sides could have accomplished something great  for the American people.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), the longest serving member of the Ways and Means  Committee, and a well-deserved 1 minute, I might add.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, one of the great men of our times.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the very capable legislator and Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), a distinguished Vietnam veteran and a well- known and valued member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), the former president of the State Senate and  a well-informed member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a very capable member of the committee, and a  champion of renewable energy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the very quotable Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, a good  friend, and a former member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a very knowledgeable Member from the  city of Chicago and champion of all things Chicago.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), a capable member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, the stock market has been going up since March  of 2009, and we have had 88 straight months of economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms.  Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is very successful.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), the former revenue commissioner of the State  of California, who is going to tell us about the State and local tax  deduction ending.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez), who will tell us about the great harm that this  does to New York and to the island of Puerto Rico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   So, in 1 month, we have taken the entire revenue system of the  country without one public hearing, without any witness testimony,  without the solicitation of one expert. ``We,'' meaning the Republican  majority. They have decided to go forward with this reckless plan.    Contrast this with Reagan and O'Neill and Rostenkowski and Packwood  in 1986.   When Gephardt and Bradley first offered their bill in 1982 on tax  reform, 4 years ensued before the measure came to the floor for  passage, and, in that time, 450 witnesses offered testimony. Every  expert from every nook and cranny in America was invited to offer their  vision of what a better tax system might look like. And those  individuals--and I knew them all because I went to the committee when  Mr. Rostenkowski was the chairman--saw that as the fabled achievement  of their time in a bipartisan manner.   Do you know what else?   Secretary Reagan and Chief of Staff Jim Baker sat through the markups  on that tax reform measure.   Now, Secretary Mnuchin, instead, has said, nobody at the top will get  a tax cut. And then they cut the rate from 39.6 at the top to 37. Well,  nobody at the top will get a tax cut.   We are going to double the exemption on this estate tax so that you  might now keep $22 million rather than $11 million, without any  formalization of taxation.   My friend, Mr. Brady--and he is my friend--he spoke before about the  people's money.  [[Page H10211]]    Well, you know what the people's responsibility is?   A million new veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. That is the  people's responsibility.   When we talk about responsibility and the people's money, Medicare is  the people's responsibility. Social Security is the people's  responsibility.   As we celebrate the extension of life expectancy in America, Medicaid  today now cares for people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. That  is the people's responsibility.   They have carefully taken theology and wed it to science fiction.   Remember what we heard around here all these years?   Don't worry, tax cuts pay for themselves. That was the offering in  2001, $1.3 trillion worth of tax cuts.   Well, we get to 2003, another $1 trillion worth of tax cuts. By the  way, there was time in between for a repatriation holiday, at 5\1/4\,  all advertised on the basis of job creation, and layoffs ensued almost  the next day.                                time  1345    This money is going to be used for stock buybacks and dividends.  There will be little investment in this lost opportunity where we  should have invested in community colleges and vocational education and  apprenticeship programs.   Six million jobs in America go unanswered every single day because of  a skills alignment problem and also the horror of what opiate addiction  has done across the United States. It has sidelined 2 million people.   What they are telling us today is the following: We have got tax  simplification. What happened to the postcard? As I said earlier, we  are going to have to carry around a billboard for tax simplification to  figure out what is in it. They keep talking about phase-ins and  phaseouts. I am telling you, we will all be passed out by the time they  get done with this. This is more complexity.   And wait until people have a chance over the next few weeks to sort  through what is in this bill. But here is something you might give some  thought to: the bottom quintile, you are going to get $60 a year. The  second quintile, you are going to get $380 a year. The top 1 percent,  they are going to get $51,000 a year. The top 0.1 percent, they are  going to get $193,000 a year, all in the name of middle class tax  relief.   As we proceed to the holiday, they are telling us this is their  Christmas present. And you know what they are doing with it? It is  going to be Christmas hangover debt, and they are putting it on the  credit card and adding $2.3 trillion to the Federal debt.   Merry Christmas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly am.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
