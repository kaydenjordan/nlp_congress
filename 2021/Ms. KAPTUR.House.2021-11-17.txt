 Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud President Biden's  bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This historic  legislation is an enormous win for the American people.   Finally, from coast to coast, in every State, district, and territory  of our Nation, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will deliver  significant new resources. Together, America will restore our Nation's  crumbling infrastructure. Together, we will create millions of good- paying jobs over the next decade.   The Great Lakes region will be empowered with billions of dollars to  rebuild our roads, bridges, rail lines, revitalize our water  infrastructure and airports. We will deploy modern broadband  connectivity and new carbon-free energy systems.   By properly rewarding those who make and build what makes and builds  America, we will create a fairer, more just, and more prosperous future  for our middle-class workers, families, and communities.   For years there has been talk about infrastructure. President Biden  is delivering and building back better for Americans from coast to  coast.                            ____________________
