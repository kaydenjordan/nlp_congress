 Madam Speaker, it is in the best interests of the  United States of America to build and maintain strong partnerships with  our allies across the globe.   In that spirit, I rise today in recognition of our important  relationship with one of those allies, the Republic of India.   India, the world's largest democracy, is under constant threat from  the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party has been  acting aggressively towards India in recent years and infringing on  Indian territory.   India is an effective counterweight to the Chinese Communist Party's  desire for dominance in southeast Asia, Madam Speaker, and a strong  India is critical to preventing expansion of the Chinese Communist  Party's global influence.   I am proud to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives  today with a strong, clear message for our friends in India: The United  States supports you in your struggle against Chinese aggressors.  Together, our two democratic, free nations will stand against the  communism that only seeks to rob citizens of their individuality and  beliefs.                            ____________________
