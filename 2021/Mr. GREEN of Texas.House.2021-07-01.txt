 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today as I  always do, with great respect for all and love of country at heart.   I rise today for a very special reason. Today is one of the days that  I will cherish for the rest of my life. What I will do today is  something that I believe will help us to commemorate an unfortunate  circumstance that our country has been a part of.   This is the day that I will have the opportunity to bring to the  attention of the Congress of the United States of America a very  special resolution. This is a resolution that is supporting the  designation of Slavery Remembrance Day.   The resolution proposes that August 20, 2021, serve as the first  Slavery Remembrance Day. And this is done to remind us of the evils of  slavery.   Mr. Speaker, I have noticed that as time has passed during my  lifetime, there have been those who have sought to whitewash, to  sanitize, the evils associated with slavery. This is a necessary  resolution because this resolution will forever allow us to remember  the horrors of slavery, the events that have shaped our current  circumstances.   Slavery was our seminal sin. It was the sin that has, for too long-- centuries, for too long--had an impact on the politics, the economics,  the social standing of people in our country.   This resolution reads as follows. I shall not read it in its entirety  today, but there are some portions of it that are exceedingly  important.         Whereas this resolution may be cited as the ``Original       Slavery Remembrance Day Resolution of 2021.''    For those who keep records, it is H. Res. 517. It has been filed, and  it has more than 75 original cosponsors. I am saying original and more  than 75 simply because, right up to the last minute, we were adding  people, so more than 75 original cosponsors.   I shall do all that I can to memorialize the persons who are original  cosponsors, and I shall seek additional cosponsors of this resolution.         Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes August 20,       2021, as ``Slavery Remembrance Day'' and commemorates the       lives of all enslaved people while also condemning the act       and perpetuation of slavery in the United States of America       and across the world.        Whereas we posthumously recognize the following Members of       Congress, who served during and after the Reconstruction era,       as honorary cosponsors of this resolution.    Their names are listed. I will not read them today. I want to do  something very special when these names are mentioned, and they shall  be mentioned in the near future. But their names are all here, persons  who actually served in the Congress of the United States of America.  These are persons who merit a special place in history because of all  that they had to endure to serve our country.         Whereas, on August 20, 1619, the first 20 enslaved Africans       were brought to what is now Fort Monroe, then Point Comfort.    At that time, the time that they arrived, August 20, 1619, it was  Point Comfort. History has a way of reminding us of things. ``Point  Comfort,'' the place where 20 enslaved Africans arrived. Point Comfort.         Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes August 20,       2021, as ``Slavery Remembrance Day'' and commemorates the       lives of all enslaved people while also condemning the act       and perpetuation of slavery in the United States of       America and across the world.        Whereas African tribal chiefs captured, enslaved, and sold       their captives to transatlantic slave traders.    You can't tell the story without telling the whole story. You have to  tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. If there is  a scintilla of a mistake in what I say, I would beg that people would  contact me and let me know, because the truth about slavery must be  told. And the truth is that African people sold other Africans into  slavery.         Whereas over the period of the Atlantic slave trade, from       approximately 1526 to 1867, millions of humans were abducted       and shipped from Africa, and 10,700,000 arrived in the       Americas as personal property.        Whereas the majority of enslaved Africans brought to       British North America arrived between 1720 and 1780.    I do want to emphasize the fact that they were personal property,  chattels. They could be bought; they could be sold. I do understand  that this is a part of the history that we don't cherish. It is a part  of the history that we don't care to recall, but it is a part of the  history that we must remember.   We cannot allow ourselves to think, for any amount of time, that  history will never repeat itself, and we have to be ever vigilant as to  prevent history  [[Page H3592]]  from repeating itself. This is why we must have a remembrance day.   This is not the only remembrance day, my dear friends. We remember 9/ 11, and it is commemorated for the lives that were lost. We remember  Pearl Harbor. We remember January 6, the date of the insurrection. And  my prognostication is that there will be a January 6 remembrance day.   Days such as these, days that are infamous, should always be  remembered in the annals of history, and they should forever live in  infamy. But we have to remember these days.                                time  1145         Whereas 6 percent of African captives were sent directly to       British North America.        Whereas by 1825, the population of the United States       included about one-quarter of the people of African descent       in what has been called the New World.        Whereas the Middle Passage from West Africa to the West       Indies was dangerous and horrific for enslaved people.        Whereas the Middle Passage carried mothers, fathers,       children, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and       individuals from all walks of life to slavery in the       Americas.        Whereas although the sexes were separated, men, women and       children were kept naked, packed--and even stacked, I might       add--but packed close together, and the men were chained for       long periods.        Whereas according to some historians, about 12 percent of       those who embarked did not survive the voyage.        Whereas sharks followed the slave ships to feed on the       bodies of slaves thrown overboard.        Whereas enslaved people suffered a variety of miserable and       often fatal maladies due to the Atlantic slave trade and the       inhumane living and working conditions.        Whereas infant and child mortality rates were twice as high       among slave children as among Southern White children.        Whereas enslaved people often worked from sunup to after       sundown, 6 to 7 days a week often without food for long       periods of time.        Whereas enslaved Black families lived with the perpetual       possibility of separation caused by the sale of one or more       family members.    Stepping aside from the text for a moment, it has to be painful to  hear this, to know that on the auction block a mother could be  separated from her children and to know that on that auction block  families would be separated and could be sent in different directions.   Human beings were treated as property. The suffering that they  endured is unthinkable and unimaginable. It was suffering that not even  the mind of Dante could imagine. They were persons treated, to a  certain extent, like animals. The enslaved Black families were human  beings.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas it is estimated that approximately one-third of       enslaved children in the upper South States of Maryland and       Virginia experienced family separation in one of three       possible scenarios: sale away from parents, sale with mother       away from father, or sale of mother or father away from       children.    These are the horrors of slavery and the evils of slavery that we can  never ever forget. Just as we never forget other horrors and just as we  have remembrance days for them, we should have this remembrance day for  slavery.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas Nat Turner was born into slavery in Southampton       County, Virginia, in 1800.        Whereas Southampton County was home to many plantations,       and enslaved people outnumbered free Whites.        Whereas Turner learned to read and write at an early age, a       young age, becoming deeply religious.        Whereas Turner was sold to several different masters over       the course of his life, the last time in 1830.        Whereas Turner preached to his fellow enslaved people       developing a loyal following.        Whereas Turner began planning a revolt with a few trusted       fellow enslaved men from neighboring plantations.    Generally speaking, we honor people who fight being held in  captivity. Generally speaking, they are held in high esteem, and they  are celebrated for their desire to be free and their willingness to  fight for their freedom--generally speaking.   But one has to ask: Where are all of the statues for Nat Turner?   Where are all of the resolutions that have been written extolling the  virtues of Nat Turner?   The question must be posed: How can we honor those who enslaved to a  greater extent than we honor those who suffered the horrors of slavery?   Continuing with the text:         Whereas Turner began planning a revolt with a few trusted       fellow enslaved men from neighboring plantations.        Whereas Turner's rebellion began in August 1831, quickly       growing from a small handful of enslaved individuals to more       than 70 enslaved and free Blacks.        Whereas the rebels went from house to house in Southampton       County, freeing enslaved people.        Whereas the rebels were ultimately defeated by a State       militia that had over twice the manpower of the rebels, with       three artillery companies reinforcing it.        Whereas Turner was captured 6 weeks after the rebellion was       put down, whereupon he was quickly convicted and sentenced to       death.        Whereas in retaliation for the uprising, Virginia       officially executed 56 Black people with at least 100 more       killed by militias through extrajudicial violence.    We are now talking about people who were killed because other people  fought for their freedom.   Stepping aside from the text, we can never allow ourselves to  sanitize the horrors of slavery. This resolution is important. There  has to be a day of remembrance.         Whereas the rebellion caused widespread panic among       slaveholders throughout the South, resulting in widespread       violence against enslaved people.    Please, Mr. Speaker, understand, I take no great pride in reading  this and presenting this. There is no great pride in this. There is  pain. This is sinful and shameful, and we can never forget the horrors  of slavery.         Whereas in the wake of the rebellion, the Virginia General       Assembly passed legislation making it illegal to teach       enslaved free Blacks to read and write.    I take no pleasure.         Whereas the Underground Railroad was a network of       individuals who helped around 100,000 slaves escape to the       North.        Whereas the railroad began when a conductor often posing as       a slave would enter a plantation and attempt to guide       runaways.                                   (1200)         Whereas the escapees would travel 10 to 20 miles each night       between safe houses or ``stations'' to avoid detection,       waiting in safe houses for the next along the line to be       alerted to their presence.        Whereas Ms. Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery along the       Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionists who guided       escaped slaves to the North, traveling primarily at night to       avoid bounty hunters.    My dear friends, my dear brothers and sisters, many of these persons  were not of African ancestry. We didn't get here by ourselves. There  were people of goodwill, of many stripes who made it possible for us to  have these opportunities that we have today. I thank them all. My  prayer is that there will always be such people of goodwill to assist  those who find themselves in harm's way, due to injustice.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas Ms. Tubman returned to the South no less than 13       times to free 70 enslaved persons, including much of her       family, for which she would be given the name, Moses.        Whereas Ms. Tubman deftly led those she saved North during       the fall and winter, when there would-be captors stayed       inside to avoid the cold.    Some things bear repeating. Whereas Ms. Tubman deftly led those she  saved North during the fall and winter, when their would-be captors  stayed inside to avoid the cold.         Whereas in Ms. Tubman's own words: ``I never ran my train       off the track, and I never lost a passenger.''        Whereas during the Civil War, Ms. Tubman served as a nurse,       scout, spy in the Union Army, becoming the first woman to       plan and lead a military operation in the United States,       liberating 700 enslaved people in South Carolina.        Whereas the life of Ms. Tubman continued working to       improving the lives of oppressed people, raising funds and       building schools, as well as a hospital, in the name of       formerly enslaved people, while participating in the women's       suffrage movement.        Whereas John Brown, an abolitionist who ran an important       stop on the Underground Railroad, dedicated his life to       slavery.        Whereas John Brown led a militia in guerilla attacks on       pro-slavery towns in Kansas, losing one of his sons in the       struggle.        Whereas John Brown, with the help of Harriet Tubman,       planned and organized an invasion of the South to free all       slaves.    One has to ask: Where are the statues of John Brown?   One has to ask: How is it that we have statues within a short  distance of where I stand now honoring those who would enslave, but not  honoring those who would set the slaves free?   One has to ask: How do these things happen?   But one has to also be appreciative of the fact that their removal is  almost a certainty now.   One has to be appreciative of the fact that there are those among us  who  [[Page H3593]]  have taken up the fight for freedom, and they have brought it to the  very floor of this House of Representatives.   I am grateful to those who have concluded that we must remove the  statues of those who would enslave, and my prayer is we will replace  them with some statues of those who fought to free the slaves. This is  my prayer.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas John Brown began his invasion at Harpers Ferry,       West Virginia, but was surrounded and captured by Federal       troops led by Robert E. Lee, losing two more sons in the       fight.    There are still people alive today who don't want John Brown to be  celebrated. They don't want the people who gave their very last breath,  the very last ounce of their existence to the cause of freedom.  Celebrate those who would enslave, but not those who would free the  slaves.   I am grateful to those people of goodwill who stand today to continue  the struggle for liberty and justice for all, as extolled in the Pledge  of Allegiance.         Whereas the 13th Amendment was passed by Congress on       January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865, and       provides that ``Neither slavery or involuntary servitude,       except as a condition of punishment, except as punishment for       a crime whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted,       shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to       their jurisdiction.''    There is much more that can be said about the 13th Amendment. Because  I do not say it at this time, I beg that you not charge me for not  knowing some of the things that can be said about the 13th Amendment.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas beginning in the 20th century, African Americans       began to relocate from Southern farms to Southern cities,       from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, in a       movement known as the Great Migration.        Whereas the relocation of formerly enslaved individuals and       their descendants also included unfavorable and, at times,       unjust interactions with law enforcement that often resulted       in imprisonment and convict leasing.    Stepping aside from the text, in Sugar Land, Texas, bodies were  unearthed. In Sugar Land, Texas, 95 bodies unearthed. Those who study  these things have concluded that they were likely the victims of  convict leasing.   Convict leasing was a means by which slavery was continued by another  name. Convict leasing allowed laws to be used to have persons who  committed petty offenses held in jail. They were detained. Couldn't pay  a fine. These Black Codes, as they were called, allowed for convict  leasing to continue.   Persons were arrested for just standing around, not having a job, put  into the convict leasing program. And 95 such bodies were found of  persons who are thought to have been victims of convict leasing in  Sugar Land, Texas. Just outside of my congressional district, I might  add.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas convict leasing, also known as slavery by another       name, was a system that allowed persons to lease imprisoned       individuals to private entities, often corporations and       plantations.        Whereas the remains of 95 persons thought to be of African       ancestry, who were subjected to the State of Texas convict       leasing system, were discovered in 2018, at the construction       site of Fort Bend Independent School District's James Reese       Career and Technical Center in Sugar Land, Texas.    There is much more to be said about this. In the days and weeks to  come, I shall say more about this and what has happened to these 95  persons, human beings, buried, to a certain extent, in a common grave  area.         Whereas while slavery was abolished, descendants of the       enslaved continue to live with the effects of slavery's       progenies: Jim Crow, mass lynchings, segregation, police       brutality, mass incarceration, and institutionalized racism.                                time  1215    Stepping aside from the text, I am a son of the segregated South. I  have experienced these progenies, some of them. Not all of them, of  course. I am 73 years of age. I have been blessed to live longer than  many thought I would, not because of some illness, but because I was  born Black.   The prognosticators never projected or prognosticated that I would be  standing here. There was nothing at my birth that would have given  anyone reason to believe that I would stand here. And probably there  was nothing that would give persons reason to believe that I would  stand here and read this resolution.   For many, this is a resolution that is not supposed to be filed; it  is not supposed to be heard.   I am a liberated Democrat. I am not going to allow my agenda, the  agenda of those who have suffered, to go unnoticed. It won't happen on  my watch. As long as I am in this House, I am going to remind us that  we have a duty and a responsibility, as well as an obligation, to  understand the evils of slavery and understand how they have not  evaporated. They have not simply faded away. To this day, the progenies  of the evils still haunt us. They haunt us in this very House.   For those who are offended, I beg that you would forgive me, but I  don't have any recourse. Those who sent me here, they didn't send me  here to do all that I can to get along and go along. They sent me here  to try to make a difference. I guess I have a case of the ``can't help  its.''   I do what I can do, because I know my history, and I have suffered  the pain from a progeny of slavery.   Continuing with the text:         Whereas despite the horrors of slavery and against all       odds, enslaved people became thought leaders and       revolutionaries and changed the course of American history.    Too often they are forgotten, pushed aside.   Too often, the history that they made is stolen.   Too often the status quo will wait until they can find a proper  person to attribute the history to.   The status quo too often selects the persons that ought to be  celebrated in history, and too often those persons are not the persons  who suffered to bring the history to a better place.   The status quo has many ways to defend itself. The status quo can do  it with the power of appointment.   The status quo can do it by acknowledging people and ignoring others.   The status quo has many ways to defend itself.   I am reminded of the words of Voltaire. He reminds us that--and I am  paraphrasing--it is dangerous to be right in matters where the  established powers are wrong.   So the status quo defends itself, and the true history is not always  known. There will come a time, however, when the truth about some of  the history I am aware of will be made known.   Mr. Chairman, the House is not in order. Someone appears to be on the  phone in the House. I ask that we kindly investigate. This is a matter  of serious concern, and a person ought not be on the phone in the  House. It is contrary to the rules of the House. A person ought not do  this when a serious matter is being discussed on the floor of the House  of Representatives.   Doesn't matter who that person is, by the way. And if the person  doesn't stop, I will put the person's name in the Record, because I  know who it is. I am not going to suffer that kind of disrespect.         Resolved, this resolution may be cited as the ``Original       Slavery Remembrance Day Resolution of 2021.'' That is section       1 in the short title.        Section 2, Slavery Remembrance Day.        That the House of Representatives:        One, supports the designation of a ``Slavery Remembrance       Day'' to serve as a reminder of the evils of slavery.        Two, condemns slavery and its evil progenies; and       encourages all to acknowledge the importance of slavery       remembrance.    I am grateful to the Speaker for allowing the time. I am grateful to  the majority leader. I am grateful to the whip. I am grateful to all of  the chairs. I am grateful to the many persons who are cosponsors of  this resolution.   As I indicated, it was coming to me as I was moving to the floor, and  I have found a note from my staff. I am eternally grateful to my staff.   Seventy-seven cosponsors. These are the persons who are part of what  I believe to be a historic resolution.   Those who are not should not be condemned. We simply but only ask  that they would become cosponsors, and this can be accomplished quite  easily. Contact my office and let us know that you would like to be a  cosponsor. The love we have for you is not diminished one scintilla  because you are not an original; it is not. I am not that kind of guy.  I am interested in having persons of goodwill become a part of this  resolution. And there is much more that will be said and done as we  move forward with the resolution.   I thank all of the persons who are here today. I appreciate the fact  that  [[Page H3594]]  this House functions as efficaciously as it does.   I am going to remember who was standing with the gavel at hand. I am  going to remember the faces. This is a special moment in time. I will  remember those who were to speak after me.   I will remember this wonderful lady who is seated over to my left,  who has always been so kind and so generous and gentle.   I will remember the person who has prevented someone else from  talking on the phone and who doesn't allow it to happen in this House  when there is business before this House. She is evenhanded; she treats  all of us the same.   I will remember the Parliamentarian, who has allowed his COVID beard  to continue. That is just a joke, friends. I want to bring a bit of  levity. But the Parliamentarian has been very helpful, and all of those  who are associated with the office, have been very helpful.   I pray that on the August 20 or before, this resolution will receive  a vote in this House so that this House can go on record, as it has  gone on record for many other things, as supporting Slavery Remembrance  Day.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor now to yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
