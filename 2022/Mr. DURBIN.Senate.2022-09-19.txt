 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2\1/2\ years ago, a native of my home  State of Illinois and a veteran of the U.S. Navy, Mark Frerichs, was  abducted by the Taliban or one of its affiliates in Afghanistan.   He was working there as a contractor, and his disappearance was  devastating to his family back in Lombard, IL.   Senator Duckworth and I have spent countless hours and staff hours  working with his family trying to find out what happened to Mark. We  spoke to his sister Charlene and repeatedly raised his case with both  the Trump and Biden administrations. We wanted to let them know we  cared, and we joined the family on that course.   Well, today, the family's prayers have been answered. The news was  released that Mark is coming home. I want to commend President Biden,  Secretary of State Blinken, and their teams for never giving up on Mark  and ultimately securing his freedom.   His sister Charlene said upon news of her brother's release that  ``[w]e never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to  us.'' She was right. And Mark was so fortunate to have her as his  steadfast champion.    Welcome home, Mark Frerichs.                       Inflation Reduction Act of 2022    Madam President, I listened to the comments that were just made by  the Republican leader about events in Washington, the state of the  economy, and it was interesting, the perspective he took. He was  critical of President Biden for calling a meeting of several thousand  supporters last week on the White House lawn from all over the United  States to celebrate the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act here in  the U.S. Senate and House. You know and I know there wasn't a single  Republican vote in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act. Some 6 weeks  ago, we did some things that, frankly, many of us had been hoping for  for a long time without a single Republican vote supporting it.   The Senator from Kentucky wondered what we were celebrating. Well,  let me tell him a few of the things we are celebrating.   After years of candidates going out on the campaign trail and telling  America that the cost of prescription drugs were too high, we finally  did something about it--finally. After years of negotiating the price  for drugs in the Veterans' Administration so we could afford to give  our veterans the very best, we applied the same standard to Medicare.  What does it mean? It means that the most popular and most expensive  drugs that are sold through Medicare to recipients over the age of 65,  we are now going to negotiate the prices to come up with a reasonable  amount to charge taxpayers for those drugs.   Well, if you wondered whether or not the pharmaceutical industry can  handle that kind of truth, I might remind people what they already  know. Exactly the same drugs in the same boxes are for sale in Canada  at a fraction of the price that we pay in the United States. The same  thing is true in Europe. And we said, once and for all, we are going to  do something about it. I think that is something to celebrate.   Let me tell you something else that is part of it too. We said that,  from this point forward, when this bill takes effect, no recipient on  Medicare will ever pay more than $2,000 a year for prescription drugs-- upper limit, ceiling, 2,000 bucks. Do you know what these same people  were faced with when it came to cancer drugs and other therapies?  Thousands and thousands of dollars. And we brought it home to a level-- which I wish we could have done more, but it is very important as  well--and that is when it comes to diabetes. Millions of Americans  suffer from diabetes or someone in their family does, and we said that  if you are on Medicare, you won't have to pay more than $35 for a dose  of insulin--$35. That is a relief to a lot of people with diabetes in  their family. Some of those people couldn't afford insulin, couldn't  afford the doses they need, and they endangered their life in the  process.   In addition to all of that, we, in this bill, did, in fact, address  the Tax Code. The Senator from Kentucky said earlier that we raised  taxes. We did. Let me tell you who is going to pay more in taxes. If  you own a corporation that over the last 3 years has had a net profit,  an average net profit, of $1 billion a year--1 billion--I am not asking  for a show of hands--but if you had a net profit that averaged over $1  billion over the last 3 years, you have to pay a minimum corporate tax  of--get ready--15 percent. Fifteen percent.   Most Americans pay their taxes believing that is what the law  requires, and many believe, as I do, that is the price of admission in  America for a great nation. Fifteen percent--we would all welcome that  rate. There are very few people at that rate. But to say that a  corporation with a net profit on average of $1 billion a year over the  last 3 years finally has to pay taxes instead of escaping all tax  liability--  [[Page S4811]]  guilty as charged. The Senator from Kentucky is right. We did that. Do  you know the net result of it? The net result of it, it is going to  reduce the deficit this year by $1.3 trillion.   All this talk about the big spenders in Congress, the bill we put  together for inflation reduction zeroed in on those two issues: capping  the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare and making certain that  corporations, profitable corporations, pay their fair share of taxes  just like every American family. Those two elements were not mentioned  by the Senator from Kentucky. It is understandable. But what I want to  make clear is, we didn't have a single Republican vote in support of  what I have just given you.   There is an additional section there that is controversial, but I  feel strongly about it. I think we are facing in this world today  obvious evidence of extreme weather and changes that should alarm us.  Yes, it is climate change. It is global warming. And what we did in  this bill was to create incentives for American families and  corporations to start taking steps toward responsible conduct. It is  coming. It wasn't a Federal mandate that required all the car companies  to build electric vehicles. They see the writing on the wall. They  realize we have to change the way that we energize transportation in  America, and they want to be in front of the parade, not behind it. So  do we. That was part of this bill as well. I support it. Not a single  Republican voted for it. That is the reality.    Incidentally, inflation is a burden on American families and  individuals. There is no doubt about it, and I am not going to  sugarcoat it. We have seen some progress. For example, the price of  gasoline stares us right in the face every time we drive right down the  road. Well, I did some driving over the weekend, probably put 600 to  700 miles on the car in Illinois, driving around to various events, and  I kept an eye out for the cost of gasoline. I don't know what it is in  Hawaii or in any home State, but I will tell you that in Missouri,  gasoline was selling for $3.13 a gallon; in Illinois, closer to $3.50 a  gallon. High? Yes. But not $5, which we faced just a few months ago. We  have made some progress, and we need to continue to focus on reducing  the cost of goods for families that they face every week. That is part  of our mission as well.    I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin),  the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock), and the Senator from Oregon  (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.
