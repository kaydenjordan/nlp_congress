 Mr. Speaker, I rise as leader of the  Republicans on the Education and Labor Committee, which had a referral  on H.R. 1 that did not even have a hearing, much less a markup on the  provisions that fall within our jurisdiction.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, a referral means a bill should be debated  by a committee of jurisdiction, but that did not happen.   It appears that every corner of American life would be touched by  this overreaching, politically-motivated bill. Even colleges and  universities did not manage to escape its reach.   We fully recognize the opportunity colleges and universities can  provide for traditional 18- to 24-year-old students to register to  vote. That is why we have always been supportive of voter registration  efforts on campuses. But mandating voter registration efforts on campus  doesn't show good intentions for student engagement.   Instead, it reveals the true motive behind this unnecessary tinkering  with the Higher Education Act. Colleges and universities have not, do  not, and must not ever exist to serve the Federal Government.   The provisions in H.R. 1 take institutions of higher learning and put  them in the same category as your local DMV. It is bad enough that  colleges and universities barely resemble the free marketplace of ideas  they once were. This bill turns them into full-fledged government  offices, with all of the customer service and freedom of thought for  which government offices are known.   The reasons to oppose H.R. 1 are many, but we could not allow the  provisions that impact educational institutions to go unnoticed as  House Democrats clearly hoped.   H.R. 1 is one of the most cynical political stunts we have seen and,  for that reason, Mr. Speaker, we should oppose it and oppose it with  all our might.                            ____________________
