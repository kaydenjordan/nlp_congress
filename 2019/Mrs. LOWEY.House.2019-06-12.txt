 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H4453]]  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 2740.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, today, we bring four bills to the floor that reject the  slash-and-burn approach of the Trump administration and, instead, chart  a new course: one that increases investments in American families to  make up for lost ground; one that gives every person a better chance at  a better life.   With these bills, we are investing for the people. We invest in  education and in the health of the American people, in infrastructure,  and in the environment, in our national security and in the needs of  servicemembers and military families.   And let me just say--because, frankly, the administration's misuse of  government funds should concern both parties--this bill includes  necessary oversight provisions to prohibit the administration from  misappropriating funds, including for a border wall.   This hallowed institution must not be a rubber stamp for Presidential  pet projects.   As chair of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations  Subcommittee, I am proud of the fiscal year 2020 State and Foreign  Operations division, which reflects congressional priorities that  advance United States foreign policy.                                time  1430    The allocation of $56.381 billion, a 3.9 increase above fiscal year  2019, is critical to support important investments in our national  security, fund our international commitments, and repair America's  reputation abroad.   This bill rejects the administration's unacceptable budget request  and irresponsible policies and, rather, strives to uphold many  bipartisan congressional priorities.   America's foreign policy is strongest when diplomacy, development,  and defense are well-funded and equally prioritized, as many of today's  global challenges cannot be addressed by military intervention alone.   I want to quickly highlight some of the key provisions in this  division.   Unlike the administration's fiscal year 2020 request, this bill would  ensure ample funding for humanitarian assistance, multilateral  organizations, basic education, and reproductive health services.   It would also permanently repeal the antiwoman global gag rule and  prevent prior funds from implementing this destructive policy.   To restore U.S. leadership on fighting climate change, the bill would  replace the prohibition on the Green Climate Fund with permissive  authority and prohibit the use of funds to withdraw from the Paris  climate agreement.   It would provide robust funding to our key allies while protecting  our investments in the Northern Triangle. Members on both sides of the  aisle know these efforts save lives, promote goodwill, and support  American interests abroad. This bill would support these programs and  restore American leadership in the world.   Our talented Appropriations Subcommittee chairs will tell us more  about what the other parts of this package do for the people.   In totality, this legislation truly is a product of hard work and  bipartisan cooperation, with input from Members on both sides of the  aisle, that meets the diverse needs of our Nation.   Hubert Humphrey once said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those in the       shadows of life.    This has been our goal. If we pass this bill, it can be our  achievement.   So as we consider this bill, let's do so in good faith. Let's pass  this bill for the good of the American people.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the distinguished chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Energy and Water.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Chair, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the chairman of the Defense  Subcommittee.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the chair of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Before I close, I would like to thank the staff for their tireless  work, particularly Steve Marchese, Craig Higgins, Erin Kolodjeski, Dean  Koulouris, Jason Wheelock, Jean Kwon, Marin Stein, Clelia Alvarado, Liz  Leibowitz, and Wendy Coursen. And all those whom I didn't include, I  thank all the other staff who have been so really remarkable in this  very important work.   With this bill, we have forged a vision that stands in stark contrast  to the reckless austerity of recent years and the bleak view presented  in the administration's budget request. This is a bill for the people.  It will strengthen communities, improve lives, and help repair our  standing in the world, and I urge support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pallone), my good friend and the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Chair, I thank my good friend, Mr. Pallone, for  bringing this issue to our attention and for his longstanding efforts  to bring this conflict to an end.   Madam Chair, we can all agree on the need to bring the 30-year  Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to a peaceful resolution, as we can all agree  upon the need to maintain the United States' role as a neutral, third- party arbiter and for the United States to maintain positive diplomatic  relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan.   I thank the gentleman for bringing this matter to our attention, and  I and my staff look forward to working with Mr. Pallone and his staff  on this important issue.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mr. Buchanan
