 Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  confirmation of Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. We should not be  holding this vote.   We are in the eleventh hour of a Presidential election, and 56  million Americans have already voted. The American people are sending a  message, and we ought to hear what they have to say.   Instead, what is happening in the Senate is an obscene power grab by  my Republican colleagues to bypass democracy and force the least  popular and most extreme views of their party onto the American people  with no regard for the life-and-death consequences of their actions.   So, my friends in the majority, you had a decade to create an  alternative to the Affordable Care Act. You still have no viable plan.  And after failing to repeal it in 2017 and suffering an unprecedented  electoral rebuke in 2018, you are relying on the Supreme Court to do  your dirty work.   Oral arguments in California v. Texas, the legal challenge brought by  Republican-led States with the Trump administration's support are on  the Court's docket November 10. We know full well that a 6-to-3  conservative majority of the Supreme Court is likely to overturn it or  maybe just gut the ACA so deeply it will effectively be dead, as if  that is somehow any better.   At least 20 million people are at risk of losing their healthcare  coverage, and 135 million may lose protections for preexisting  conditions. The fact that you are even willing to roll the dice with  their healthcare in the middle of a global pandemic that has already  affected more than 8 million Americans and killed over 224,000 of your  countrymen is reckless and cruel. Don't you see you are playing with  fire? And you don't seem to care that hundreds of millions of  Americans, Americans you represent, are going to get burned. It is not  as if you aren't hearing from people in your States who fear a future  without access to healthcare; it is that you are not listening.   Yesterday, I spent some time with New Jerseyans for whom the  Affordable Care Act--in their words, not mine--is a matter of life or  death. For several of them, going without quality healthcare coverage  is, in their words, a death sentence.   I wonder how many of you would have the courage to listen to their  stories, look them in the eye, and tell them you have no plan to  protect their care. I suspect not many. So I am going to share just a  few of their stories.   Stephanie Vigario is a 31-year-old essential worker, a pharmacy  technician from Newark, NJ, who caught COVID-19. She spent 2 months--2  months--fighting for her life in a hospital, including 35 days on a  ventilator. By the grace of God, she survived, but her life may never  be the same. Even after all the intensive rehabilitation she went  through, she is still working on her recovery.   There are hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 survivors like her  grappling with the long-term health consequences of a disease we don't  yet fully understand--organ tissue damage, weakness and fatigue,  chronic shortness of breath. These Americans now have a preexisting  condition. Without the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies  could once again begin pricing them out of coverage or denying it  altogether.   I also had the privilege of speaking with Scott Chesney of Verona,  NJ. Scott is a married father of two who at the tender age of 15 was  paralyzed from the waist down. He faces a lifetime of expensive medical  needs. To quote him:         Aging with a disability--a preexisting condition--is tough.       Your body breaks down. Thankfully, my wife has health       insurance because if I don't get the medications and therapy       I need, I don't live.    But without the Affordable Care Act, Scott will likely face annual  caps and lifetime limits on his healthcare. Paying out of pocket for  his care would likely lead to medical bankruptcy, and that burden  weighs heavily on him every day as he thinks of his wife and children's  future, as well as his own.   Finally, I want to share the story of Daria Caldwell of Flemington,  NJ, because her situation really speaks to the challenges that so many  of our constituents across the Nation are going through right now.  Daria lost her job and her health insurance as a result of the economic  fallout of this pandemic, and this happened at the very time she was  diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a treatable but incurable type of  blood cancer.   Daria is 62 years old. She is not old enough to enroll in Medicare.  She is paying for COBRA right now, but it will soon run out, and she  will need to find new coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, someone  like Daria, with expensive preexisting conditions, would basically be  blacklisted from the individual health insurance market. An insurer  would take one look at her medical history, and the fact that some of  her cancer drugs, like Revlimid, cost hundreds of thousands dollars a  month, and they would simply turn her away.   She said:         Dissolving the ACA would cost me my life.    She says:         That sounds dramatic because it is. I don't want to die,       but I feel like a price tag has been put on my head and the       constant threat is beyond anything I thought I would ever       have to endure. It's nearly as devastating as the diagnosis       itself.    Now, I am not telling this body these stories just to pull at your  heartstrings, though, believe me, listening to these men and women as I  did yesterday moved me beyond tears. I am sharing their stories, their  incredibly personal struggles, to remind my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle that to the American people this is not ideological. This is  not abstract. It is personal. These are matters of life and death.    Of course, the Affordable Care Act isn't the only issue at stake  here. The very reason we are here considering a Supreme Court nominee  in the final days of a Presidential election is, I believe, because my  Republican colleagues fear the will of the American people.   The number of Americans who support the most far-right positions of  the Republican Party is shrinking, and so stacking the Supreme Court is  their only path to advancing their unpopular agenda, and they know it.   They know that most Americans--nearly 80 percent according to the  last decade of Gallup polling--oppose criminalizing abortion. The  overwhelming majority believe in the right of a woman to decide when  she has children, and they know it is none of the government's damn  business.   They know that most Americans support action on climate change and  limits on how much poisonous pollutants companies can pump into the  air.  [[Page S6491]]    They know that most Americans, including responsible gun owners,  support lifesaving background checks and tougher gun safety laws.   And they know that most Americans believe that their LGBTQ sons and  daughters and friends and neighbors should be able to marry the people  they love and live their lives free of discrimination.   My colleagues seem to have forgotten that as elected representatives  of the American people, they are supposed to reflect the will of the  American people. And guess what. The will of the people changes. This  isn't the 1950s anymore.   But rather than adjust your sails to the winds of change, rather than  meet the American people where they are on issues of life and death,  you would instead prefer to sink the whole ship.   Those of my colleagues who know me know that I try to see the best of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I really do. I pride  myself on my working relationships with so many of you, and some of  you, I even consider dear friends. But I was stunned--just stunned--by  the hypocrisy. Where are your principles?   When you blocked Merrick Garland's nomination, you didn't say it was  because President Obama was a Democrat and the Senate was held by  Republicans. You said very clearly at the time it was because a Supreme  Court vacancy should not--not--be filled during a Presidential election  year. You said the American people should have a voice. Now, it is  clear you didn't even believe the words you were saying at that time.   You were determined to deprive a democratically elected two-term  President of his constitutional prerogative in order to fundamentally  alter the makeup of the Supreme Court. You did it in order to tip the  scales of justice against women, workers, voters, LGBTQ Americans,  patients, consumers, and immigrants for generations to come.   Judge Barrett is the culmination of a 30-year fever dreamed up and  cooked up by the Federalist Society and its corporate benefit factors.  They will finally have enough Justices to do their bidding, and the  American people are the ones who will have to deal with the real-world  consequences of this shameless hypocrisy.   We have to remember what this is all about. This is about the right  of an LGBTQ American to be by the bedside of their loved one as they  take their last breath. This is about the ability of a rape or incest  survivor to terminate an unwanted pregnancy without government  intrusion. This is about the ability of a cancer patient to afford her  treatment and a baby with a heart defect to get treated without a  lifetime limit within weeks of being born.   So I am urging you--no, I am pleading with you--to think long and  hard about the consequences of your actions for both the American  future and for the future comity of this body. You have twisted and  distorted every rule and broken every norm to get your way just because  you currently have the power to do so. That does not make it right.   You are poisoning the well of the Senate and flooding our Nation with  bad blood, and you have revealed yourselves to be so fearful of the  democratic will of the American people that you will confirm a Justice  to the Supreme Court whose views are far outside the mainstream just  days before the conclusion of the Presidential election.   I urge you not to go through with this vote. This is a craven abuse  of power that will ultimately inflict great harm on the American  people. History--history--is not going to forget it. And I think  someday--probably sooner than you think--you are likely to regret it.   With that, I yield the floor.
