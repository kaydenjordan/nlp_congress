 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New Ulm  Medical Center for being named the number one critical access hospital  in the United States for 2019. This medical center, part of Allina  Health, serves more than 13,000 New Ulm residents and countless more  folks in southern Minnesota.   The New Ulm Medical Center has found positive ways to improve  affordability and increase successful patient outcomes. Even when faced  with serious health challenges, patients can thrive when they have  access to affordable and conveniently located healthcare.   All Americans deserve access to quality, timely medical care. I am  very pleased that residents in New Ulm, Brown County, and surrounding  areas in southern Minnesota have such a fine institution of medicine to  provide them.   Congratulations to New Ulm Medical Center, and thank you for serving  our community.                            ____________________
