 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for fiscal  responsibility as Congress seeks to craft a budget.   This past year, our Nation has spent more than $7.6 trillion. That is  more than the Federal Government spent in the first 200 years since our  founding. With the Federal Government's debt already clocking in at $28  trillion and rising as I speak, we must face the reality that our  grandchildren are going to foot this bill.   On May 12, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that inflation  had grown by 4.2 percent over the last year. That is the largest 12- month increase since September 2008. Should we continue to spend at the  rate that we are spending, our national debt, debt servicing, and costs  for household items will continue to skyrocket, making life  unaffordable for millions more.   This is not right. It is immoral for us to continue to fulfill the  wants and needs of our generation by stealing opportunity from the  next. We must do the hard work of meeting our country's needs  responsibly.   The Republican Study Committee has proposed such a budget, a  conservative budget, one that provides a roadmap toward a better future  for our country. This budget gets us back on track in just 5 years  while eliminating the deficit and cutting taxes. This is a conservative  budget, one that aims to strengthen our Nation and provide better  governance.   I am pleased to report that the RSC budget includes four of my  legislative proposals, including my bill to require the Congressional  Budget Office to include the cost of debt servicing when preparing cost  estimates for proposed legislation. Before legislation passes either  the House or Senate, lawmakers should know how much it is going to  cost, yet Congress routinely ignores the true cost and overstates the  benefits of new spending.   The American people have to account for the cost of debt servicing in  their  [[Page H2429]]  family budgets, and providing Congress with accurate cost estimates  that include the cost of debt servicing is commonsense reform that  would hold Congress to the same standard, forcing lawmakers to reckon  with the actual cost of raising our national debt.   Additionally, this budget is pro-life. It includes my bill, the  Women's Public Health and Safety Act, which would help prevent taxpayer  dollars from funding abortion providers. This legislation will empower  States to end the bankrolling of abortion providers and free up funding  for healthcare initiatives for those providers that actually put the  well-being of women and babies first.   This budget is pro-Second Amendment. It includes my legislation to  prohibit a natural disaster declaration from being used to impose gun  or ammo controls.   Finally, this bill is fiscally responsible. It includes my  legislation for a Federal sunset commission to monitor the  effectiveness of government agencies and prevent wasteful  inefficiencies and duplicative programming.   I want to thank the RSC Budget Task Force chairman, Congressman Hern,  and the chairman of the RSC, Congressman Banks, for putting forth a  bold budget.   We can get our Nation back on track. We just need to put in the time  to do what we have to do here in Washington.                            ____________________
