 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about important  legislation I am introducing today. It is called the Cell Phone Jamming  Reform Act. Senator Tom Cotton is introducing the companion bill in the  Senate.   All around the Nation, one of the most important issues that I hear  about is the rapid rise in crime, especially violent crime.   According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association Crime Report for  2022 for urban areas, homicide is up 13 percent, rape is up 23 percent,  aggravated assault is up 33 percent--all since 2020.   Every one of us knows that this is unacceptable and everyone should  feel safe being in their community. In the House Republicans'  Commitment to America, we promised that the new Republican majority  will work toward creating a Nation that is safe. A key pillar of that  promise is alleviating this current crime crisis.   The Cell Phone Jamming Reform Act is a crucial first step in our  effort to reduce crime and enhance public safety. This legislation will  prevent criminals from conducting criminal operations from behind bars  by allowing State and Federal prison officials to use cell phone  jamming systems.   The technology will protect inmates, it will protect guards, and it  will protect the public at large.   State attorneys general from across the country have determined that  cell phones from within prisons, these contraband cell phones, are  among the most serious threat to public safety facing prison  administrators today.   Now, as cell phone technology has evolved, and it continues to  evolve, mobile phones are easier to conceal than ever. They provide  countless ways for criminals to communicate with the outside world.   Inmates use contraband cell phones to organize murders, riots, drug  operations, fraud, extortion, and other crimes. I want to give you just  a few examples.   In Tennessee, an inmate used a contraband cell phone to orchestrate  drug conspiracy deals by shipping a package full of methamphetamine to  his girlfriend from within the prison. In South Carolina, there have  been four major drug trafficking cases where the operation was run by  contraband cell phones from behind prison walls. In 2018, gang- affiliated inmates in a maximum security prison used cell phones to  organize and coordinate a brutal attack that killed 7 inmates and  injured 20.   All Americans have the right to feel safe in their communities, to  walk their kids around the block without the fear of assault, to park  their car without the fear it will be broken into, or maybe taken  completely.   One of the most fundamental duties of government is to ensure that  its citizens have the right and the ability to live, to work, and to  raise a family without the fear of being a victim of crime.   The Cell Phone Jamming Reform Act is a key step toward reducing  crime, enhancing public safety, and, ultimately, to fulfilling our goal  to create a Nation that is safe.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.                            ____________________
