 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 99, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) disapproving the rule  submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of  unemployment compensation applicants, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 42,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Next Wednesday, February 22, will mark 5 years since the Middle Class  Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was signed into law. This 2012 law has  made important reforms in the unemployment insurance system,  improvements that were specifically designed to help more out-of-work  Americans successfully return to the workforce.                                time  1330    This included a key provision which overturned a 1960s-era ban by the  Department of Labor on drug screening and testing of unemployment  insurance applicants.   Unemployment insurance serves those that have lost their jobs through  no fault of their own. It seeks to promote swift reemployment through  several key requirements. Namely, to be eligible for unemployment  insurance benefits, applicants must be able to work, available to work,  and actively seeking work. So if a worker loses his or her job due to  drug use, that worker is not truly able to work. In addition, if a  worker cannot take a new job because they can't pass a mandatory drug  test from their employer, this worker is not truly available to work  either.   In recognition of this issue, the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and  Job Creation Act allowed but did not require States to drug screen and  test certain unemployment applicants, specifically those seeking a job  or an occupation that regularly required new employees to pass a drug  test. I was proud to lead this effort in 2012 because I knew it would  have a meaningful impact on the lives of many Americans struggling with  drug use.   The goal is simple: get the incentives right in unemployment  insurance so that Americans can confront and overcome these challenges.   With a growing number of employers now requiring drug tests for new  workers, we wanted to empower these out-  [[Page H1201]]  of-work Americans to be ready to pass that drug test, take that new  job, and get back on the path to earning their own success.   My home State of Texas was one of the first to step up when this  provision was established by the 2012 law. They even changed their own  laws to get ready. But before this provision could be implemented by  States, the law required the Department of Labor to issue a regulation  defining those occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. The  intent was to match real-world expectations from employers.   In a 2012 hearing of the Committee on Ways and Means' Human Resources  Subcommittee, an official from the Department of Labor assured us the  rule could be drafted quickly and according to congressional intent.  Well, despite those assurances, months went by with no action from the  Obama administration.   During that time, the Ways and Means Committee held another hearing  on this issue and even sent a letter to the Department of Labor in  anticipation of the regulation. We urged them to craft the rule  broadly, which was consistent with what we were hearing from  businesses.   In October of 2014, more than 2 years after the law was passed, the  Department issued its proposed rule. Counter to our recommendations,  the draft rule was incredibly narrow. So narrow, in fact, that States  like Texas would be severely limited in their ability to successfully  implement an unemployment insurance drug testing program.   Again, the Ways and Means Committee made our concerns known to the  Obama administration by submitting a public comment on the draft rule,  calling for significant revisions. We made clear that the proposed rule  did not faithfully adhere to the intent of Congress, and these same  concerns were also echoed in other public comments from prominent  stakeholders.   Two more years went by. Meanwhile, Congress continued to press the  administration to revise the rule so it followed the intent of the  bipartisan law.   That brings us to August of last year, when, at long last, the  Department of Labor published its final rule. And just like the  proposed rule 2 years earlier, it ignored the intent of Congress. It  disregarded most of the comments and the concerns of stakeholders.  Above all, the final rule directly undermined the ability of States to  implement this important bipartisan reform that would help unemployed  workers in their quest to find a good-paying new job.   So on his way out of office, former President Obama flat out refused  to implement the law he signed in 2012. Instead, he directed the  Department of Labor to issue a regulation that effectively blocks  States from taking action.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick of Washington not keeping  its promises. They are sick of unaccountable Federal bureaucrats  abusing their authority to undercut the will of Congress and the  American people. And this eleventh-hour regulation by the Obama  Department of Labor is a prime example of just that.   The debate we are having today is not about the merits of drug  testing unemployment insurance applicants. That is now for the States  to decide because, in 2012, Congress passed a law providing them--not  the Federal Government--with the ability to do so.   This debate is about placing a check and balance on blatant executive  overreach that all but prohibits States from moving forward with this  reform. More importantly, it is about ensuring that the will and the  intent of this body is upheld.   In closing, I thank the House for its consideration of H.J. Res. 42.  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Smith) be permitted to control the remainder of my time.
