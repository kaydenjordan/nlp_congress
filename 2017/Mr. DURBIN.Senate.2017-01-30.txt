On this vote, the yeas are 56,  the nays are 43.   The motion is agreed to.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, this is the 11th day of the Trump  Presidency. To say that these have been tumultuous days is certainly an  understatement. What happened over this past weekend really was  unsettling to many people all across the United States.   Candidate Trump made it clear that he had strong feelings about  refugees and strong feelings about immigration, but I don't think  anyone anticipated the Executive orders that were issued by the Trump  administration, by the President, on Friday. The net result of that we  saw across the United States at O'Hare International Airport, JFK,  Dulles, many other airports. International travelers, en route, learned  that the laws of the United States were being changed because of  President Trump's Executive order. As a result, there was a lot of  confusion and uncertainty, and hardships were created. Individuals who  were coming to the United States as refugees were being turned away.   For the record, this decision to indefinitely suspend the admission  of Syrian refugees into the United States is not a decision based on  fact. Since 9/11, since the war in Syria began, we have not had a  single--not one--instance of terrorism by a Syrian refugee--not one.  The United States has not stepped up as other countries like Canada  have in admitting Syrian refugees. We have gone to great lengths,  extraordinary lengths, to give background checks that are as consuming  as one can imagine, to verify their identity and their safety to the  United States.   Overwhelmingly, these Syrian refugees are the victims of a deadly war  which has gone on for years, and overwhelmingly they are children with  their mothers. I have met them. I sat down with them in Chicago. It is  heartbreaking to think that they have lived through war, may have been  lucky enough to make it to a refugee camp, and then waited for years-- for years--to be cleared by the United States and be given a chance to  come to this country.   It has to be a heartbreaking process. Through it all, many of them  have endured losses in their families that they will never be able to  forget--injuries and deaths of people whom they love. These are men and  women in Syria escaping a deadly war and the terrorists who have  ravaged that country. They have tried to come to the United States for  safety and security.   The history of refugees in America is one that in modern version is  very admirable, but unfortunately before--during World War II--it was a  sad chapter in our history. Not only did we inter about 120,000  Japanese Americans in camps during the war for fear that they would  betray the United States, but during that war, time and again, the  administration of President Roosevelt as well as Congress refused to  allow those who were escaping the Holocaust in Nazi Germany to come to  the United States.   Here on this Senate floor where I stand, an effort was made by  Senator Robert Wagner of New York to admit 10,000 Jewish children out  of Nazi Germany into the United States so that their parents would have  the peace of mind that they would not be killed by the war or the  Holocaust. That measure was defeated on the floor of this Senate. Prior  to our entry into the war, those who tried to escape Nazi Germany and  come to the United States were turned away by the United States.  [[Page S470]]    The most notorious example was the SS St. Louis, which sailed from  Germany, came to, first, Havana, Cuba, then to Miami, FL, and was  turned away in both places with about 900 passengers who feared for  their lives because of the anti-Semitism and the killing that was  taking place in Nazi Germany.   They tracked that passenger list. Several hundred of them were  rejected by the United States. They were not given refugee status. They  were forced to return to Germany. Several hundred of them perished in  the Holocaust.   It was after that bitter experience that the United States decided to  try to set an example for the world when it came to compassion and  humanity for refugees. We stepped up time and again to be that place of  security and safety. We can point proudly to the fact that when the  Cubans were fearful of a Communist takeover in their country, fearful  for their lives and their rights and their liberties, they came to the  United States in tens of thousands.   Now Cuban Americans, a proud part of our country not only in Florida  but around our Nation, can point to the U.S. refugee policy as the  means by which they finally made it to the safety of the United States.  Here we were in a Cold War with the Soviet Union; Cuba, 90 miles off  our shore was being taken over by a dictator, Fidel Castro, who was  declaring his loyalty to the Soviet Union. Yet we were readily  receiving tens of thousands of refugees from Cuba in the midst of that  Cold War. Talk about a chance--and taking a chance. Those men and women  who came to the United States were not vetted for months, years, and in  many cases not at all. They were allowed into our country. Thank  goodness we did it. It was the right thing to do.   Time and again, whether it was refugees coming in from Vietnam after  the end of that deadly war or whether it was Soviet Jews, persecuted by  the Soviet Union, trying to escape, coming to the United States, we  opened our doors and said: The United States of America will set an  example for the world when it comes to refugees. That defined who we  were and who we still should be.   Now this new President is ready to walk away from that. If we had one  instance of a Syrian refugee coming into the United States after that  vetting process who caused harm to our citizens or engaged in an act of  terrorism--if we had one--then perhaps this President could start to  make his case.   All he has is fear, unreasoned fear, unproven fear. We recall what  Franklin Roosevelt said to this Nation, standing right out here on the  steps when he was inaugurated in March of 1933: We have nothing to fear  but fear itself. It is fear itself that is motivating this President to  make decisions inconsistent with more than 50 years of American history  and inconsistent with American values.   When you meet these refugees and you hear their heartbreaking  stories, how can you say that there is no room for you in this country?  Yet that is exactly what he said.   Sadly, he not only came up with this Executive order, he did it in a  fashion where the agencies that were supposed to implement the order  really were caught by surprise. Now they are priding themselves on the  fact that they can turn on a dime when given instructions that are  important for national security. But in this case, where national  security was not the motive--political security was the motive; I am  talking in the crassest terms. In those cases, these agencies were  forced to make split-second decisions, and some of them were horrible.   A man who came to the United States from Iraq, from one of the seven  countries designated by President Trump, came from Iraq after having  risked his life for American soldiers. He was rewarded with an  opportunity to come to the United States, was detained at the airport,  questioned at length, threatened to be returned to Iraq, and finally-- after 19 hours--allowed to stay.   There is story after story of families coming to see someone who was  on the deathbed, their last chance to be together, and families who had  gone overseas for what they thought were just casual or really easy  trips who were subject to detention and some turned away. Why? It  certainly was not in the interest of the security of the United States,  and it was not handled in a professional manner. It was impulsive and  not decisive. It was ill conceived instead of wise.   Here we are today. As I stand here at this chair and this desk in the  Senate, across the street thousands have gathered in front of the  Supreme Court to express their outrage over the Executive orders issued  by President Trump. I am happy to report that almost one dozen  Republican Senators have joined us in expressing reservations about  this policy.   It gives me hope that maybe on a bipartisan basis we can rein in some  of the excesses of this administration. God forbid we ignore the basic  constitutional issue that has been raised by these Executive orders. It  is no coincidence that these seven countries are predominately Muslim  countries. It is no coincidence that President Trump went on a  Christian broadcasting station and said preference would be given to  Christians.   The Constitution which we are sworn to uphold and defend, the  Constitution which guides this Nation is one that was written at a time  when religion was a divisive issue that led to people coming to the  United States.   I think in this section, our Founding Fathers probably showed more  wisdom and more understanding of our future than any other on the issue  of religion. They only said three things in the entire Constitution,  three things over 200 years ago. They said that this Congress, this  government, will not establish an official religion. They did that, of  course, many of them having come from England, where they had a  national church. They didn't want that in the United States. Most  importantly, they said each person in America had freedom of religious  belief, to believe what they wished or to believe nothing if they  wished, and that would be an honored freedom under our Bill of Rights.  The third element: Religion could not be used as a litmus test for  public office. That is it.   When you think of all the wars and all the deaths and all the  persecution based on religion, the fact that we have largely escaped it  is because of the wisdom of that document.   Now comes this 45th President of the United States who decides to  rewrite the book, to ignore this basic constitutional direction and  mandate, and to say on the Christian Broadcasting Network: We are going  to favor Christian refugees coming to the United States. That, to me,  is unacceptable and unconstitutional, and inconsistent with who we are,  what we are, and the values we treasure in this country.   My mother was an immigrant to this country. I never knew my  grandmother, who brought her over on the ship from Lithuania. I do have  one thing now in my office upstairs that my grandmother carried with  her to this country. It is a prayer book. We are a Roman Catholic  family. She was a Roman Catholic in Lithuania. The Russian Orthodox  religion was being pushed by the czar, who was dominant when they left  Lithuania, and they banned Catholic prayer books written in Lithuania.   I never knew my grandmother. I wish I had. She risked everything to  bring that Catholic prayer book, that contraband from czarist- controlled Lithuania into the United States. I have it upstairs. It  means the world to me that this woman with limited formal education but  unlimited courage was willing to risk a lot, bringing three small  children into this country, carrying with her that prayer book which  might have gotten her imprisoned in Lithuania back in her day. So  religion means a lot to our family, not just on a personal basis but  what America means when it comes to religion.   When this President is so casual with the constitutional guarantees  of religion, I don't believe he is serving the United States or  honoring the history that came before him.   There have been so many issues that have come up during the 11 days  of his Presidency, but President Trump's decision to turn away innocent  people fleeing persecution, genocide, and terror and to ban immigrants  on the basis of religion is the worst, in my view. This attack is not  only un-American, it risks alienating 1 billion Muslims around the  world. Some of the most conservative people in this country--I am  certain Republicans--have said over and over again: Don't do this.  There are Muslim countries that are  [[Page S471]]  allies in fighting terrorism, and if you alienate them, it is going to  lessen our ability to stop the spread of Al Qaeda and ISIS.   Furthermore, this is a recruiting tool. You know what is going to  happen. Those who hate the United States are going to use this action  by President Trump to verify their belief and their credo that the  United States is anti-Muslim.   There was a Republican President, George W. Bush, whom I disagreed  with many times, but thank goodness, after 9/11, he had the wisdom and  showed the leadership to come before the American people to say: We are  not going to condemn the Muslim religion. We are going to go after  those who corrupted it, but we are going to honor it as a religion of  peace.   How different President George W. Bush, that Republican President,  was to President Donald Trump, this Republican President.   Senator Dianne Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the Senate  Judiciary Committee. She has introduced a resolution, on which I am  proud to be one of the original cosponsors, to repeal and rescind these  reprehensible President Donald Trump Executive orders on refugees and  immigration.   We are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis in the history of the  world. More than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced from  their homes. The brutal Syrian conflict, which is the epicenter of this  humanitarian crisis, has killed hundreds of thousands, injured more  than a million, and displaced half of the population of that country.  In some areas, children literally starve to death in Syria. This  conflict has forced more than 4.7 million refugees to flee. Around 70  percent of them are women and children who are looking for a safe place  in this world. Half of Syrian children today are not in school because  of this conflict and because of the forces that have dispersed them  around the world. Millions in and outside of Syria need humanitarian  assistance.   Last week--the same week President Trump signed this awful Executive  order on refugees--the United Nations issued an appeal for $4.6 billion  to meet the basic needs of Syrian refugees and struggling communities  hosting them in neighboring countries.   Lebanon is a country where I believe half of the children in school  today are Syrian. Jordan, one of our best friends and allies in the  Middle East, has made more sacrifices on behalf of refugees per capita  than any nation on Earth. What message does it send to our friends in  Jordan that while they risk the security and safety and stability of  their nation to absorb these refugees from Syria and around the world,  that as an official policy of President Donald Trump, the United States  no longer will even consider allowing a Syrian refugee to come to the  United States? How can we in good conscience ask the King of Jordan to  risk his monarchy and his country for refugees when President Trump  says they are not allowed in the United States?   Earlier this month, I am happy to report, more than 1,700 Jewish  rabbis called on our government to maintain and strengthen the refugee  program for refugees of all ethnic and religious backgrounds--not to  halt it, pause it, or restrict it. This weekend, I was so proud of the  Catholic cardinal in Chicago, Blase Cupich, who came out and said the  Executive orders of Donald Trump are not consistent with American  values and certainly are not consistent with the beliefs of the  Catholic Church. Religious leaders all across the country are speaking  out. They understand that this is more than a political test; this is a  moral test of who we are as Americans.   Many of the refugees who came to this country were fleeing regimes  that were hostile to the United States. We gave them safety.    Refugees are the most carefully vetted and investigated of all  travelers. Before refugees are admitted into the United States, they go  through security screening that is almost unheard of. All of that  screening takes place before they can even consider being allowed to  set foot in America, and Syrian refugees go through an even stricter  review. Extreme vetting? I have news for this President: Syrian  refugees and refugees all over the world are already going through  extreme vetting.   Shutting down the Refugee Resettlement Program won't protect our  security. It plays into ISIS's argument that the United States is  waging a war against Islam.   Listen to what Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA and  National Security Agency under Presidents Bush and Obama, said about  President Trump's Executive order:         It's a horrible move. It is a political, ideological move       driven by the language of the campaign and, frankly, campaign       promises--promises in the campaign that were hyped by an       exaggeration of the threat. And in fact, what we're doing now       has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday       morning before this happened because we are now living the       worst jihadist narrative possible, that there is undying       enmity between Islam and the West. Muslims out there who were       not part of the jihadist movement are now being shown that       the story they were being told by the jihadists--they hate       us; they're our enemy--that's being acted out by the American       government. And frankly, at a humanitarian level, it's an       abomination.    That statement was not made by the Democratic National Committee; it  was made by Gen. Michael Hayden, former Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency under Presidents  Bush and Obama.   If we are serious about protecting America, we should be serious  about closing the real loopholes that might threaten us. Think of the  hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors to the United States under  the Visa Waiver Program who go through no vetting, not even  fingerprinting, before they get on a plane to come to the United  States. Want to close a loophole in security? Let's look at that one  seriously.   Instead of real security threats, President Trump is focusing on  innocent people--children, women, families who are fleeing terrorism.   Today's refugees, like millions before them from all over the world,  will become proud Americans who contribute greatly to our society and  economy.   Albert Einstein was a refugee. Thank goodness he came to the United  States. Today, so many of the leaders of our major corporations and  high-tech companies are immigrants to this country and, in some cases,  refugees.   Building walls on our borders and fear in our hearts will not move  America forward. Let's not continue the cruelty or deception of blaming  immigrants and refugees for our security and economic challenges. Let's  work together to build a better America for all Americans, including  new Americans, no matter the color of their skin, where their parents  were born, or how they pray.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
