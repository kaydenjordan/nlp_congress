 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes, and I rise in  support of providing critical emergency relief to respond to the  catastrophic damages wreaked by Hurricane Harvey and the expectation of  damages from Hurricane Irma.   And I also want to acknowledge the cooperation and the good will  extended to us by Chairman Frelinghuysen. It is a pleasure for me to  work with him as well.   My thoughts and prayers remain with all those whose families, lives,  homes, and businesses have been upended by these disasters. This  Congress and the American people are with you in your time of need.   I am pleased this package provides a temporary suspension of the  Federal debt limit to prevent a catastrophic debt default and a  continuing resolution extending Federal funding through December 8. As  in 2013 and 2015, when faced with government funding deadlines and  impending sequestration, we must use the time until the CR expires to  develop a new budget agreement with realistic caps on defense and  nondefense discretionary spending.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
