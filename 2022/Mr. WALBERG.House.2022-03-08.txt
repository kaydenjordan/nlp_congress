 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, today, Michigan's average fuel prices are mere cents  away from the all-time high in the Motor State--not seen since the  middle of the Great Recession. On Thursday, Triple A (AAA) data showed  that Michigan had seen the highest State-wide average increase over the  last week of any State in the Union.   Today, a gallon of regular unleaded gas costs 61 cents more than it  did just one week prior. Diesel, which helps fuel our State's thriving  agricultural industry, has increased even more.   Since this time last year, the cost of diesel is up 58 percent. In  2022, the price of natural gas is expected to reach an 8-year high. Not  only does this increase families' costs to heat their homes, but it  also further raises the already-inflated price of essential fertilizers  that help grow Michigan crops.   Clearly, President Biden's war on American energy independence has  created an energy crisis and made us more dependent on adversaries like  Vladimir Putin, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. The crisis continues  to hit our homes, our farms, and our businesses, and it grows in  severity week after week.   Recently, I sat down with some farmers in my home State. They  lamented how the rising prices of energy and overall production costs  is hurting  [[Page H1362]]  their livelihoods and trickling down to Michigan consumers. The data  shows the same U.S. farm income is expected to drop 8 percent  this year, all while prices at the supermarket reach historic highs. If  we don't unleash American energy, this cost will continue to  reverberate in our agricultural industry and at Michiganders' kitchen  tables for years to come.    Madam Speaker, I implore the Biden administration to take the  necessary steps to increase our energy production at home. We have the  capacity, we have the drive, we have the capability and tools to do  so--for the sake of consumers in Michigan and around the world.
