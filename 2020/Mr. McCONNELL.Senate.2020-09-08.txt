 Our Nation has spent the last 6 months fighting the  medical, economic, and social effects of this pandemic. The Senate's  historic rescue package from back in March, the CARES Act, has gone a  long way to help American workers and families endure these incredible  challenges.   It delivered the extra Federal unemployment benefits that helped  laid-off workers make ends meet. It created the Paycheck Protection  Program, which has helped millions of small businesses keep their  lights on and keep employees on the payroll; it sent resources to the  frontlines of the healthcare fight; and it invested billions in the  race for treatments and for vaccines.   But this relief was never going to last forever. Today, enhanced  Federal unemployment benefits are only still available because of  action by President Trump. The Paycheck Protection Program has closed  to new applications, and the funds it has delivered are being  exhausted. This last month has brought a whole new challenge: how to  get teachers and students safely into a new school year. These are the  challenges that people I represent are facing every single day.  Kentuckians and all Americans know this unprecedented crisis is not  through with us yet, and so they expect that Congress isn't through  helping yet either.   Senate Republicans have been fighting for months to deliver another  round of COVID-19 relief. In July, we proposed the HEALS Act, a  sweeping package totaling more than $1 trillion that would have led  right to bipartisan talks, but Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader  said no.   They said they would block our trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and  healthcare unless we doubled the cost to accommodate an endless wish  list of non-COVID-related liberal priorities such as tax cuts for blue- State millionaires.   So Republicans tried another way to break the logjam. In August, we  proposed narrowing discussions to some of the most urgent, most  bipartisan subjects that seemed especially ripe for agreement, but  Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader blocked that as well. Now they  claimed it was too ``piecemeal''--too piecemeal, they said--to get any  help out the door until Democrats and Republicans had settled every  disagreement on every front.   The Democratic leaders have spent months playing these ``Goldilocks''  games. They have complained about every single thing we put forward but  produced nothing of their own with any chance whatsoever of becoming  law.  [[Page S5430]]  Meanwhile, after all their blustering that Congress should never do  anything ``piecemeal,'' Speaker Pelosi came rushing back to Washington  to pass the most piecemeal bill you could possibly imagine--legislation  that solely helped out the U.S. Postal Service and did nothing at all  for American families. When Republicans tried to help American workers  keep their jobs, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer said it was  ``piecemeal,'' but when House Democrats' fears about mail-in voting  made them think maybe their own jobs would be in jeopardy, that  argument suddenly disappeared.   That is the score. Democrats are all for piecemeal bills when they  concern their own reelections, but when it comes to bipartisan aid for  kids, jobs, and schools, Democrats say it is either their entire wish  list--all of it--or nobody gets a dime.   Well, Republicans see this quite differently. We don't think this  crisis cares about partisan politics. We think people are hurting and  Congress should do its job. We want to agree where a bipartisan  agreement is possible, get more help out the door, and then keep  arguing over the rest later.   That is how you legislate. That is how you make law. You find  agreement where agreement is possible and keep arguing over the rest  later.   So Republicans are making yet another overture. Today, we are  releasing a targeted proposal that focuses on several of the most  urgent aspects of this crisis--issues where bipartisanship should be  especially possible. I am talking about policies such as extending the  additional Federal unemployment benefit for jobless workers; providing  a second round of the job-saving Paycheck Protection Program for the  hardest hit small businesses to prevent layoffs; sending more than $100  billion to help K-12 schools and universities open safely and educate  our kids; dedicating billions more for testing, contact tracing,  treatments, and vaccines; on-shoring manufacturing capacity for  critical medical supplies and rebuilding our national stockpile; giving  all kinds of families more choice and flexibility to navigate education  and childcare during the crisis; providing legal protections for  schools, churches, charities, nonprofits, and employers so they can  reopen; providing more help for the Postal Service. Our proposal would  do all this and more.   Now, here is what our bill is not. It is not a sweeping,  multitrillion-dollar plan to rebuild the entire country in Republicans'  image. It does not even contain every single relief policy that  Republicans ourselves think would help in the short term. I am  confident the Democrats would feel the same way.   But the American people don't need us to keep arguing over what might  be perfect. They need us to actually make law.   So Democratic leaders are perfectly free to come out here and keep up  their playbook from these past months. Just blast away--blast away--in  bad faith, call names, and complain about the infinite number of things  this proposal does not do. Maybe they will bring back their  ``Goldilocks'' act and say our multihundred-billion-dollar proposal is  too small or too skinny, even though Democrats just passed a piecemeal  bill for the Postal Service that ignored everything else--a piecemeal  bill for the Postal Service that ignored everything else.   Democrats can do all that if they want to. I understand they have  already been criticizing this bill today before they even read it,  before it had even been put out. More of this would just reinforce that  only one side of the aisle seems to want any bipartisan outcome at all.   It is easy to tell in Washington whether somebody's end goal is  political posturing or getting an outcome. One way or another, what  Democrats do will be revealing.   The Senate is going to vote on this targeted proposal. We are going  to get the stonewalling of Democratic leaders out from behind closed  doors and put this to a vote out here on the floor. It is going to  happen this week. Senators will not be voting on whether this targeted  package satisfies every one of their legislative hopes and dreams. That  is not what we will do in this Chamber. We vote on whether to make  laws, whether to forge a compromise, whether to do a lot of good for  the country and keep arguing over the remaining differences later.   A few weeks ago, more than 100 House Democrats spoke out publicly.  They asked Speaker Pelosi to stop stonewalling and let the House vote  on targeted COVID relief short of--short of--her entire wish list. The  Speaker ignored them--ignored her rank and file, just like her  piecemeal postal bill ignored American families.   Over here I will make sure our Democratic colleagues get a chance to  walk the walk. Every Senator who has said they want a bipartisan  outcome for the country will have a chance to vote for everyone to see.  Senators will vote this week, and the American people will be watching                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.
