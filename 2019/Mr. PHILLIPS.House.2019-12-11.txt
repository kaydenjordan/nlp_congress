 Mr. Speaker, last week, my State and our country lost  three young and remarkable servicemembers in a tragic helicopter crash  outside of St. Cloud, Minnesota.   Sergeant Kort Plantenberg; Chief Warrant Officer 2 James Rogers, Jr.;  and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Charles Nord each served our country with  valor and leave behind grieving families and friends and heartbroken  communities.   I recently flew with a crew from St. Cloud, and I lost my own father  in a helicopter crash in the Vietnam war back in 1969, so my heart is  particularly heavy today for Kaley Nord, 2-year-old Lydia, and her  soon-to-be-born sibling, who will grow up without a father.   But we will never forget, and we will carry their legacies forward in  the spirit of service, duty, and above all else, sacrifice.   May their memories be for a blessing.                            ____________________
