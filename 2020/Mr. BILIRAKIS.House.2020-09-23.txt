 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for putting forth  this bill, and I also thank my good friend Ranking Member Roe, who does  an outstanding job. He has really done excellent work. It has been an  honor to serve with him on behalf of our veterans. I thank him so much  for his service, his continuing service to our country and our true  American heroes.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 785, the  Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement  Act.   This bill will help prevent veteran suicide by expanding access to  care, services, and support for at-risk individuals within the VA  healthcare system and their local communities. It contains the IMPROVE  Act, a bill by my friend General Bergman that I was proud to support as  one of the first cosponsors.   This section creates a grant program for community providers to  collaborate and assist in suicide prevention services and is modeled  after the bipartisan SSVF program, which has been very successful in  reducing veteran homelessness. We need new and innovative ways to  tackle this tragic problem that our veterans are facing today.   Tragically, 20 servicemembers and veterans take their own lives each  day, not in combat, not by violent crime, but due to suicide. We must  do everything to stop this, Madam Speaker.   We know, too, that many of those 20 per day are not currently using  VA services. That is why this grant program may be particularly  helpful, since it specifically targets to reach those veterans who are  actively suicidal or at risk of suicide who are not current users of  the VA health system.   Madam Speaker, the status quo is unacceptable, and none of us should  stand idly by and allow this epidemic of veteran suicide to continue.  When we called on them, our heroes, these servicemembers and veterans  answered the call to serve. It is time for us to answer the call and  support our heroes and get them the help that they have earned and  deserve.                                time  1245
