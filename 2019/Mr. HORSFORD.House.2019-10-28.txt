 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and the anchor for this  Special Order hour, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, for her commitment,  dedication, and service, not just to the people of Detroit but to the  people of this great Nation.                                time  2030    I join with my colleagues, not only in the Congressional Black  Caucus, but this body of government as a whole, in mourning a giant in  the legacy of Representative John Conyers.   Representative John Conyers was a force to be reckoned with, a leader  of the civil rights movement who stood tall in the House of  Representatives for more than a half century, the longest serving  African American Congressman.   During his 53 years as the Representative for the part of Michigan  encompassing Detroit, Congressman Conyers fought for the people of his  State tooth and nail.   Congressman Conyers was known as the dean of the House of  Representatives, and he paved the way for all of us who are here this  evening. I really believe that we stand on his shoulders.   Speaking to his legacy, he was a cofounder of the Congressional Black  Caucus. So, the fact that we are now 54 members in number representing  more than 84 million people across the country, it was the vision of  people like Congressman Conyers and others that allowed the  Congressional Black Caucus to come forward.   He also led the charge to declare, as has been stated, a national  holiday in honor of the great Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., a day  Congressman Conyers fought for tirelessly that we now hold in our  hearts as a day of remembrance for the legacy of another fearless  leader.   He also served on two powerful committees as chairman: the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform--and we just mourned the passing of  the chairman of that great committee, Chairman Cummings--and the House  Judiciary Committee, which has great responsibility; and, in both, he  never shied away from speaking truth to power.   As has been stated by my good friend Congressman Evans, one of his  early mottos was: Register, vote, run for office. It is power that  counts.   So we will continue to harness this power to promote the ideals that  Congressman Conyers espoused during his career.   I want to note, and I don't think I shared this with Congresswoman  Lawrence, but there is a group called the Detroit Connection. Because  so many people tend to come to Las Vegas to retire, we have a big  contingency of Detroit people, and they have an event every year called  the Detroit Connection. They raise money. They provide scholarships.   I was so honored one year to have Congressman Conyers come to Las  Vegas and attend the event for the Detroit Connection, and it made that  group feel so good to know that their champion and their Representative  was still there.   So, we will use the privilege of serving--I know I will as one of the  new, younger Members--to continue to fight for equality and justice for  all, just as Congressman Conyers did during his 53 years here on  Capitol Hill.   Tonight, we honor him with our words, but tomorrow we must honor him  with our actions.   Congressman Conyers, we will continue the good work you started all  those years ago. May you rest in power.
