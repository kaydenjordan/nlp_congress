 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, after line 16, insert the following:        (i) the Secretary of State with respect to border-crossing       facilities consisting of oil pipelines;        Page 2, line 17, strike ``(i)'' and insert ``(ii)''.        Page 2, line 19, strike ``oil or''.        Page 2, line 21, strike ``(ii)'' and insert ``(iii)''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, since 1968, oil pipelines that cross  international borders have been reviewed and authorized by the  Department of State. That is nearly 50 years. This is common sense.  After all, the State Department handles diplomacy, the State Department  manages treaties related to our international boundaries, and the State  Department is responsible for the security of pathways for our  pipelines.   But the bill we are considering today would shift decisionmaking  authority for those pipelines from the State Department, which is  equipped to handle all aspects of this issue, to Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, which isn't equipped.   So it just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. Chairman. It seems quite  arbitrary and quite foolish and moving in the wrong direction. This is  change for change's sake, and it wouldn't improve the process.   My amendment would prevent this mistake. It would simply ensure that  permitting authority for cross-border oil pipelines remains with the  Department of State. That is the permitting authority for cross-border  oil pipelines to remain with the Department of State.   In each of the past two Congresses, my friends in the majority  agreed. They passed substantially similar legislation to change the  cross-border pipeline permitting process, but they kept the final  approval authority where it belongs, with the Department of State.   Cross-border oil pipelines are matters of international diplomacy and  national security, and oversight should remain with the State  Department. The old adage, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' I don't  know what we are trying to do here. So I urge support for my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the  [[Page H6019]]  amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Tsongas    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part B of House Report 115-235.
