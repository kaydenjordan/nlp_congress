 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks on the topic of tonight's Special Order.    Madam Speaker, what a privilege it has  been not only to serve with John Lewis, but to be witness tonight to  the remembrances of our icon, the peacemaker, the justice seeker,  Congressman John Robert Lewis.   Personally, I never got used to working with John Lewis, and I  struggled to call him ``John.''   I met him right after I got sworn in, in a special election, near the  chair in which he often sat. I was completely tongue-tied.   Whether it was a casual hello, a walk back and forth from the Capitol  for votes, or planning a sit-in, every single interaction with John was  profound.    John knew oppression and he knew racial violence. He had been beaten,  clubbed, spat on, and denigrated. John had experienced the worst forms  of bigotry. He had seen the worst in people, and yet it steeled his  determination and it deepened his faith.   John Lewis is the kindest man I have ever known. Love, compassion,  integrity were the hallmarks of everything he did, big or small.   Like so many of you, I was fortunate enough to be able to go to Selma  on several occasions with John and walk the Civil Rights Trail.   To hear John Lewis speak on the Edmund Pettus Bridge is  transformative. That bridge is an unusual structure. It has a steep  rise as it comes up, it flattens in the middle, and then there is a  steep descent.   I could imagine John Lewis, as I saw him speak from that bridge,  being a young man leading, with Hosea Williams, a column of 600  marchers and getting to the middle of that bridge and for the first  time being able to see what awaited them, the sea of State troopers, of  angry crowds. I am sure he could feel the violence in the air like  electricity.   But John did not turn back. He did not falter in the face of hatred  and of violence. He was fortified by the moral clarity of why he was  marching: to ensure that every American had the right to vote.   And we know what happened. We know they were beaten, trampled, and  gassed. But they reconvened and marched to Montgomery and made the  Civil Rights Act the law of the land.   Today we find ourselves again in this country in the middle of the  bridge, and we can see the danger ahead. We can see those who seek to  divide this country, suppress the vote, and cut off opportunity. While  John Lewis cannot physically lead us across that bridge, he has taught  us what to do.   Many of us have referenced what would be the last words for us to  hear from John Lewis, and he spoke, as always, inspirationally about  the true  [[Page H3689]]  sorrow he felt for the soul of America, that in the wake of the brutal  murder of George Floyd we were not in a better place, and that those  poisonous, toxic roots of slavery still entangled our institutions and  our Nation.   But he also said to us that he had never been more optimistic,  watching the peaceful protesters across this country assemble.   He told us, as he always did, to be bold, to not be weary. He told us  that the winds of change are blowing.   So we must honor him by continuing our work, by unfurling those sails  to catch that wind, and to live for justice; to see, as he saw, the  divinity in not only John Lewis, but in all of us; and to know that,  collectively, we can continue the march that he started for us, and we  can bring this country to live up to the ideals of justice and equality  for all.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), a  distinguished Member.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from the great State of Florida (Mr. Soto); and  I would ask my colleagues to keep their comments to 2 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Axne). But please, I urge my  colleagues, our time is very short. We want everyone to be able to  speak, so please try to keep your comments under 2 minutes. One minute  would be preferable.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished Member from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, it is difficult to close  such a remembrance and a celebration, and we will never close the  chapter on our friendship, admiration, and reverence for John Lewis.  But John Lewis, for me, has always been the embodiment of the words of  Micah 6. John has shown us what is good: to love justice, love mercy,  and walk humbly with your God.   Rest in peace, power, and glory, Brother John.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
