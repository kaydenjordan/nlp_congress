 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Steven  Kandarian on his retirement from MetLife after serving as chairman of  the board, president, and chief executive officer for the last 8 years.   After Steve Kandarian earned his undergraduate degree from Clark  University, his JD from Georgetown University, and his MBA from Harvard  Business School, he began his career as an investment banker before  founding and serving as managing partner of Orion Partners, a private  equity firm based in Boston.   Mr. Speaker, between 2001 and 2004, Mr. Kandarian was executive  director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the PBGC. During  his time at the PBGC, he made the case for comprehensive reform of the  pension funding rules to put the defined benefit system and the PBGC on  a sound financial footing. His efforts helped lay the  [[Page H3244]]  groundwork for the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.   In 2005, Kandarian joined MetLife as executive vice president and  chief investment officer. And from 2007 to 2012, he led MetLife's  enterprise-wide strategy.   Under Mr. Kandarian's leadership during this time, MetLife identified  the housing bubble early and reduced its exposure to the 2008 financial  crisis. His efforts helped MetLife emerge from the credit crisis with  the financial strength to complete the company's $16.4 billion purchase  of Alico from AIG. This cemented the company's position as a leading  U.S.-based global life insurer.   When Mr. Kandarian became President and CEO of MetLife in 2011, and  later chairman of the board of directors in 2012, his leadership saw  the company expand into North Carolina, my home State. And, in fact,  MetLife expanded and became a leading company in my part of North  Carolina because of Mr. Kandarian's efforts. With its growing presence  in Cary, North Carolina, MetLife now employs many of my constituents at  their Global Technology and Operations hub. In fact, over 2,000 North  Carolinians go to work every day in MetLife in Cary, North Carolina.   And MetLife also has had a long history of giving back to the  community in North Carolina. Since they began hiring in Cary in 2013,  employees have contributed thousands of volunteer hours to local  service projects like Habitat for Humanity. And the MetLife Foundation  has made grants exceeding $2 million to support a number of community  programs, like those that serve disabled veterans, as well as serving  emerging innovations with local technology engineers. None of that  would have been possible without Steve Kandarian's leadership at  MetLife.   Mr. Kandarian has also been a leader in the policy realm, championing  tax reform that resisted the status quo and in pursuing financial  services regulation that targeted risky activities rather than  entities. His successful challenge of MetLife's designation as a  systemically important financial institution was emblematic of the  worthwhile quest to find the right regulatory balance, not regulation  at any cost.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Kandarian on his long and successful  career, and I wish him and his family well in his retirement from  MetLife.
