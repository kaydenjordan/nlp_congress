 Madam Speaker, I love to listen to music, modern country  like Kenny Chesney, classic country like Johnny Cash, `90s grunge like  Pearl Jam, and `80s rock like The Who with Pete Townshend doing  windmills.   But there is another Townsend that does more than Pete to keep music  alive. This past Saturday, I dropped by to meet Chase Townsend and to  thank him for creating jobs. He runs The Music Factory in Pearland,  Texas.   That small business was started 50 years ago by his dad, Steve. I was  overwhelmed by the guitars, ukuleles, cellos, keyboards, and drums.   I asked him: Why do you do this? What keeps you going?  [[Page H1003]]    He said: It is a Harry Potter and the wand moment. There is that  divine light coming down from somewhere. There is music out of nowhere.   Rock on, Chase. Rock on.                            ____________________
