 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a real-life account  of the raw deal Republicans gave the American people with their GOP tax  scam.   Dennis, a retired constituent of mine from Louisville, who still  works part time, recently wrote a letter to the Courier-Journal  newspaper. He stated: ``The so-called tax cut for the middle class is  going to cost me an estimated $600 more in taxes in 2018.''   Dennis pays his taxes quarterly, which is why he did these  calculations now. He added in part: ``I urge people to look into this  so-called great tax break for the middle class. This might change your  mind on the current Members of Congress that have been misleading you  to thinking they are actually working to help you, unless you are one  of the big donors!''   Dennis isn't alone. By the time this scam is fully implemented, more  than 80 million middle class families will see their taxes increase.  That is not progress. That is a ripoff.                            ____________________
