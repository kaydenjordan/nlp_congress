 Madam President it is my honor to congratulate  Gagliano's Italian Market & Deli on 100 years of successful  entrepreneurship founded in culture, community, and family in Pueblo,  CO. The Gagliano's story is one of multigenerational immigrant success  and a heartening example of the American dream.   Giuseppe Gagliano, known as Joe, left Italy in 1918. The promise of  steel mill work and American opportunity drew him to Pueblo. Maria  Carmella DeAngelo--his neighbor from the farmlands just outside of  Palermo in Lucca, Sicily--followed him and they were married in 1920.  Soon, they had their first child, Rose. In 1921, however, a  catastrophic flood destroyed their first home. Later, they lost their  second child, Francis, to illness. Despite these tragedies, the  Gaglianos persisted in finding opportunity.   Joe began the family's legacy of entrepreneurship by saving enough  money selling milk from his cow before and after his shifts at the  mill. Later that year, he used $300 in savings to buy the empty lot  next to their new Elm Street home to build an attached store.   Joe and Maria Gagliano's market stocked a wide variety of sought- after Italian foods and specialties that became popular with Pueblo's  diverse immigrant community. Carmella soon developed the recipe for her  classic Italian sausage that quickly became a mainstay of the business.  While they nurtured their entrepreneurial success, they showed  compassion to customers during the Great Depression by never pursuing  unpaid debts under the interest free credit they offered. The Gaglianos  and their extended family who helped to run the store also took pride  in their hard work to become U.S. citizens.   The Gagliano's story shows the great power of family bonds with four  generations having owned and operated the store, cultivating both its  historic identity and its business growth over the decades. Founders  Joe and Carmella Gagliano passed away in 1966 and 1992, respectively.  In 1994, Joe and Rose (Gagliano) Cortese retired from the business.  Their successors in owning and operating the store are Tony Gagliano,  the nephew of original founder Joe, along with his wife Josephine and  children, Bonnie and Vince.   I am grateful to commemorate this special moment that is a living  reflection of the American dream. I wish for a pleasant community  celebration of this milestone in Pueblo on June 26, 2021, as well. May  the Gagaliano family and their Italian Market & Deli take pride in  their century of success and find many more years of prosperity and  health to come.                            ____________________
