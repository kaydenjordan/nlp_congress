 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, what is happening on the floor right now  is absolutely extraordinary. It is absolutely extraordinary that  Republicans are using the budget process, the reconciliation process,  in between the swearing in of the new Congress and the swearing in of a  new President, to rip away from 20 million Americans health care  insurance, to drive up rates for one-third of consumers in this country  who have some form of preexisting condition--a sickness that without  this law would make their rates go higher--and to throw the entire  health care marketplace into chaos.   It is absolutely exceptional what is happening right now. No one in  this body should normalize it. No one outside of this body should  perceive this to be just politics as usual.   I was here when the Affordable Care Act passed. I was in the House of  Representatives. Since then, I have heard my Republican friends say  over and over and over again that they want to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and replace it. I can't tell you the hundreds of times I have  heard that phrase, ``repeal it and replace it.''   President-Elect Trump talked about that throughout the campaign, and  then 2 days after he won the election, on Thursday night, he went on  national television to double down on the promise that there would be  an immediate replacement. He said: There will not be 2 hours between  the Affordable Care Act being repealed and it being replaced with  something better.   That is the second part of the argument the Republicans have made.  The Affordable Care Act, in their minds, was deficient, despite the  fact that there are 20 million people who have insurance today who  wouldn't have it otherwise and despite the fact that there are hundreds  of millions of Americans across the country who don't have to worry  about them and their loved ones having their insurance rates jacked up  because they are sick, and despite the fact that seniors are paying  thousands of dollars less in prescription drugs than they were.   The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect--it never was--but the  enthusiasm of Republicans to take away from Americans their health  insurance and to drive rates up for millions more is really  unthinkable.   We heard over and over again that the priority was to repeal it and  replace it. Now we are repealing the Affordable Care Act with no plan  for what comes next. We are driving forward with a repeal vote with no  plan for how we keep the health care system together, how we prevent it  from falling into chaos, how we continue to insure the millions of  Americans who rely on it.   There is a cruelty to this enthusiasm for immediate repeal that is a  little bit hard to understand--it is really hard to understand.   I think about somebody like Jonathan Miller. He lives in my State. He  lives in Meriden, CT. He was born with cystic fibrosis. He is insured  today through the Affordable Care Act. Here is what he said:         For me, I was able to live a relatively normal life growing       up, wonderful family and friends, but health has always been       the most important thing in my life. I spend even in a good       health year probably one or two hospitalizations each year       that require IV antibiotics, I am on a whole suite of       medications, each day I take about 15 to 20 medications, some       of those are pills, some are breathing treatments, and then       there are the shots. Healthcare is the number one priority in       my life, it's more important than income, more important than       anything else, being able to maintain my health.    He is insured by the Affordable Care Act today, but he also receives  the benefit of the insurance protections because Jonathan, without the  Affordable Care Act, even if he had insurance, would lose it--probably  a couple of months into the year--because of a practice prior to the  Affordable Care Act of capping the amount of money you would be covered  for in a given year or in a lifetime. Jonathan would have blown through  that in a heartbeat.   It is not hyperbole when he says: ``Without the Affordable Care Act,  I'd probably be dead within months.''   That is the reality for millions of people across this country.  Without health insurance, they cannot survive. They can't afford their  medication.   So this isn't just about politics, this isn't just about the words on  the page, these are people's lives. This is about life or death, and  the casualness of throwing out a law without any concept of what comes  next--I have read so many quotes in the paper over the last few days of  Republicans admitting they don't know yet what they are going to do in  its place, but they still feel the need right now, in the lameduck  session, to begin the process of repealing this law without any concept  of what comes next.   Why do it now? Why not take one step back? Why not reach across the  aisle to Democrats and say: Let's try to work to make this better.  Let's try to answer the concerns the Republicans have, that President- Elect Trump has. Let's take some time to work through this, reform it  in a bipartisan way. No. Instead, we are rushing forward with repeal,  stealing health care for millions of Americans, plunging the health  care system into chaos, with no guarantee that there is anything that  is going to emerge in its place.   Senator Kaine and I have a very simple budget point of order. Senator  Kaine has talked about it. It would prohibit the consideration of any  legislation as part of budget reconciliation that would, No. 1, reduce  the number of Americans who are enrolled in health insurance; No. 2,  increase premiums or total out-of-pocket costs for those people with  private insurance; or, No. 3, reduce the scope and scale of benefits  that people have.   I have heard my Republican friends say: We are going to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, and we are going to replace it with something  better. We are not even committing you to replacing it with something  better. We are just saying, if you are going to replace it, let's  guarantee now that legislation is not going to take anybody's health  care insurance away who has it now who wants it, it is not going to  raise costs, and it is not going to reduce benefits.   I am going to be honest. The replacement isn't coming. It is not  coming, and even if it comes, it can't meet those three tests. There is  no way there is a replacement coming that is going to maintain the 20  million people who have insurance now, that is going to maintain cost  controls and maintain benefits. It is not happening.   News flash to the American public: This law is being repealed under a  budget reconciliation process that shuts out Democrats, and it is not  going to be replaced by something that is equal in quality or better.  At the very least, we can all put our names and our votes to a budget  point of order that commits Republicans to the promise that they have  made for 6 years, which is that if they repeal this, they will not put  a piece of legislation before this Congress that doesn't guarantee that  everybody keeps their health insurance, costs don't go up, and benefits  don't come down.   I urge, when this comes up for a vote, a positive vote from my  colleagues, and I urge my Republican friends to honor the promise they  have made.   I thank Senator Kaine and others for joining me in offering it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
