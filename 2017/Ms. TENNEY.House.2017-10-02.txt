 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast Cancer  Awareness Month and all who have been affected by this terrible  disease. Each October we take time to raise awareness about the threat  breast cancer poses to women and men throughout the country and the  world.   Studies show that one in eight women across the Nation will be  diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and that more than  249,000 people in the United States are diagnosed each year. Roughly 1  percent of those are men.   This month, it is not only imperative that we reflect upon all who  are affected by breast cancer, but that we also take action to fight  against it.   Today I would like to recognize a courageous constituent, friend, and  cancer survivor, Karen Newton. Earlier this year, I played in the  Congressional Women's Softball Game in honor of Karen's triumph over  breast cancer. Karen is a vibrant testament to the fact that strides we  make in medicine are helping cancer patient and their loved ones,  though I don't think she is a very good driver.    Whether it is wearing pink to raise awareness or offering support to  a brave person who is fighting this disease, in October, let's all join  together to fight to end breast cancer.                            ____________________
