 Madam Speaker, 2019 marks the 100th  anniversary of diplomatic relations between Poland and the United  States.  [[Page H220]]    As praised by Ambassador Piotr Wilczek:         It has been a century of solidarity, understanding, but       most of all friendship. Our bond is stronger than ever, and       we look forward to the next 100 years to come.    In 1795, imperial Russia and Prussia occupied the Polish nation,  ending its official existence for 123 years.   The Washington Times recounted:         In 1918, the Versailles Conference restored an independent       Polish state. Freedom was lost once more in 1939 as Nazi       Germany invaded from the west and Soviet Russia from the       east. Subjugation continued until 1989, with the end of the       Soviet-backed communist rule.    Free and democratic Poland today is a valued member of NATO and the  European Union.   Poland has achieved 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth, now  continued by President Andrzej Duda.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
