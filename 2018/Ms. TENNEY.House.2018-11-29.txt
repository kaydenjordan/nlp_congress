 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my dear friend, John  Scarano, who recently retired as the executive director of the Herkimer  County Chamber of Commerce after 12 years at the helm.   John, a native of Little Falls and also a twin, returned to Herkimer  County after serving in the U.S. Army for 6 years. Upon his return,  John spent 23 years at Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation in East  Herkimer before his appointment to the chamber in 2006.   During his tenure, John has played a pivotal role in revitalization  projects, which have made significant contributions to Herkimer's  budding economy, including the Frankfort 5S South Business Park, a new  Tractor Supply Distribution Center in Frankfurt, the new Heidelberg  Bakery facility, and the emergence and support of countless new small  businesses.   Along with his work at the chamber, John has served on the boards of  the Herkimer County Industrial Development Agency, the Herkimer County  Historical Society, and the Herkimer County HealthNet.   John is a generous, deeply caring, and honorable person, and I know  he will continue to do the best for our community in retirement. John  is also one of the most relentlessly fun, enthusiastic, and patriotic  people I have ever known.   To my dear friend John Scarano, thank you for your many years of  dedicated service to our community and our Nation. We are grateful to  you, and we wish you the best in retirement.                            ____________________
