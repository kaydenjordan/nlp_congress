B.  Raynor, V. Barefoot, and H. Rose--to help organize the  event. The first State Annual Singing Convention was held in a tobacco  warehouse in 1921. A silver cup was awarded to the best all-around  group, along with prizes for the best quartette and duet. Impartial  judges had to be found from a great distance away, and picnic baskets  filled a table 110 feet in length as 200 people came to enjoy the  wonderful singing.   After a fire destroyed the tobacco warehouse in 1922, a new location  for the Sing was found in an oak-shaded grove at the center of town.  This land was donated by Miss Catherine Benson, a member of the family  for which the town is named. In its early years, a temporary stage was  constructed and lumber stacked on pine blocks served as seating, These  materials were borrowed from a local sawmill and returned at the  conclusion of the Sing. permanent stage in the center of the grove was  dedicated in 1950, thanks to town merchants and patrons of the Singing  Convention. Folding chairs have now replaced the early lumber-on-block  seating. The Singing Grove would fill to capacity long before the  singing started as people reunited with old friends and relatives,  caught up on the latest news, and forgot about their worries as their  souls were lifted through song. For those not able to attend in person,  local radio stations allowed listeners to tune in and for a time, the  State Annual Singing Convention was broadcast to a national audience.   As the joy-filled weekend wound to an end, singers and spectators  alike anxiously awaited judges tallying scores and winners being  announced in several different categories. The people have changed, but  the Sing remains because of a steadfast commitment to what it  represents. As an early leader once wrote, ``The multitude of voices  blend in `God be with you till we meet again' to reassure the world  that there will always be a song of love in the hearts of God's people  everywhere. That is the faith of the State Annual Singing Convention.''   It is my honor to commemorate this notable centennial. The State  Annual Singing onvention has nurtured countless souls through song and  is a testament to the faith of those who carry on its legacy. I extend  my congratulations and best wishes for the next 100 years.                            ____________________
