 Madam Speaker, on August 3, 2019, in El Paso, a white  supremacist massacred 23 innocent people at Walmart. Our red flag bill  might have saved them.   On August 31, 2019, eight people were killed in Midland-Odessa by a  man who failed his background check and purchased a gun through a  private sale. Our bill on private firearm sales might have saved them.   On May 18, 2018, at Santa Fe High School, a 17-year-old used his  father's gun to kill 10 people. Our safe storage bill might have saved  them.  [[Page H5377]]    In Uvalde, parents are burying their babies today after an 18-year- old purchased an AR-15-style rifle and slaughtered 21 individuals. Our  bill raising the age to 21 might have saved them.   These are just the recent Texas mass shootings.   It is not the teachers, the schools, or the doors. It is the guns.   We can't save every life, but my God, shouldn't we try?   We hear Americans, and today in the House, we are taking the action  you are demanding. Take note of who is with you and who is not. I am  proud to remain El Paso Strong.
