 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, where is the soul of America in this Chamber? I have  listened to every speaker since the debate began.   I think that Shakespeare would say: Thou dost protest too much.   We have simple, profound facts. Our children are being blown away.  Last week, the first funeral, that casket could not be opened.   I think every single Member here is a parent. Walk behind that  casket. Think of yourselves and your own children. They deserve  solutions to this. There has to be more from you than damning the  Democratic Party.   Come on. We are Members of Congress.    Many of us say a prayer, the Lord's prayer. And at the end  we say: And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen.
