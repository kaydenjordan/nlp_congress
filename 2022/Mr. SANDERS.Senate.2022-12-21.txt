 Madam President, at the end of this Congress, I will       leave my role as chair of the Senate Budget Committee, where I have had       the privilege of leading the Democratic side since 2015.        In January, I look forward to chairing the Committee on Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions, which has been led so ably by our       colleague, the senior Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, who is       going to chair the Appropriations Committee. At the HELP committee, I       look forward to focusing on universal healthcare, prescription drug       prices, and workers' rights, among other priorities for the people of       Vermont and America.        As I leave the helm of the Budget Committee, I want to express my       thanks to the excellent Budget Committee staff, led so well by my       longtime staff director Warren Gunnels and his deputy staff director       Mike Jones.        Not many people realize it, but the Budget Committee staff played an       important role in getting this Congress' two major budget laws, the       American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted into       law. Budget Committee staff worked tirelessly with the staff of       authorizing committees to ensure that their work would comply with the       arcane and often-changing Senate rules.        I believe that history will show that the American Rescue Plan Act       averted what would have been a prolonged, painful recession in the wake       of the COVID-19 pandemic. Budget Committee staff deserve part of the       credit for that achievement.        The Budget Committee staff and I would very much have preferred that       Congress had enacted all of President Biden's more transformational       Build Back Better Plan. And Budget Committee staff worked long and hard       to make that so. But that we were not able to bring that entire package       across the finish line in no way diminishes the recognition that the       Budget Committee staff deserve for their efforts to make it happen.        I want to commend the Democratic staff who served the Budget       Committee this Congress: Joey Alpert, Olga Bakun, Nicolas Ballon,       Merissa Barrera, Alex Beaton, Sion Bell, Michaela Brown, Montana Cruz,       Bill Dauster, Robert Etter, Tyler Evilsizer, Liam Fagan, Danielle       Gardner, Billy Gendell, Zachary Green, Nikhil Goyal, Warren Gunnels,       Ethan Hinch, Hufsa Husain, Alex Jacquez, Mike Jones, Melissa Kaplan-      Pistiner, Mike Lawliss, April Lobo, Katrina Menard, Chris Neubert,       Jimmy O'Donnell, Liz Pancotti, Richard Phillips, Ethan Rosenkranz,       Hannah Sachs, Joshua Smith, David Snower, Camila Thorndike, Roberto       Velez, and Melinda Warner. I believe that there is no finer committee       staff in Congress.        I also want to thank our nonpartisan administrative staff, who have       so ably served both Democratic and Republican Senators on the Budget       Committee this Congress: Ben Mason, Mallory Nersesian, Maeve Poulson,       Alex Scioscia, Katie Smith, Carlile Soldo, and George Woodall.        In the congress to come, our Colleague Sheldon Whitehouse will chair       the Budget Committee. I wish him every success as he takes on that       important job. Some of the Budget Committee staff will stay to work       with him, and some will come to work with me at the HELP Committee,       where they will join able staff that Senator Murray has assembled       there.        I thank all these staff for the important work that they have done in       this Congress and for the important work that they will do in the       Congress to come.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to honor Jim       Condos of South Burlington and Montpelier, VT. Jim is retiring as       Vermont Secretary of State after more than 35 years in public service.        A lifelong Vermonter, Jim has served his community at multiple levels       of government. After 18 years as a South Burlington city councilor, he       went on to represent Chittenden County in the Vermont State Senate. In       2010, Jim was elected secretary of state, a position that he has held       for the past 12 years. During his tenure, Jim has been recognized as an       expert on election administration and has served in such roles as       president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, a member       of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Board of Advisors, an       executive board member for the Council of State Government, and the       national cochair of the Overseas Voting Initiative for Military       Personnel and Overseas Citizens. Jim has also been called upon by       Congress to share his expertise, specifically on voting and election       cybersecurity.        Thanks in large part to Jim's leadership, Vermont is widely       considered a leader in voter access. At a time when the right to vote       is being curtailed in many States, Jim and his team have expanded       Vermonters' access to democracy through same-day registration,       automatic voter registration, online voter registration, ADA-accessible       voting, universal vote-by-mail, and ballot dropboxes. During the COVID-      19 pandemic, Jim's office implemented safe voting options so that       Vermonters did not need to choose between their health and their right       to vote. His pro-voter policies also led to record-shattering voter       turnout, for both early and total voting, in the 2022 midterm and 2020       Presidential elections. This work has all been done while ensuring the       integrity of elections through election            [[Page S9777]]            cybersecurity measures and ballot curing, discrediting arguments that       expanding access to the vote enables election fraud. In fact, Vermont       has been on the forefront of election security, identifying threats       that have ultimately led to the strengthening of systems nationwide.        In addition to defending democracy through sound election       administration, Jim has prioritized good government while secretary of       state. For example, he and his team oversaw the transition from a paper       system to an electronic system, posting more records and information       online. While this received fewer headlines than the office's election       work, it has been critical to ensuring transparency and public access.       Similarly, Jim's work to reduce red tape in the office of professional       regulation means that Vermont businesses and professionals are better       served, while still protecting the public.        At a time when democracy is under threat and distrust in government       is pervasive, Jim has given Vermonters faith and hope for the future.       He has shown what accessible elections and good government can and       should look like, and for that, he has my sincere gratitude. Vermont is       indeed a better place and Vermonters are better off thanks to Secretary       of State Jim Condos. I wish Jim and Annie all the best for his well-      deserved retirement.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to honor Beth       Pearce of Barre, VT. Beth is retiring as Vermont State Treasurer after       more than 45 years in public service, including nearly two decades       serving Vermonters.        Beth was born in West Springfield, MA, and grew up in a civically and       political engaged household. After serving in a variety of government       positions throughout the Northeast, Beth became Vermont's deputy State       treasurer in 2003. In 2011, she was appointed Vermont State Treasurer       and, despite being new to electoral politics, she was elected in own       right in 2012, and was reelected to four additional terms.        Despite her electoral success, Beth has long considered herself more       of a policy person than a politician, something that it evident in her       approach in the State treasurer's office. She has taken her role as a       public servant seriously and has been a careful steward of public       funds. Though this has sometimes put her at the center of challenging       issues, Beth's integrity has earned her widespread respect.        As Beth herself has described, her office's work ``is not just       numbers on spreadsheets, but a reflection of [their] commitment of       service to, and respect for, everyone in Vermont.'' This approach is       just one of the things that sets Beth apart. While she has relished the       day-to-day work and embraced being described as ``breathtakingly       boring,'' Beth has never lost sight of the immense responsibility of       the State treasurer's office to positively impact the lives of everyday       Vermonters. Whether by making sure that individuals and towns received       the aid they were entitled to following the devastation caused by       Tropical Storm Irene, that people with disabilities could save and       invest through the VermontABLE program, or that State employees could       retire with dignity, Beth has never forgotten that it is people--not       numbers--at the center of her work.        To my mind, Beth represents the best of public service. She will long       be remembered by all who worked with her for her competence, empathy,       humor, and, of course, her unwavering love of the Boston Red Sox. And       to all those Vermonters who would not otherwise know the role of the       treasurer's office, she will be remembered for her tireless work toward       a Vermont where everyone has the opportunity for a lifetime of       financial stability and well-being. Vermont is indeed a better place,       and Vermonters are better off, thanks to Beth Pearce. I join Beth's       friends, family, and fellow Vermonters in wishing her all the best in       her well-deserved retirement.                                       ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to honor the Will       Raap, one of Vermont's most visionary leaders, who passed away on       December 12.        Will was born in Fremont, CA, and spent time in Findhorn, Scotland,       where he met his future wife Lynette. Will and Lynette married in 1977       and, in 1981, moved to Vermont so Will could continue his work with the       Garden Way Company and Gardens for All. Two years later, Will cofounded       Gardener's Supply Company to enable everyone to experience the benefits       that come from gardens and gardening, including people with       disabilities, seniors, and beginning gardeners.        From the earliest days of the company, Will's business model was       built around the ``triple bottom line'' of people, planet, and profits.       A clear example of his commitment to the people that made up Gardener's       Supply happened in these early years, when Will gave himself a pay cut       in order to give a valued data entry employee a raise. It was also in       these early years of Gardener's Supply that Will began transitioning       the company into an employee-ownership structure. This move was rooted       in his belief that everyone doing the work should share in the benefit,       not just those at the top. Will's investments in his employees, both on       the individual level and on the whole, have proven powerful and       successful. In 2009, Gardener's Supply reached 100-percent employee       ownership, and that young data entry employee, Cindy Turcot, is now       president and CEO of Gardener's Supply and has become a national leader       of employee ownership.        Never short of energy, ideas, or vision, in 1987 Will brought his       passion for improving community, agriculture, and the environment to an       aging dairy farm and an unofficial landfill in the heart of Vermont's       largest city of Burlington. As mayor of Burlington at this time, I was       glad to work with Will on this important effort. During this time, Will       came to us in city government to request a $7,000 loan to buy a tractor       and start a municipal yard and food waste composting project managed by       Gardener's Supply employees. To get this much-needed project off the       ground, Will and volunteers cleaned up the neglected piece of land and       turned it into what is now known as the Intervale Center. Today, the       Intervale is national model for urban agriculture, food access, and       local food system development and successful partnerships between for-      profit and non-profit organizations. It is also a great recreational       resource for the Old North End and the entire greater Burlington area.       It is home to Vermont's largest community supported agriculture--CSA--      farm, a tree nursery, a food hub and distribution center, community       gardens, hiking trails, event spaces, and a number of established farm       enterprises.        Will was also a driving force behind Vermont's innovative Farm-to       Plate initiative, as well as the Vermont Dairy/Water Quality       Collaborative. Most recently, Will worked to turn an iconic failed       dairy farm in Charlotte, VT, into an entirely new way to think about       agriculture in our State. Using the farm's land and facilities, Will       created Earthkeep Farmcommon and the Earthkeep Farmers Collective.       Today, the former dairy farm is being used by young entrepreneurs to       grow and malt grains, raise shrimp, grow berries, make carbonated       beverages, and produce baked goods, to name just a few of the       businesses in operation there.        Will's lifetime of accomplishments reflected his style of thinking       big and his ability to surround himself with teams that were eager to       make those big ideas a reality. Will Raap represents the best of       Vermont's entrepreneurial spirit. There is no doubt that Will will be       remembered as a force for good and a leader whose lasting mark on       Vermont will be not about himself, but about all those whose lives have       been made better for his vision.        All Vermonters can honor Will's memory by asking his three favorite       questions: ``What's next?'' ``How can we make a difference?'' and,       ``Are we doing enough?'' Vermont is a better place and Vermonters are       better off thanks to Will Raap's many contributions.                                      ____________________
