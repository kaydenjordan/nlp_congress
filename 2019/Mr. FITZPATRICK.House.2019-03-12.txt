 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and memory of an amazing Bucks County resident,  Maura Duggan, whom we recently lost after a courageous battle with  cancer.   Maura was a longtime resident of Newtown, in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania. She married her husband, Thomas Duggan, in 1991, and,  together, they raised three amazing children: Patrick, Collin, and  Carlie.   Maura was beloved by her family and her friends and was known for her  adventurous spirit, her unwavering kindness, and her ability to  appreciate the small things and to find joy in everyday life.   Mr. Speaker, we, as a House, send our deepest condolences to the  Duggan family. I am grateful to them for sharing Maura's life with all  of us in Bucks County.   Maura touched so many lives and helped so many people. She is now  enjoying her eternal reward for living her life serving others.  [[Page H2654]]                                 Honoring Marion Slack     Mr. Speaker, just under 1 year ago, I stood in this  very spot to recognize the outstanding work of Mary's Cupboard, a food  pantry in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It is with a heavy heart that I  rise today to mourn the passing of one of the founders of Mary's  Cupboard, Marion Slack, who passed away at the age of 96.   Marion, a longtime resident of Middletown Township in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, lived a life of devotion to her family, to her community,  and to her Catholic faith. Marion truly embodied what it meant to live  out one's faith each and every day.   Inspired after meeting Mother Teresa, she established Mary's Cupboard  more than 40 years ago in Levittown, an emergency food center. A  parishioner at Queen of the Universe Parish, Marion was previously  recognized as Catholic Woman of the Year by the Knights of Columbus.   Mr. Speaker, our entire community stands by her children: Mary Ellen,  Maureen, Eileen, and Ann Marie, along with the entire Mary's Cupboard  family.   Marion is now enjoying her eternal reward for a life of service, and  her legacy of service to Bucks County will last for generations.                         Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance     Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of meeting with  advocates from the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance here in Washington,  D.C., last week. It was great speaking with them to express my strong  support for the continuation of funding for the Tuberous Sclerosis  Complex Research Program in the fiscal year 2020 Department of Defense  Appropriations Act.   Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, or TSC, is a genetic disorder that can  cause tumor growth in vital organs in the human body. It occurs in  approximately 1 in 6,000 births.   I am proud to share the story of the Miller family, constituents of  mine from Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   Nearly 5 years ago, Lindsey and her husband, Dave, welcomed their  daughter, Ellie, into the world. While Ellie was born with TSC, she has  not let it stop her from being just like every other kid. She is  developmentally on track, she enjoys preschool with her friends, and  she sees her doctors regularly at the Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia.   However, there is no way to currently gauge how TSC will affect Ellie  in the years to come. That is why funding for the Tuberous Sclerosis  Complex Research Program is so vitally important.   This program has my full support, and I encourage all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it as well. I thank my  colleagues, Mr. Mullin from Oklahoma and Mr. Loebsack from Iowa, for  their leadership on this issue.   Again, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in this very worthy  cause on behalf of all dealing with this across our Nation.                            ____________________
