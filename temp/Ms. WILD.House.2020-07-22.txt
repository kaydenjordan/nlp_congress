 Madam Speaker, shortly after I came to Congress, I learned  through the grapevine that a couple of my staff members wanted nothing  more than to meet the great John Lewis in person.   So with some trepidation, and very cognizant of the demands on his  time, I approached him as a freshman Member on the House floor to  inquire whether I could make an appointment with his staff. And in his  usual warm and gregarious manner, Mr. Lewis said: ``Of course. Of  course.''   A few weeks later, I took these staffers on a mystery field trip to  the Cannon House Office Building. And the look on their faces when they  realized we were about to enter John Lewis' office was priceless.   I figured it would be a quick handshake and a photo op, and then we  would be on our way back to our office. But no. Mr. Lewis greeted my 6- foot-4-inch legislative counsel Zach and my speechwriter Yann with:  ``Hello, young brothers'' and took them into his office where  he proceeded to give them a narrated history of the civil rights  movement with the aid of large photographs that were stacked all over  his office.    Zach and Yann and Sara, another member of my team, asked many  questions, and he answered them all. We took the obligatory photos for  which I am thankful, because now they have the treasure of those  memories forever.   A full hour-and-a-half elapsed, and our meeting with him ended only  because my team needed to get back to work, so we had to break away. I  am convinced he would have gladly spent the rest of the afternoon  speaking with them. That is just one example of the generosity of  spirit of the great John Lewis.   Rest in peace, Mr. Lewis. I hope you are starting a whole lot of good  trouble wherever you are. It is the greatest honor of my life to have  served with you.
