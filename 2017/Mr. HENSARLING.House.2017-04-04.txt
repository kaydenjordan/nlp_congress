 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 240, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1343) to direct the Securities and Exchange  Commission to revise its rules so as to increase the threshold amount  for requiring issuers to provide certain disclosures relating to  compensatory benefit plans, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 240, an  amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules  Committee Print 115-11 is adopted and the bill, as amended, is  considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 1343         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Employee       Ownership Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INCREASED THRESHOLD FOR DISCLOSURES RELATING TO                     COMPENSATORY BENEFIT PLANS.         Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise       section 230.701(e) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations,       so as to increase from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 the       aggregate sales price or amount of securities sold during any       consecutive 12-month period in excess of which the issuer is       required under such section to deliver an additional       disclosure to investors. The Commission shall index for       inflation such aggregate sales price or amount every 5 years       to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All       Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,       rounding to the nearest $1,000,000.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Financial Services.   After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the  amendment printed in House Report 115-75, if offered by the Member  designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall be  separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally  divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee  Ownership Act. I also want to commend the Republican and Democrat  sponsors of this important bill: Mr. Hultgren of Illinois, Mr. Delaney  of Maryland, Mr. Higgins of New York, Mr. MacArthur of New Jersey, Ms.  Sinema of Arizona, and Mr. Stivers of Ohio.   Their bipartisan efforts resulted in a bipartisan bill that will help  small businesses, including startups, to successfully reward their  hardworking employees; and, while doing so, this bill will allow small  businesses to effectively deploy their capital to grow and to create  jobs on Main Streets all across our country.   We all know, Mr. Speaker, that small businesses are the heart and  soul of the American economy. In fact, they helped create more than 60  percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. So if  our Nation is to have a healthier economy that offers more opportunity  to more Americans, then we must encourage small-business growth and  small-business startups, and this starts with ensuring they have access  to the capital and credit they need to grow.   Yet as we have heard from countless witnesses who have appeared  before the House Financial Services Committee, community banks and  credit unions in particular--the primary source of our small-business  loans--are simply drowning, Mr. Speaker, in a sea of complicated and  costly regulations. The same occurs with the maze of burdensome  securities regulations that are written with the largest public  companies in mind but end up hurting smaller companies.   Although small companies are at the forefront of innovation and job  creation, they often face significant obstacles in obtaining funding in  our capital markets. These obstacles often result from the  proportionately larger burden that securities regulations place on  small companies when they seek to access capital both in the public and  private markets.   These small companies also face difficult challenges on how best they  can deploy their limited resources and capital--to grow and thrive or  to be able to sufficiently compensate their workforce, which is a  critical component of their success.   Currently, the SEC allows private companies to offer their own  securities to employees as part of written compensation agreements  without having to comply with burdensome Federal securities  registration requirements under what is called SEC rule 701. Now,  unfortunately, one of the rule's thresholds has not been adjusted in  two decades. What the bipartisan supporters of this bill are proposing  is simply to modernize this SEC rule with a modest increase in that  threshold.   Increasing the rule 701 threshold gives private companies more  flexibility to reward and retain employees and permits private  companies to keep valuable, skilled employees without having to use  other methods such as borrowing money or selling securities. Updating  this rule can encourage more companies to offer more incentives to more  employees.   As one witness who testified before Congress said, this bill ``would  support a valuable compensation practice that allows small businesses  to hire the most highly skilled workers'' and better enable small,  emerging growth companies that are at a competitive disadvantage with  bigger businesses to attract and retain employees.   Allowing employees to become owners in the company also benefits  those employees. As startups and small companies reach success, we all  want their employees to also reap the benefits of that success. That is  what is happening with companies that are able to offer stock options  as part of their employee compensation plans.   For example, when Google was in its early stages, it hired someone to  be an in-house, part-time masseuse and compensated her with both cash  and stock options. That masseuse is now worth millions today. Another  example is from an ad-tech company, MoPub. Thirty-six of its 100  employees became millionaires when the company was acquired by Twitter  because MoPub's CEO set his employees up for success by offering them  performance-based stock-option grants.   So, Mr. Speaker, shouldn't we want more American workers to have the  opportunities like at Google and MoPub? Don't we want more Americans to  have an opportunity to obtain an ownership stake in the places that  they work? That way the workers can earn the large financial upside  that comes when the company performs well, and the company benefits by  being able to attract talented workers.   Unfortunately, again, Mr. Speaker, too many companies right now shy  away from offering employees greater ownership opportunities because an  expensive, bureaucratic, burdensome, top-down regulation in Washington  hasn't been updated in nearly 20 years. Mr. Speaker, we can fix that  today. We can fix that by passing this commonsense, bipartisan bill,  the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act.   We can provide American workers with more opportunities to share in  the successes and profits of companies they work for. We can help to  foster capital formation so more Americans can go back to work, have  good careers, pay their mortgages, plan for a secure retirement, and  ultimately give their families a better life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.
