 Mr. President, I am thrilled that we are passing this  legislation. It is amazing to me--and I am sure the Presiding Officer  would agree--that the Senate has actually returned to regular order. We  are passing amendments on both sides of the aisle, and I think we are  going to have a big bipartisan vote here in the Senate. In having been  here for a number of years when the Senate didn't operate that way--it  was incredibly dysfunctional--it is a great, great privilege to be here  at a moment when it is working. So I want to express my sense of  gratitude for that.                             January 6 Commission    Mr. President, I also want to call the Presiding Officer's attention  to news reports this afternoon that say that our colleagues on the  Republican side of the aisle have decided they are going to block this  bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and that  they are going to use the filibuster here to block a Commission that  some of them actually called for and a Commission that, I think, 35  Republican Members of the House of Representatives supported.   I wanted to come to the floor to appeal to their conscience and to  ask them to consider the damage that it will do to our democracy to not  have this Commission, as we have done at other important moments in the  country's history.   And, Mr. President, you were here on January 6. I was here on January  6. We had been sent here--we came here--to accomplish the ministerial  task that we are required after a Presidential election is concluded,  to certify the results of that election, to certify the ballots of  millions and millions and millions of Americans who voted in the last  election. That is why we were here.   Unfortunately, we had a President at that time who denied that the  election had actually happened.   The President will remember that we also had colleagues that came to  this floor and said that we were disrespecting the President's base or  their base because we were certifying the election, instead of having  enough respect for their base to tell them the truth, which was that  the election had been decided by millions of voters, and by every court  that looked at it and by incredibly brave local officials, many of them  Republicans, who wouldn't allow the President to push them around.   The 6th was a terrible day here. The people who invaded this Capitol,  the people who stormed the platform that had been set up for the  peaceful transfer of power on January 20, when Joe Biden took the oath  of office--the people who came here on January 6 cursed the Capitol  Police. They bludgeoned the Capitol Police. They speared them. They  hurled racial epithets, leading some of our African-American police  officers here to ask what had happened to America. They broke windows  in the Capitol. They looted the Parliamentarian's office--the people  who would bravely carry the ballots out of this Chamber, when we were  led to the Hart building, and protect those ballots that could have  ended up getting burned out on the National Mall, if they hadn't had  the presence of mind to do their job--just like the Capitol Police, who  were in mortal danger that day doing their job.   And I remember, when we were all together in one of the Senate office  buildings, after they had rushed us out of here, we would later see  that the mob was just a hallway away from here, and, actually, they  were misdirected by another Capitol Police officer, who put his life in  jeopardy to move them out of the way.   We were taken to another building, a Senate office building, and it  was in that room--we were crowded in that room. It was in that room  that I saw a scene that I never thought I would ever see as an  American, on the TV sets that were on the walls of that room. While we  were inside the room, we were watching the scene that everyone else in  the country and everyone else across the world was watching of the U.S.  Capitol being invaded by our own people.   I know the President will remember that when he was growing up, when  I was growing up, that was not an uncommon sight to see in countries  all over the world. There are a lot of countries that have had events  like January 6 over the world, especially when there have been  transitions of power or a tyrant unwilling to give up their power.   But in a million years, I would never have imagined that it would  happen here. And it did happen, and it sent a message all over the  planet.   While we were in that room, unable to certify this election, the  Chinese Government had the greatest propaganda win that you could  imagine, and in the weeks that followed, they have said democracy is in  decline, democracy is failing. That is what the Russians are saying.  That is what the Iranians are saying.   And when I was there in that room that day, I thought a lot about my  mom and her parents, who were Polish Jews, who survived the Holocaust.  The whole family was killed except for them and an aunt, and they were  lucky enough that, after the war was over, they went to Stockholm,  Sweden, for a year. They went to Mexico City for a year, and then they  came here to the only country in the world where they thought they  could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.   And so even worse for me than the thought of our adversaries using  this to undermine democracy was the understanding that people all over  the world situated just like my mom and her parents would lose hope in  the American ideal, would lose hope in democracy and in the rule of  law.   Now, the good news is we actually had a January 20. A lot of  countries that go through January 6 never get to January 20, and we had  that, and Joe Biden took the oath of office and he became President of  the United States, and Kamala Harris became the Vice President of the  United States. We had, notwithstanding all of the prior President's  efforts to the contrary and the efforts of some of his allies in  Congress  [[Page S3850]]  to the contrary--we had--a peaceful transfer of power.   But consider how close we came, not just on the 6th, but consider  what would have happened if elected officials, many of them Republicans  in Georgia and in Arizona and in Michigan hadn't fulfilled their  obligations to the rule of law, hadn't lived up to their oath of  office, bent to the will of a President who didn't want to relinquish  power. Where would we be then?   Imagine if the Democrats, instead of winning a narrow majority in the  House of Representatives, had lost the majority in the House of  Representatives, and 140 or more--148--Republican votes to decertify  the election, to overturn the will of the voters, to disenfranchise  millions and millions and millions of Americans all of a sudden was a  majority doing that, as the former President would have wanted.   Imagine if 60 judges, many of them Republicans, appointed by  President Trump, who howled the President's lawyers out of courtroom  after courtroom, after courtroom because, instead of doing what the  President wanted them to do, instead of finding them ``a few more  votes,'' as he said to the secretary of state in Georgia, recorded on  the phone, they did their job as judges and they withstood the  pressure. They swore an oath, and they fulfilled their oath, and that  is the only way democracy can actually work. It is when elected  officials and judicial officials apply the rule of law, fulfill their  oath and their obligation.    And what I want to say to my colleagues today, I want to implore them  and appeal to their conscience, because the responsibility to the  democracy is not over. The democracy is still at risk. We still have a  President of the United States--a former President--who refuses to  concede the election, who, on a daily basis almost, says that the  election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who are saying  the election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who won't  face the facts and tell their constituents the truth.   I want to say again: Respect your constituents enough that you are  going to tell them the truth, and that is why, at difficult moments in  our history, like after President Kennedy was killed or the Challenger  exploded or 9/11 happened, we have had a bipartisan Commission to make  sure we understood what led us here and how we can do better coming out  of this.   It has never been perfect, but it has worked pretty well, and that is  what we need here. We need to understand what led millions of Americans  to believe conspiracy theories about our own country and what led  thousands of people to storm the Capitol of the United States, to  attack police officers, to attack police officers, leading to their  death.   From all over the country, they came to invade this Capitol, and if  we don't want it to happen again or we want to be able to protect  ourselves, and I am not just talking about the poor Capitol Police,  although that, at a bare minimum, ought to be enough to warrant a  Commission. I am talking about the danger of political violence in this  Nation going forward if we don't address this and the American people  don't have the chance to understand what happened.   As I mentioned, that night on January 6, standing at this desk on the  floor, political violence is what brings these republics to an end.   I am going to finish because I know there are others who want to  speak, but let me just finish by saying how agonizing it was to watch  Officer Sicknick's mom here today, going door to door to door, to ask  people: Please vote for this Commission.   I hope that people will reconsider. I hope they will search their  conscience. The people around the world who watched January 6 are  watching us today, and they want to know if democracy is up to the  challenges of the 21st century.   I believe it is. I believe it is. I think democracy is the highest  expression of humanity on Earth, and we are being tested in all kinds  of ways right now, externally and internally. This would give us the  chance to at least deal with the internal question. And I think at a  moment like this it is important for us not to stand for a party or for  a President but for the truth and for common sense and for our exercise  in self-government.   For all of those reasons, I hope that when we have the vote tonight,  that it will succeed and the American people will have the benefit of a  bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and help us  understand how we can strengthen our democracy.   With that, I yield the floor.
