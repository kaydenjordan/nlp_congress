 Mr. Speaker, for years, Pakistan has provided  support for America's enemies with American blood on their hands.  Pakistan has supported the Taliban providing them safe haven, cash, and  weapons. It is no coincidence that the leader of the Taliban was living  in Pakistan when a United States air strike took him out last year.   Pakistan harbored the number one enemy of the world, Obama bin Laden,  until our SEALs brought him to justice. Pakistan's intelligence  services has been dubbed the veritable arm of the terrorist group  Haqqani Network. They have even cut off supply routes for our troops in  Afghanistan.   The Ambassador to Afghanistan has said that Pakistan supports  terrorist groups in Afghanistan, but still Pakistan is considered a  major non-NATO ally of the U.S. This status means that they get  priority for significant benefits in the areas of foreign aid and  defense cooperation. I am introducing a bill that removes Pakistan from  this list of trusted allies.   Pakistan is playing both sides. It is time to call it like it is.  Pakistan should not be counted as a major non-NATO ally of the United  States.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
