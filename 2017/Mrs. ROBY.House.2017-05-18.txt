 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a report on my recent travels  to Afghanistan, where our Armed Forces remain engaged at a critical  front of the global war on terrorism.   I have been a part of several congressional delegations to  Afghanistan to survey conditions there, particularly as it concerns the  progress being made by Afghan women and girls to attain equal rights. I  was honored once again to lead a delegation of my colleagues to the  region to conduct oversight of American operations and better inform  our efforts here in Congress to fulfill  [[Page H4320]]  our constitutional responsibility to fund and support our military.   Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 15 years since American and allied  forces invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime and stamp out  the terrorist breeding ground it harbored. Many brave Americans have  given their lives in the struggle to defeat the al-Qaida terrorist  threat and protect our homeland. It is incumbent on us as a nation to  honor their sacrifice by never allowing it to be in vain.   So much has been given and, because of that, so much has been gained.  There is no question in my mind that our country is safer and the world  is freer because of the work our military has done and continues to do  in Afghanistan. That is an important truth I am reminded of in a  powerful way each time I visit Afghanistan, and I am compelled to share  it with my colleagues here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I have said for years that the test for our success in  Afghanistan going forward is the preservation of the gains made by  women and girls. Having observed the treatment of women and girls in  Afghanistan over many years now, I can tell you that the progress today  is as fragile as ever.   There is good news. New laws criminalize violence toward women and  offer them unprecedented legal protections. Girls are attending school  and going to college. Women are working in government, serving in the  military, in the police force, and even running for office. There is an  Afghan Women's Chamber of Commerce that specifically works to see that  women are incorporated into the nation's economic future.   For American women like me who grew up with parents telling me I  could achieve anything I wanted to, those kinds of things are  commonplace. For Afghan women who grew up in a culture that has  subjugated them to second-class citizenship or worse, these activities  are nothing short of extraordinary. Centuries of repression are being  reversed, and a new generation of women that expects and demands basic  rights is taking hold.   During our visit, our delegation was honored to meet with the Afghan  First Lady, Mrs. Ghani, and many other women leaders. We discussed the  opportunities now available to Afghan women that weren't conceivable 50  years ago under the Taliban, and most importantly they explained just  how critical these gains are to the overall stability of Afghanistan.                                time  1045    While it is certainly encouraging to listen to these remarkable  stories of hope and progress, there exists a deep concern among Afghan  women about seeing these important gains backslide and their rights  erode. In fact, in some areas of the country, this is already  happening. The Taliban's resurgence amid the drawdown of coalition  forces presents a major threat that we must acknowledge.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow the  gains we have made in Afghanistan to fall by the wayside.   We know all too well what can happen when radical oppressive  ideologies are allowed to fester in hostile nations. Make no mistake:  because freedom and fairness for Afghan women is essential to the  security of our Nation, it is also crucial to our own.   That is why I am pleased that President Trump is reviewing our  strategy in Afghanistan, including a reevaluation of troop levels and  our rules of engagement.   Simply put, if we are going to be in Afghanistan, we need to be  willing to do what it takes to succeed. Of course, the Afghan people  must take the reins of their country's future, but the United States  will play a key role in ensuring a lasting peace.   Right now I fear we have tied the hands of our military through  reduced force strength and limited rules of engagement. We should never  send our military men and women into harm's way without the tools and  resources they need to get the job done. Reevaluating our force  strength and rules of engagement is the right decision, and I look  forward to hearing from President Trump and Secretary Mattis as the  NATO summit approaches.   Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that Congress was able to deliver a  comprehensive appropriations bill that properly funds our military.  Funding the government by short-term extensions takes away the  Pentagon's ability to plan for the future. With everything going on in  the world right now, including the situation in Afghanistan, we cannot  hinder our commanders with financial uncertainties.   One of the reasons I was so eager to serve on defense appropriations  was having the opportunity to reverse military cuts that made no sense.  For the last several years, we have been in constant tension with the  Obama administration, whose sequestration policy threatened to hollow  out our military. But not anymore.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who joined me on the delegation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the House, this week, is  taking action to support our law enforcement officers and their  families as we mark National Police Week.   We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to law enforcement officers at  all levels: State and local police officers, sheriffs, firefighters,  first responders, and our Federal agents. They all put their lives on  the line to keep this country and our communities safe.    Congress must always ensure that our law enforcement agencies have  the proper tools and resources to get the job done, and I am honored to  play a role in this important work through my service on the Judiciary  Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice,  and Science.   But, Mr. Speaker, law enforcement officers need more than equipment  and funding. They need our support. They need our support because they  are under attack. The last few years have seen a disturbing uptick in  the instances of police being targeted by violent criminals just  because they are wearing a badge.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, at  least 64 police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty last  year, 21 of which were ambush-style killings. Attacks in Dallas, Baton  Rouge, Chicago, and other places were chilling reminders of the dangers  these brave individuals face when they go to work.   It is time to send a clear, strong message: If you kill a law  enforcement officer, you will be brought to justice and punished to the  full extent of the law. That is why I am proud to support H.R. 115, the  Thin Blue Line Act.   Under current law, killing a Federal law enforcement officer is an  aggravating factor when considering a death sentence for the offender,  just as it should be. However, the same deterrent and prosecution is  not extended to State and local police officers, firefighters, or first  responders. The Thin Blue Line Act would change this by making the  murder of local law enforcement an aggravating factor when considering  a death sentence.   Mr. Speaker, had this provision been in place just 4 years ago, it  would have applied to the Boston bombing case when the bombers killed a  local campus officer. It would also apply when State and local officers  serve on joint law enforcement task forces.   States all over the country are taking action to support law  enforcement through stronger protection for officers and stricter  penalties for criminals, and I believe Congress should do the same.
