 Mr. Speaker, how very appropriate it is today that this  Congress is interrupting consideration of child welfare and foster care  bills in order to address a gift for the nuclear industry. An  indifferent Congress that refuses to put an extra dime in addressing  the deficiencies of our foster care system doesn't hesitate for a  moment in giving a few more million dollars to the nuclear industry.   Isn't it amazing to hear what we will accomplish with a mere $16  million additional tax subsidy?   Our national security will be protected. This is the first concern I  have heard here on the floor in months from a Republican about giving  things to Russia and China. Maybe the better place to look than this  bill is down the street at the White House, if the real concern is what  we are giving to the Russia.   To hear supporters of this bill talk about the dangers to Georgia and  South Carolina, you would think that Sherman's March on Atlanta,  Georgia, and South Carolina was nothing compared to the harm this  Congress would do if it failed to enact this bill.   Well, the devastation that faces consumers in these States has  nothing to do with what Congress has or has not done, but it has to do  with the nuclear industry seeking special treatment, much as it is  seeking taxpayer subsidies here today.                                time  1645    It is an industry that has disregarded longstanding utility law to  compel Georgians to pay higher electric bills for utility investments  before they ever deliver one kilowatt of power. And it may, in fact,  never get around to providing any power for all the money that is  wasted on them.   This is a bill that is masquerading as an incentive for the future. A  glorious new day for nuclear power. And yet it makes this tax credit  available to 20-year-old nuclear technology and for last-century  uranium mining.   This bill hardly matches its cover. It is true that $16 million of  additional help to the nuclear industry is a mere footnote compared to  the billions of taxpayer dollars, taxpayer resources, that have been  lavished on this industry in the past.   In Georgia, the nuclear power industry literally turned decades of  utility law upside down in demanding that electric ratepayers pay for  what stockholders traditionally have paid for. Even after doing that,  Westinghouse, a once distinguished American company, a blue ribbon  company, went belly up. It has been nuked, and so have those local  utility ratepayers.   As The New York Times reported recently:   ``Many of the company's injuries are self-inflicted. . . . ''   ``Bankruptcy will make it harder for Westinghouse's business partners  to collect money they are owed by the nuclear-plant maker.''   ``Now, it is unclear whether the company will be able to complete any  of its projects, which in the United States are about 3 years late and  billions over budget.''   ``The cost estimates are already running $1 billion to $1.3 billion  higher than originally expected, according to a recent report from  Morgan Stanley, and could eventually exceed $8 billion . . . '' right  onto the shoulders of those ratepayers in Georgia and South Carolina.   Of course, you would have thought, after the disaster at Fukushima  and the many questions raised about nuclear power in Japan, that  Congress would be rethinking nuclear power as a panacea. But even if  you overlook this human disaster and the dangers to health and safety,  a recognition that when the nuclear industry makes a mistake it is a  mistake that lasts forever, if you just look at the economics alone,  this kind of tax subsidy is unjustified.   With an ample amount of natural gas coming on the market, with so  much renewable energy, nuclear simply has not made economic sense, and  the history of this particular legislation demonstrates that.   When this tax break was originally set up back in 2005, there were  some 32 nuclear plants that were going to take advantage of it, and it  hasn't been because of the failure of Congress that they didn't. Out of  that 32, exactly four have even begun to be built, and not one of them,  not a single one of them, has been completed in over a decade and a  half.   After this record of miserable failures, there is good reason to ask  why taxpayers should be called on to give even more.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 13 environmental  groups expressing opposition to the legislation.                                                      June 20, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 1551--amending tax credit provisions           for ``advanced'' nuclear power.         Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       our millions of members we are writing to register our strong       opposition to H.R. 1551 that would eliminate the placed-in-      service date for the nuclear production tax credit, which is       currently January 1, 2021. It would also allow public power       companies to receive the benefit of the federal production       tax credit even though they pay no taxes.        Despite H.R. 1551's misleading title, the production tax       credit it extends is not designated solely for new, supposed       ``advanced'' nuclear technologies. Rather, reactor designs       that were approved over twenty years ago are eligible as       described in the bill analysis by the Joint Committee on       Taxation, ``An advanced nuclear facility is any nuclear       facility for the production of electricity, the reactor       design for which was approved after 1993 by the Nuclear       Regulatory Commission.''        The nuclear industry is once again demonstrating that it is       not only dirty and dangerous but that it is also not cost       competitive. Despite promises that this time would be       different, the four Toshiba-Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear       reactors under construction in the U.S., two at Southern       Company's  [[Page H4961]]       Plant Vogtle in Georgia and two at SCANA's V.C. Summer plant       in South Carolina, have yet again shown that the nuclear       industry is incapable of building new reactors within budget       or on time even with significant federal and state financial       incentives and new, streamlined federal licensing processes.        Reports issued in recent weeks show that the costs of these       projects are out of control, and falling further and further       behind schedule. Both are approximately 40% complete in terms       of construction, yet have already more than doubled in cost       and projected construction time. When construction started in       2009, Vogtle 3 and 4 were projected to cost a total of $14       billion and to begin generating electricity in 2016 and 2017,       respectively. Eight years later, the reactors may not be       completed until 2022 and 2023, if ever, and at an estimated       total project cost of $29 billion. Summer 2 and 3 were       projected to cost $11 billion, but overruns have pushed the       total to at least $22.9 billion. Consequently, utility       customers in both states are suffering as they are paying in       advance for the financing costs associated with the projects       far longer than initially predicted and will ultimately face       increasing bills because of the projects' costs overruns.        H.R. 1551 would unfairly reward Southern Company and SCANA       Corp. for not being able to complete these projects on time,       providing them each with more than $1 billion in taxpayer-      provided handouts to shield their shareholders from the       financial responsibility of pursuing inherently risky,       uneconomical projects. Perhaps even worse, eliminating the       placed-in-service date will provide an incentive for yet       other utilities to make the same mistakes.        The purpose of tax incentives, whether for nuclear,       renewable energy, or other technologies, is to support       innovation and technological leadership in the energy sector       and to drive the commercialization of promising new       technologies. When the nuclear production tax credit was       created in 2005, Congress hoped to support a revival of       nuclear reactor construction. Only four out of thirty-two       reactors proposed since 2005 ever began construction, and the       vast majority of the rest have been cancelled or indefinitely       shelved.        The failures to bring any of the four reactors online       within the fifteen-year period of the tax credit program       demonstrates that the technology is an even greater failure       than the first generation of reactors, and it will never be       widely commercialized. It is simply not a justified or worthy       investment of taxpayers' money to grant the owners of these       reactors the extraordinary relief of billions of dollars in       subsidies for projects that hold no promise for the U.S.       energy sector. It should not be forgotten that Southern       Company's expansion of Plant Vogtle has already received       substantial taxpayer support through the $8.3 billion in       federal nuclear loan guarantees and the public/private cost-      sharing support during the permitting and licensing process.        Finally, we oppose H.R. 1551 because the legislation       establishes an expensive precedent by creating brand-new tax       credit value for any not-for-profit project partners that can       only be transferred to all for-profit project partners. Both       the Vogtle and Summer projects feature a combination of both       for-profit and not-for-profit utilities. Not-for-profit       utilities, such as rural cooperatives, municipal or state-      owned utilities, have no federal tax liability and therefore       are not entitled to tax credits. But under H.R. 1551, the tax       credit is made available for not-for-profit entities that can       only be transferred to the project's for-profit partners.       Furthermore, H.R. 1551 specifies that rural cooperatives may       treat tax credit transfers as funds collected for ``the sole       purpose of meeting losses and expenses''--that is, as a form       of debt relief, for which production tax credits were not       intended. These measures amount to a brand-new, taxpayer-      shouldered giveaway for both Southern Company and SCANA Corp.        Furthermore, the definition of ``eligible partners'' that       can receive the tax credits from the not-for-profit       partner(s) is troubling as it ``includes any person who       designed or constructed the nuclear power plant, participates       in the provision of nuclear steam or nuclear fuel to the       power plant, or has an ownership interest in the facility.''       Providing tax credits to reactor suppliers or the uranium       mining industry is objectionable and goes beyond the original       intent of the law to provide incentives to actual nuclear       utilities that were among the first to pursue new nuclear       generation.        The rationales provided for eliminating the placed-in-      service date for the nuclear production tax credit are       irrelevant and have no merit:        ``The cost of H.R. 1551 is minimal.'' The cost of the       nuclear production tax credits is at least $5.2 billion. Due       to both eliminating the placed-in-service date and by       permitting qualified public entities to transfer credits to       an eligible project partner, the latter provision would       actually increase the cost of the tax credits by allowing       non-profit, tax-exempt owners of reactors to take a large       federal tax credit. State and municipal utilities and rural       cooperatives are major owners of both the Vogtle and Summer       projects: rural cooperatives own 54.3% of the Vogtle 3 and 4       reactors; and Santee Cooper owns 45% of the Summer 2 and 3       reactors. By permitting these tax-exempt entities to transfer       tax credits to private sector partners, H.R. 1551 would       double the anticipated amount of the tax credits for the       Summer and Vogtle projects. The credits are valued at $18 per       megawatt-hour of electricity generated for the first eight       years. This would amount to about $160 million per year for       each reactor--$1.3 billion each, or $5.2 billion for all four       reactors. Taxpayers stand to avoid a $5.2 billion expense if       none of the reactors come online before the tax credits       expire at the end of 2020. By eliminating the placed-in-      service date, H.R. 1551 could cost taxpayers billions of       dollars for a failed technology.        ``The tax credits are essential to the completion of the       Vogtle and Summer projects.'' It is not clear that the tax       credits will have any effect on the outcome of the Vogtle and       Summer projects at this point. Each of the reactors under       construction is now $5 billion to $7 billion over budget.       Even $1.3 billion in tax credits is not enough offset such       massive cost overruns; and, in/ any case, the benefits of the       production tax credit were assumed when the utilities began       building the reactors. If the utilities determine to complete       the reactors despite the cost overruns, the value of the tax       credits will not be a decisive factor.        ``The tax credits are essential to maintaining U.S.       leadership in the global nuclear industry.'' Extending the       nuclear production tax credit will do nothing to promote U.S.       leadership in nuclear technology or reactor exports. The tax       credits themselves will derive to the domestic utilities that       will own and operate the Vogtle and Summer reactors, not the       manufacturers that design, export, and build reactors. The       nuclear divisions of Westinghouse and General Electric are       the only two U.S.-based companies actively involved in the       global reactor market, but both are now owned by Japanese       corporations (Toshiba and Hitachi). As a result of       Westinghouse's bankruptcy, Toshiba has determined not to       build any more new reactors, and not to continue supporting       the AP1000 reactor design. GE-Hitachi's prospects are no       better. The company has only two reactors in construction       globally (both in Japan and long-delayed).        ``A viable commercial nuclear power industry is necessary       to support the nation's defense nuclear complex.'' This would       be a hypocritical reason to provide a subsidy to reactors,       and could prove dangerous to peace and security domestically       and globally. The U.S. is under international treaty       obligations to maintain a strict separation of civilian and       military applications of nuclear technology. Historically,       the U.S. government's purpose in promoting commercial nuclear       power was to encourage the peaceful application of atomic       energy, not to advance nuclear weapons. If the U.S. is       perceived as promoting civilian nuclear power as a means of       bolstering our nuclear weapons program, then it will       undermine our credibility in the nonproliferation arena. It       could also encourage enemies to view nuclear power plants as       extensions of our military establishment, and hence as       legitimate targets in armed conflict.        We strongly oppose this bill and urge you to vote against       this undeserved industry bailout. We urge Congress to oppose       this provision and instead focus on low- or no-carbon energy       choices that can be deployed affordably in the near-term, at       low risk, that will lead us to a clean and sustainable       future.

Mr. Speaker, I believe that there is an important  additional concern raised by our colleague Mr. Neal already.    And that is the fact that there are so many other  additional measures that our colleagues' bipartisan efforts that are  pending in our committee on energy-efficient residential property, on  fuel cells, on small wind energy, on geothermal heat pumps, to mention  only a few. These represent forms of energy and energy conservation  that will help us address climate change while achieving our energy  objectives.   Mr. Speaker, instead of today's measure, our focus should be on safe,  healthy forms of energy instead of an industry that costs too much and  poses too much danger to humans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I salute all of  those who are here today offering the bills--this one, and the four  other related bills--that are being considered; particularly, Mr.  Davis, who now holds the position as ranking Democrat on the Human  Resources Subcommittee, a job that I have held for the last several  years; and Ms. Bass, who has so ably led our Foster Care Caucus. I  think it is unfortunate that they are here; unfortunate because all of  this business should have been resolved last year.   All five of these modest bills would already be helping children  today but for the way the so-called Family First Prevention Services  Act was bungled last year. Each of these five bills were a part of it.  But, unfortunately, families, and particularly families caring for  foster children, have not, and are still not, among the first  priorities of this Congress.   Of course, here in the House, there were many speeches. We had  extensive hearings year after year concerning foster children and the  horrors of child abuse. But speeches alone can't do the job.   There are also many people of goodwill who genuinely care about this  foster care problem in both parties. Mrs. Walorski is certainly one of  those individuals.   But all of us encountered a big problem last year in the Ways and  Means Committee when the Family First Prevention Services Act came up.  It was the same problem we faced in the last Congress when Senator  Wyden and I offered a larger version of the same piece of legislation.   The Ways and Means Committee majority leadership objects to adding a  dime of additional revenue to accompany our speeches. The majority  rejected my recommendation for a tax compliance measure to simply  require the reporting of alimony payments. If you get alimony, it is a  form of income, but there is no report required. This is not an  increased tax. It is a way of avoiding tax evasion. And it would have  raised the revenues necessary to fund the additional Family First  prevention services.   When this bill reached the Senate, the House's decision to reject  that approach, or any other reasonable pay-for, was, instead, relying  on what you could call basically a ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach  by cutting funds in support of adoptions and shifting funds from one  part of the foster care system to another part. That, unfortunately,  became the excuse in the Senate to block the bill from being passed. I  have to say that my home State of Texas, under Federal court order, to  correct its many unconstitutional abuses in the foster care system,  wrongfully led the way in blocking the Family First bill.   As to the particular bills that we have up today, this one recognizes  how mobile our society is and how much we need to be able to go across  the country in addressing this problem.   The earlier bill that we considered concerning children who age out  of the foster system that Ms. Bass sponsored--really important--we  heard time and again about the challenges that those children face when  they are, essentially, dumped out on the street at age 18 or age 21,  depending on which State they are in; and challenges particularly for  young women who find themselves in that situation without adequate  preparation or adult help.   This bill that we considered addressed the primary problem of limited  Federal investment in helping these vulnerable older youth prepare for  independence. I don't have any objection to it or to any of the bills  that are being considered today. I object only to the ideological  insistence of some in the majority that any additional revenue from any  source, no matter how reasonable, cannot be placed in a deficient  foster care system, which too many of our States will not fix.   And today's changes do not appear to add any actual new resources to  foster care, and, indeed, they are likely to be overwhelmed by one cut  after another that President Trump is proposing, particularly the  Medicaid cuts that are being forced through this Congress, that are  very important to foster youth and to all children.   So in this Congress--so indifferent to the education and social  service and health needs of children of all types across our country-- perhaps only taking a little step is the best we can expect to meet the  needs of the most vulnerable children in our society.   But I think all of us must be committed to work together to find a  day when we are willing to take truly meaningful action before, rather  than after, children--more children--are needlessly lost.
