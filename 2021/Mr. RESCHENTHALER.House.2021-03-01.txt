 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Cole for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, which should more appropriately be titled, the  for the politicians act, is nothing more than a top-down Federal power  grab that nationalizes our elections and empowers the Democratic party  to permanently hold on to their majority.   Article I, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution gives States the  primary role in establishing election law and in administering  elections.   H.R. 1 upends this constitutional balance by forcing States to  permanently expand mail-in voting, legalize ballot harvesting, and  disregard voter ID laws. Even more alarming, this bill allows for the  first-ever Federal funding of campaigns, creating a 6 to 1 government  match to small-dollar donors. This means that for every $200 donated,  the Federal Government would contribute $1,200. Additionally, certain  voters will be given publicly funded vouchers to donate to candidates  of their choice.   H.R. 1 also stifles free speech and empowers President Biden's IRS to  target conservative organizations and deny them their tax-exempt  status.   Last, but certainly not least, H.R. 1 increases vulnerability for  foreign election interference at a time when we should be increasingly  more vigilant about hostile regimes seeking to undermine our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and  ``no'' on H.R. 1.
