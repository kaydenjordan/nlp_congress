 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Castro) for yielding, and for bringing this important legislation to  the floor and giving us a chance to honor our values in the most  bipartisan way.   One of the saddest things of all of this is how many people are  suffering.  [[Page H4665]]  One of the joys of it is that it has enabled us to work together over  the years.   Madam Speaker, I would ask the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith)  how many years--at least, 30, working together on this subject.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Uyghur Forced Labor  Prevention Act and the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, two strong  bipartisan bills to send a strong message to Beijing and to the world  that the U.S. Congress will not allow human rights to be sacrificed for  commercial interest.   As I have said many times, if America does not speak out for human  rights in China because of commercial interest, we lose all moral  authority to speak out about human rights anywhere in the world.                                time  1230    I salute Chairman  Jim McGovern, chair of the Congressional-Executive  Commission on China and chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission, a leading voice in the country and in the Congress for  human rights.   I thank Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, one of our new freshmen, for  her early leadership and dedication she has brought to this priority.   I thank, also, Mr. Smith, and I acknowledge our working together over  the years. He is now the ranking member of the Congressional-Executive  Commission on China and co-chair of the Lantos Commission.   I salute our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel,  and our leaders in the Senate, Senator Rubio and Senator Merkley.   I thank our chairman, again, for this opportunity and so many of our  Members who have spoken on this issue.   Beijing's barbarous actions targeting the Uyghur people continue to  be an outrage to the collective conscience of the world. Across the  Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Uyghur people and other Muslim  majorities are brutally repressed in a pervasive state of mass  surveillance and predictive policing used to discriminate against and  violate the human rights of minorities: incidents of mass shootings,  extrajudicial killings, intimidation and suppression of journalists  courageously exposing the truth, and the mass incarceration of more  than--and this is a lower figure; I think it is higher, but it is a  conservative figure--1 million innocent people with beatings, solitary  confinement, deprivation of food and medical treatment, and extensively  documented programs of forced labor.   So if you are out there watching the Congress, know what this means  to you. The exploitation of people in China has a direct impact on our  trade policy and on our values, first and foremost.   Tragically, the products of the forced labor often end up here in  American stores and homes. In fact, roughly one in five cotton garments  sold globally contains cotton or yarn from the Xinjiang region, the  Uyghur region.   We must shine a light on the inhumane practice of forced labor, hold  the perpetrators accountable, and stop this exploitation. And we must  send a clear message to Beijing: These abuses must end now.   I remember years ago when Mr. Smith and Frank Wolf visited forced  labor--I don't know if you call them prisons or whatever--in China.  Their courage to go there was so overwhelming to the rest of us. They  were able to document what we needed to know.   Unfortunately, the challenge to the conscience that they brought to  us was not heeded by all here. We could overwhelmingly win in the House  and even in the Senate but not be able to override a veto, whether it  was a Democrat or a Republican in the White House.   But I remember how brave they were and how brave those prisoners were  to show them the evidence of the forced labor so we could make the case  to workers in America: You have been subjected to the exploitation of  workers there; that is an exploitation of workers here.   Again, we were proud, in May, to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy  Act, which uncovers the truth of China's abuses and ensures that those  supporting labor camps, and urges the application of targeted sanctions  against those involved in the oppression of the Uyghur people.   Today, we build on that overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation with  these two bills which, together, will ensure that goods made in the  Xinjiang region and imported to the United States are not made with  forced labor.   Congress must and will continue to speak out against Beijing's other  human rights abuses, like the decades-long abuse faced by the Tibetan  people--the Chinese are there to crush their culture, eliminate their  language, and suppress their religion; their assault on the honor of  His Holiness the Dalai Lama by saying they will choose his successor  goes beyond the pale and it is a challenge to the conscience of the  world--the Hong Kong fight for democracy and the rule of law, which  they oppress; and the jailing of journalists, human rights lawyers,  Christians, and democracy advocates on the mainland.   That is why the House is proud to have passed legislation, including  the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the Hong Kong Autonomy  Act, and the Tibet Policy and Support Act, which we urge the Senate to  take up immediately. All of this was passed in an overwhelmingly  bipartisan way because we respect the dignity and worth of every  person.   We have always said that we cannot look the other way when this  oppression of millions of people is taking place, and we are acting  upon those values and those beliefs that we have.   In honor of the millions fighting for their dignity, safety, and  rights in China and around the world, I urge a strong bipartisan vote  for the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and the Uyghur Forced Labor  Disclosure Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. McCaul, ranking member on the  committee of jurisdiction, and everyone for their support.
