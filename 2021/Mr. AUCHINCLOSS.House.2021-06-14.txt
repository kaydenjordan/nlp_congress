 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of investing in  our care economy.   Recently, I visited Triumph Incorporated, a Head Start program in the  city of Taunton in my district. Triumph provides low-cost and high- quality early education and childcare for children in our community.   Senator Warren and I heard from parents about the impact Triumph made  on their lives. In addition to caring for their children, the facility  provided a space for community and friendship for young families. From  kindergarten readiness to nurturing children with developmental  differences, the educators and administrators at Triumph show up for  those in need.   Every family in America deserves access to high-quality, affordable,  and accessible early childhood education and childcare. By investing in  caregiving, we will help Americans get back to work, create good-paying  jobs, and build an economy that works for everyone.                            ____________________
