 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to the FISA Amendments Reauthorization  Act of 2017, which reauthorizes section 702 of FISA for 6 years without  enacting adequate protections for our privacy.   Supporters of this measure want to convince us a new, incredibly  narrow warrant provision actually constitutes reform. It does not. Our  right to privacy does not begin when the Department of Justice has a  fully formed criminal case against us, nor does it begin when  prosecutors enter our emails and text messages into evidence against us  in court.   The Constitution guarantees far more than this. Our right to privacy  protects us when the government first makes its decision to search our  private communications for information it might find useful. S. 139  falls well short of this basic guarantee. We, therefore, cannot--we  must not--support this bill.   Make no mistake: S. 139 is not a compromise. The Judiciary Committee,  the technology companies, civil society, and other critical  stakeholders were shut out of this conversation long ago.   S. 139 does not include a meaningful warrant requirement. The rule in  this bill does not apply to most searches of the section 702 database.  It does not apply to a query for any information that ``could mitigate  a threat,'' an exception that threatens to swallow the entire rule. As  a result, S. 139 allows the FBI unfettered access to this information  for purely domestic nonterrorism cases without a warrant.   What does that mean in the year of Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump? It  means that absolutely nothing stops the Department of Justice from  trolling the database for evidence that you use marijuana or failed to  pay your taxes or may be in the country unlawfully or possess a firearm  that you should not have. None of these cases have anything to do with  the core purposes of section 702, and all of them should require a  warrant based on individualized suspicion and probable cause.   I agree with Chairman Goodlatte that section 702 should be  reauthorized. I understand its importance to the intelligence agencies.  But none of us should support this bill which pretends at reform while  codifying some of the worst practices of the intelligence community in  domestic crimes.   When we came to Congress, each of us took an oath to defend and  protect the Constitution of the United States. I ask that each of my  colleagues honor that oath today and that we work together to defeat  this bill and to bring the right set of reforms to the floor without  delay.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, many of us are opposing this bill and  supporting the amendment because it is very different from the  Judiciary Committee bill that we reported, which was a good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me repeat the refrain of those of  us who are members of the Judiciary Committee who have gone through  this process since 9/11, and that is that we support the integrity and  the importance of section 702 as a national security tool, and we want  it reauthorized, but we want it right.   Our job and our task is also to be the protectors of the Fourth  Amendment, and that is the protection of the American people against  unreasonable search and seizure.   No matter how much my friends on the other side of the aisle argue,  we know that the FBI can have the tools that it needs; but, in the  instance of this underlying bill, similar to the bill that was passed  in 2007 by the Bush administration, on which the Judiciary Committee  came back and amended it and made it a bill that provides the tools  that were needed by those who are on the front lines in the United  States military and the FBI, ultimately, it was changed to deny those  rights.   In this instance, the warrant that my friends are talking about is  revised only to fully predicated cases. It does not apply to the  searching of documents that will have information about Americans.   I ask my colleagues to postpone this. Let us work together on behalf  of the American people. Who are we if we cannot uphold the  Constitution? It is not protected in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in  strong opposition to S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of  2017.''   S. 139 reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, which is scheduled to expire on January 19, 2018.   Section 702 authorizes the Justice Department and NSA to collect non- U.S. persons' communications that are sent while abroad.   The collection programs have to be approved each year by the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court).   The FISA Court was set up by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act (FISA; Public Law 95-511) to oversee intelligence- gathering activities and ensure compliance with the U.S. Constitution.   Under FISA, the term ``U.S. person'' covers citizens, green card  holders, associations with a ``substantial number of members'' who are  U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and U.S.-incorporated companies.   Title VII also allows intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance  on a specific U.S. person reasonably believed to be outside of the  country, with the approval of the FISA Court.   The NSA's use of section 702 authority to collect Americans'  information from their communications with foreign surveillance targets  was revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.   Snowden also revealed that the NSA obtains communications from U.S.- based providers such as Google, Verizon, and Facebook.   Although Section 702 is a critical national security tool set to  expire on January 19, 2018, events of the recent past strongly suggest  that Section 702 should not be reauthorized without necessary and  significant reforms that are not included in the legislation before us.   So as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I oppose the bill for  several compelling reasons:   1. S. 139 fails to address the core concerns of Members of Congress  and the American public--the government's use of Section 702  information against United States citizens investigations that have  nothing to do with national security.   2. The warrant ``requirement'' contained in the bill is riddled with  loopholes and applies only to fully predicated, official FBI  investigations, not to the hundreds of thousands searches the FBI runs  every day to run down a lead or check out a tip.   3. S. 139 exacerbates existing problems with Section 702 by codifying  so-called ``about collection,'' a type of surveillance that was shut  down after it twice failed to meet Fourth Amendment scrutiny.   4. S. 139 is universally opposed by technology companies, privacy,  and civil liberties groups across the political spectrum from the ACLU  to FreedomWorks.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us comes from the Intelligence  Committee, where it was passed on a strict party-line vote.   This stands in stark contrast to H.R. 3989, the USA Liberty Act the  bipartisan bill reported by the Judiciary Committee after multiple  hearings, an open markup process, and a bipartisan vote of approval.   The USA Liberty Act enjoys much broader support, contains meaningful  reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and is far  superior to the bill before us.   Inexplicably, the House Republican leadership did choose the best  option, which was to bring the USA Liberty Act to the floor for debate  and vote; instead, they chose the worst option, which is S. 139, the  bill before us.   For this reason, I urge all members to join me in supporting the  Amash-Lofgren Amendment, the best option remaining before us.   The Amash-Lofgren strike the text of S. 139 in its entirety and  substitutes in its place the text of the ``Uniting and Strengthening  America by Reforming and Improving the Government's High-Tech  Surveillance Act'' (``USA RIGHTS Act'').   In contrast to S. 139, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' enacts necessary and  meaningful reforms to Section 702, which are necessary in light of the  past abuses of surveillance authorities, contemporary noncompliance  with this authority, and the danger posed by potential future abuses.   First, the USA RIGHTS Act creates a search warrant requirement that  closes the so-called ``backdoor search loophole'' through which the  government searches, without first obtaining a court-issued warrant  based on probable cause, for information about U.S. persons or persons  inside the U.S.   The ``USA RIGHTS Act'' provides an exception for emergencies, but  requires a court warrant afterward.   Second, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' prohibits the collection of domestic  communications and permanently ends ``about'' collection, an illegal  practice the National Security Agency recently stopped because of  persistent and significant compliance violations.   This is important because while ``reverse targeting'' is prohibited  under the Jackson Lee Amendment incorporated in the USA Freedom Act  enacted on June 2, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-23), this prohibition was often  skirted by collecting information from communications that merely  mention an intelligence target.   Under the ``USA RIGHTS Act'', collections would be limited to  communications that are ``to'' or ``from'' a target, and the  intentional collection of wholly domestic communications is prohibited.   Third, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' requires the government give notice  when it uses information obtained or derived from Section 702  surveillance in proceedings against U.S. persons or people on U.S. soil  which will enable a defendant to assert his or her constitutional  rights and help ensure that foreign intelligence surveillance is not  being misused.   Fourth, under the ``USA RIGHTS Act'', Section 702 authority sunsets  in 4 years, which will obligate the Congress to exercise regular  oversight and provide the opportunity to make necessary reforms before  reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  was enacted to protect the liberty and security of Americans, not to  diminish their constitutional rights.   All Americans want to find the common ground where commonsense rules  and regulations relating to fighting terrorism at home and abroad can  exist while still protecting the cherished privacy and civil liberties  which Americans hold close to our collective hearts.   That is why Section 702 should not be reauthorized with reforms to  prevent the government from using information against its political  opponents or members of religious, ethnic, or other groups.   One way to do that without interfering with the national security  objectives of 702 surveillance is simply to reject S. 139 and support  the USA RIGHTS Act by voting for the Amash-Lofgren Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I noted in an op-ed published way back in October 2007,  that as Alexis de Tocqueville, the most astute student of American  democracy, observed nearly two centuries ago, the reason democracies  invariably prevail in any military conflict is because democracy is the  governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that  are indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, courage, and a  love of justice.   And the best way to keep America safe and strong is to remain true to  the valued embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  [[Page H147]]    S. 139 does not strike the proper balance between our cherished  liberties and smart security.   We can do better; we should reject S. 139 and support the Amash- Lofgren Amendment.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu).   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, having served on Active Duty  in the United States military, when it comes to foreign terrorists on  foreign soil, we need to track them down and kill them. That is why I  support the FISA Act, as applied to foreigners.   But, unfortunately, this act has now been used to apply to Americans.  If you are going to do that, you need to follow the Constitution, you  need to put in a warrant requirement. Unfortunately, the Nunes FISA  bill does not do that. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS amendment.   At the end of the day, this is not about terrorists or terrorism. It  is about: Can you use warrantless information against Americans in a  domestic court?   That is what this issue is about. Don't let the intelligence agencies  scare you.   Vote ``no'' on the Nunes bill and ``yes'' on the USA RIGHTS  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, any responsible effort to authorize section  702 must pass three tests:   It must include a meaningful warrant requirement;   It must end the ``abouts'' collection until Congress says otherwise;  and   It must not restrict the government's ability to collect intelligence  on valid targets operating outside of the United States.   The underlying bill does not include a meaningful warrant  requirement, and it does not end ``abouts'' collection.   The Amash-Lofgren amendment, on the other hand, passes all three  tests:   It includes a warrant agreement that comports with the Fourth  Amendment;   It puts an end to ``abouts'' collection; and   It leaves the core functionality of section 702 perfectly intact. It  would be harder to use this authority to spy on United States citizens,  but the government's ability to gather intelligence on suspected  terrorists and others overseas will not be affected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and make a  meaningful change to section 702.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the many sponsors of this amendment for their  leadership in this important fight.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
