 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Georgia for the creative ways it is building a more  environmentally sustainable campus. Late last year, UGA golf course  superintendent Scott Griffith took up an interest in, of all things,  bees.   Alongside the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences,  Griffith established a beekeeping program on the golf course,  recognizing that it would make for an excellent outlet for educating  students about the importance of pollinators.   Bees, as we all know, play a vital role in maintaining our ecosystem.  These industrious insects pollinate our flowers and crops, helping to  maintain the delicate balance of nature that allows for a bountiful  supply of food and a greener world to live in.   Unfortunately, bees have faced numerous, sometimes existential  challenges in recent years. Pesticides, habitat loss, and deforestation  have all contributed to decline in the population of bees, which has  had a serious cascading effect throughout the food chain.   By providing a safe and nurturing environment for bees, the  university is not only helping to safeguard these creatures, but they  are also educating the next generation of leaders about the importance  of conservation and sustainability.   I again congratulate Mr. Griffith and all UGA faculty for their out- of-the-box thinking. I look forward to seeing the positive impact this  will have on the ecosystem and community in Athens.                                time  1130                        Congratulating Tierra Jackson     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Tierra  Jackson, a pharmacy student at the University of Georgia, for being  named president of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association.   As president, she is responsible for shaping the priorities of the  organization. She decided that the organization's theme for this year  would be Students Creating, Reimagining, and Innovating Pharmacy  Together. She hopes to bring together a broad group of students who are  interested about the profession of pharmacy, healthcare issues, and the  poor minority representation in these areas.   The Student National Pharmaceutical Association is a leading voice in  pharmacy education, has 120 chapters nationwide, and boasts over 5,000  members. This distinction is evidence of the diligence she carries with  her every day.   A native of Statesboro, Georgia, she received a bachelor of science  in pharmaceutical science degree. While an undergrad, she was the  president for the Pre-Pharmacy Society and vice president and service  coordinator of the NAACP. She is cofounder and vice president of the  Black Student Pharmacist Organization.   Even at such an early stage in her career, she has already displayed  leadership beyond her years. I am proud of Tierra Jackson and the  impact that she is having on shaping the future of the pharmacy and  pharmaceutical industry.   I congratulate her on her appointment, and I wish her a successful  tenure as president of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Georgia's Natalie Navarrete for being named a 2023 Rhodes  Scholar, an honor received by only the most outstanding young minds  from around the world.   As many of you know, the Rhodes Scholarship is the oldest and most  celebrated international fellowship award in the world. To be  recognized with such an honor is synonymous with the qualities typical  of the brightest people this country has to offer: hardworking,  brilliant, and boundary pushing.   Natalie is no exception. A Morehead Honors College student and  foundation fellow at the University of Georgia, Natalie is pursuing  degrees in international affairs, Russian, Spanish, and Latin American  and Caribbean studies.   She will continue her studies at the University of Oxford in October  where she plans to pursue a master's degree in Russian and Eastern  European studies. I have no doubt that she will continue to excel in  these studies and make important breakthroughs in her field.    I join the entire University of Georgia family in congratulating  Natalie on this truly extraordinary achievement. Her success is a  testament to world-class opportunities offered by the University of  Georgia, and I am confident that she will continue to make us all proud  for years to come.                            ____________________
