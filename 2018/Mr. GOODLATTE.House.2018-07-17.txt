 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 717) to promote pro bono legal services as a critical way in  which to empower survivors of domestic violence, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 717         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and       Represent Act of 2018'' or the ``POWER Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local,       State, tribal, and national levels and such violence or       behavior harms the most vulnerable members of our society.        (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of       Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic       violence during their lifetime.        (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all       forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the       violence that destroys lives and shatters families.  [[Page H6283]]         (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of       solutions at the local, State, and national levels are       necessary to combat such violence or behavior.        (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic       Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700       assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September       2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal       representation, were not met.        (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by       providing not only legal representation, but also access to       emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare.        (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the       provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic       violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking       reduces the probability of such violence or behavior       reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move       forward.        (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of       successfully obtaining a protective order against an       attacker, which prevents further mental and physical injury       to a victim and his or her family, as demonstrated by a study       that found that 83 percent of victims represented by an       attorney were able to obtain a protective order, whereas only       32 percent of victims without an attorney were able to do so.        (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include       commentary stating that ``every lawyer, regardless of       professional prominence or professional workload, has a       responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to       pay, and personal involvement in the problems of the       disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in       the life of a lawyer''.        (10) As leaders in their legal communities, judges in       district courts should encourage lawyers to provide pro bono       resources in an effort to help victims of such violence or       behavior escape the cycle of abuse.        (11) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this       mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause       and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence,       dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the       country.        (12) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal       services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence,       dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower       those survivors to move forward with their lives.       SEC. 3. DISTRICT COURTS TO PROMOTE EMPOWERMENT EVENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for a period       of 4 years, the chief judge, or his or her designee, for each       judicial district shall lead not less than 1 public event, in       partnership with a State, local, tribal, or territorial       domestic violence service provider or coalition and a State       or local volunteer lawyer project, promoting pro bono legal       services as a critical way in which to empower survivors of       domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and       stalking and engage citizens in assisting those survivors.        (b) Districts Containing Indian Tribes and Tribal       Organizations.--During each 2-year period, the chief judge,       or his or her designee, for a judicial district that contains       an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are       defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and       Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)) shall lead not       less than 1 public event promoting pro bono legal services       under subsection (a) of this section in partnership with an       Indian tribe or tribal organization with the intent of       increasing the provision of pro bono legal services for       Indian or Alaska Native victims of domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking.        (c) Requirements.--Each chief judge shall--        (1) have discretion as to the design, organization, and       implementation of the public events required under subsection       (a); and        (2) in conducting a public event under subsection (a), seek       to maximize the local impact of the event and the provision       of access to high-quality pro bono legal services by       survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual       assault, and stalking.       SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Report to the Director of the Administrative Office of       the United States Courts.--Not later than October 30 of each       year, each chief judge shall submit to the Director of the       Administrative Office of the United States Courts a report       detailing each public event conducted under section 3 during       the previous fiscal year.        (b) Report to Congress.--        (1) In general.--Not later than January 1 of each year, the       Director of the Administrative Office of the United States       Courts shall submit to Congress a compilation and summary of       each report received under subsection (a) for the previous       fiscal year.        (2) Requirement.--Each comprehensive report submitted under       paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of how each public       event meets the goals set forth in this Act, as well as       suggestions on how to improve future public events.       SEC. 5. FUNDING.         The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall       use existing funds to carry out the requirements of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on S. 717, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to be voting on S. 717, the Pro bono  Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2018, otherwise known as the POWER  Act.   The POWER Act directs that each year the chief judge in each judicial  district across the country hold at least one event in partnership with  domestic violence service providers or volunteer lawyer projects to  promote pro bono legal services for survivors of domestic violence and  sexual assault.   Lawyers play a critical role in combating domestic violence. Not only  do government prosecutors enforce criminal laws, but in the civil  realm, lawyers may provide legal representation in matters such as  civil protection order applications which ultimately help keep victims  safe from their abusers.   While victims are able to apply for these orders pro se, as this bill  makes clear, legal representation increases the possibility of  successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, which  prevents further mental and physical injury to a victim and his or her  family. One study has found that 83 percent of victims represented by  an attorney were able to obtain a protective order, whereas only 32  percent of victims without an attorney were able to do so.   Federal courts already promote many pro bono programs in their  judicial districts and have access to local attorneys who may be able  to volunteer to work with domestic violence victims. This bill not only  requires a public event in each Federal judicial district for every  year during a 4-year period, it also requires an additional public  event to be held every 2 years during the 4-year period in districts  that contain Tribes or Tribal organizations that specifically focus on  encouraging pro bono legal services for Indian or Alaska Native victims  of domestic violence.   I would like to thank Senator Sullivan from Alaska for introducing  this bill and shepherding it through the Senate. And I would like to  thank Mr. Kennedy from the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts for  introducing this bill in the House. This is an extremely important  issue, and I hope it will make a real difference in increasing legal  services to victims.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the POWER Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), who is the  Republican Conference chair.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the POWER  Act.   Survivors of sexual and domestic violence must know that they have a  place to turn where they can step out of the shadows of abuse to find  hope. To provide that hope, the POWER Act will bring more tools and  resources to communities so that survivors can find access to legal  services that they need. It will also encourage lawyers across the  country to get involved in these cases, and it will help people break  free from the dangerous cycle of abuse.   No one should ever have to live in fear of being intimidated from  seeking justice. The first step is making sure they courageously know  where they can safely go for help. Today, to build on our work to make  our communities safer, I urge my colleagues to join me in sending the  POWER Act to the President's desk to become law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House who has  been a real champion in combating domestic violence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill. I thank the Senator from  Alaska, Mr. Sullivan, for working with me and my staff. On the minority  side as well, I thank Congressman Kennedy, Mr. Raskin, and the ranking  member on the Judiciary Committee.   This is truly a bipartisan effort to help educate people who are the  victims of domestic violence about better ways that they can protect  themselves and avail themselves of good representation in court.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
