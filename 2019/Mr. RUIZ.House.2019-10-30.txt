 Madam Speaker, earlier this month, James Madison Elementary  School in Indio, California, closed after rust, mold, and corrosion  were found in the columns and the walls supporting the building,  compromising the school's infrastructure and putting students,  teachers, and staff at risk.   This is symptomatic of outdated and weak infrastructure in schools  throughout our Nation. Thankfully, the Desert Sands Unified School  District board closed the school and transferred students to another  facility.   The cost of our schools' outdated infrastructure is adding up. We  need big and bold investments in school infrastructure to keep our  students safe, prevent school closures, and help our students compete.   That is why I cosponsored and urge a vote on the Rebuilding America's  Schools Act of 2019, to invest $100 billion in schools' much-needed  physical and digital infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 865, the  Rebuilding America's Schools Act of 2019, and prioritize students'  well-being, safety, and education.                            ____________________
