 Mr. Speaker, obviously, it is a new year, and we  return to Washington with an agenda that is completely full and, in  many, many ways, a tragic and an extremely dangerous agenda out ahead  of us.   Last December, this House undertook the issue of how to deal with the  issue of a President who was not paying attention to his oath of  office, and so we passed an impeachment resolution. That issue is now  over in the Senate and in their hands. I could spend some time talking  about that.   Then, last Friday, another issue occurred, and I will spend more time  talking about that a little later.   But what I came to the floor tonight for is to talk about what our  Democratic Caucus, our leadership, and the 230-plus members of our  Caucus have been working on diligently over the last year for the  people, a series of legislative initiatives that address the  fundamental concerns that America has, that Americans talk about, as we  like to say, at their breakfast table or dinner table: the concerns  about their family's education, about their job, about their  retirement, and, as I learned yesterday from my neighbor, a rancher,  about the extraordinary cost of health insurance.   I come to the floor tonight for that purpose, but I am going to delay  my discussion of that and ask the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee,  Bobby Scott, to talk about the extraordinary work that his  committee has done on the issue of education and for the working men  and women of America.   Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott)  represents one of the largest military districts in the Nation, and I  know that the thoughts of his constituents are on our minds. I also  know that it is time for America to recognize the work that he has done  on the Education and Labor Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, the gentleman can use the word ``brag,''  but I would recommend that it is not bragging. It is simply a fact; not  an alternate fact, but it is a fact that the gentleman's committee and  this House--now under Democratic control--has passed well over 250  bills that are for the people.   The work that the Committee of Education and Labor has done for the  working men and women of this Nation is an extraordinary example of  what can be done when we focus on legislation that is for the people.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman did mention the grim  reaper, I don't think by name, but, clearly, the Senate leader intends  to delay legislation that would be in the interest of the American  people: higher wages, better healthcare, better insurance products,  jobs, making it in America, all of the things that I know the gentleman  and his committee have worked so hard on.  [[Page H9]]    So I thank the gentleman for that, and I look forward to the days  ahead when I know that the gentleman has an additional agenda of  legislation that he is going to be putting on the floor of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am sure the gentleman will. I thank the  gentleman very much.   Mr. Speaker, I am really torn. I want to continue discussing the  legislation that is out there, but I really stand in front of this  Chamber--which at the moment is empty--with a very, very heavy heart  and extraordinary concern.    I am looking at where we are as a nation this evening, and I am going  to really ponder tomorrow what fate may behold our men and women in the  military.   A couple of hours ago the inevitable happened. I think I was a  freshman in high school and my science teacher was trying to give me  some of the principles of physics. He was talking about for every  action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.   He was showing various examples of that and, of course, I was then  playing football and I could really understand. I hit somebody, and  they would hit me back; or I would push somebody and they would push  back. I would like to think that I was more than equal.   Last Friday, our President took an action and launched missiles at  the highest commander of the Iranian military and killed him, along  with one of the major, if not the major commander of the militia units  in Iraq.   That attack took place just outside the Baghdad International  Airport. That was an action, presumably, to prevent some future action  that might be taken by the Iranians and by their leader or directed by  their leader, Soleimani.   My high school science teacher could not have been more correct. For  every action, there is a reaction. And we will undoubtedly engage in a  debate here on the floor and in the Congress and across the United  States about whether the first action taken by the President to take  out the leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was an appropriate action.   I think not, for a variety of reasons. And then we will also debate  whether the Iranian reaction to that action which occurred a couple of  hours ago was appropriate.   I am quite sure that our military on the base in Iraq at Al Asad  views the Iranian action as a very serious threat. We don't yet know  the results of the bombardment of missiles, but we can assume that  there was certainly destruction of buildings or airfields and we pray  that there was no destruction of life.   But perhaps we may find that prayer unanswered. Where do we go from  here? Where do we go from here? We are not on the verge of war. In a  very, very unfortunate, tragic sense, we are in a war and some would  claim that war is now 40 years old and started way back with the  embassy in Tehran being occupied, and we could say that is correct.   This is different. I am on the Armed Services Committee, and I have  had the briefings and I know, as do our generals and our intelligence  community, the capabilities of the Iranian military. Furthermore, we  know the capabilities of their proxies, the various military units that  they have set up, or quasi-military units that they have set up: the  militias, Yemen, Houthis, Hezbollah, and others.   It is really a moment this evening for us to hold our anger, which is  a normal and natural thing that certainly I, and I am sure every one of  my colleagues possesses: anger at the attack on our military base.   I suppose we should also think that perhaps Iran should hold its  anger, although they certainly expressed it in the streets, in the  funeral ceremonies, and in the launching of ballistic missiles at an  American air base.   We should hold our anger. We should say: Where does this go from  here? What is the next tit for tat? Unfortunately, I don't believe our  President thought about the next move, about the equal and opposite  reaction when he ordered the launching of the missiles that took out a  very dangerous, bad, bad person.   I don't think he thought about the next order, nor do I think he  thought about the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth order. Where does it  go from there?   But we have a chance this evening and tomorrow, and in the days  ahead, to stop and think about the next event, the next tit for tat.  What does it mean now for those of us in Congress, 435--I guess 434  since one of our colleagues resigned today--and the Senate--undoubtedly  occupied with impeachment?   It is time for us to reach into our desk drawer and pull out the  Constitution of the United States and read Article I, and for the  American people to do the same. When we read that, we will find that  only Congress can declare war; not the President, not the Secretary of  State, not the Secretary of Defense, and not a general, but only  Congress.                                time  1945    Maybe we could argue that it is already starting, in which case,  stop, come to Congress, Mr. President, and tell us why you must, why we  must, why America must, and why our military must pursue the next tit  for tat. Stop and tell us where it leads. Tell us how you think it  might end.   I know that our Secretary of Defense says that we are not going to  start a war but that we will end it. Okay, then you come here. You come  to the floor of this House as Roosevelt did and as others have done,  and you tell us why we should have a war with Iran. Tell us how you  intend to pursue that war and at what cost in human lives and the  treasury of this Nation.   Then, let us ponder your wisdom or lack of wisdom. Let us ponder--no,  not ``let us.'' This is not a matter of the President letting us. This  is a matter of the Congress of the United States asserting its  constitutional obligation.   At this moment and on this day, when it is easy to argue that America  has been attacked, on this day, stop, come to us, Mr. President, and  tell us why you want to pursue a war with Iran. Tell us what equipment  you will need. Tell us the number of troops that will be dispatched.   Then it is our responsibility--535 of us--to say that, yes, we will  go to war with Iran, or, no, we will not.   This is a critical moment. This is a moment when I am thinking about  that science teacher who said that for every action, there is an equal  and opposite reaction. We have seen an action and a reaction. Yes, we  attacked Iran by taking out their top general, and, yes, they attacked  us by launching their missiles into our airbase and quite possibly  harming our military personnel and others.   Now stop. Come here, Mr. President. Stand before us. Stand before the  American people, and tell us why, how, and what it will cost to pursue  this.   That is his responsibility. Then it is our responsibility on behalf  of the American people and people beyond this Nation to say that, yes,  we will pursue a war, or, no, we will not.   Keep in mind, Mr. President, that the existing authorizations to use  force do not apply to this situation, not the authorization to use  force that was established for al-Qaida and Afghanistan, not the  authorization to use force to go after Saddam Hussein in Iraq. No.  Those don't apply.   This is different. This is demonstrably different. This requires the  President to come to the Congress and explain why we should conduct a  war with Iran.   It is not to say we cannot protect ourselves. But the next action by  our military likely would be far more an action of protection but,  rather, an action in response to what happened a couple of hours ago.   I would have loved and would have desired not to be here at this  moment, talking about this issue but, rather, following what Mr. Scott  had said about what has been done this last year for the American  people, about the efforts that we have made to bring down healthcare  costs, to provide pharmaceuticals that people can afford, and to  guarantee that Americans do not lose their right to health insurance,  as the President and our Republican colleagues are attempting and have  attempted to do for the last 10 years.   I would love to have spent this evening talking about that. I would  have loved to talk about the education programs that Mr. Scott has  already brought to our attention and to talk about raising the minimum  wage. But that is not where I am tonight.   My thoughts are with those military personnel, the airmen, many of  whom  [[Page H10]]  are from my district and probably at the bases there in the Middle  East. My thoughts are with them and their families. I pray that all are  safe.   And I pray that tonight or tomorrow morning a tweet says: ``I, the  President of the United States, will come to Congress and explain why  we should or should not pursue a war with Iran.''   It is a good time for all of us to pray. It is a good time for all of  us to take a deep breath and realize the path that we are on and where  it might lead.   I am deeply, deeply disturbed by what has happened. I am willing to  take up my responsibility here, and I anxiously await what the  President of the United States of America has to say as he stands here  in the Congress and explains to a joint session of the Senate and the  House why we should pursue a war with Iran. That is his responsibility,  and then it is our responsibility--elected by the people of America--to  go to war or not to go to war. We shall see.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 53 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, January 8, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
