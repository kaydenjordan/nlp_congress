 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the most  aggressively progrowth tax reform package passed since the Reagan  administration.   Each day, we learn about a new business giving a substantial bonus to  its employees, increasing wages, or reinvesting into their communities  because of tax reform. Today, ExxonMobil announced that they would  invest an additional $50 billion in the United States due to this law.  Many Arizonans are seeing the benefits from businesses such as Boeing,  Waste Management, and Arizona Public Service, just to name a few.   According to Americans for Tax Reform: ``At least 3 million Americans  are receiving special tax reform bonuses.'' These successes are taking  place long before tax reform has even  [[Page H657]]  been implemented fully. Most Americans have yet to learn how much more  money they will see in their paychecks.   Mr. Speaker, tax reform has placed us on the right course to keep our  booming economy humming at a good clip and sets the trajectory for even  more significant growth in the future. I predict a very prosperous new  year.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for leading  tonight's Special Order. It has been an eye-opening year in office for  me, and it is an honor to serve with Representative Gaetz on the  Judiciary Committee in the pursuit of justice.   Exactly 11 nights ago, Mr. Speaker, I walked into a secure vault,  signed one of the most detailed nondisclosure documents I have ever  seen, and viewed ``the memo.'' Everything I read was what I expected to  read. That is what is outrageous to me. There was not much that I did  not expect to find.    I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Gowdy, Chairman Nunes, and  members of the House Intelligence Committee who have now voted to  present that memo to the public. I am looking forward to President  Trump shortly declassifying that memo permanently.   I have heard people say to me: You are eroding trust in government  and in the finest law enforcement agency in the country, the FBI, with  your continual attacks. But they don't understand that we are not  attacking the FBI. We are seeking clarity, transparency, and an  understanding of what went on under the leadership of the Department of  Justice and the FBI in the previous administration. To not reveal that  to the public is what erodes trust in their government.   Nothing in this memo will impair our national security. But if we are  to withhold this memo from the American people, I believe that,  instead, would harm our national security because it would harm the  integrity of those agencies, and it would further erode the trust that  Americans have in their government.   The American people deserve to see the information that I have read,  that Mr. Gaetz has read, and that over 100 Members of Congress have  read. The leadership of Chairman Devin Nunes has made a tremendous  difference, and this truth will be exposed. I congratulate him.  [[Page H659]]    Mr. Speaker, this memo will provide clarity and understanding. This  is the memo, when it gets out, where the people will say: We need to  make changes. We have got to have people in these law enforcement  agencies and that lead these agencies and these bodies be trustworthy,  follow the law, and not abuse their power for political gain or  purpose.   Mr. Speaker, I trust my constituents. Frankly, in the last week, I  met with literally hundreds of my constituents. The most common theme  talked about was: When will that classified memo be released so I can  read it, so I can make a determination, so I can understand what has  been going on in our government?   I am so pleased that the House Intelligence Committee voted today to  answer the question. In short order you will be able to read this and  make up your own mind. That is why I encourage President Trump to  quickly declassify the memo.   Again, I thank my colleague, Representative Gaetz, and all who have  been working on this issue to make this memo open and transparent for  the people.
