 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Corporal Joseph  Maciel, who was killed July 7 from injuries sustained while in  Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel.   Corporal Maciel was only 20 years old and is remembered by those who  loved him for his infectious smile and love for his country. According  to his father Jose, Corporal Maciel knew in high school that he wanted  to serve his country. And when he enlisted in the Army, he made his  family proud.   Corporal Maciel was a beloved member of our community, admired by his  family and those he served alongside. He gave his life for freedom, and  we are forever indebted to his service and to him.   I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of  Corporal Joseph Maciel's friends and family in South Gate, California,  in my district, and I thank him for his service and his family for  their sacrifice.                             Cuts to EPA Funding     Mr. Speaker, for the last year, in my congressional  district, California's 44th District, which includes the communities of  Compton, Watts, South Gate, and the Port of Los Angeles, we have been  fighting to make sure we have access to clean air and to clean water.   We learned several months ago that there is something called  chromium-6 in the air, which is a deadly chemical that causes  respiratory problems and can lead to cancer.   Now, who oversees to make sure that these polluters are cracked down  on and that we make sure that polluters are held accountable? The EPA,  the Environmental Protection Agency.   This week this House is expected to consider FY 2019--fiscal year  2019, the Interior-Environment appropriations bill as part of a two- bill minibus. Now, this Republican bill puts the health and safety of  American people at risk.   What does it do? It is going to cut the Environmental Protection  Agency by $100 million. You heard me right. They are going to cut  funding for the EPA.   This is the agency that oversees at making sure that polluters are  held accountable. That, my friends, will put the American people in  jeopardy, and those polluters that are going around, across the country  and polluting things, like chromium-6 that is killing our kids and our  seniors and causing asthma and respiratory problems, it is going to  make it easier for them to pollute.  [[Page H6271]]                                     time  1045    What else does it do? It slashes clean water grant programs by $300  million. In my community in Compton, California, we recently had a  brown water crisis. It is still going on. There is brown water coming  out of the faucets. We don't have to think too far back as to what  happened in Flint, Michigan.   To think that we are having a vote this week that is going to cut  $300 million--money that is used to invest in America's water  infrastructure--is appalling. When I heard about it this week, I  thought it was important that the American people know about it. This  is what should be on the front page of the newspapers. This is what the  media should be reporting on, what is happening in this Congress and  how the American people are put at risk when such cuts are happening to  the very agencies that are put there to protect us, so that we ensure  that we have clean air and clean water.   As somebody who serves as the chair of two environmental task forces  here in Congress, we cannot allow this to continue to happen without  raising our voices, calling our elected officials, calling our offices,  and speaking out about what the American people want. And this is one:  Clean air and clean water is a basic right that everybody is entitled  to.   I believe this bill is going to take us backward. It is going to hurt  us. And it really hurts our ability to make sure that we continue to  look at things like climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this, and I urge  the American people to have their voices heard.                            ____________________
