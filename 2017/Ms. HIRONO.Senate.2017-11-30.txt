Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the Republican tax plan we are debating  today is a sham. It is a solution in search of a problem.   The President and his allies in Congress are bound and determined to  give the richest people in our country and large corporations huge tax  cuts that will magically trickle down to create a fantastic,  incredible, wonderful economy. Why? Why do we even need this?   Corporations and the richest 1 percent of people in our country are  doing just fine, thank you very much. They certainly don't need any  more goodies. Over the past 10 years, corporate profits have grown  exponentially. More wealth is concentrated in the hands of the top 1  percent than at any time since the Great Depression.   Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim this bill will spur  new investment and help workers. What world are they living in?   Corporations have sheltered over $2.6 trillion offshore to avoid  paying taxes. This is money they could already be using to create jobs,  build factories, or raise employee wages. It is not happening, and it  will not happen.   These people and corporations do not need more money and profits. On  the other hand, middle-class families have been seeing stagnant wages  for nearly 20 years. Healthcare continues to be a political football,  with the President sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and congressional  efforts to repeal the healthcare law. The cost of a college education  is increasingly out of the reach of middle-class families.   The list goes on.   Rather than crafting a tax plan that would actually help middle-class  families, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have decided to screw  them over instead--all to give rich people and corporations huge tax  cuts they do not need.   In Hawaii we have a word to describe what is happening here. The word  is ``shibai'' or B.S.   We have had little time to debate the devastating impact of this  massive bill, but even in the short amount of time we have had, it is  clear how many of the major provisions in this bill would harm middle- class families. For example, this bill eliminates the individual  mandate for healthcare, which is just another way to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. How many bites out of this repeal apple are the  Republicans going to take? Thirteen million people will lose their  health insurance. Premiums for everyone else will increase  significantly every year as a result of this yet another bite out of  the ACA apple. Do they think these millions of people who will be hurt  will not notice what is happening to them and their healthcare? I don't  think so.   The devastating impact of this bill is not limited to the parts we  have all heard about. The Republican tax scam has a number of obscure  provisions that are already having or will cause real harm.   The House bill, for example, eliminates the ability of State and  local governments to issue something called private activity bonds.  This kind of bond is certainly not something you hear being discussed  on ``Morning Joe'' or Wolf Blitzer, but they are critical to our  communities. Through private activity bonds, the Federal Government  allows State and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds to finance  certain kinds of projects that help our communities. State and local  governments routinely issue these kinds of bonds to construct schools,  hospitals, et cetera.   Although this bill hasn't even passed Congress yet, it is already  having a devastating impact. Let me give a concrete example. Residents  of West Maui have been waiting for a hospital for decades. Right now,  on their side of the island, if there is a medical emergency, the only  way an ambulance can get to West Maui to Maui Memorial--the island's  only hospital--is on a two-lane highway. One lane winds around the side  of a cliff, making it susceptible to falling rocks and flash floods.  The other lane is being eaten away by coastal erosion. So on a normal  day, when nothing goes wrong, it will take over an hour to reach Maui  Memorial from West Maui, but if there is traffic or an accident on the  highway, you can forget about it. For serious injuries, even an hour is  too long to wait for lifesaving medical care.   Construction of the West Maui Medical Center is clearly important and  needed. When the project is completed, West Maui will have, for the  first time, a dedicated emergency room and will offer essential  surgical and radiological services. It will save lives. Although  initial work on this project has begun, construction has stalled. Why?  Because the financing for the project is being held up out of fear that  Republicans in Congress will eliminate the private activity bonds this  project needs for completion.  [[Page S7526]]    Other hospitals in Hawaii have used these kinds of activity bonds.  Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Hawaii that offers  prenatal care and services for women has expanded their facilities and  their ability to treat literally thousands of new people.   I have visited this hospital. I have heard from them. They cannot  understand why Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress  could, in good conscience, cut a program that saves lives, all to  finance tax cuts--not needed--for the richest people and corporations  in our country.   The theory, certainly not reality, is that these huge tax cuts will  magically trickle down to create a fantastic, incredible, tremendous  economy. The fact that this theory has been thoroughly discredited and  in reality shown to be false is of little concern to them.   What exactly, then, is the problem this bill is supposed to address?   Over the past 10 years, corporate profits have grown exponentially.  This bill eliminates the State and local tax deduction that thousands  of taxpayers in Hawaii count on. These tax giveaways to the rich will  force States to make huge and painful cuts to public education,  essential social services, and infrastructure investment.   When the project is completed, West Maui will have a dedicated  emergency room and will offer essential surgical and radiological  services. It will save lives.   Brian Hoyle, the president of Newport Hospital Corporation, which is  building the West Maui Hospital, said, ``We're waiting to see what  Congress does. All of the health care community does not like this  bill. It's a very bad bill for the state of Hawaii.''   Other hospitals across Hawaii have used private activity bonds to  finance much-needed expansions of service.   With the help of private activity bonds, Kapiolani Medical Center for  Women and Children in Honolulu recently finished construction on its  Diamond Head Tower, which houses some of the hospital's most important  neonatal functions.   Last year, I visited the new 40,000-square-foot Neonatal Intensive  Care Unit, NICU. The NICU is five times larger than its former facility  and can better serve the more than 1,000 of the most vulnerable babies  born at the hospital every year.   In only a few days, Kapiolani will open its new emergency room, which  is twice the size of its old one, to the nearly 125 patients who come  through their doors every day.   I heard from Michael Robinson, Kapiolani's vice president of  government relations and community affairs, on how private activity  bonds could literally mean the difference between life and death for  Hawaii residents.   He wrote to me, saying:         Private activity bonds were critical in the construction of       Kapiolani Medical Center's Diamond Head Tower, enabling us to       expand our bed capacity and meet the needs of the most       critically ill children and their families throughout Hawaii.        It's difficult to understand why Congress is considering       eliminating private activity bonds when this method of       financing has been essential in providing non-profit       hospitals the resources to provide care to the patients they       serve.    As Michael said, it is hard to understand how Donald Trump and his  Republican allies in Congress could in good conscience cut a program  that saves lives to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.   If this bill passes before the end of this calendar year, it could  trigger $136 billion in mandatory cuts to essential programs, including  $25 billion in cuts to Medicare. Senator Booker, Senator Murray, and I  have submitted an amendment that would automatically undo the corporate  tax cut if these cuts to Medicare happen.   If we are serious about a tax plan that will truly help middle-class  families in a meaningful way, we need to kill this terrible bill and  start over.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
