 Madam Speaker, I rise today to put on notice every  State mooching New Jersey's tax dollars.   Last week, a new Rockefeller report revealed what we have known for  too long: Some States, like New Jersey, are paying their own weight and  paying their own way. Other States are not. They are mooching off the  rest of us.   My district his historically received 33 cents for every dollar it  sends to Washington, D.C., while other States, like Mississippi and  Alabama, receive 7 to 12 times that amount, depending upon the study.   According to one study, the National Priorities Project report, as  you see here, moocher States like Mississippi receive $4.38 for every  dollar they send to Washington.   This news is only compounded by the fact that, come tax season, the  tax hike bill, which gutted the State and local tax deductions, kicks  in and will really start to hurt my district. That was a giveaway to  the moocher States and was largely paid for by States like mine.   New Jersey is one of the top tax-paying States in the Nation, which  is why we must cut taxes there for residents and businesses of all  sizes and work with mayors to continue to do like I have done to claw  back more dollars to the State. We are already up 16 percent.   Madam Speaker, as this new Congress begins, I am making it one of my  core missions to reinstate the SALT deduction, stop double taxation,  and fight back against the moocher States who continue to rob us blind.  It is time to fight to get more dollars back to States like ours.                            ____________________
