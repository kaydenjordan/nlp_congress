 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Wicker, I  rise today to celebrate Emergency Nurses Week and all of the nurses  throughout the country and around the world working day in and day out  on the front lines to care for those in need.   More than 2 years ago now, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic turned  our emergency rooms into battle zones against the virus virtually  overnight, and our nurses fought that battle every single day. They  fought it when they were understaffed and didn't have personal  protective equipment. They fought it through a rise in violence in  their workplaces. They fought it as tireless advocates for their  patients, even while risking their own health and the well-being of  their own families. And they fought it through exhaustion and burnout.  These challenges came on top of an already existing shortage of trained  and qualified nurses, a raging opioid epidemic, and a mental health  crisis--and now a fentanyl crisis and the monkeypox outbreak.   Our nurses are heroes, and throughout the week of October 9, we will  join together to honor and celebrate their heroic work. They deserve  all the respect, admiration, and support of a grateful nation--not just  for 1 week, but indeed, every day of the year.                            ____________________
