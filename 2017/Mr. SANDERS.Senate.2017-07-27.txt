 Mr. President, let me begin by taking a moment to kind  of summarize for the American people where we are in this enormous  discussion which is causing a great deal of anxiety all over Vermont  and all over America.   Several months ago, the Republican-led House passed by, I believe,  three votes legislation that would throw 23 million Americans off of  the health insurance they currently have--23 million Americans, men,  women, and children, people who are struggling with cancer, heart  disease, diabetes, and with other life-threatening illnesses. They  would simply be thrown off of the health insurance they have.   That legislation also cut Medicaid by $800 billion over a 10-year  period. That means children with disabilities in Alaska or Vermont who  are now on Medicaid might no longer be able to get the help they need  in order to survive or to live a dignified life. At a time when  Medicaid provides two-thirds of the funding for nursing homes all over  this country, it means that if the Republican legislation were to  succeed, we don't know, but thousands and thousands of people all over  this country with Alzheimer's, with terrible illnesses, who are now in  nursing homes would be thrown out of their nursing homes.    Where would they go? Nobody really knows. When you cut Medicaid by  $800 billion and Medicaid funds two-thirds of nursing home care,  needless to say, people in nursing homes would be forced to leave, to  go--nobody knows where.   Right now in my State of Vermont and across this country, we are  dealing with a massive heroin and opioid crisis. Every day, people are  dying from heroin, opioid overdoses. It turns out that Medicaid is the  major source of funding in terms of treating heroin and opioid  addiction.   If you make massive cuts to Medicaid, the impact in States like  Vermont, West Virginia, Kentucky--States that are struggling with  opioid and heroin addiction--would be horrendous. People would no  longer be able to get the treatment they need.   I recall, during the campaign, Donald Trump said that he was a  champion of working families; he was going to stand up for workers,  take on the establishment. If the Republican House bill were to be  passed, older workers--people who are 60, 62 years of age--would see,  in many cases, at least a doubling of the premiums they pay. In many  cases, they would go from $4,000 a year today to over $8,000 a year.  That is not being a champion or a friend of the working class.   My Republican friends, and you hear them even today, talk about  freedom, choice. They love choice. They love freedom. People in America  should have the right to get healthcare anyplace they want. It should  be a right to have any insurance policy they want.   Two and a half million women have made a choice. The choice they have  made is they want to get quality healthcare through Planned Parenthood.  If the Republican bill in the House were to pass, those 2.5 million  women would be denied their choice.   You have a Republican bill in the House that throws 23 million people  off of health insurance. How many of those people will die? My  Republican friends get very nervous when I raise that issue because  they say--and I understand it--nobody here wants to see anyone die  unnecessarily. No Republican does, no Democrat, no American does.   According to study after study, including studies done at the Harvard  School of Public Health, when you throw 23 million people off of health  insurance--people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with  diabetes, people with life-threatening illnesses--what do you think  will happen? What these studies show is that thousands and thousands of  Americans every year will die unnecessarily because they will not have  the treatment they need to deal with their life-threatening illnesses.  That is the reality. That is not Bernie Sanders talking. That is study  after study. PolitiFact backed that up. They looked at all of the  studies. They said: Yes, thousands of people will die. That is the  result.   In the House bill, after you throw 23 million people off of health  insurance, raise deductibles, defund Planned Parenthood, after you make  older people pay more for healthcare, $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid,  what else is in the bill?   Oh, there are some people who will do well in the bill--not the  children, not the elderly, not the sick, not the poor. But there are  some people--and we have to acknowledge that--who would do well under  the Republican bill; that is, if you are in the top 1 percent.  Congratulations. Republican legislation, after throwing disabled  children off of healthcare, congratulations--you are going to get a  massive tax break.   Who in America believes that it makes sense to throw disabled  children off of health insurance and tell people with cancer that they  can't continue to get the treatment they need in order to get $300  billion in tax breaks for the top 1 percent and hundreds of billions  more in tax breaks for insurance companies and drug companies?   Do you know what? My Republican colleagues may think that is a good  idea. That is not what the American people believe. The latest poll  that I saw, the USA Today poll, had 12 percent of the American people  thinking that was a good idea. I can only believe those 12 percent had  not really looked at this issue. There is massive opposition from  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to this absurd Republican  proposal.   It is not just the American people who think that it is absurd to  give tax breaks to the rich and throw 23 million Americans off their  health insurance. It is not just the American people. It is  [[Page S4357]]  those people who are most engaged in healthcare in America--the people  who know the most.   It is important to understand that throughout this process, whether  in the House or in the Senate, virtually every major healthcare  organization in America--the people who treat us every single day are  opposed to this Republican legislation.   One might think that maybe my Republican colleagues would say: Well,  wait a second. What is going on when those in the American Medical  Association--our doctors, the people who treat us--think this  legislation is a mistake? Doctors say no. The American Hospital  Association says no because they understand that when you make massive  cuts to Medicaid, rural hospitals in Vermont and all over this country  may go under. Then what happens to a rural community that no longer has  its hospital?   The American Hospital Association is opposed to this legislation. The  American Cancer Society is opposed to this legislation. They know what  its impact will be for folks who are struggling with cancer. The  American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians,  the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric  Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Catholic Health  Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis  Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS Society, and the  American Nurses Association--one might think, when virtually every  major national healthcare organization in this country is opposed to  legislation, that maybe, just maybe, my Republican colleagues might  think twice about going forward.    In this process, they have not had the opportunity, amazingly enough,  to hear from doctors, to hear from hospital administrations, to hear  from patient advocates. As you well know, despite the fact that we are  dealing with an issue that impacts every single American--which is what  healthcare does--an issue that impacts one-sixth of the American  economy, over $3 trillion a year, there has not been one hearing, one  public hearing on this bill. This bill has been written behind closed  doors. Senator McCain the other day made that point.   How do you deal with one-sixth of the economy and their desire to  transform the American healthcare system without listening to one  doctor, without listening to one hospital administration, writing a  bill with a few Republican Senators behind closed doors?   This is an unprecedented and disastrous process for healthcare. On  those grounds alone, what every Member of this Senate should agree to-- and Senator McCain made this point; this process has been awful. Kill  it now. Go back to what is called regular process, regular order. Go  back to the committee and start this discussion. Please do not throw  22, 23 million people off of health insurance without hearing from  doctors, patient advocates, hospital administrators.   No, that is not where the Republicans are today. They want to rush  this through behind closed doors and get a quick vote on it.   Interestingly enough, as I understand it, Senator Daines of Montana  today is going to introduce legislation for a Medicare-for-all  healthcare system. That is very interesting. I hope this is really a  breakthrough on the part of my Republican colleagues. I very much hope  they finally recognize that maybe the United States of America should  join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing healthcare to  all people as a right and not a privilege.   I hope that when Senator Daines comes down here, he will say: No, it  does not make sense to throw 23 million more people off of healthcare,  but, in fact, we have to move forward, do what Canada does, what  Germany does, what the UK does, what France does, what every major  country on Earth does, and guarantee healthcare to all people as a  right. I hope very much that is what Senator Daines will be saying.   Do you know what? I kind of think that is not what he will be saying.  I kind of think that in the midst of this discussion in which millions  of Americans are wondering whether they are going to continue to have  healthcare, what is going to happen to their kids, what is going to  happen to their parents, I suspect what Senator Daines is doing is  nothing more than an old political trick: trying to embarrass  Democrats. Will they support the Medicare-for-all bill introduced by  Congressman John Conyers?   At a time when we are engaged in a very serious debate about the  future of healthcare, I think this is not a time for political games.  If Senator Daines is serious about a Medicare-for-all proposal, let's  work together, but now is not the time for political games.   Senator Daines, as I understand it, is going to offer an amendment,  but we don't know what he is amending because we don't even know what  is in the legislation the Republicans will bring forward.   How do you amend something when we don't even have a base bill to  amend? This is, I suspect--I hope I am wrong. I hope Senator Daines has  seen the light, but I suspect not, and I suspect it is just a political  game. I do hope, by the way, at some point within this debate, if we  can--if not, certainly in the near future--to, in fact, be introducing  a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. It will be somewhat different  than my friend John Conyers' bill in the House, but what it will do is  say that in America, if you are rich or if you are poor, if you are a  man, woman, and child, yes, you are entitled to healthcare as a human  right and not a privilege.   As you may or may not know, our current healthcare system is the most  expensive, bureaucratic, and wasteful system in the entire world. While  the healthcare industry makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year in  profits--and in many ways what our healthcare system is about is not  providing quality care to all of us but seeing how the insurance  companies and the drug companies can rip us off. The truth is, even  today, we have some 28 million people who have no health insurance so  our goal should be to say to those 28 million: We are going to provide  health insurance to you, to all Americans, and not throw 22, 23 million  more people off of health insurance.    All of us recognize that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect.  What the American people want us to do--and poll after poll suggests  this--is they want us to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy  it. The American people are paying deductibles that in many instances  are far too high, keeping people from going to the doctor when they  need to. Today, copayments are much too high; premiums, much too high.  I do find it interesting that when Donald Trump campaigned for  President, he talked about the high cost of prescription drugs. He is  right. In this country--and I am going to get into that in a moment--we  pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  That is what the American people want us to deal with in healthcare  legislation, not throw 22 million people off of healthcare. They want  us to lower the cost of prescription drugs. I have not heard one word  from the Republicans about the need to lower the cost of prescription  drugs.   The United States spends far more per capita on healthcare than any  major country on Earth. We often have worse outcomes. If we go back to  regular order, if we go back to committee process--which is what we  should do--the very first question a Member of the Senate should ask  is, How does it happen that here in America we spend far more per  capita on healthcare than do the people of any other country? Here is  the chart. The United States is spending $9,990 per person on  healthcare, almost $10,000 per person on healthcare. What do they spend  in Germany? Well, they spend $5,300, almost half of what we spend. What  about Canada? I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. It is a  really nice country. They spend $4,533. How does it happen that we are  spending more than double per person compared to the Canadians and  almost double what the Germans do? The French spend less than half of  what we do. Australians spend less than half of what we do. The  Japanese spend less than half. The UK spends about 40 percent less.   Don't you think the very first question a Member of the Senate might  ask is, Why do we spend so much compared to other countries? By the  way, all of these other countries guarantee healthcare to all of their  people. In many instances, the outcomes, the  [[Page S4358]]  health outcomes in those countries, are better than our country. They  live longer. The life expectancy is longer. Their infant mortality rate  is lower. In some particular diseases, they do better in treating their  people. Here is a simple truth. The truth is, if we took a hard look at  countries around the world--all of which have one form or another of  national healthcare programs, all of which said healthcare is a right,  whether you are rich or you are poor--maybe we might want to learn  something, but, no, we have not had one hearing in order to discuss why  we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare and why we pay the  highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.   You know why we haven't had any hearings on that, fellow Americans?  Because it might get the insurance companies a little bit nervous.  Insurance companies pour hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign  contributions into the political process. The pharmaceutical industry  spends a huge amount of money on campaign contributions and lobbying  efforts.   I say to my colleagues in the Senate, maybe, just maybe, we might  want to stand up for working people and the middle class rather than  for the owners of the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical  industry.   It is interesting. One never knows what to expect from the President.  Every given day there is another adventure out there, but a couple of  months ago, the President met with, I believe, the Australian Prime  Minister. That was in May. President Trump said during that meeting:  Australia has a ``better healthcare'' system than the United States.  That is what Donald Trump said. To my Republican friends here who  support President Trump, listen to what he said. On this one instance-- he is not right very often--but I will confess on this issue, he is  right. In Australia, everyone is guaranteed healthcare as a right.  Australia has a universal healthcare program called, ironically,  Medicare, that provides all Australians with affordable, accessible,  and high-quality healthcare. While the United States has the most  expensive, bureaucratic, wasteful, and ineffective healthcare system in  the world, Australia, it turns out, has one of the most efficient.   President Trump was right. In 2014, Australia's healthcare system  ranked sixth out of 55 countries in efficiency. The United States  ranked 44. Not only does Australia guarantee universal healthcare  coverage, it spends less than half what we spend on healthcare per  capita. In 2015, they spent $4,500 while we spent almost $10,000. While  the Australian Government spent 9 percent of its GDP on healthcare, the  United States spent nearly double that, 17 percent. Further, many  healthcare services are far cheaper in Australia. An MRI costs about  $350 in Australia versus $1,100 in the United States. One day in a  hospital costs about $1,300 in Australia versus $4,300 in the United  States. An appendectomy costs about $5,200 in Australia versus roughly  $14,000 in the United States, et cetera.   Not only does Australia guarantee universal healthcare, spend less on  healthcare per capita, and pay less than we do for many health  services, they have better health outcomes. In 2014, the average life  expectancy in Australia was 82.4 years compared to 78.8 years in the  United States. They live longer in Australia. For context, according to  a 2014 report from the World Health Organization, Australian men have  the third longest life expectancy and Australian women have the seventh  longest life expectancy in the world. The United States doesn't even  crack the top 10 for life expectancy, despite spending so much more  than any other country on healthcare.   What all of this comes down to is the fact that America is the  wealthiest country in the history of the world. The question we have to  ask ourselves--and I hope Senator Daines will address that question as  he introduces his Medicare-for-all bill--is how does it happen that in  Canada, every man, woman, and child is guaranteed healthcare? The same  is true in the UK, in Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and every  other major country on Earth. How does it happen that every  industrialized country understands that healthcare is a right of all  people, because all of us get sick? All of us have accidents, not just  the rich. How does every major country on Earth say healthcare is a  right except the United States? How is it today we have 28 million  without any health insurance--more who have high deductibles and high  copayments, who are underinsured--and the response of our Republican  friends is to say: Twenty-eight million uninsured? That is not enough.  Let's throw another 22 million people off of health insurance.   Our response should be to move forward and guarantee healthcare to  all people, not throw another 22 million people off of health  insurance. I don't have the time to go into great detail as to why our  wasteful and bureaucratic healthcare system ends up spending almost  twice as much per capita as systems around the world. That is a subject  for a lot of discussion, and I intend to play an active role in that  discussion, but let me just give you some examples: because we have  such a bureaucratic and complicated system; because hospitals in  America have to deal with this person who has a $5,000 deductible, that  person who has an $8,000 deductible; this person who has this, that  person has that--they have to deal with dozens and dozens of different  configurations for insurance. It requires an enormous amount of time,  energy, and manpower to deal with those myriad of insurance companies.  The result of that is, the United States spends far more on hospital  administrative costs than most other countries. These costs accounted  for one-quarter of total U.S. hospital spending from 2010 to 2011, more  than $200 billion--over twice what was spent in Canada and in Scotland.   What I would hope--if we don't sit around just worrying about the  profits of the insurance companies--what I would hope is, all of us  would agree that when we spend a dollar on healthcare, we want that  dollar to go to doctors, to nurses, to medicine. We want that dollar to  go to the provision of healthcare, not to advertising, not to  profiteering, not to dividends, not to outlandish CEO insurance company  salaries but to the actual provision of healthcare which keeps us well.  Yet we do that worse than any other major country on Earth.   The large health insurance and drug companies are making hundreds of  billions of dollars in profits every single year, and they are  rewarding their executives with outrageous compensation packages. Once  again, the function of healthcare, in my mind, is to provide quality  care to all in a cost-effective way, not to make CEOs of insurance  companies and drug companies even richer than they are today.   In 2015, the top 58 health insurance companies made $24 billion in  profits. Should the function of healthcare in America be to allow  insurance companies to make huge profits or should we make sure all of  our people get quality healthcare? Not only do the insurance companies  make huge profits, but their CEOs make outlandish salaries, while 28  million Americans have no health insurance at all, and others have very  high deductibles. In 2015, Aetna's CEO made $17.2 million in  compensation. Now, Aetna, like every other insurance company, spends  half their life trying to tell people they are not covered for what  they thought they were covered, but they do manage to find $17 million  in salary compensation for their CEO. CIGNA's CEO made $17.3 million in  compensation. UnitedHealth Group's CEO made $14.5 million in  compensation. Anthem/Wellpoint's CEO made $13.6 million. Humana's CEO  made $10.3 million. Is the function of healthcare in America to make  CEOs of insurance companies outlandishly wealthy, or is it to provide  healthcare to all people?    It is not just the insurance companies. If you ask people in my State  of Vermont what their major concern is--and I think they would say the  same in Iowa and probably any State in America--they would say: I am  sick and tired of being ripped off by the drug companies. I go into my  pharmacy, have a medicine I have been using for 10 years, and suddenly  the price has doubled, tripled, for no particular reason other than the  pharmaceutical industry could get away with it.   We are the only major country on Earth not to control the prices of  the pharmaceutical industry. The result is--and this is an outrage, and  it speaks to everything that should be discussed but which is not being  discussed in the Republican bill--is that  [[Page S4359]]  today, one out of five patients under the age of 65 who gets a  prescription from their doctor is unable to afford that prescription.  How crazy is that? What kind of dysfunctional healthcare system allows  somebody to go to a doctor because they are sick, the doctor writes a  prescription, and one out of five Americans can't even afford to fill  that prescription. What happens to that person? Well, the likelihood is  they get even sicker, and then they end up in the emergency room at  outrageous costs or, maybe even worse, they end up in the hospital. How  crazy is that?   I have not heard one word--not one word--from our Republicans about  addressing the absurdity of Americans paying by far the highest prices  in the world for prescription drugs. I have a chart over here that just  deals with half a dozen drugs, but we can list many, many more.   Lantus, a diabetes drug, costs $186 in the United States. Diabetes is  a very serious problem. Lantus costs $186 in the United States and $47  in France. It is the same drug.   This is a healthcare reform debate. I have yet to hear one Republican  raise that issue, but I think the people in Iowa and the people in  Vermont want us to raise that issue.   Crestor, a popular drug for high cholesterol, costs $86 in the United  States and $29 in Japan.   Advair, which is used to treat asthma--another very serious problem-- costs $155 in our country and $38 in Germany.   The list goes on and on and on. That is why millions of people, by  the way, are now buying their medicine in Canada and other countries,  because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the  pharmaceutical industry--an industry that spends billions of dollars  over a period of time on lobbyists here and campaign contributions.   You might think--just might--that when we deal with healthcare  reform, one Republican--just one--might stand up and say: Well, you  know, maybe we might want to stand with the elderly and the sick in  this country and not just with the pharmaceutical industry. I have not  heard one Republican in this debate talk about that issue.   To give an example of the greed of the pharmaceutical industry--and I  can go on and on. They are the greediest, maybe with the exception of  Wall Street. It is hard to determine which one of these institutions is  more greedy, but the pharmaceutical industry certainly can make a claim  for being the greediest industry in this country. Out in California a  few months ago, there was an effort to lower the cost of prescription  drugs in their State. It is called proposition 61. The big drug  companies spent $131 million to defeat that ballot initiative--$131  million to defeat a ballot initiative in California that would have  lowered the cost of prescription drugs. And all over this country, the  American people cannot afford the medicine they need, but the drug  companies had $131 million to spend just on one initiative.   Meanwhile, while the American people are getting sicker and sicker  and sometimes dying because they cannot afford the medications they  need, I have received--and I think every Member of the Senate has  received--communications from oncologists, people who are dealing with  patients who have cancer, who are saying: My patients cannot afford the  high cost of cancer medicine. And it is not just cancer, of course.   While the American people are getting ripped off by the drug  companies, in 2015 the five largest drug companies in America made over  $50 billion in profits--five companies, $50 billion in profits. Yet  one-fifth of the American people cannot afford to buy the prescriptions  they need. How outrageous is that? And my Republican colleagues are  telling us they are dealing with healthcare reform without mentioning  one word about the high cost of prescription drugs. Give me a break.  You are dealing with many things, but you are not dealing with  healthcare reform.   Again, it is not just the pharmaceutical companies that are making  huge profits; we are seeing executives from these large drug companies  making outrageous compensation. In fact, in 2015, the top 10  pharmaceutical industry CEOs made $327 million in total compensation.  Elderly people walking to the drugstore can't afford the prescription  drugs they need, and yet CEOs of major drug companies are making $327  million in total compensation.   Former CEO of Gilead, John Martin, became a billionaire because his  drug company charged $1,000 a pill for Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug that  costs $1 to manufacture and can be bought in India today for just $4.  In this country, it sold for $1,000 a pill, and he became a billionaire  as a result of it. That is a healthcare system out of control.   I know it is a radical idea here in the Senate, but maybe--just  maybe--we might want to represent the American people and not the CEOs  of the drug companies and the insurance companies.   Some of my Republican colleagues have been spending the last few days  using words like ``freedom,'' ``choice,'' and ``opportunity'' to try to  convince the American people about their abysmal healthcare  legislation. This is the same language that rightwing ideologues, like  the billionaire Koch brothers, use when they try to discredit  government programs and move to privatize them. What the Koch brothers  mean by ``freedom'' is their own freedom. And by the way, they are the  second wealthiest family in America, worth some $80 billion. What they  mean by ``freedom'' is their own freedom to profit off the misery of  ordinary Americans who rely on a wide variety of government programs  that make life bearable and, in some cases, even possible.   I want to say a word about freedom. This is a 203-foot yacht. This is  a yacht owned by a billionaire that costs about $90 million to  purchase. Like everybody else, I think, in this Chamber, I think the  American people--every American should have the freedom to purchase  this $90 million yacht, and I would urge all Americans to go on the  internet, find out where the yacht stores are--wherever they sell  yachts--and go out there and say: Hey, I got the freedom to buy this  $90 million yacht. We all believe in that. You got the money; you buy  it.   Here is a picture of a home, and this home is worth tens and tens of  millions of dollars. It looks to me like it has 30 or 40 or 50 rooms,  probably 5, 10 bathrooms. It is a very nice house, and it is owned by a  billionaire.   You know, I think every American who wants to own a home worth tens  and tens of millions of dollars, go to your local Realtor. You go out  and you buy that home.   What we are talking about today in terms of freedom is not freedom to  buy a yacht or freedom to buy a mansion; we are talking about the  freedom to stay alive, the freedom to be able to go to the doctor when  you are sick, the freedom not to go bankrupt if you end up in the  hospital with a serious disease.   So when my Republican friends talk about freedom of choice, fine, we  all agree: You got the money, you go out and buy any big house you want  or buy any big yacht you want. But where there is a serious  disagreement is, we say that the children of this country who have  serious illnesses have the freedom to stay alive even if their parents  do not have a lot of money; that older people who are now in nursing  homes should have the freedom to get dignified care in a nursing home  even if they have Alzheimer's and even if they don't have a lot of  money. Healthcare is not another commodity. Healthcare is not a  mansion. Healthcare is not a yacht. Healthcare is whether we stay alive  or whether we don't, whether we ease our suffering or whether we don't.  And I believe--unlike, unfortunately, many of my Republicans--that  right to get healthcare when you need it is something every American  should be able to get.   Here in the Senate, we have good health insurance. Over the last 10  years, a number of Senators have had serious illnesses, and they have  gotten some of the best care in the world. If it is good for the  Senate, it is good for every American. Healthcare must be a right of  all people, not a privilege. Quality care must be available to all, not  just the wealthy.   Senator Daines is going to come down here in a while to offer a  Medicare-for-all proposal. Again, I hope this is a breakthrough. I hope  our Republican colleagues understand that we have to join the rest of  the industrialized world. And if Senator Daines comes down here and is  prepared to  [[Page S4360]]  vote for that legislation, prepared to get his other Republican  Senators prepared to vote for that legislation, my God, we can win this  vote overwhelmingly and move this country in a very different  direction.   But I have a feeling that is not what Senator Daines has in mind. I  think this is another joke, another game, another sham as part of a  horrendous overall process. So I will not be supporting that amendment,  unless Senator Daines and Republicans vote for it as well. But this I  will do: Whether in this debate--and I hope I have the opportunity--or  in the very near future, I will offer a Medicare-for-all, single-payer  program which finally has the United States doing what every other  major country on Earth does--guarantee healthcare to every man, woman,  and child in a cost-effective way. And when we do that and when we  eliminate the need for families to spend $15 or $20,000 a year for  health insurance, we will save the average middle-class family  substantial sums of money.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this is an exciting day. After years and  years, some of my Republican colleagues have begun to understand that  we cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which allows 28  million Americans to have no health insurance, which forces us to pay  the highest prices in the world, by far, for healthcare and even higher  prices--outrageously high prices--for prescription drugs.   I understand that Senator Daines has offered a Medicare-for-all,  single-payer system, and I congratulate him. It sounds to me as though  the Republicans are beginning to catch on about the need to transform  our healthcare system and join the rest of the industrialized world.   So I say to Senator Daines, if he is prepared to vote for this  legislation and if he can get maybe five, six more Republicans to vote  for this legislation, I think we can win it, and I think the United  States can join the rest of the industrialized world and finally  guarantee healthcare to all people.   So if Senator Daines and five or six other Republicans vote for this,  count me in. And we are going to work together, finally, to provide  healthcare to all people. But if Senator Daines is just playing a  political trick--I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.    Mr. President, if Senator Daines is just playing a  political trick and does not intend to vote for this legislation or  have any other Republican vote for it, I would suggest that every  Member in the Senate vote present on this bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a motion to  commit be printed in the Record to instruct the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions to report back with changes that ensure  the bill includes a provision establishing a robust public health  insurance option that is affordable and high quality, that provides  comprehensive benefits, and that may be offered on the Federal and  State exchanges.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Sanders moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill includes a provision establishing       a robust public health insurance option that is affordable       and high-quality, that provides comprehensive benefits, and       that may be offered on the Federal and State Exchanges.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a motion to  commit be printed in the Record to instruct the Committee on Finance to  report back with changes that ensure that no provision in the bill will  reduce or eliminate the amount of Medicaid funding provided to schools  under current law.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Sanders moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that no provision in the bill will reduce or       eliminate the amount of Medicaid funding provided to schools       under current law.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a motion to  commit be printed in the Record to instruct the Committee on Finance to  report back with changes that ensure the bill includes a provision to  lower the eligibility age for Medicare benefits to age 55.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Sanders moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill includes a provision to lower the       eligibility age for Medicare benefits under title XVIII of       the Social Security Act to 55 years of age.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a motion to  commit be printed in the Record to instruct the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor and Pensions to report back with changes that are  based on hearings held by the committee.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Sanders moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate within 3       days with changes that are within the jurisdiction of such       Committee based on hearings held by the Committee.     Mr. President, at last count, I think it was the Gallup  poll that found 12 percent of the American people had confidence in the  U.S. Congress. I think we are on our way tonight to single digits  because in the modern history of this country there has never been a  process as absurd as what we are seeing right here.   We are talking about legislation that impacts one-sixth of the  American economy--over $3 trillion. We are talking about legislation,  because it is healthcare, that impacts every man, woman, and child in  this country.   Mr. President, maybe you can help me. How many public hearings have  we had dealing with legislation that is of enormous significance to  tens of millions of people? Well, I will help you with the answer:  There have been zero hearings.   What impact will this legislation have on doctors who are trying to  treat us every day? One might think that we would hear from the doctors  of the American Medical Association to tell us how this legislation  would impact their work. We have not had one public hearing to hear  from one doctor.   What has the American Hospital Association had to say about how this  legislation would impact rural hospitals in America, many of which may  close down? They have not had one moment, one opportunity to say one  word on this legislation.   We are proceeding here with major legislation written behind closed  doors by a handful of Republicans. Most Republicans have not been  involved in this process, let alone Democrats, let alone the American  people.   By the way, when we think of the American people, how do they feel  about this legislation? Well, the last poll that I saw was USA Today.  They had 12 percent of the American people thinking that this  legislation makes sense. Well, maybe the American people got it wrong.  How do the major healthcare organizations in America feel about this  legislation--the people who are on the cutting edge, the people who do  the work every day? Well, guess what. The AMA, the American Medical  Association, is opposed; the American Hospital Association is opposed;  AARP, the largest senior group in America, is opposed because they know  the horrendous impact this will have in raising premiums for older  workers; the American Cancer Society is opposed; the American Heart  Association is opposed; the American Academy of Family Physicians is  opposed; the American Academy of Pediatrics is opposed; the American  Psychiatric Association is opposed. Virtually every major national  healthcare organization is opposed to this disastrous legislation.   So the American people are opposed, and the healthcare organizations  all across this country are opposed. The bill was written behind closed  doors. Yet, under those circumstances, they want to bring it to the  floor for a vote.  [[Page S4404]]    Now, what most Americans are sitting around and thinking--they are  saying: Look, the Affordable Care Act has done some good things. Before  the Affordable Care Act, we had some 50 million people without any  health insurance. The Affordable Care Act provided insurance for about  20 million people. That is no small thing.   In the majority leader's own State of Kentucky, the rate of uninsured  went from 20 percent down to 7 percent. That is pretty good--not great,  but it is pretty good. In West Virginia, the rate of uninsured went way  down. We have seen 20 million people gain insurance. We have dealt with  the Affordable Care Act under a total obscenity; that is, if somebody  had a serious illness--breast cancer, diabetes--they could not get  insurance at an affordable cost because of a preexisting condition. How  insane is that? The American people said that is nonsense. What is the  function of insurance if not to cover us when we need it the most for  those illnesses that we have had? We ended that absurdity. That was a  good thing. The Affordable Care Act has done other very important  things.   Have you heard one Member of this body say that the Affordable Care  Act is perfect? Have you heard one person here say that the Affordable  Care Act does not need to be improved? Of course, it does. Right now,  throughout this country--in my State of Vermont and all over this  country--deductibles are too high. I have talked to people with $5,000,  $10,000 deductibles. They can't go to the doctor when they should. We  have to lower deductibles. Copayments are too high. Premiums are too  high.   I will tell you something else. Donald Trump ran for President, and  he campaigned, and he said: I am going to stand with the working people  of this country. Prescription drug costs are too high. I am going to  take on the pharmaceutical industry. We are going to lower prescription  drug costs in America. Today, if you can believe it, one out of five  Americans under 65 cannot afford to fill the prescription their doctors  write. Today, somebody walked into a pharmacy and found that the cost  of the medicine they have been using for 10 years has doubled, maybe  tripled, because we have no legislation that stops the drug companies  from charging us anything they want. And they will charge us anything  they want. The result is, we have the highest prices in the world for  prescription drugs.   Those are the problems that the American people want answers to:  Deductibles are too high, premiums are too high, copayments are too  high, and prescription drug costs are too high. We are not doing enough  good work in primary healthcare. Too many people, even with insurance,  cannot find the doctors they need. There are many other problems. Those  are what the American people want us to solve.   This legislation only makes a very bad situation worse. How do you  improve healthcare in America when you throw 16 million people off of  the health insurance they currently have? How do you improve healthcare  in America when, according to the CBO, premiums are going to go up 20  percent every year? Let's get that clear: 20 percent on January 1,  another 20 percent the following year--that is 40 percent--and another  20 percent the year after. Do you think this is really improving  healthcare, bringing freedom to the American people? I think not.   So what is the solution? The solution is--I know this is a radical  idea--that maybe we should do what the American people want us to do  and not what special, powerful interests want, not what billionaire  campaign contributors want--whose rightwing ideology wants to end  government services for working families all across this country.   I hope that we will have the common sense and the decency to sit  down, throw the problems on the table, and then resolve them. I think  we can do that. That is why we have to end this absurd process. We have  to go back to regular order, which simply means go back to the  committee.   I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. Let's have that discussion. Let's hear different ideas.  Let's solve problems. Let us not make a bad situation worse, and let us  not make the American people even feel more contemptuous of this  institution than they currently do.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
