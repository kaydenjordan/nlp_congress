 Dr. King once said the true measure of a man is not how  he behaves in moments of comfort and convenience, but how he stands in  times of challenge and controversy.   Last Congress, I had the honor of serving with Chairman Cummings on  the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and he did not look for the easy  way out. He never ran from controversy or challenge.   You see, Mr. Cummings was a true leader. Life is all about choices,  Mr. Speaker, and true leaders have to make a lot of them.   We can live in fear of what man will say or do to us, or we can stand  up and speak out for what we know in our hearts is right.   Elijah Cummings never failed to stand up and speak out. You see, he  was a true leader.   We can follow the crowd no matter how wrong the crowd may be, or we  can choose to be a drum major for justice. Elijah Cummings chose to be  a drum major for justice.   Mr. Speaker, we can close our minds and our hearts, mentor no one,  and share nothing with anyone. We can make life's journey all about us,  or we can mentor, impart knowledge and wisdom, and look out for someone  else and have their back.   Elijah Cummings was a mentor, a role model. He cared about us. And  every day, we knew it.   Elijah Cummings had the Nation's back. For that, we are forever  grateful to Chairman Elijah Cummings for a life well lived.
