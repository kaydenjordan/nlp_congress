 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Joseph Toppin  of Edison, New Jersey, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.   Colonel Toppin entered the military in 1948, the same year that a  wavering President named Harry Truman finally prohibited racial  discrimination in the Armed Forces. Colonel Toppin rose to become the  first African American to serve as battalion commander for the Army's  40th Infantry Division.   The colonel has dedicated his life to improving the quality of our  democracy and making the world a safer place. He helped with postwar  planning for the development of Korea. He also was the principal  planner for the Army's ship-to-shore discharge operations along the  west coast of France. And Colonel Toppin was the inspector general for  Fort Dix in New Jersey.   Upon leaving the Army, he had an illustrious career at Bethlehem  Steel Corporation.   Colonel Toppin is now retired, but he has still not stopped inspiring  those around him, which is why I stand here tonight. Mr. Speaker, I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Colonel Toppin on his 100th  birthday and for his service to the United States of America.                            ____________________
