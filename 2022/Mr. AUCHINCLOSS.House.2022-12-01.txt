 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the climate  crisis and clean energy investments we need to continue as we double  down on the work we started this Congress to protect a planet of clean  air and clean water for future generations.   During the district work period, I hosted a conference on climate  action and clean energy at Olin College of Engineering in Needham,  Massachusetts. Across three panels of experts, we covered policy and  industry, clean energy science and technology, and international  affairs.   Despite the challenges we discussed, I am optimistic. There is  growing political will, abundant talent and innovation, and increasing  global cooperation around the imperative of a clean energy transition.   Next Congress we must build on that political will in order to  achieve a future of clean air, clean water, and clean energy that is  too cheap to meter.                            ____________________
