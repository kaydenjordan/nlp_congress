 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chair DeLauro, and I  thank the Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I have a speech about how important it is for us to  stand up against terror and the terror strikes against Israel launched  by the terrorist group Hamas from Gaza--4,500 rockets that Iron Dome  helped to stop. And I have a speech that is all about how important it  is for us to replenish that.   But, Mr. Speaker, I cannot--I cannot--allow one of my colleagues to  stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and label the Jewish  democratic State of Israel an apartheid state. I reject it.   Today, this Caucus, this body, the House of Representatives will  overwhelmingly stand with our ally, the State of Israel, in  replenishing this defensive system.   If you believe in human rights, if you believe in saving lives,  Israeli lives and Palestinian lives, I say to my colleague who just  besmirched our ally, then you will support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, we can have an opportunity to debate lots of  issues on the House floor, but to falsely characterize the State of  Israel is consistent with those--let's be clear--it is consistent with  those who advocate for the dismantling of the one Jewish state in the  world. When there is no place on the map for one Jewish state, that is  anti-Semitism, and I reject that.   I stand in support of this important legislation. I thank the  Speaker, the majority leader, and the chairwoman for bringing this  forward, and I urge every one of my colleagues to stand in support of  this.
