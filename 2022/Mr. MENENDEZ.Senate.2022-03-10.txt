 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to  discharge S.J. Res. 35.   I am a little perplexed by the Parliamentarian's decision that this  can move forward because there is a statutory timeframe that says that  the resolution needs to be brought forth in order for it to have  validity.   My understanding of the Parliamentarian's decision is that even  though--if there was passage of this resolution--it would not have  validity because it is past the timeframe, it still can be brought.  That seems to be a pursuit of the Senate's time in a way that is an  extraordinary amount of time on unlimited numbers of discharge  resolutions that potentially exist that, having passed the statutory  timeframe, can still be brought to the Senate floor even though  whatever the vote is has no consequence. I fail to understand that.   Since that is the ruling, let me just say that I appreciate that the  Senator from Kentucky has concerns about human rights in Egypt, and I  agree that we must absolutely continue to raise concerns in a way that  will meaningfully bring about positive change. I believe we should be  doing more to prioritize a country's human rights record in the context  of our broader relationship.   In fact, last year, with several of my colleagues, I introduced S.  1473, the Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms Exports Act, or what we  call the SAFEGUARD Act, to ensure that human rights issues full  attention and arms exports decision making are considered.   And I invite all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  support and cosponsor this important legislation.   As I think everyone in this body knows, for years I have led the  fight in the Senate against arms sales to countries that commit  significant and repeated human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia.   Last Congress, the Senate approved 23 resolutions of disapproval that  I introduced when the Trump administration sought to short circuit our  rights to consider these sales according to law.   Joint resolutions of disapproval are just one tool that we have, and  we must make sensible distinctions about the types of systems we  consider. In this particular debate, as I have argued before, a  critical distinction is between arms that are inherently offensive and  lethal and those that are not. Some are defensive; some are simply  logistical.   Today, we are considering a sale of 12 cargo aircraft, which I  believe squarely falls in the category of largely defensive, nonlethal  arms. This aircraft is used for transporting military and other cargo,  including humanitarian supplies, as well as personnel in-country and  internationally. Egypt has earlier model C-130s since the 1980s, but  its current fleet is aging and becoming more expensive to maintain.   The United States and Egypt have a long and valuable relationship  that goes beyond the security realm. Egypt is also an important  security partner for other U.S. allies in the region. This, of course,  does not mean that it is above reproach--it is not--or that the nature  of that relationship is static. It is not.   Indeed, I supported the Secretary of State's determination made last  month not to release $130 million in withheld foreign military  financing because Egypt's government has not made, in his view,  sufficient progress in human rights, especially with regard to the  [[Page S1095]]  treatment of peaceful activists and the continued targeting of  independent civil society organizations.   I have used my prerogative as chair of the Foreign Relations  Committee in the arms sales process before, and I will continue to do  so in the future regarding systems that may consistently relate to  these concerns.   But in the end, our relationship with Egypt has to be one of  maintaining a balance between the foreign policy and national security  concerns of the United States and our partners.   We should, however, continue to raise human rights concerns and press  for meaningful reforms. We should continue encouraging the government  to uphold its own commitments, but to this end, because these are  purely, not only--they are logistical at best, I urge my colleagues to  reject this motion to discharge.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Foreign Relations,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2022.

In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S.

Robert Menendez.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

(iii) Description: On December 11, 2014, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       14-59 of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms       Export Control Act (AECA) of ten (10) CH-47D Model Chinook       Helicopters to include twenty-three (23) T55-GA-714A Engines       (20 installed and 3 spares), twelve (12) AN/AAR-57 Common       Missile Warning System (10 installed and 2 spares), twelve       (12) AN/ARC-220 High Frequency (HF) Radios, twelve (12) AN/      ARC-186 Very High Frequency (VHF) AM/FM Radios, twelve (12)       AN/ARC-164 Ultra High Frequency (UHF)-AM, twelve (12) AN/ARN       123 VOR ILS Marker Beacons, twelve (12) AN/ARN-89 or AN/ARN-      149 Direction Finder Sets, twelve (12) AN/ASN-128 Doppler/      Global Positioning System Navigation Sets, twelve (12) AN/      ARC-201D or AN/ARC-201E VHF FM Homing Radios, twelve (12) AN/      APX-118 Transponders, three (3) AN/APX-118A Transponders,       twelve (12) AN/APR-39A(V)1 Radar Signal Detecting Sets,       mission equipment, communication and navigation equipment,       Maintenance Work Orders/Engineering Change Proposals (MWO/      ECPs), aircraft hardware and software support, repair and       return, spare and repair parts, publications and technical       documentation, support equipment, minor modifications,       personnel training and training equipment, U.S. government       and contractor technical and engineering support services,       and other related elements of logistics and program support.       The estimated cost was $150 million. Major Defense Equipment       (MDE) constituted $57.2 million of this total.        On February 5, 2021, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0D-21, of the possible sale       of an additional eight (8) T55-GA-714A engines in support of       Greece's CH-47D helicopter fleet. This addition resulted in       an increase in MDE by $14 million to $71.2 million. The total       estimated case value increased to $164 million.        This transmittal notifies the addition of a phased       maintenance program and follow-on support services for the       Hellenic Army's CH-47 helicopter fleet (non-MDE).        The total MDE value will remain $71.2 million. The total       estimated program value will increase by $120 million to $284       million.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally,       which is an important partner for political stability and       economic progress in Europe.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology Statement contained in the original notification       applies to articles and services reported here.
