 Madam Speaker, lowering prescription drug costs is the  [[Page H8608]]  public's top health priority for Congress.   Most Americans say that prescription drugs have made their lives  better, but for so many the cost is unreasonable and unaffordable.   Insulin, which keeps more than 7 million Americans alive, is an  extreme example. We have had insulin for nearly 100 years, yet my  constituents, Utah mothers whose kids have type I diabetes, tell me  that skyrocketing costs have put this lifesaving medicine nearly out of  reach.   My hometown newspaper recently carried a story about volunteers  crisscrossing Utah to pick up leftover insulin--because a family had  extra or a diabetic family member died--and delivering that medicine  where it is needed. They call it ``Diabetic Christmas,'' a sad  commentary on just how badly our system is failing our patients.   We need actions to offer relief that bring down costs so that people  don't have to celebrate Diabetic Christmas in order to stay alive and  stay healthy.   This week, we passed a bill with unanimous bipartisan support that  makes drug pricing more transparent and makes it easier for seniors on  Medicare drug plans to understand their benefits and their costs. It is  a good step forward, but we have more work to do.                            ____________________
