 Mr. Speaker, for the sake of not belaboring the great  points already made by my colleagues here today, I will keep this  brief.   The Biden administration's WOTUS rule creates a regulatory headache  for economic drivers like farmers, ranchers, small business owners,  manufacturers, miners, and more. Similar to the old Obama  administration WOTUS rule, this new rule is a gift to lawyers and  activists.   All this rule does is give D.C. bureaucrats a chance to trade in  their dress shoes for their never-worn cowboy boots, step over a few  puddles and call them navigable waters, and upend the lives of rural  Americans.   Time and time again, the Biden administration creates hardships for  the constituents I represent. Unfortunately, I expect no less from this  activist administration. It is clear that they do not consider rural  America a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this CRA to nullify the  ``sumbumcheous,'' devastating Biden administration WOTUS rule.
