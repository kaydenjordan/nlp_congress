 Mr. Speaker, in approximately 2 weeks, our country will  hit its debt ceiling.   House Republicans understand that this would be disastrous for our  already fragile economy. That is why we took decisive action to address  this crisis responsibly and sensibly by passing the Limit, Save, Grow  Act. This legislation would not only end the debt limit crisis, but it  would also address the root cause of that crisis: Washington's  irresponsible spending.   Since President Biden took office, the 10-year trajectory on Federal  spending has increased by a staggering $10 trillion.   While House Republicans have been hard at work crafting solutions to  the debt ceiling, this administration and House Democrats have wasted  valuable time, putting our Nation's financial stability at risk.   Two weeks ago, the White House press secretary flatly said the  President is ``not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling.'' That is  critical time that could have been spent on negotiations, not political  stunts.   To make matters worse, President Biden is now leaving for an 8-day  trip to Asia as our country teeters on the brink of default.   It is time for the other side to stop playing politics. We are out of  time.                            ____________________
