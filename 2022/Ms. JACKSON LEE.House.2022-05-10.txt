 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), and the manager for the minority.   Mr. Speaker, let me rise with enthusiasm for this legislation for it  has been a long-time investment of Whip Clyburn.   The Targeting Resources to Communities in Need Act of 2022 tracks  work that I have done as it relates to equity in various entities, but  in particular in African Americans.   This work of Mr. Clyburn, 10-20-30, has the ability to reach poor  communities that have not been necessarily receiving the benefits  equitably of Federal resources. This can be a great boost to our rural  communities. It can be a source of change.   For example, in Texas, during the pandemic, we lost a large number of  rural hospitals, and in those communities people were deprived of  access to good healthcare. The hospitals just closed because they did  not have the resources.   This, as well, deals with education, flood mitigation,  infrastructure, all of these issues come out of appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rogers who I know has been working with Whip  Clyburn for a long time on this equitable approach to the distribution  of our funds.   I think it is important for the American people to know that Members  of Congress are concerned that Federal funds get to the people, and  they get to the people that are most in need--they are life-changing  efforts.   For example, as we worked on the community projects, many Members  have found that when they give those pointed dollars, you can change  lives of communities, schools, neighborhoods, and families. This  particular legislation, the Targeting Resources to Communities in Need  Act, is an appropriate approach to ensuring that tax dollars get to  where they are needed and help those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 6531 and  congratulate Mr. Clyburn for his work.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I reject the notion that America is not strong enough to stand with  Ukraine as it tramples on autocracy. I reject the notion that America  and the American people are not strong enough to stand with those in  Ukraine who are fighting for their survival and fighting against the  horrible violence of Vladimir Putin. I reject the notion that Americans  are not empathetic about Mariupol and what the mayor at that time on  April 12 said; he noted that 210 children were murdered by this vicious  bombing in the midst of 21,000 dead.   As I traveled with Leader Hoyer, over and over again I asked the  question about the children. As UNICEF said, this war is a nightmare  for Ukraine's children.   This supplemental for Ukraine recognizes that. It recognizes that  democracy must stand but that children must be protected with the focus  on humanitarian aid, eliminating or stopping human trafficking, and  recognizing that girls and women have been raped. It is time for us to  speak what the American people have spoken, that  [[Page H4772]]  they are standing with Ukraine. They want a victory for Ukraine.   This supplemental will help us stand with Ukraine. I ask my  colleagues to support it and to recognize victory for Ukraine.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the leadership that  we have shown in this Democratic Caucus, joined by our Republican  friends.   Let me thank the chairwoman, the manager of this bill, and the  Republican manager, my friend from Texas.   The one point that I think we can all agree to: This is a vile and  violent and brutal and senseless war. It is Vladimir Putin trying to  return to the greatness of Russia that fought Nazism but is now making  a fiasco and light of what fighting Nazism is all about.   Going to Ukraine with the Hoyer codel, my focus was on the terrible  plight of children. In an op-ed that was printed in the Houston  Chronicle, I said that our children in war must never suffer the  nightmare that UNICEF says.   So, I support this supplemental for the very reason of dealing with,  one, providing for the munitions and exportability of funds to procure  critical munitions, but as well the humanitarian aid that is to correct  the devastation of children who saw the bodies of their parents dead in  the street.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  kindness.   Dealing with the pictures that were depicted, but the stories that I  heard of children sitting next to dead parents, or dead bodies,  children unaccompanied, lost, orphaned.   So my conclusion is that, in addition to war, we must realize that  our children are our future.   In this bill, the administration for children and families, $900  million to provide refugee support services, housing, English language,  trauma and support services to help those who have been trafficked or  may be trafficked, to help those who have been raped, young women and  children; to deal with the Centers for Disease Control with $54 million  to provide them medical support; and, of course, to be able to provide  dealing with the migration and refugee circumstances that we saw in  Poland that took 2 to 3 million refugees, including children.                                time  2110    We are standing on democracy. We are not afraid to stand with what is  right, and we are not afraid to say glory to Ukraine. We want the  victory for Ukraine, and we want defeat for Vladimir Putin. Regime  change would be great, but we realize that will not happen, but defeat  must happen. I support the supplemental. Let us stand for democracy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute this naming of a  Houston post office after Vanessa Guillen and to congratulate my  colleague, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, whose constituent Vanessa was,  for her leadership in recognizing the importance of the life and legacy  of Vanessa Guillen. She was a hero in life and a hero in death.   As the story is told, all of her life she wanted to be in the United  States Army, and she was an impeccable member of the United States  military. Her tragic story is not one that she deserved, the violent  death, the sexual assault, the lack of oversight, the lack of knowledge  and investigation and process that would have really saved her life.   She did her duty. She made those in positions of power aware of the  journey and the trials and tribulations that she was facing. Yet, her  life was lost but not her legacy, not her story, and not the response  that has come about through the United States Congress. And that will  continue.   As I heard my colleague say, she will not rest until Vanessa Guillen  gets justice. This is one step of honor for all little girls to know  what a brave and wonderful young woman she was and to be able to say to  her family that we will never forget her story.   I honor her tonight; I honor her legacy; I honor her bravery; and I  honor her story.   What are we to say to the young girls who seek to be part of the  United States military and to fight and stand for their country? Yes,  they can model their lives after the service given by Vanessa Guillen.   I thank her, brave that she was and, yes, a servant of the people of  the United States. I thank her, and I salute her.   Congratulations for this post office to her family and her community  and to Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia.
