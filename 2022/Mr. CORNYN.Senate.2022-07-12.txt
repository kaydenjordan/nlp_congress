 Mr. President, month after month, week after week, day  after day, family budgets are being battered by inflation--inflation  made worse by the reckless spending habits of the Federal Government  and particularly of the Biden administration.   Gas prices are up nearly 50 percent from a year ago, and grocery  bills--as any of us can see when we go to the grocery store--have  soared. From eggs to milk to meat to produce, everyday essentials cost  more today than they did last year.   The pain of inflation is having a dramatic impact on the American  people. This quote from the New York Times yesterday sums it up pretty  well:         Widespread concerns about the economy and inflation have       helped turn the national mood decidedly dark, both on Mr.       Biden and the trajectory of our nation.    It is a sentiment I have heard over and over again in my  conversations with my constituents in Texas, and it is one that is  increasingly visible in public surveys. A recent poll from the New York  Times and Siena College found that more than three-quarters of voters  think that the United States is headed in the wrong direction--three- quarters of the country. Only 13 percent said the country was on the  right track.   With voter confidence at a concerning low, our Democratic colleagues  have made an interesting calculation. They are trying to resurrect  their ``Build Back Broke'' agenda. Now, you may remember this bill,  which was called Build Back Better, but I think it can more accurately  be described as ``Build Back Broke'' or ``Build Back Bankrupt.'' This  bill went out with a whimper last year because our Democratic  colleagues didn't even have the support among their Members to pass it  in an evenly divided Senate where the Vice President breaks the tie.   So they have now chosen this moment, for some reason, to bring it  back. To have a shot at passing this proposal, our Democratic  colleagues have slimmed and trimmed the bill, but it still packs a  painful punch, especially where it has to do with energy prices.   Last month, the national average of gasoline exceeded $5 a gallon for  the  [[Page S3220]]  first time on record--5 bucks a gallon, plus. Since then, prices have  fallen some, but the national average today is still $4.66 a gallon.  Now, that is better than $5, but it is certainly no reason for  celebration, and it still costs almost 40 bucks more to fill up a  pickup truck today than it did a year ago.   In standard fashion, the Biden administration has tried to blame  someone else. Mr. Biden has implausibly blamed Vladimir Putin for the  high price of gasoline. So rather than acknowledge the impact of its  own policies which have discouraged investment in new production, new  supply, the administration is trying to blame the very energy companies  that we are depending on to produce more oil and gas so we can make  more gasoline and so we can bring the price down.   I have heard from oil and gas producers in Texas who are working to  ramp up production and bring down prices for consumers. It is as if the  law of supply and demand has somehow been repealed during this  administration. They simply don't get it that if you want to bring down  the price of something, you need to increase supply or reduce demand.  This administration doesn't understand that it is not as simple as just  pushing a button on a machine to increase output. This is a process  that takes time. It takes investment. It takes time to build the  pipelines and the infrastructure. It takes time to drill the wells and  produce the oil and send it to the refineries to make into gasoline and  jet fuel.   While industry is working to increase supply, Washington Democrats  are looking for new ways to put an even tighter squeeze on domestic  energy. You would have thought that the Russian invasion of  Ukraine demonstrated the irresponsibility of not maintaining multiple  accesses to energy. As a matter of fact, Mr. Putin had convinced most  of Europe to depend solely on Russian supply, and then when that is no  longer available or when he uses it as a weapon, they are looking  around for alternatives. But they are not easy to come by. They take  time, and they take some investment.    According to reports, we are hearing that our Democratic colleagues  are considering a new tax that would require energy producers to pay  hefty fees if they emit more methane than our Democratic colleagues  would allow.   Natural gas accounts for about 40 percent of our electricity, double  the amount of renewable resources. You know, we are having a hot spell  in Texas. I know it is July. It is always hot in Texas in July, but we  are having a particularly bad spell of 100-degree-plus days in my  hometown of Austin, TX, and across the State. And one of the problems  is that, for some reason, the wind that we depend on to produce  electricity from wind turbines has died down during this hot period, so  not only do you have the constraints on natural gas and other sources  of energy, but now even renewable sources like wind are not producing  as much electricity as we need in order to maintain the grid, in order  to maintain things like air-conditioning.   Hitting producers of natural gas with a methane fee and other  proposed tax hikes isn't going to change the fact that we need natural  gas to keep the lights on. We have seen emissions reduced by about 15  percent over recent years, primarily because the country has  transitioned from coal to natural gas. You would think that would be  something that we would celebrate, and certainly our energy supply  continues to transition as we come up with new and different ways to  satisfy our demand and our economy's need for affordable energy.   One change this tax that our Democratic colleagues are considering  would have is on energy costs for American people. Electricity costs  are already up 12 percent from last year, and with this new methane  fee, they would certainly rise even more. So instead of policies that  would reduce the pain at the pump and at the grocery store of sky-high  prices, actually, our Democratic colleagues are considering policies  that would make it worse.   I understand this proposal is still in the drafting phase, but it is  an example of the sort of things that our colleagues are considering in  their ``Build Back Broke'' reconciliation bill. Last go-around, the  ``Build Back Broke'' included tax credits for rich people buying  expensive electric vehicles. Now, most of my constituents in Texas  can't afford an $80,000 electric vehicle, but if you are a well-to-do  person and you can pay that price, you will get a tax credit, courtesy  of Uncle Sam and the Federal Government and our Democratic colleagues.  But you won't get it if you are buying a used car on a parking lot  because you need to take your kids to school or you need to be able to  drive to work.   Our colleagues also propose to provide billions of dollars in  taxpayer-funded rebates and grants to cover the cost of retrofitting  private homes--not public buildings but private homes.   While the climate policies would be sure to hurt working families,  another piece of this proposal would give the richest Americans another  cause to celebrate. The so-called millionaire tax break has been  scrapped and revived many times over the past few years. It is  extremely unpopular among working families for a very simple reason: It  allows millionaires and billionaires in blue States to pay less Federal  taxes. It is a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. That is the  proposal.   When our colleagues tried to include this provision in their most  recent partisan spending attempt, the price for this tax cut for  millionaires and billionaires was $285 billion. That is quite a tax cut  for the wealthiest people in America.   According to the liberal Tax Policy Center, 93 percent of those  making a million dollars or more would receive a tax break averaging  about $48,000--a $48,000 tax cut for people making a million dollars or  more or at least 93 percent of them.   So this isn't an attempt to support those who are struggling to make  ends meet or to bring down high prices that are wiping out family  budgets; it is a get-out-of-jail-free card for the wealthiest people in  America who don't want to pay their fair share of taxes.   Under this proposal, two-thirds of those making more than a million  dollars would receive a tax cut next year. Nearly 90 percent of those  earning between $500,000 and a million dollars would receive a tax cut.  These aren't the families who have been forced to buy just a few bucks'  worth of gasoline because they can't afford to fill up their car or  remove items from their shopping list because they simply find them to  be too expensive or have to make conscious choices for cheaper items at  the grocery store in order to feed their family to deal with inflation.  We are talking about not making their life better but making life maybe  a little bit better for the wealthiest of Americans.   If this proposal were enacted, about 70 percent of the benefit would  go to the top 5 percent of earners; that is, people making $366,000 a  year--roughly six times the median income in Texas.   The millionaires who stand to gain the most from this change are  those who live in blue States like New York or California that have  higher State and local taxes. They would get to deduct up to $80,000 of  their State and local taxes and send the bill to the American taxpayer.   Working families in Texas should not be forced to subsidize the tax  bill for Manhattan millionaires. Inflation is already pummeling folks  in Texas. The last thing we need to do is to send more tax breaks to  the wealthiest of Americans, who are not hurting at this time when the  vast majority of Americans are hurting.   Well, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise when the majority leader of  the Senate is from New York and the Speaker of the House is from  California, two of the highest taxing States at the State and local  level. And I understand they are hearing from their constituents  saying: We want our old tax break back that we lost in 2017. But you  shouldn't prioritize tax breaks for the wealthiest of your constituents  over dealing with the rising costs of working families.   This proposal won't ease the burden that Americans are facing or help  our country build back better; it will ensure that we never reach the  prepandemic economy that was the envy of the world. No PR blitz or no  spin doctoring can hide the truth about this reckless tax-and-spending  spree proposal that apparently the majority leader is considering. It  wraps ill-conceived tax plans, irresponsible spending, and hurtful  energy policies into another partisan exercise.  [[Page S3221]]    And let's get this straight. No Republican is going to vote for this.  So if, in fact, our Democratic colleagues can pass it--and they can if  all 50 Senators on the Democratic side and the Vice President vote for  it--it will be they who own it and who will be accountable to the  American people in the upcoming midterm elections. But it is fair to  ask where have these policies gotten us so far.   While the administration has kept its foot on the neck of domestic  energy policy while the President is making, apparently, a trip to  Saudi Arabia to talk to Muhammad bin Salman about increasing Saudi  production of oil--not here in America, which would create jobs, which  would create more supply, arguably bring down price at the pump--he is  going hat in hand to a foreign leader in a nondemocratic country and  saying: Will you please open the spigot just a little bit more?   I think it is embarrassing.   We have also seen our Democratic colleagues spend nearly $2 trillion  on a party-line vote earlier this year that helped ignite inflation to  its current 40-year high levels. This new tax-and-spending spree--or, I  should say, the old tax-and-spending spree bill which is now being  repackaged and presumably resold--won't be any different from the  earlier one.   So it isn't time to hand out tax breaks to the well-off or push our  country toward unrealistic energy goals at a time of more demand and  not enough supply. We need more domestic energy supplies. That would  provide relief for working families and a shot at waking up from the  economic nightmare that we find ourselves in.   So this reconciliation bill--this ``Build Back Broke'' bill that is  apparently being contemplated by our Democratic colleagues--is not the  solution. It is making the problem worse.
