 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great group who  has been documenting something tragic going on in our community, the  Toxic 18 group on the Treasure Coast of Florida.   The administrators and the members of Toxic 18 have dedicated  countless volunteer hours to taking pictures, videos, and looking at  the destruction which has included dead animals, sickness, destroyed  environment, and businesses being forced to close across the Treasure  Coast, all as a result of the harmful algal blooms going on in our  area.   Their administrators, people who I have had the chance to get to  know, like Cyndi Lenz, Jennie Pawlowsky, Cristina Maldonado, Kim  Streiber, and Troy Brown have done an outstanding job, and because of  their work, I am very optimistic for a great 2019 and future beyond  that because of the work they have already done in 2018 and before.                            ____________________
