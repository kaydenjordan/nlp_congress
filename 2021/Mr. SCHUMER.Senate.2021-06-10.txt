 Madam President, late last night, a giant of the legal  world, Judge Robert Katzmann, passed away at the age of 68. He was the  former chief judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York,  one of the Nation's foremost jurists, and a kind, humble, compassionate  human being, who was deeply admired by everyone who knew him.   The son of immigrants--his father was a refugee from Nazi Germany-- Robert Katzmann was an amazing intellect, attending our Nation's top  schools. He went on to work for his professor and eventual mentor,  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whetting his chops in working on the  confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. For the rest  of his life, he was maybe the most important writer on the topic of  legislative-judicial relations.   Later in his life, even when he had attained one of the highest  judgeships in the country, Judge Katzmann never lost his passion for  helping those who were just starting their careers. He taught at NYU  and Georgetown and ran an acclaimed civic education course even while  he was the chief judge on the court of appeals. He also lectured widely  for the cause of proper legal representation for the poor, especially  the immigrant poor.   It just so happens that yesterday morning, I was able to introduce a  nominee to the Second Circuit, Judge Katzmann's circuit, who dedicated  her career to providing top-notch legal counsel to those who couldn't  afford it: Ms. Eunice Lee, a former Federal defender. It is a fitting  reminder that Judge Katzmann's legacy lives on through the principles  he advanced.   We send our deepest condolences to his wife, his brothers and sister,  and to the innumerable number of students and colleagues whom Judge  Katzmann inspired over the course of his life.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on the subject of our business  here on the floor, the Senate has had a very productive week.   We began the week by passing landmark, bipartisan legislation to  supercharge American innovation and lay  [[Page S4024]]  the groundwork for another century of American leadership on the world  stage. It passed with nearly 70 votes--an overwhelming and rare display  of bipartisan support. As I mentioned yesterday, we are going to work  with Speaker Pelosi and the relevant committee chairs in the House to  move this bill forward as quickly as possible. It is vital to our  Nation's future that the House and Senate must come together to send  President Biden a bill that he can sign into law.   The Senate also confirmed the first judicial appointments of  President Biden's tenure--two district court judges--and we will  confirm a third today, the first Muslim American to serve as an article  III judge in our history. On Monday, the Senate will confirm President  Biden's first circuit court nominee, the amazing Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson, and next week, this Chamber will take up additional, highly  qualified nominees to the executive branch, including Lina Khan for the  Federal Trade Commission and several others.   The Senate Democratic majority will move swiftly to perform our  constitutional duty to advise and consent on the President's nominees.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, ransomware, over the  past few months, there have been a number of high-profile cyber attacks  against the U.S. Government, American businesses, and critical  infrastructure. From the cyber winds attack last year to a ransomware  attack on the city of Baltimore and the Colonial Pipeline, cyber crime  is a real and growing threat.   Just last week, the MTA, our vast subway system in New York, was the  victim of an attack.   While the Attorney General has announced an intensified effort to  combat this scourge of ransomware attacks, we in Congress have a  responsibility to conduct oversight and determine whether our  government needs an additional authority and resource to take the fight  to cyber criminals and foreign intelligence services.   Congress must ensure that Federal Agencies, like the Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency, have the necessary resources to  take on this growing threat and support State and local governments  under assault. So earlier this week, I called for Congress to increase  CISA'S budget by $500 million to fight this growing threat, and today I  am asking Chairman Peters--Gary Peters of our Homeland Security  Committee--and the other relevant committee chairs to begin a  government-wide review of these attacks and determine what legislation  may be needed to counter the threat of cyber crime and bring the fight  to the cyber criminals.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, I want my  colleagues to be aware of the number ``29 percent.'' That is the  percentage of Republican voters who believe that President Trump will  be ``reinstated'' as President later this summer--29 percent. Almost a  third of Republican voters believe he will be reinstated as President.  According to that recent poll by Morning Consult, nearly a third-- nearly a third--of Republican voters believe Donald Trump will be  reinstated.   Of course, the idea of ``reinstatement'' comes from the disgraced  former President Trump himself and is nothing more than the deluded  ramblings of a defeated politician. But it is a glaring warning that  the Big Lie has created fertile ground for all sorts of insane  conspiracy.   It is a depressing fact of our times that there is an audience out  there who will literally believe anything the former President says, no  matter how unrealistic or untrue. They believe him when he just  abjectly lies.   The blame here, however, does not rest only with the former  President. The blame falls heavily on Washington Republicans and the  political right who have not done enough to stand up to the Big Lie.   After making a few brave noises in the wake of January 6, Republican  leadership here in Washington now seems to have traded political  courage and truth for appeasement.   The Republican minority leader in the House called Donald Trump  ``morally responsible'' for the attack on January 6. He empowered his  deputies to take part in painstaking negotiations to establish an  independent commission to study those events and then promptly voted  against it. He convened his entire conference to deliver a pink slip to  the one Member of his leadership team who dared repeat the truth that  President Biden is the President.   Here in the Senate, the Republican leader gave a strong speech on  January 6 and was willing to hold Donald Trump responsible for what  happened that day. Several months later, however, the Republican leader  whipped his Members into a partisan filibuster of an independent  commission, which he called a ``purely political exercise.''   The Republican Party is now wrapped around the axle of the Big Lie,  and a big reason why is that Republican leaders are unwilling to move  on from Trumpism.   We are watching the results play out in State after State, where  Republican legislatures have swallowed the Big Lie whole and are  rapidly constricting the right to vote and fumbling through old ballots  for traces of bamboo.   The truth is, the Big Lie has consequences. It erodes our trust in  elections, faith in our democracy, and it is gnawing away at the very  right to vote in America.   After 4 long years during which the Republican Party foolishly tried  to ride the tiger of Donald Trump, it seems as though many of them  wound up inside.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, it be in order to proceed to file cloture on  Executive Calendar Nos. 119 and 107.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Executive Calendar  No. 119.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 107.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June 10, be  waived.    I yield the floor.
