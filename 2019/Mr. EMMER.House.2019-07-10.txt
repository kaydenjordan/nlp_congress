 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the St. Cloud  Police Department for receiving the United States Department of  Justice's L. Anthony Sutin Civic Imagination Award. This award  recognizes collaborative partnerships between law enforcement and their  communities.   The St. Cloud Police Department received the award for its Community  Outpost Project. The ``Cop House,'' as is it is more commonly known, is  a refurbished residential home in a neighborhood that previously  experienced a high level of calls for local law enforcement.   The St. Cloud Police Department, together with numerous community  partners, now provides not only a local gathering place, but safety and  health programming for the neighborhood residents out of this home.   Congratulations to Chief Blair Anderson, Lieutenant Lori Ellering,  the Greater St. Cloud Public Safety Foundation, and all of the officers  of the St. Cloud Police Department for this well-deserved award.   Our community appreciates all of you and all that you do to protect  and serve us.                      Prioritizing Transportation Safety     Mr. Speaker, on Minnesota's U.S. Highway 12 between the  cities of Independence and my hometown of Delano, in just the last 5  years, there have been 811 crashes in which 239 people have been  injured and 24 people have lost their lives.   Several of those lost have been high school classmates of my own  children. In fact, this past March, Marleena Dieterich, a senior honor  student at Delano High School and the child of Thom and Deb, lost her  life as she was trying to get home.   Recently, Deputy Administrator for the Federal Highway Administration  Brandye Hendrickson visited Minnesota on behalf of Secretary Chao.  Following a bus tour of the most dangerous stretches of U.S. Highway  12, we held a roundtable with community leaders and residents to  discuss possible solutions and the need for action.                                time  1030    The accidents and fatalities on this road are avoidable. We continue  to urge Secretary Chao to visit and see firsthand the danger this  highway presents.   Congress must do its part to provide long-term Federal transportation  funding for needed infrastructure repairs and improvements. We must  find innovative and long-term solutions to address these sorely needed  improvements, like the need on U.S. Highway 12.   I thank Deputy Administrator Hendrickson and everyone who  participated in our roundtable. Together, we will continue fighting for  improvements on U.S. Highway 12 until we see the changes that will  prioritize the safety of our neighbors, our friends, and our fellow  Minnesotans.                       Inspiring Future Female Leaders     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my staff and to  highlight a program our office launched during my first term in  Congress for high school women in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional  District.   The program is called the Young Women's Leadership Program.   In addition to my staff, I want to personally thank the amazing women  leaders who have participated in the program and who have agreed to be  a resource and mentors for the young women who attend these programs as  they get ready for life beyond high school.   Every summer, our Young Women's Leadership Program hosts three  roundtable discussions featuring high-achieving professional women in  our district.   To date, we have been honored by the first female brigadier general  for both the Army and Air Force, the first Asian American female U.S.  district attorney, a surgeon, a college professor, and numerous female  entrepreneurs and business owners.   This program gives our participants insight into valuable leadership  experiences and career advice during a pivotal time in their lives.   Our panelists have discussed how to negotiate your first salary, tips  for networking successfully, managing a work-life balance, and  countless other lessons.   We live in a time in our Nation's history where everyone is important  and needed, especially strong women.   Again, I want to thank the incredible women leaders who have  participated in our program to pay it forward for the next generation  of women leaders, and I encourage my Republican and Democrat colleagues  here in Congress to do the same in all of your districts.                             A Better Way to Age     Mr. Speaker, we recently held a senior forum for residents  of Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. This forum was an  opportunity to connect our seniors and their caregivers with resources  to assist with health, lifestyle, and future planning needs.   I want to thank the Metropolitan Area Agency on Aging and the Central  Minnesota Council on Aging for partnering with our office to make this  event a success.   Recently, the House passed the Setting Every Community Up for  Retirement Enhancement Act. This nonpartisan law, more commonly known  as the SECURE Act, will make it easier to establish retirement plans  and removes age limits for IRA contributions.   The SECURE Act will allow our seniors more flexibility and improve  their quality of life in retirement.  [[Page H5311]]    This is great, nonpartisan work by Congress. And, going forward, we  must all be committed to doing what we can to ensure our seniors are  able to plan for their financial futures, stay healthy, and maintain  connections to their communities.                            ____________________
