 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the tremendous work  by several Ohioans and to reflect on what the power of education has on  our young people today, as reflected by the boards.   It has been said: ``A quality education has the power to transform  societies in a single generation, provide children with the protection  they need from the hazards of poverty, labor exploitation, and disease,  and give them the knowledge, skills, and confidence to reach their full  potential.''   I met with Columbus City Schools Board of Education members W. Shawna  Gibbs, Michael Cole, and Gahanna-Jefferson Public School Board  President Beryl Brown Piccolantonio. These three dedicated educators  and advocates, along with a whole host of others from across the Third  Congressional District, are working day and night to ensure every child  has the knowledge, skills, and confidence to reach their full  potential.   Across my whole district, whether that be Worthington, East Columbus,  Reynoldsburg, to Groveport Madison, and everywhere in between, people  respect the power of education.   Another Ohioan committed to making this goal a reality for more  students is Jamie Spero. For over a decade, Jamie has been with  Sandusky City Schools, where she currently teaches ninth grade English.   Her hard work and unique ability to connect with students and people  has made all the difference. Under her tutelage, students have achieved  an 85 percent passage rate on the State aptitude test, and in the  process, achieved the highest value-added score in the English  department 2 years in a row.   Mr. Speaker, we need more people like Jamie, Shawna, Michael, and  Beryl.   Or as Jamie recently said to me:         We need more educators to let students know daily that they       can achieve anything they can put their minds to no matter       their race, abilities, or anything negative they have been       told.    Yes, America's next generation of leaders are today's students, and  many will go on to be great teachers, doctors, first responders,  lawyers, scientists, astronauts, you name it, and, yes, even Members of  Congress.   So I was particularly honored to find out that two of my youngest  constituents were inspired by me.    Recently, Catharine dressed up as me for Worthington Evening Street  Elementary's Black History Month living wax museum.   Similarly, Jamia, a student at A-Plus Children's Academy Community  School, did a presentation on my decades-long service to central Ohio.   As part of their projects, Catharine and Jamia highlighted my career.  I am flattered, but I want them to know, and every other young person,  that being the first is great, but we need to have a second and third,  because each of us has the responsibility to mentor the next  generation.   For example, last month, students from Grace Christian School in  Blacklick, including a student, 5 years old in kindergarten, were  studying Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, and 5-year-old  Leah said:         We learned what happened to people like Ruby Bridges and       Rosa Parks just wasn't right. We should treat everyone       fairly.    So I stand here today on the shoulders of heroes and sheroes who have  inspired Americans of all backgrounds for decades, even centuries, to  still do that: treat people fairly.   Mr. Speaker, whether it is the KIPP School, Bexley High School, Ohio  Media School, Columbus Africentric, or Columbus School for Girls, King  famously said: ``The function of education is to teach one to think  intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character, that  is the goal of true education.''   Thanks to all the hardworking teachers, educators, parents, mentors  past and present, students in central Ohio and far beyond are embracing  the power of education and its positive effect on the lives of so many  in our classrooms.   Let us salute these students and teachers for a job well done.                            ____________________
