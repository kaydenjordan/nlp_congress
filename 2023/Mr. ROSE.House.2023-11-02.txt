 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) which would reduce  funding for the Office of Air and Radiation under the EPA by 50  percent.   The EPA's Office of Air and Radiation is one of the most radical,  out-of-touch, and burdensome regulatory authorities in the Federal  Government that most Americans have never heard of. They are  essentially charged with carrying out the Biden administration and  progressive Democrats' job and economy killing Green New Deal agenda.   The unelected bureaucrats at the Office of Air and Radiation have  repeatedly targeted small business industries--people's livelihoods and  the way of life for thousands of Americans--with little or no regard.   It is time the American people's Representatives in this body, the  U.S. House, say enough is enough and remove the EPA's boot from the  neck of the American people.   Mr. Chair, there is no better way to start than supporting Mr.  Posey's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 4821,  the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act.   In June, the Biden administration's Department of the Interior led by  Secretary Deb Haaland issued an order to phase out the use of single  use plastics, including plastic straws, by 2032.   My amendment is straightforward. My amendment will prevent the  Department of the Interior from banning the sale of plastic straws on  public lands and national parks.   According to a study published in the journal Food Additives and  Contaminants, paper straws may not be more eco-friendly than plastic  straws. The majority of the paper straws in this study included  perfluoroalkyl substances and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS,  which are often referred to as forever chemicals.   According to a recent article in USA Today, scientists in Belgium  tested 39 brands of straws made of paper, bamboo, plastic, and  stainless steel found in shops, supermarkets, and restaurants across  the country.   The article continued that: ``These `eco-friendly' plant-based straws  are not necessarily a more sustainable alternative to plastic straws,  said the study's conclusion, because they can be considered as an  additional source of PFAS exposure in humans and the environment.''   Mr. Chairman, we have to ask: Why is the Department of the Interior  rushing to ban plastic straws in national parks when it is far from  clear whether or not there is any environmental benefit to switching to  paper straws?   Additionally, paper straws are absolutely despised by many Americans  because they start to become soggy almost immediately when you put them  into a drink. I think probably, Mr. Chairman, most Americans have  experienced exactly that.   So, Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of this USA Today  article titled ``Not so eco-friendly? Paper straws contain more  `forever chemicals' than plastic, study says.''                      [From USA Today, Aug. 28, 2023]  Not So Eco-Friendly? Paper Straws Contain More `Forever Chemicals' Than                            Plastic, Study Says                        (By Mary Walrath-Holdridge)         Not a fan of those paper straws that have replaced       disposable plastic ones in the name of being eco-friendly? As       it turns out, some of those efforts to save the environment       may have been in vain.        A new study, published Thursday in the journal Food       Additives and Contaminants, found evidence of ``forever       chemical'' PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in the       majority of both paper and bamboo straws tested.        Scientists in Belgium tested 39 brands of straws made of       paper, bamboo, plastic and stainless steel found in shops,       supermarkets and restaurants across the country.        Of the straws tested, almost all contained some       concertation of PFAS, which are often used during       manufacturing to make products water resistant. Out of the       total 39 tested, the chemicals were detected in 27, none of       which were stainless steel.        Paper straws, on the other hand, were the most likely to       contain PFAS, with 18 out of 20, or 90%, of paper brands       testing positive. They were also found in four out of five       bamboo straws, three out of four plastic straws and two out       of five glass straws.                             not so eco-friendly?         Eighteen different PFAS were detected in total, though       overall in low concentrations. The chemical most commonly       found, however, was perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) which was       banned globally in 2020.        ``These `eco-friendly' plant-based straws are not       necessarily a more sustainable alternative to plastic       straws,'' said the study's conclusion, ``because they can be       considered  [[Page H5358]]       as an additional source of PFAS exposure in humans and the       environment (e.g. after degradation in landfills or through       incomplete incineration) .''        The study also discovered PFAS that are known to be highly       water soluble, meaning they have the potential to bleed from       the straw into a drink, but did not investigate this       component further.        The researchers proposed that, while manufactures could       intentionally be coating their plant-based straws in       chemicals to make them water-repellent, the presence of PFAS       could also be attributed to contaminated soil or an       unintended consequence of material recycling. The authors       suggested further analysis and studies be conducted to       determine the primary source of contamination in the straws       and how the chemicals may impact drinks and people consuming       them.        This Belgian study comes on the heels of a 2021 U.S. study,       which found the presence of 21 PFAS in paper and other plant-      based straws versus no measurable amounts in plastic ones.        While PFAS were present in most straws tested, the low       concentration, paired with the limited extent to which people       use straws, means they don't pose an immediate risk to       humans.        Small amounts of PFAS are not harmful in and of themselves,       but rather their ability to build up over time, including in       the human body, is what poses the most risk. Even with these       findings, plant-based straws are still better for the       environment than straight-up plastics.        As stainless-steel straws are reusable long-term and all       tested PFAS-free, the study authors suggest the use of these       straws for bother environmental and health-related reasons.                                what are pfas?         PFAS stands for ``per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,''       and refers to a collection of long-lasting chemicals that       take a very long time to slowly break down in the       environment.        According to the United States Environmental Protection       Agency (EPA), PFAS are widely used and persist for long       periods of time in the environment, meaning they are found in       the blood of people and animals around the world, as well as       air, water, soil and in low levels in foods, packaging and       household products.                 what health risks are associated with pfas?         While scientists are still working to determine the extent       to which PFAS impact us, animals and our environment, they       are already associated with a list of health concerns.        According to the EPA, PFAS have been linked to:        Reproductive effects such as decreased fertility or       increased high blood pressure in pregnant women.        Developmental effects or delays in children, including low       birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations, or       behavioral changes.        Increased risk of some cancers, including prostate, kidney,       and testicular cancers. Reduced ability of the body's immune       system to fight infections, including reduced vaccine       response.        Interference with the body's natural hormones.        Increased cholesterol levels and/or risk of obesity.                        where are pfas usually found?         According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),       PFAS can be found in hundreds of products we use daily. In       some cases, they are approved for use in limited amounts by       the FDA, such as in food packaging.        They are commonly found in:        Stain- and water-resistant fabrics and carpeting.        Cleaning products.        Paints.        Fire-fighting foams.        Cookware.        Food packaging        Food processing equipment.    Mr. Chairman, the American people do not want their  government dictating what type of straws they can drink from.   A ``yes'' vote on my amendment is a resounding repudiation of the  nanny state that the Biden administration is currently building via  edicts from unelected bureaucrats.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close.   Mr. Chair, it is time to get the government out of our drinks. I  understand the concern that my colleague expresses, Mr. Chair, but I  would say that the best way to avoid the need for congressional  intervention would be for the administration to not be chasing its tail  trying to force American consumers to make choices that are absolutely  not clear in terms of the environmental impact that they would have.   The plastic straw ban being implemented by the Department of the  Interior is fundamentally and fatally flawed. Numerous scientific  studies have cast serious doubts as to whether or not paper straws are  more environmentally friendly than plastic straws.   Mr. Chair, just listen to these headlines regarding paper straws.                                time  0000    From the National Post, ``It turns out all those paper straws are bad  for the environment too.''   From U.S. News & World Report, ``'Eco-Friendly' Paper Straws Contain  Harmful PFAS Chemicals.''   Finally, from KSL News, ``Paper straws are no better than plastic,  research says.''   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record these several articles.                   [From nationalpost.com, Aug. 29, 2023]      It Turns Out All Those Paper Straws Are Bad for the Environment                            (By Tristin Hopper)         Canada has legislated the mandatory adoption of paper       straws just in time for new evidence to emerge that the new       straws may be just as unsustainable as their plastic       predecessors.        A new study published in the journal Food Additives and       Contaminants examined more than 20 different brands of plant-      based straws and found high levels of toxic chemicals in       almost all of them.        ``These `eco-friendly' plant-based straws are not       necessarily a more sustainable alternative to plastic       straws,'' concluded a research team based at Belgium's       University of Antwerp.        Straws examined by the researchers were largely found to be       laden with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),       commonly known as ``forever chemicals.''        This not only means that the straws likely aren't       biodegradable, but that they are vectors for chemicals       considered hazardous to human and environmental health.        The report noted that even in situations where a plant-      based straw doesn't become litter, it will most likely end up       in a landfill where it will spend the rest of its lifecycle       ``releasing PFAS further into the environment.''        ``Straws made from plant-based materials . . . are often       advertised as being more sustainable and eco-friendly than       those made from plastic. However, the presence of PFAS in       these straws means that's not necessarily true,''       environmental scientist Thimo Groffen said in a press       statement.        Canada is in the midst of an all-out drive to prohibit the       distribution of single-use plastics, with plastic straws       being one of the most visible targets of the ban.        In December 2022, Environment Canada made it illegal to       manufacture or import plastic straws, cutlery and checkout       bags, among others. At the end of this year, the sale of       those products will also become prohibited. The transition is       not free; even according to the most optimistic estimates of  [[Page H5359]]       the Government of Canada, the average Canadian can expect to       pay $50 apiece in the higher costs of plastic alternatives.        The University of Antwerp team performed chemical analysis       on 39 different types of straws sourced from Belgium       supermarkets and fast food outlets: 20 paper, five glass,       five bamboo, five stainless steel, and four plastic.        Only the stainless-steel straws were found to be completely       PFAS-free. The steel straws were also the only type that       could realistically be recycled. Researchers were surprised       to discover that even glass straws contained measurable       amounts of forever chemicals.        As to why these chemicals were so widespread in alternative       straws, one reason is that they were added to make the       products water-repellent. The Belgian study also noted that       it might be partially unintended; with so many paper straws       made from recycled materials, manufacturers might be       unwittingly using raw ingredients that were previously       infused with PFAS.        Although Canada's straw ban has often pitched as a means to       protect ocean health, the vast majority of plastic in the       world's oceans comes from a handful of countries (largely in       South Asia) that dump their waste directly onto beaches or       into rivers.        In Canada, by contrast, the vast majority of single-use       plastics are captured by existing waste-management systems. A       2019 report commissioned by Environment Canada determined       that of the 3,268 kilotonnes of plastic waste Canada       generated in 2016, 3,239 kilotonnes were ``collected.''        Ottawa has also done little to no research on the       environmental impacts or the potential unintended       consequences of finding alternatives to single-use plastics.       A Government of Canada report on alternatives to plastic       straws and checkout bags simply advises retailers to find       products that won't be ``problematic.''        That same report touts how Starbucks replaced plastic       straws in 2019 with specialized ``strawless'' lids, but fails       to note that the new lids actually contain more plastic than       the prior cup/straw combo.                                   ____                [From U.S. News & World Report, Aug. 25, 2023]         `Eco-Friendly' Paper Straws Contain Harmful PFAS Chemicals                              (By Cara Murez)         ``Straws made from plant-based materials, such as paper and       bamboo, are often advertised as being more sustainable and       eco-friendly than those made from plastic,'' said researcher       Thimo Groffen, an environmental scientist at the University       of Antwerp in Belgium. ``However, the presence of PFAS in       these straws means that's not necessarily true.''        For this study, published Aug. 24 in the journal Food       Additives and Contaminants, Groffen and colleagues tested 39       straw brands in a variety of materials for poly- and       perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).        Straws were paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel and       plastic. Each straw went through two rounds of testing for       PFAS.        PFAS were found in 69 percent of the straws. Testing       detected 18 different PFAS.        These chemicals were found in 90 percent of paper straws;       about 80 percent of bamboo straws; 75 percent of plastic       straws, and 40 percent of glass straw brands.        PFAS were not detected in any of the five types of steel       straws tested.        The most commonly found PFAS was perfluorooctanoic acid       (PFOA), which has been banned worldwide since 2020.        Testing also detected trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and       trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS). These ``ultra-short-      chain'' PFAS are highly water soluble and so might leach out       of straws into drinks, according to the study.        These all may pose limited risk to human health because       people tend to use straws only occasionally and chemical       concentrations were low, researchers said. But the chemicals       can build up in the body for years.        ``Small amounts of PFAS, while not harmful in themselves,       can add to the chemical load already present in the body,''       Groffen said in a journal news release.        It's not known if the straws contained the PFAS to       waterproof them or because of contamination from soil used to       grow materials or water used in manufacturing.        PFAS are used in many everyday products, including nonstick       pans and outdoor clothing. They make these items resistant to       water, heat and stains, but break down very slowly over time       and can persist in the environment for thousands of years.        They're associated with health problems, such as lower       response to vaccines, lower birth weight, thyroid disease,       increased cholesterol levels, liver damage, kidney cancer and       testicular cancer.        A recent U.S. study found PFAS in plant-based drinking       straws as well. While some countries have banned single-use       plastic products, plant-based alternatives have become       popular.        Researchers said the prevalence of PFAS in the straws       suggests they were added as a waterproof coating.        ``The presence of PFAS in paper and bamboo straws shows       they are not necessarily biodegradable,'' Groffen said. ``We       did not detect any PFAS in stainless steel straws, so I would       advise consumers to use this type of straw--or just avoid       using straws at all.''                       [From KLS.com, Sept. 3, 2023]           Paper Straws Are No Better Than Plastic, Research Says                             (By Mariah Maynes)         Plastic straws have long been vilified for their negative       impact on the environment. In efforts to be more       environmentally friendly, many businesses and consumers have       adopted paper straws as an alternative.        Despite well-meaning attempts to cause less harm to the       environment by using paper instead of plastic, researchers       found that paper straws are just as bad.        Christian Britschgi, a reporter for Reason Magazine, said       Belgian researchers conducted a study to examine 39 straw       brands. The straws were made with different materials like       paper, plastic, metal, and bamboo.        The researchers measured the presence of polyfluoroalkyl       substances. The chemicals are common in consumer products and       industrial processes.        The chemicals are often called ``forever chemicals''       because they do not break down in the environment, according       to the CDC. The lack of regular decomposition means these       paper straws can move through soil and water, contaminating       food and drinking water. Bioaccumulation can cause health       problems in animals.        Research has found that these forever chemicals are       hazardous to the environment and to human health. Research       has found that exposure to certain levels of polyfluoroalkyl       substances can result in adverse health risks, the EPA said.       Some examples are decreased fertility, increased risk of       developing some cancers and reduced immunity, among other       conditions. Research into adverse health effects related to       these forever chemicals exposure is ongoing.        Human consumption of products derived from animals that       were exposed to bioaccumulation, breathing contaminated air       or drinking contaminated water, or certain occupations such       as chemical manufacturing, are all examples of exposure to       polyfluoroalkyl substances.                           Paper vs. plastic straws         Researchers found that the paper straws all contained       polyfluoroalkyl substances. The paper straws contained higher       concentrations of forever chemicals than their counterparts       constructed with other materials.        Plastic straws also contain these forever chemicals, but in       lower concentrations. About 70 percent of the plastic straws       examined by the researchers contained the chemicals.        The only type of straw that did not contain polyfluoroalkyl       substances was the steel option, researchers found. Steel       straws are a reusable option.        Britschgi said the emissions and pollution produced from       making straws should be taken into account when determining       how environmentally friendly they are.    Mr. Chair, my amendment will stop the nonsense that the  Biden administration is trying to force upon the American people  through the Department of the Interior by prohibiting any funds from  being used to implement, administer, apply, enforce, or carry out any  plastic straw prohibitions.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment  and the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time.
