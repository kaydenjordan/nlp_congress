During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the day before yesterday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule for consideration for two very  important measures. First, the resolution provides for the  consideration of H.R. 2372, the VETERAN Act. This rule provides for 1  hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Ways and Means Committee.   In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 2579,  the Broader Options for Americans Act. This rule provides for 1 hour of  debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member  of the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, both of these bills are a part of the House of  Representatives' commitment to repair damage done by the Affordable  Care Act. These bills seek to amend key parts of the American Health  Care Act, which the House passed on May 4 of 2017.   The American Health Care Act expands health coverage options for  Americans by allowing them to use advanceable, refundable tax credits  to purchase State-approved plans in the individual market. The two  bills will ensure the tax credits that Americans will use to purchase  health insurance policies will be available to all who qualify.   When the House passed the American Health Care Act, the bill included  individual, advanceable, flexible, refundable tax credits that  individuals can use to purchase health insurance policies on the  individual market. When the bill passed, however, procedural reasons  prevented the House from including two key groups of Americans:  veterans who are eligible for coverage through the VA and individuals  who need to get continuation of coverage through an employer's COBRA- sponsored plan. The two bills covered under this rule will remedy that  same problem.   In recent years, the Internal Revenue Service has adopted a practice  of providing eligible veterans the choice to get financial support for  a private plan in lieu of enrolling in healthcare provided by the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   H.R. 2372, the VETERAN Act, will codify this and continue that  practice retroactively for both the Affordable Care Act's Premium Tax  Credit and the new tax credit created in the American Health Care Act.  Veterans will continue to be able to get premium support when they opt  out to purchase a private health plan instead of enrolling in the  healthcare provided by the VA.   Similarly, H.R. 2579 will expand access to the new American Health  Care Act tax credit to COBRA, in the continuation of that coverage.  Under COBRA, group plans allow beneficiaries to keep their existing  employer-sponsored coverage if they are laid off, work fewer hours, or  lose insurance due to a change in family circumstances.   Often, those who need to use the COBRA coverage are those most in  need, such as individuals who are in the middle of a treatment course  and want to preserve their network of providers. COBRA coverage is  frequently very expensive, since the individual policyholder must now  pay all the premium for their policy.   H.R. 2579 will extend the new tax credits to include people receiving  COBRA coverage and enable people who need it to continue taking  advantage of their employer-sponsored healthcare coverage, even after a  triggering event.   Mr. Speaker, the bills the House will consider under this rule will  help fulfill the promise Republicans made to the American people. We  made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with something  that works the highest priority. Six weeks ago, we took the first step  in fulfilling that promise with the passage of the American Health Care  Act, and today we will take another step forward creating a healthcare  system that works for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule, I urge support for the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say that I do agree with the honorable gentleman from  Massachusetts. Yesterday, I think Speaker Ryan gave one of the finest  speeches that I have heard on the floor of this House.   I also agree that there will be ample time for debate on all of the  issues that are encompassed in today's rule, and I look forward to that  spirited debate, as I always have in the past. But I also agree with  the gentleman, that some of that debate may be best left for another  day.   I also want to acknowledge the gentleman from Massachusetts and his  comments about David Vince. Any time one of our staffers departs from  either the minority or the majority side, it is obviously a time of  gratitude for their service, and we look forward to what is next in  their lives.   But I want to join with the gentleman from Massachusetts that we  appreciate the service of David Vince to the minority and to the  members of the Rules Committee in general.   So thank you for your service to the House, David.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for all of their work on the  rules and the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
