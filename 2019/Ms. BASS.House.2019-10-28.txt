 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 886) to direct the Attorney General to establish and carry out a  Veteran Treatment Court Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 886         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Treatment Court       Coordination Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that veterans treatment courts       are a successful program aimed at helping veterans charged       with non-violent crimes receive the help and the benefits for       which the veterans are entitled.       SEC. 3. VETERAN TREATMENT COURT PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations, in coordination with the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs, the Attorney General shall establish and       carry out a Veteran Treatment Court Program to provide grants       and technical assistance to court systems that--        (1) have adopted a Veterans Treatment Court Program; or        (2) have filed a notice of intent to establish a Veterans       Treatment Court Program with the Secretary.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Veterans Treatment Court       Program established under subsection (a) is to ensure the       Department of Justice has a single office to coordinate the       provision of grants, training, and technical assistance to       help State, local, and Tribal governments to develop and       maintain veteran treatment courts.        (c) Programs Included.--The Veterans Treatment Court       Program established under subsection (a) shall include the       grant programs relating to veterans treatment courts carried       out by the Attorney General pursuant to sections 2901, 2991,       and 3021 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of       1968 (34 U.S.C. 10581, 10651, and 10701) or any other       provision of law.        (d) Regulations.--The Attorney General shall promulgate       regulations to carry out this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 886, the Veteran Treatment Court  Coordination Act. This bill stands as a testament to the commitment  Congress has to veterans, those who have service-connected mental  health disabilities and become involved in the criminal justice system.   By establishing a grant program office called the Veteran Treatment  Court Program Office in the Department of Justice, the bill makes  permanent our support for the hundreds of local veteran treatment court  programs around the country that successfully rehabilitate veterans.   The Veterans Treatment Court Program Office would build upon the  success of the hundreds of veterans courts programs in the United  States by standardizing data reporting methods, serving as a repository  for resources, providing training to veterans court administrators, and  distributing information nationwide on best practices on how to improve  the administration of veterans courts.   Despite efforts to welcome veterans home and ease their transition to  civilian life, many veterans continue to face hardships after  completing their military service. One study reports that approximately  9 percent of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have been  arrested since returning home.   The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that approximately 180,000  veterans were incarcerated in State and Federal prisons between 2011  and 2012. Of those incarcerated veterans surveyed, 48 percent of  veterans in prison and 55 percent of veterans in jail reported that  they had been told by a mental health professional that they had a  mental health disorder.   Veterans treatment courts can provide an effective means by which  communities can rehabilitate veterans who commit crimes and support  victims by ensuring veteran-defendants pay restitution before they may  receive a dismissal or expungement.   Empirical studies show that veterans courts provide more effective  means of rehabilitating justice-involved veterans. Although 20 percent  of veterans court participants received jail sanctions during their  participation in the veterans court program, only 14 percent  experienced a new incarceration during an average of nearly 1 year in  the program. This rate of recidivism is substantially less than the 23  to 46 percent 1-year recidivism rate found among nonveteran prisoners.  Most programs report less than five dropouts in the 2017 calendar year.   There are over 500 veteran treatment courts operated by State, local,  and Tribal governments. This bill ensures existing programs will  continue their mission to serve our veterans and make it easier for  jurisdictions to start new veterans court programs and adopt best  practices.   I thank our colleague, Representative Charlie Crist, for his  leadership in authoring this bill and for his continuing dedication to  supporting our veterans.   This is a thoughtful and important bill that will help veterans who  need our assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his brevity.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would help provide support to more than 1  million veterans diagnosed with service-connected disabilities, as well  as the thousands who are undiagnosed who have been and will be exposed  to the criminal justice system.   Supporting rehabilitative veterans courts programs is the least we  can do to acknowledge their sacrifice and treat our veterans involved  with the criminal justice system with compassion and care.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in  strong support of H.R. 886, the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination  Act of 2019.   Our men and women in uniform often struggle with physical and mental  remnants of their time in service. According to the VA, over 1.7  million veterans received treatment through a VA mental health  specialty program in 2018.   Additionally, close to 20 percent of service members returning from  Iraq or Afghanistan experience depression or have a Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder diagnosis.   Mr. Speaker, we want our veterans to thrive. They listened to their  Nation's call and served when needed. It is now our responsibility to  address every single issue that stops them from living a full life and  continue to contribute to their country as a civilian.   Veterans' Treatment Courts are a valuable tool that assists veterans  facing non-violent criminal charges resulting from mental illness,  substance abuse or other adverse behavior.   They provide alternatives at the state and county level that focus on  rehabilitation and reintegration in part by facilitating programs that  provide support and resources to veterans.   H.R. 886 directs the Department of Justice to establish a Veterans  Treatment Court Program that provides grants and technical assistance  for local governments to develop and maintain veteran treatment courts.   State circuits that have either adopted a Veterans Treatment Court or  have filed a notice of intent to establish a Veterans Treatment Court  would be eligible.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I genuinely believe veterans are  an asset to our communities and as such should be given all available  help and assistance.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Crist from Florida for his leadership on  this issue and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3942) to apply requirements relating to delivery sales of  cigarettes to delivery sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3942         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Online Sales of       E-Cigarettes to Children Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE JENKINS ACT.         (a) In General.--The Act entitled ``An Act to assist States       in collecting sales and use taxes on cigarettes'', approved       October 19, 1949 (commonly known as the ``Jenkins Act'') (15       U.S.C. 375 et seq.), is amended--        (1) in section 1 (15 U.S.C. 375)--        (A) in paragraph (2)(A)(ii)--        (i) by striking ``includes roll-your-own tobacco'' and       inserting the following: ``includes--         ``(I) roll-your-own tobacco'';         (ii) in subclause (I), as so designated, by striking the       period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:         ``(II) an electronic nicotine delivery system.'';         (B) by redesignating paragraphs (7) through (14) as       paragraphs (8) through (15), respectively; and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:        ``(7) Electronic nicotine delivery system.--The term       `electronic nicotine delivery system'--         ``(A) means any electronic device that, through an       aerosolized solution, delivers nicotine, flavor, or any other       substance to the user inhaling from the device;        ``(B) includes--        ``(i) an e-cigarette;        ``(ii) an e-hookah;        ``(iii) an e-cigar;        ``(iv) a vape pen;        ``(v) an advanced refillable personal vaporizer;        ``(vi) an electronic pipe; and        ``(vii) any component, liquid, part, or accessory of a       device described in subparagraph (A), without regard to       whether the component, liquid, part, or accessory is sold       separately from the device; and        ``(C) does not include a product that is--        ``(i) approved by the Food and Drug Administration for--         ``(I) sale as a tobacco cessation product; or        ``(II) any other therapeutic purpose; and         ``(ii) marketed and sold solely for a purpose described in       clause (i).''; and        (2) in section 2A(b)(1) (15 U.S.C. 376a(b)(1)), by       inserting ``NICOTINE/'' after ``CIGARETTES/''.

(b) Effective Date.--The prohibition on mailing of       cigarettes under section 1716E of title 18, United States       Code, shall apply to electronic nicotine delivery systems on       and after the date on which the United States Postal Service       promulgates regulations under subsection (a) of this section.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3942, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes  to Children Act, is an important bill to protect our young people. I  applaud the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for taking the  lead on this issue and introducing this bipartisan legislation.   This bill addresses a very serious public health crisis in our  country, one which is tragically affecting our children. Since last  summer, a mysterious and severe pulmonary disease associated with the  use of e-cigarettes and the practice of vaping has sickened over 1,000  mostly young and otherwise healthy people, 18 of whom have died.   Public health advocates place the blame for this crisis on the  aggressive marketing of vaping products that appeal to kids, including  e-liquids with fruit, bubble gum, or even cotton candy flavors in  packaging that features superhero or cartoon characters. Advocates also  cite the mushrooming popularity of USB flash drive-like e-cigarettes,  which have a high nicotine content, appealing flavors, and can easily  be concealed.   Evidence of the attractiveness of these products to young people is  reflected in some staggering statistics. According to the 2018 National  Youth Tobacco Survey, between 2017 and 2018 there was a 78 percent  increase in e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent  increase among middle school students. H.R. 3942 will play an important  role in addressing this crisis.   Congress regulates the sales of tobacco products via interstate  shipment through the 1949 Jenkins Act. In 2010, Congress extended the  Jenkins Act to regulate delivery sales of tobacco products over the  internet through the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act, or PACT  Act.   Among other things, the PACT Act curbed internet sales of cigarettes  to underage people by encouraging and requiring that delivery agents  check identification in person when the product is delivered.   H.R. 3942 amends current law to curb online sales of e-cigarettes to  minors. It amends the definition of ``cigarette'' to extend to any  electronic nicotine delivery system, which includes e-cigarettes, vape  pens, and other electronic devices.   A violation of the provisions of the Jenkins Act is a Federal felony,  punishable by up to 3 years in prison. Amending current law to extend  these protections to e-cigarettes is the right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3942, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children       Act. There are certain provisions in the legislation which       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name Members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       Committees.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                 Acting Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I notice that there are a number of young  people who are in the gallery, so I am hoping that they pay close  attention to this debate since it is all about you guys.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3942 is an important measure to address a  threat to the health of our children and young people.   For the reasons discussed here today, I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
