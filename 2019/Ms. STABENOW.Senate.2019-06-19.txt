 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about something I have  talked about many times on the floor and to reiterate over and over  again that healthcare isn't political; it is personal. It is personal  for people in Michigan. It is personal for every person, every child,  and every family all across our country.   It affects each of us, regardless of our political affiliation or the  State we live in or what kind of car we drive. Hopefully, you are  driving a car made in Michigan.   At some point, just about all of us will need to take at least one  prescription medication in our lifetime. The question is, Will we be  able to afford it?   Brian Hose knows this struggle very well. He owns Sharpsburg  Pharmacy, an independent drugstore in Sharpsburg, MD. He joined me and  some of  [[Page S3815]]  my Democratic colleagues at a press conference last week on the rising  cost of prescription drugs.   As a pharmacist, Dr. Hose works hard every day to make sure the  customers he has have access to the medications they need to stay  healthy and, in many cases, to stay alive.   However, that task keeps getting harder and harder. Between 2008 and  2016, prices on the most popular brand-name drugs rose 208 percent--208  percent during that timeframe. Dr. Hose's customers didn't see their  incomes rise 208 percent during that same time. Certainly people in  Michigan didn't see their incomes rise 208 percent during that same  timeframe.   According to AARP, the average price of brand-name drugs that seniors  often take rose at four times the rate of inflation in just 1 year-- four times the rate of inflation in 2017 alone. That is unsustainable  for people.   Dr. Hose's most vulnerable customers are seniors, of course,  especially those who live on Social Security. As the price of  medications keeps going up and up, Dr. Hose's customers find it harder  and harder to pay for the medications they need.   Dr. Hose said this: ``In no way is the current system looking out for  the best interests of the patient, who ultimately needs to buy their  medications to stay alive.'' Just ask anyone who takes insulin. Insulin  is not a new drug. In fact, it has been around since 1922--almost 100  years--when Canadian scientists treated the first diabetic patient.  Those scientists sold the patent to the University of Toronto for three  Canadian dollars. They said they didn't believe they should make money  off of something that was so important to people's lives. Imagine. They  knew how important their discovery was and how many lives would be  saved. But somewhere between 1922 and 2019, insulin has become less  about saving lives and more about making money. In fact, over the past  15 years, insulin prices have tripled, putting people's health and  lives at risk.   Last summer, I met Nicole Smith-Holt, who lives in Richfield, MN. She  came to Washington, DC, to testify during a hearing on prescription  drug prices. Her son, Alec, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he  was 24 years old. Alec worked hard to keep his diabetes under control,  but one thing he couldn't control was the rising cost of his insulin.   When Alec turned 26, he was no longer qualified to be under his  parents' insurance plan, as we have under the Affordable Care Act.  About 20 days later, he went to the pharmacy to buy his monthly supply  of insulin. The bill for his insulin and supplies came to $1,300. It  was a week from payday, and he didn't have $1,300, so he started  rationing his insulin. Alec never made it to payday.   Nicole said:         I received a call that no parent ever wants to receive or       expects to receive. I was told that my son was found dead in       his apartment, on his bedroom floor all alone.    She added:         We lost an amazing young man. He had so many hopes and       dreams. He left behind a 5-year-old daughter who now has to       grow up without her father. His little brother lost his idol,       his sisters lost a best friend, and my husband and myself       lost our child.    Affordable medication is a life-and-death issue for millions of  Americans like Alec. Unfortunately, we have a pharmaceutical industry  that is more interested in profits right now than in people.   In 2018, there were 1,451 registered lobbyists for the pharmaceutical  and health product industry. That is almost 15 lobbyists for every  Senator. Their job is to stop competition and keep prices high, and  they are doing a very good job. It is the ultimate example of a rigged  system. It has to change.   The No. 1 way we can bring down costs is to let Medicare negotiate  the best price. From the beginning, Medicare Part D has been prohibited  from harnessing the bargaining power of 43 million American seniors to  bring down costs, which is absurd. That didn't make sense back in 2003,  when it was passed as part of Medicare Part D's protectionist language,  and it doesn't make sense today.   We know how negotiation can work. We know how negotiation can work  because it works for the VA, which saved 40 percent compared to  Medicare. We have the VA system for veterans, and we have Medicare for  seniors and people with disabilities. The VA negotiates. Medicare is  stopped by law from negotiating best price--which, by the way, keeps us  with the highest prices in the world. In fact, according to a recent  AARP analysis, Medicare could have saved $14.4 billion on just 50 drugs  in 2016 if that program had paid the same prices as the VA--$14.4  billion. By the way, cut that down, that is hundreds of dollars-- thousands of dollars out of the pockets of seniors and people with  disabilities and, more broadly, people across the country in every  family.   A recent poll found that 92 percent of Americans support allowing  Medicare to negotiate drug prices. I would love 92 percent agreement on  anything. We should be able to act quickly on something that 92 percent  of the American public thinks we ought to do. So what is stopping us?  The pharmaceutical lobby and my Republican colleagues in Congress. It  is time to listen to the 92 percent of Americans who want to allow  Medicare to negotiate with drug companies. It is just plain common  sense.   Negotiating a bulk price is not radical; it is actually something  that is done in industry after industry after industry.   Dr. Hose said:         Seniors in Medicare Part D are one of the largest       purchasers of medication in the world. Yet they are unable to       leverage their buying power to decrease their costs.    It makes no sense. It makes no sense. It is past time that this  should be changed. But we certainly, as we are talking about ways to  lower prices right now--and I commend the chairman and ranking member  of Finance for working on this issue and the chairman for bringing the  top drug company CEOs and the pharmacy benefit managers into committee.  I commend him for that. But this is the moment we need to be totally  focused and totally serious about bringing down prices in the most  effective way. If we want to do it right, we need to allow Medicare to  negotiate on behalf of the American people and put people first.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
