 Madam President, let me begin this afternoon with the  following quote:         [F]ew men in . . . society . . . will have sufficient skill       in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. And .       . . the number must still be still smaller of those who unite       the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge.    That was Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78.   The Framers knew the independent judiciary would be a crucial part of  this new experiment in self-government. If the separation of powers  were to endure and the people's rights were to be safe, we would need  individuals of the highest quality on the courts. So how fortunate for  our country that the Senate just advanced one of the most qualified  nominees to judicial service that we have seen in our lifetimes.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh  Circuit is a stellar nominee in every single respect. Her intellectual  brilliance is unquestioned. Her command of the law is remarkable. Her  integrity is above reproach.   First, as an award-winning academic and then as a circuit judge, she  has worked her way up to the pinnacle of the law.   But just as importantly, Judge Barrett has displayed zero willingness  to impose personal views or clumsily craft new policy with her gavel.  She has demonstrated the judicial humility, the neutrality, and the  commitment to our written Constitution that are essential for this  office.   By now, as tends to happen by the end of these processes, the Senate  knows Judge Barrett very well. Senators saw the Judiciary Committee put  the nominee through her paces with days of exhaustive questioning. We  have been able to study nearly 100 opinions she has issued in 3 years  on the Federal bench. We have had another opportunity to examine the 15  years of scholarly writings that most of us reviewed 3 years ago when  Judge Barrett won bipartisan confirmation to her current job. And we  have been deluged by personal testimonies from every corner of Judge  Barrett's career and life to confirm just what a remarkable person this  nominee is.   One of Judge Barrett's former colleagues at Notre Dame is a leading  expert in comparative constitutional law. That means he studies the  courts and constitutions of countries all around the world. He meets  judges from across the planet.    Here is what this expert says about his colleague: ``I have had very  many occasions to meet, observe, and work with high court judges from  all over the world, from Argentina to Austria, from South Africa to  South Korea . . . [and] I can say with great certainty that Judge  Barrett stands out, on a par in her abilities with the most  distinguished'' of them all. He goes on to say her legal work is ``as  erudite as it [is] clear and accessible,'' and ``as honest and fair- minded . . . as anyone could aspire to, with not a hint of personal  bias.''   Now, most of us would be thrilled to receive such praise once or  twice in an entire career--in an entire career--but Judge Barrett seems  to provoke this reaction in absolutely everyone. The highest  professional compliments seem to be the default reaction of anybody who  crosses her path, anybody who comes into contact with her.   Eighty-one of her law school classmates from ``diverse backgrounds,  political affiliations, and philosophies'' say the nominee embodies  ``the highest caliber of intellect . . . fair-mindedness, empathy,  integrity, humility, good humor, and commitment to justice.'' They also  said: ``As fellow students, we often learned more from Amy than the  professor.''   Three years ago, more than 70 fellow scholars wrote the Senate,  calling her scholarship ``careful,'' ``rigorous [and] fair-minded.''  They said her ``personal integrity'' earns wide respect.   Listen to this. Every one of the Supreme Court alumni who clerked  alongside Judge Barrett wrote us to share their ``unanimous'' view that  she is a ``woman of remarkable intellect and character.'' That means,  colleagues, those were the clerks to Ginsburg and the clerks to Breyer  as well--all of them, without exception.   How did that clerkship come about? It came about, by the way, after  one of her professors, who is now a university president, wrote Justice  Scalia with one sentence: ``Amy Coney Barrett is the best student I  ever had.''   But before she clerked for the Supreme Court, she clerked for  Laurence Silberman over on the DC Circuit, who, by his own admission,  is an Ivy League snob. He got a call one day from a professor at Notre  Dame, and he said: ``I know you only take clerks from mostly Harvard  and Yale, but this is the best student I ever had at Notre Dame.'' So  this Ivy League snob decided to take a chance on somebody who didn't go  to Harvard or Yale. That was Amy Coney Barrett. And then he called his  good friend Nino Scalia and said: ``Goodness, gracious, you don't want  to miss this opportunity to have this clerk.''   So we have here a uniquely qualified person, and the best evidence of  it is you don't hear anything over there about her qualifications; not  a peep about her talent, her intellect. We have, colleagues, the  perfect nominee for the Supreme Court.   A few weeks ago, Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, who leans left,  wrote that Judge Barrett is ``a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who  will analyze and decide cases in good faith.'' He said she ``meets and  exceeds'' the ``basic criteria for being a good Justice.''   So, as I was saying, no matter all the acrimony that has swirled  around the process, nobody has attempted to dispute Judge Barrett's  qualifications. To the contrary, no one can help being impressed.   At one point during Judge Barrett's hearing, she was asked about an  arcane legal doctrine. Her answer was so clear and so accessible that  one of our Democratic colleagues--I won't name him; I don't want to get  him in trouble--had to remark: ``That's quite a definition. I'm really  impressed.'' Well, so are the American people.   Some opponents of this nomination come right out and say ``It is not  about qualifications.'' They deserve some credit for being honest about  it. They say they aren't interested in whether Judge Barrett will  smartly and faithfully apply our laws and our Constitution. They aren't  interested in that. Instead, they want to make apocalyptic predictions  about policy.   Well, there are a few problems with that. One is that their political  side  [[Page S6451]]  has been shopping the same horror stories for 50 years. They have been  saying the same thing for half a century about every Supreme Court  nominee by a Republican President, without exception. Many of those  judges--not to the delight of some people on this side of the aisle-- went on to not disappoint the other side, which shows you how hard it  is to predict what someone will be for life. Many have been surprised,  some unpleasantly.   It is almost as if jurists are not politicians with policy platforms.  It is almost as though that is the wrong way to look at it. That is a  deeper misunderstanding of what is at play here.   Let me quote an expert: ``A judge must apply the law as written, not  as she wishes it were.''   Scalia used to put it this way. He would say: If you want to make  policy, why don't you run for office? That is not what we do here. That  is not our job.   It takes a good deal of discipline to squeeze your personal opinion  out of your decision-making. Those are the kinds of judges we have been  confirming here for the last 4 years--people who are sworn to uphold  the law and take it seriously.   President Obama once said he wanted to appoint judges who had  empathy. Think about it for a minute. If you are the litigant for whom  the judge has empathy, you are probably in pretty good shape. But what  if you aren't? That is not what we have been doing here for the last 4  years with the judiciary. The reason that frightens these guys on the  other side so much is because that is exactly what they want--another  branch of legislators seeking outcomes that may or may not be reflected  in the law or the Constitution that is before them. That is exactly  what they want.   Courts have a vital responsibility to enforce the rule of law, which  is critical to a free society, but the policy decisions and value  judgments of the government must be made by the political branches  elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect  courts to do so, and courts should not try--shouldn't try.   Now, who said that? That was Amy Barrett who said that. She  understands the separation of powers far more keenly than her critics.  She understands the job of a judge.   Our Democratic colleagues should not have tried to filibuster this  exceptional nominee. They should have listened and actually learned.   I loved during the hearing when Senator Cornyn said: What do you have  on your notepad? She held it up. Nothing. Nothing. No notes at all.   We have a few former Supreme Court clerks on that committee: Senator  Cruz, Senator Hawley. I have heard them say over and over--oh, three.  Mike. Sorry. Three. So they have been around the best, at the highest  level. Nobody has seen anything better than this. This is something to  really be proud of and feel good about. We made an important  contribution to the future of this country.   A lot of what we have done over the last 4 years will be undone  sooner or later by the next election. They won't be able to do much  about this for a long time to come.   Fortunately for Judge Barrett and for our Nation, history will  remember what is already clear: The deficiency is with their judgment,  not hers--their judgment, not hers. The Senate is doing the right  thing.   We are moving this nomination forward, and, colleagues, by tomorrow  night we will have a new member of the U.S. Supreme Court   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I think my remarks may encroach  somewhat on the time previously set for beginning the vote. I ask  consent that I be allowed to finish.    Mr. President, this evening the Senate will render one  of the most consequential judgments it can ever deliver. We will  approve a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court.   Since the ink dried on the Constitution, only 114 men and women have  been entrusted to uphold the separation of powers, protect people's  rights, and dispense impartial justice on the Supreme Court. In a few  minutes, Judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana will join their ranks.   This body has spent weeks studying the nominee's record. We have  examined 15 years of scholarly writings, about 100 opinions from the  Seventh Circuit, and testimonials from legal experts running the gamut  from close colleagues to total strangers.   There have been one-on-one meetings for every Senator who wanted one  and a week of intensive hearings. All of it--all of it--has pointed to  one conclusion: This is one of the most brilliant, admired, and well- qualified nominees in our lifetime.   Intellectually, Judge Barrett is an absolute all-star. She graduated  No. 1 in her class at Notre Dame Law School. She clerked on the second  highest Federal court and the Supreme Court. Then she returned to her  alma mater and became an award-winning academic.   Judge Barrett's mastery of the Constitution gives her a firm grasp on  the judicial role. She has pledged to ``apply the law as written, not  as she wishes it were.'' Her testimony, her writings, and her  reputation confirm a total and complete commitment to impartiality, and  the nominee's personal integrity and strength of character are  literally beyond reproach.   She earned the highest rating from the left-leaning American Bar  Association. They marveled at the ``breadth, diversity, and strength of  the positive feedback [they] received from judges and lawyers of all  political persuasions.''   If confirmed, this daughter of Louisiana and Indiana will become the  only current Justice with a law degree from any school not named  Harvard or Yale--any school not named Harvard or Yale. She will be the  first mother of school-aged children to ever sit on the Court.   By every account, the Supreme Court is getting not just a talented  lawyer but a fantastic person. We have heard moving testimony from  former students whom Judge Barrett went out of her way to help and to  mentor. Her past clerks describe an exemplary boss. Her fellow scholars  describe a winsome, respectful colleague who is tailor-made for the  collaborative atmosphere of the Court.   By any objective standard, colleagues, Judge Barrett deserves to be  confirmed to the Supreme Court. The American people agree. In just a  few minutes, she will be on the Supreme Court.   Two weeks ago, a CNN journalist made this observation that I found  particularly interesting. This is what he said: ``Let's be honest . . .  in another [political] age . . . Judge Amy Coney Barrett would be  getting 70 votes or more in the United States Senate . . . because of  her qualifications''--in a different era.   Now, we know that is not going to happen. These are not the days when  Justice Scalia was confirmed 98 to 0 and Justice Ginsburg was confirmed  96 to 3. By the way, I voted for both Ginsburg and Breyer. It seems  like a long time ago now.   We spent a lot of energy in recent weeks debating this matter. I  think we can all acknowledge that both sides in the Senate have sort of  parallel oral histories about the last 30 or so years. Each side feels  the other side struck first and struck worst and has done more to  electrify the atmosphere around here about confirmations.   Now, predictably enough, I think our account is based on what  actually happened, what actually occurred--factually accurate. I was  there. I know what happened.   I had laid it out earlier, and I will talk about some of it again so  the people may understand how we got to where we are. It was the Senate  Democrats--our colleagues over here, who amazingly enough don't seem to  be on the floor at the moment--who spent the early 2000s boasting about  their  [[Page S6587]]  brand-new strategy of filibustering qualified nominees from a  Republican President. They were proud of it. They found a new way to  halt the process, stop those crazy rightwing judges that Bush 43 was  going to send up.   They pioneered it because they knew what the precedent was at that  point. At that point, as we discussed before, it just wasn't done. You  could do it--you could--but you didn't. The best evidence that you  shouldn't do it was the Clarence Thomas nomination, confirmed 52 to 48.  All of us know that any one of us in this body has a lot of power to  object. If any one of the 100 Senators at that time, including people  who were vehemently opposed to Justice Thomas--like Joe Biden and Ted  Kennedy--could have made us get to 60 votes and Thomas Clarence would  not have been on the Supreme Court. That is how strong the tradition  was, until the Democratic leader led the effort in the early 2000s to  establish the new standard.   Well, after establishing the new standard, they got kind of weary of  it. In 2013, the so-called nuclear option was implemented because  Republicans were holding President Obama's nominees to the same  standard that they, themselves, had created. When the shoe got on the  other foot, they didn't like it too much. It was too tight.   Senate Democrats, both in 1992 and 2007, helpfully volunteered how  they would have dealt with a nominee like we did in 2016. The then- chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Joe Biden, helpfully volunteered  in 1992 when Bush 41 was running for reelection that, had a vacancy  occurred, they wouldn't fill it. There wasn't a vacancy, but he  helpfully volunteered how they would deal with it if they had one. ``If  there is a vacancy, we won't fill it.''   Well, to one-up him, Leader Harry Reid and his friend--now the  Democratic leader--Chuck Schumer said: 18 months--18 months--before the  end of the Bush 43 period, if a vacancy on the Supreme Court occurred,  they wouldn't fill it. That is a fact. What we are talking about here  are the facts about how we got to where we are.   I understand my Democratic friends seem to be terribly persuaded by  their version of all of this. All I can tell you is, I was there, I  know what happened, and my version is totally accurate. The truth is,  on all of this, we owe the country a broader discussion. Competing  claims about Senate customs cannot fully explain where we are.  Procedural finger-pointing does not explain the torrent of outrage and  threats which this nomination and many previous ones had provoked from  the political left.   There are deeper reasons why these loud voices insist it is a  national crisis. You just heard it: It is a national crisis when a  Republican President makes a nominee for the Supreme Court. Catastrophe  looms right around the corner. The country will be fundamentally  changed forever when a Republican President makes a Supreme Court  nomination.   They have hauled out the very same tactics for 50 years. Some of the  opposition is more intense, but the doomsday predictions about the  outcome of nominating these extremists like John Paul Stephens, David  Souter--I mean, the country was hanging in the balance. Really?   Well, somehow, everyone knows in advance that nominations like Bork,  Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are certain to whip up  national frenzies, while nominations like Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor,  and Kagan are just calm events by comparison.   This glaring asymmetry predates our recent disputes. It comes, my  colleagues, from a fundamental disagreement on the role of a judge in  our Republic. We just have a fundamental difference of opinion. We just  heard the Democratic leader name all of these things that are  threatened by this nominee. It sounds very similar to the tunes we have  heard before. We, like many Americans, want judges to fulfill the  limited role the Constitution assigns to them: stick to text, resolve  cases impartially, and leave policymaking to the people and their  representatives, which is what we do here.   We just spent 4 years confirming brilliant, qualified  constitutionalists to the Supreme Court and lower courts who understand  their roles--53 circuit judges, over 200 judges in total--and we are  about to confirm the third Supreme Court Justice--what they all have in  common: brilliant, smart, and know what a judge is supposed to be.   The left thinks the Framers of our country got this all wrong. They  botched the job--the people who wrote the Constitution, they didn't  understand what a judge ought to be.   Several Senate Democrats have reaffirmed in recent days during this  discussion that they actually find it quaint or naive to think the  judge would simply follow the law. Quaint or naive?   Scalia used to say: If you want to make policy, why don't you run for  office? That is not what we do here.   Gorsuch said: We don't wear red robes or blue robes, we wear black  robes.   What they want is activist judges. They have made it quite clear. The  Democratic leader just a few minutes ago made it quite clear: What they  are looking for here is a small panel of lawyers with elite educations  to reason backward from outcomes and enlighten all of the rest of us  with their moral and political judgment, whether the Constitution  speaks to the issue or not.   They know what is best for us, no matter what the Constitution or the  law may say. For the last several decades in many cases, that is what  they have done--one activist decision after another, giving the  subjective preferences of one side the force of law. Across a wide  variety of social, moral, and policy matters like a healthy society  would lead to democratic debate, the personal opinion of judges have  superseded the will of the people.   They call that a success, and they want more of it. President Obama  actually was refreshingly honest about this. He said he wanted to  appoint judges who had empathy. Well, think about that for a minute,  colleagues. What if you are the litigant before the judge for whom the  judge does not have empathy? You are in tough shape. You are in tough  shape. So you give him credit for being pretty honest about this.   That is what they are looking for--the smartest, leftish people they  can put to make all the decisions for the rest of us, rather than  leaving it to the messy democratic process to sort these things out,  the way the Framers intended.   It is clearly why we have taken on such an outsized, combative  atmosphere with regard to these confirmations. That is why they have  become so contentious, because they want to control not only the  legislative body but the judicial decisions as well.   Let me just say this. There is nothing innate about legal training  that equips people to be moral philosophers. There is just nothing  inherent in legal training that equips people to be moral philosophers.   Incidentally, as I just said, that is why these confirmations have  taken on such an outsized, unhealthy significance. The remarks we just  heard from across the aisle show exactly why the Framers wanted to stop  the courts from becoming clumsy, indirect battlefields for subjective  debates that belong in this Chamber and over in the House and in State  legislatures around the country.   The left does not rage and panic at every constitutional judge  because they will simply enact our party's policy preferences. Any  number of recent rulings make that very clear. The problem that every  judicial seat occupied by a constitutionalist is one fewer opportunity  for the left to go on offense.   At the end of the day, this is a valid debate. The difference of  opinion on the judicial role is something the Senate and our system are  built to handle. But there is something else, colleagues, our system  cannot bear. As you heard tonight, we now have one political faction  essentially claiming they now see legitimate defeat as an oxymoron.  They now see legitimate defeat as an oxymoron.   Our colleagues cannot point to a single Senate rule that has been  broken--not one. They made one false claim about committee procedure,  which the Parliamentarian dismissed. The process comports entirely with  the Constitution. We don't have any doubt, do we, that if the shoe was  on the other foot, they would be confirming this nominee? Have no  doubt, if the shoe was on the other foot in 2016, they  [[Page S6588]]  would have done the same thing. Why? Because they had the elections  that made those decisions possible.   The reason we were able to make the decision we did in 2016 is  because we had become the majority in 2014. The reason we were able to  do what we did in 2016, 2018, and 2020 is because we had the majority.  No rules were broken whatsoever.   All of these outlandish claims are utterly absurd. The louder they  scream, the more inaccurate they are. You can always tell--just check  the decibel level on the other side. The higher it goes up, the less  accurate they are.   Our Democratic colleagues keep repeating the word ``illegitimate'' as  if repetition would make it true. If you just say it often enough, does  it make it true? I don't think so. We are a constitutional Republic.  Legitimacy does not flow from their feelings. Legitimacy is not the  result of how they feel about it. You can't win them all. Elections  have consequences.   What this administration and this Republican Senate has done is  exercise the power that was given to us by the American people in a  manner that is entirely within the rules of the Senate and the  Constitution of the United States.   Irony, indeed. Think about how many times our Democratic friends have  said--berating President Trump for allegedly refusing to accept  legitimate outcomes he does not like. How many times have we heard  that: President Trump won't accept outcomes he does not like. They are  flunking that very test right before our eyes.   That is their problem. They don't like the outcome.   Well, the reason this outcome came about is because we had a series  of successful elections. One of our two major political parties  increasingly claims that any--any political system that deals them a  setback is somehow illegitimate. And this started actually long before  this vacancy, as we all know.   One year ago, Senate Democrats sent the Court--the Court, directly,  an amicus brief that read like a note from a gangster film. They wrote:  ``The Supreme Court is not well'' in their amicus brief. ``The Supreme  Court is not well. . . . Perhaps the Court can heal itself [heal  itself] before the public demands it be `restructured.' ''   In March of this year, the Democratic leader stood outside the Court.  He went over in front of the Court and threatened multiple Justices by  name. Here is what he said: ``You won't know what hit you if you go  forward with these awful decisions.''   ``You will pay the price!''   That is the Democratic leader of the Senate in front of the Supreme  Court mentioning Justices by name and, in effect, saying: If you rule  the wrong way, bad things are going to happen.   For multiple years now, Democrats in this body and on the  Presidential campaign stump have sought to revive the discredited  concept of Court packing. Every high school student in America learns  about Franklin Roosevelt's unprincipled assault on judicial  independence, so now they are thinking about repeating it. Former Vice  President Biden, who spent decades condemning the idea here in the  Senate, obediently says he will look into it.   Most importantly, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg said last year, when  asked about this, she said nine is the right number. That is the  vacancy we are filling right now. I don't think any of them quoted her  on this issue, have they? Ruth Bader Ginsburg said nine is the right  number.   These latest threats follow decades of subtler attempts to take  independent judges and essentially put them on political probation: You  don't rule the way I want, something dire might happen.   How many consecutive nominees have Democrats and the media insisted  would ``tip the balance'' of the Court? How often do we hear that-- ``tip the balance'' of the Court? Has anyone tallied up how many ``hard  right turns'' the courts have supposedly taken in our lifetimes? All  this ominous talk is a transparent attempt to apply improper pressure  to impartial judges.   Rule how we want or we are coming after the Court. Rule how we want  or we are coming after the Court. Vote how we want or we will destroy  the Senate by adding new States. These have been the Democratic  demands. This is not about separation of powers. It is a hostage  situation--a hostage situation.   Elections come and go. Political power is never permanent. But the  consequences could be cataclysmic if our colleagues across the aisle  let partisan passion boil over and scorch--scorch the ground rules of  our government.   The Framers built the Senate to be the Nation's firewall. Over and  over, this institution--our institution--has stood up to stop  recklessness that could have damaged our country forever.   So tonight, colleagues, we are called on to do that again. Tonight,  we can place a woman of unparalleled ability and temperament on the  Supreme Court. We can take another historic step toward a Judiciary  that fulfills its role with excellence but does not grasp after power  that our constitutional system intentionally assigns somewhere else.   And we can state loud and clear that the U.S. Senate does not bow to  intemperate threats.   Voting to confirm this nominee should make every single Senator  proud.   So I urge my colleagues to do just that.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.

The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, of  Indiana, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  States is confirmed.   (Applause.)    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 865.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 744 and  896 through 902 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Air  Force, Army, and Navy and that the nominations be confirmed. I further  ask unanimous consent that for all nominations confirmed during today's  session of the Senate, that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.  [[Page S6590]]     Madam President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is home  to several marvels of engineering. These feats of concrete and metal  have brought prosperity and opportunity to tens of thousands of  Kentucky families. Earlier this month, we recognized the 75th  anniversary of one of these landmarks, the Kentucky Lock and Dam. For  three-quarters of a century, this massive structure has delivered  electricity, commerce, and jobs to West Kentucky. I would like to take  a moment to congratulate this community for brilliantly taking  advantage of its geography to improve the quality of life for  generations.   In October 1945, a crowd of roughly 20,000 gathered for a glimpse of  the first U.S. President to ever visit Marshall County and the mammoth  construction project he came to dedicate. Although President Truman's  visit was only temporary, the Kentucky Lock and Dam's rural  electrification marked a turning point that has lasted for decades. It  began as plans drawn in a humble patch of dirt by local businessman  Luther Draffen and engineers from the Tennessee Valley Authority.  Luther envisioned a lock and dam system that, for the first time, would  bring electricity to much of Marshall County and the Jackson Purchase  region. He relentlessly pushed for the investment and construction of  the project to improve flood control, enhance the flow of commercial  traffic, and power the region's future.   Luther made some influential allies along the way, including Senator  Alben Barkley, who began his political career a few miles down the road  in Paducah. Barkley was elected Senate majority leader in 1937 and,  with his new clout, secured the first appropriation for the Kentucky  Lock and Dam's construction the next year. Today, the dam creates the  largest water reservoir in the eastern United States.   In my career, I have had my own opportunities to deliver for the  families who depend on the Kentucky Lock and Dam. As its waterway  traffic increased, I led the authorization for the construction of a  new and larger lock. Since then, I have directed over $600 million to  the project through the Appropriations Committee, investing in  Kentucky's 20,000 maritime workers and their future. As work continues  on the lock, I will always continue to support this project and the  Kentuckians it serves.   Just up the river, we celebrated the ribbon cutting of a similar  project at the Olmsted Locks and Dam in 2018. Over the course of three  decades, the Olmsted became one of the largest civil works projects in  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' history. Today, it sees more commercial  traffic than any other inland waterway location within the United  States. From its authorization through completion, I was working in the  Senate to ensure the project received necessary funding for the  families who depend on it.   So I am proud to join this community in marking the 75th anniversary  of the Kentucky Lock and Dam and its transformative impact on this  region. I look forward to the completion of the new lock project to  continue its great benefits for years to come.   Bobbie Foust, a columnist for the Marshall County Tribune-Courier,  attended the dedication of Kentucky Lock and Dam in 1945. She recently  wrote an incredible article about its historic impact, and I ask  unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          [From the Marshall County Tribune-Courier, Oct. 6, 2020]   Kentucky Dam Brought Prosperity 75 Years Ago; Promoters Drew Plan in                           Dirt at a Plum Thicket                             (By Bobbie Foust)         It was October 10, 1945. The weather was sunny and warm.       President Harry S. Truman was dedicating Kentucky Dam from a       platform below that powerful engineering achievement.        The dam had been producing electricity for 13 months. The       crowd was estimated at 20,000, and it was the only time a       sitting president has visited Marshall County.        I was 11 years old, and I was there.        Saturday will mark the 75th anniversary of that dedication.       It will pass with little fanfare. Yet it is impossible to       understand the impact Kentucky Dam has had on western       Kentucky unless you have experienced it.        Kentucky Dam literally pushed Marshall County and environs       out of poverty. It was the brainchild of Calvert City       businessman Luther Draffen and U.S. Sen. Alben Barkley of       Paducah. Barkley later became vice president of the United       States. Their unwavering work to have the dam built and       located here is unmatched.        For those born after 1945, Kentucky Dam, Kentucky Lake and       Kentucky Dam State Resort Park have just been here for their       enjoyment. However, there's a powerful--at times poignant--      backstory of how they became reality.        At a 1975 dinner, the late Murray State University       Professor L.J. Hortin painted a vivid picture of Luther       Draffen as the driving force behind Kentucky Dam: ``In 1936,       we met in an old plumb thicket overlooking the Tennessee       River and there was poverty all around us,'' Hortin said.       ``If anybody had predicted we'd be in this beautiful Calvert       City Country Club now, I wouldn't have believed it.''        During the plumb thicket meeting, Tennessee Valley       Authority engineers and Draffen drew plans of the dam in the       dirt with a pointed stick for Senator Barkley and a bevy of       congressmen.        Before the dam, Marshall County was a poor farming       community. Thousands were leaving to work in factories in       Detroit and Flint, Michigan and chemical industries or steel       mills in Akron and Cleveland, Ohio. Electric power didn't       exist here. There were no electric lights, electric       refrigerators or kitchen ranges, running water or indoor       plumbing. Farm families lit their homes with kerosene lamps.       In winter, families heated their homes with wood-burning       fireplaces or potbellied coal stoves. Neither television nor       the internet existed though some families had battery-powered       radios.        In 1933 Congress passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act,       the New Deal federal agency that built a series of 16 dams       including Kentucky Dam. Kentucky Dam had three objectives--      enhanced navigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power       production. After operations at the dam began, it took       another five years before rural electric cooperatives,       created under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, extended       electric power to farm communities.        The history of economic development in the lower Tennessee       River Valley and construction of Kentucky between July 1,       1938 and Aug. 30, 1944 is a long series of events going back       to the Civil War. Without Draffen's vision, financial       investment, time and political prowess the dam might never       have been built at the Gilbertsville townsite. Though he       didn't do it alone, he was the driving force.        Draffen solicited and received help from a litany of heavy       hitters of his era. Besides Barkley, there was Hortin,       Paducah broadcaster Hecht Lackey, Congressmen Voris Gregory       and Noble Gregory of Mayfield, Senators Kenneth McKellar of       Tennessee and George Norris of Nebraska. Draffen also led the       powerful Lower Tennessee Valley Association, made up of about       40 business leaders from western Kentucky, northwest       Tennessee, southeast Missouri and southern Illinois. LTVA's       single goal was to ``bring prosperity to this region,'' known       as ``the Valley.'' Electrification was crucial if the       Valley's people were to prosper.        Draffen wasn't the first person to envision damming the       lower Tennessee River. Efforts to tame the river, especially       for navigation and flood control, began as early as 1864.       What Draffen understood was that electrifying ``the Valley''       was the only way to alleviate poverty. Building a       hydroelectric power dam would achieve that goal. In 1928,       Draffen made 48 trips to Louisville at his own expense to       lobby Kentucky Utilities to provide electricity here. KU       provided electricity to Paducah, but refused to extend its       lines into rural communities saying, ``there wasn't       sufficient need.''        Groundwork that eventually prompted Kentucky Dam's       construction started June 5, 1920 when Congress authorized       the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a 10-year survey       of the Tennessee River Valley. It was the most comprehensive       study ever made of any river basin in the United States. In       1928, the Corps recommended a flood control, navigation and       power dam at Aurora Landing in Marshall County. The       recommendation prompted formation of Aurora Dam Clubs in       Marshall, Calloway and Graves counties.        The project went to Congress on March 24, 1930, and on May       28, 1931, Southern Utilities Inc. was granted a temporary       permit to build the dam. But on May 18, 1933, President       Franklin Roosevelt created TVA. That changed the picture. TVA       opposed Southern's plan, and the company's permit was allowed       to expire.        Aurora Dam Clubs morphed into the LTVA with Warren Swann of       Murray as president, Draffen, vice president and Hortin as       secretary. In 1935, Congress authorized TVA to build dams for       a nine-foot channel from Paducah to Knoxville, Tennessee.       ``It was key legislation,'' Draffen said in a 1973 interview.       ``Without that, there was doubt TVA would ever build a dam on       the lower Tennessee River.''        In March 1936, TVA rejected Aurora Landing and recommended       Gilbertsville as the preferred site. Then began what Hortin  [[Page S6591]]       called ``the most frustrating, most difficult problem of the       entire effort.'' TVA kept stalling and opposition from       private interests arose. ``TVA had moved in but wasn't ready       to build the dam,'' Hortin said. ``All the while the nation's       economic condition pressed hard on the people. There was       hunger, people couldn't get work, and the outlook was grim.       TVA would say, `Someday we'll build it.' We wanted them to       get it started. TVA was being called socialism, and a lot of       unprintable things. But LTVA stayed out of that type rhetoric       and petty politics. Our argument was pretty mercenary. We       contended that TVA was building dams for other states, it was       federal tax money being spent, and here we were at the heart       of all this water, and our dam wasn't being built!''        In January 1937, fate took a hand as nature demonstrated       the need for a dam. Rain fell for 19 days. The Tennessee and       Ohio rivers and their tributaries overflowed their banks.       Multimillions of dollars were lost.        A crucial piece of legislation passed Congress on Feb. 16,       1938. Hortin received a telegram from Sen. Barkley reading:       ``Just retained, Gilbertsville, whole TVA appropriation.''       That bill meant TVA's appropriation wouldn't be cut. Still       TVA wouldn't use the word, construction. Draffen was on a       train bound for Washington to lobby for the bill when he       received the news. He continued his journey and thanked each       legislator who voted for it.        LTVA's lobbying bore fruit on July 1, 1938 when Congress       appropriated $2.613 million for construction of the dam. Its       total cost was $116.2 million. ``On that day the word       construction was used for the first time,'' Hortin said. ``It       was key; we had our dam!''        At the height of construction, 5,000 men from several       states came to work on the dam. The economy boomed, and       housing was needed for the influx of workers. TVA floated       homes down the river to Gilbertsville from its worker village       at Pickwick Dam and built a self-contained community with       schools, administration offices, medical clinic and       recreational facilities. That community, just south of old       Gilbertsville, became known as ``The Village.''        After the dam was completed, Draffen recruited Charles Hall       to assist him in efforts to entice industry to locate in       Calvert City. Hall wrote more than 1,000 letters touting the       amenities Calvert City offered--cheap electricity, river,       rail and highway transportation. Draffen and Hall reaped       success in 1948 when the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing       Company (now Arkema) announced it would build a plant near       Altona. It opened in July 1949. Pittsburgh Metallurgical       Company (now Calvert City Metals & Alloys) opened in November       1949. Industrialization had begun.        Predictions that Calvert City's population would balloon       from less than 300 to 10,000 by 1960 didn't happen. However,       industrialization continued with National Carbide of Air       Reduction (now Carbide Industries) opening in January 1953,       followed by BFGoodrich Chemical Company (now Lubrizol) and       West Lake Chemicals. American Aniline and Extract Company       (now Estron) opened in 1954; Airco Chemical Company (which       later became Air Products and Chemicals and is now Evonik),       and General Aniline and Film Corporation (now Ashland) opened       in 1956. Other spin off companies include Wacker, Cymetech       and many support businesses.        A few industries Draffen and Hall courted didn't locate at       Calvert City. Hall said General Tire, now closed, opted for       Mayfield. Then there was Great Lakes Carbon Corporation owned       by George Skakel, father of Ethel Kennedy. In a 1980       interview, the late Grand Rivers Mayor John Henry O'Bryan,       said Luther Draffen brought Skakel to Grand Rivers to buy       land for a plant. Great Lakes Carbon bought more than 1,200       acres a little northeast of Grand Rivers from TVA and three       private landowners. But in a letter to Hall dated April 3,       1952, Skakel said he regretted ``the company had reluctantly       decided to abandon its development plans.'' Skakel held out       hope that Great Lakes Carbon might build the plant later. But       on Oct. 3, 1955, Skakel and his wife, Ann, were killed when       their plane crashed.        Probably the most significant impact electricity from       Kentucky Dam made on Marshall County was a higher standard of       living for its people. In 2015, earnings in all industries       averaged nearly $55,000 annually. Last year, travel and       recreation--much of it related to Kentucky Lake created by       the dam--added $74 million to the county's economy and       Calvert City added 2.994 million in payroll taxes to county       coffers.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of the Senate, the President  of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the majority and minority  leaders be authorized to make appointments to commissions, committees,  boards, conferences, or interparliamentary conferences authorized by  law, by concurrent action of the two Houses, or by order of the Senate.
