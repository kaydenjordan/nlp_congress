 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 77) expressing the sense of Congress that financial  institutions and other companies should work proactively with their  customers affected by the shutdown of the Federal Government who may be  facing short-term financial hardship and long-term damage to their  creditworthiness through no fault of their own, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 77         Resolved, That it is the sense of Congress that--        (1) financial institutions and other entities, such as       landlords, consumer reporting agencies and companies engaged       in the production of consumer scores, should help consumers       affected by any shutdown of the Federal Government, including       the shutdown that began on December 22, 2018;        (2) even with the recent conclusion of the shutdown, the       period of recovery has just begun and the negative impact the       shutdown is having on millions of consumers and the U.S.       economy is significant; for example, analysis from S&P Global       Ratings estimates that the U.S. economy has already lost more       than $6 billion as of January 25, 2019, and if the shutdown       were to resume in a few weeks, the analysis suggests there       would be a further reduction of real Gross Domestic Product       by $1.2 billion each week the government is shutdown;        (3) financial institutions and other companies, such as       consumer reporting agencies and companies engaged in the       production of consumer scores, should provide opportunities       for consumers affected by any shutdown--including Federal       employees, government contractors, small businesses, and       other individuals--who are or will be facing financial       distress to easily contact and alert them of their situation       immediately;        (4) affected consumers may face financial hardship and       emotional distress in making timely payments on their debts,       such as mortgages, student loans, car loans, credit cards,       and other debt, as well as paying for rent, food,       transportation, school and other basic necessities, due to       the temporary delay or permanent loss of their income;        (5) to provide quick relief to their affected customers or       tenants, financial institutions and other entities, such as       landlords, respectively, should for the duration of any       shutdown, as well as for a reasonable period of time       following a shutdown, consider waiving or reducing penalty,       late payment, and similar fees; ceasing evictions and       foreclosures; and providing forbearance;        (6) consumers affected by the shutdown, whose income are       directly or indirectly dependent on the full operation of the       Federal Government, may be experiencing financial and       emotional stress through no fault of  [[Page H1265]]       their own and their creditworthiness should not be impaired       because of the shutdown;        (7) financial institutions and other companies, such as       consumer reporting agencies and companies engaged in the       production of consumer scores, should take steps to prevent       adverse information being reported and utilized in any manner       that harms affected consumers, including by preventing       modified credit arrangements intended to help consumers       fulfill their financial obligations from being reported to,       and coded by, consumer reporting agencies on a person's       credit report in a manner that hurts the creditworthiness of       the affected consumers;        (8) new products, services, or prudent workout arrangements       designed to help affected consumers that are consistent with       safe and sound lending practices are generally in the long-      term best interest of the financial institution, the       consumer, and the economy;        (9) financial institutions should work proactively to       identify their customers who have been affected by any       shutdown and adopt flexible, prudent arrangements to help       such customers meet their debt and other obligations; and        (10) prudent efforts to adopt flexible workout arrangements       for affected consumers should not be subject to examiner       criticism or negative examinations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 77, as  amended. President Trump's historic 35-day shutdown of the Federal  Government has had a deeply harmful impact on millions of Americans and  the U.S. economy.   While this shutdown recently came to an end, we must not forget the  recovery has just begun for a wide range of affected consumers,  including Federal employees, contractors, small businesses, and other  individuals.   Many of those people will not receive back pay. Many of them have  various financial obligations, like a mortgage, or a student loan  payment that they may have missed. However, they did not cause the  shutdown and should not suffer any negative consequences from it.   Financial institutions and other entities, like landlords and  consumer reporting agencies, can play a key role in helping these  innocent people. Given the financial hardship and emotional distress  these consumers face, through no fault of their own, I introduced H.  Res. 77 to send a strong message to the financial industry that they  should do what they can to help these innocent consumers.   Specifically, the resolution expresses the sense of Congress that  financial institutions and other entities should work proactively to  help all consumers affected by the shutdown. This includes waiving  fees, ceasing evictions and foreclosures, and otherwise providing  forbearance for any affected consumer, as well as taking steps to  ensure their creditworthiness is not impaired because of the shutdown.   Financial regulators agree that it is appropriate for financial  institutions to offer prudent accommodations to help their affected  customers. On January 10, I wrote to the regulators to encourage them  to provide public guidance to financial institutions to underscore they  could affirmatively make prudent workout arrangements consistent with  safety and soundness without fear of being subject to examiner  criticisms. I am glad that they made such a statement the very next  day.   On January 18, I wrote a letter to various financial services trade  organizations, as well as the three largest credit reporting agencies,  to encourage their institutions and member companies to take all  prudent and appropriate actions, including those outlined in the  regulators interagency statement, to help any consumer who may be  affected by the shutdown.   While I appreciate that many financial institutions have already  announced various accommodations for affected consumers, I believe it  is important that there be a robust effort by all financial  institutions, consumer reporting agencies, and others to do what they  can to help in the weeks and months to come which H. Res. 77 seeks to  encourage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 77, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), who is a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee and chairwoman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, this resolution is intended not only to help  Federal employees as such, but contractors, small businesses, and  others that are connected to government in ways that you may not be  able to absolutely identify here. You may have folks who are  consultants who are not considered contractors. You may have others who  will be affected by this who maybe had a contract with the Federal  Government that is now in litigation that has to be dealt with.   That is what we are intending to do, not just have a blanket,  blanket, blanket, but some connection to the Federal Government.    Mr. Speaker, let me say this: I know that we all want to  help all of those who have been affected by the shutdown, and so I hope  I was able to clarify that, so that people can help the constituents in  their districts even in ways they may not have understood.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Lawson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this shutdown has inflicted tremendous harm on consumers  and the U.S. economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the  initial cost for the recent shutdown is more than $11 billion and  wrote: ``Among those who experienced the  [[Page H1267]]  largest and most direct negative effects are Federal workers who faced  delayed compensation and private-sector entities that lost business.  Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost  income. . . . And people who lost income and consequently borrowed  money during the shutdown will see an increase in expenses as they pay  interest on that debt.''   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree that it  would be unfair if these innocent consumers were to suffer any negative  consequences from the shutdown and that financial institutions and  others should do what they can to help.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to try and give some comfort to those who  think that maybe there are individuals who are not federally connected  who would be getting help with this kind of approach, but that is  absolutely not true. I could not list every possible way, but I am  reminded that my husband was an Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the  Bahamas. I am reminded of the families who were there. I am reminded of  the children whose education we paid for while they were in that  country, and the education of other families of ambassadors and  diplomats for whom the Federal Government pays. We would not want to  not reimburse for the education of our children in foreign countries,  et cetera. So there are many ways that people who are connected to the  Federal Government are impacted by this.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to Mr. McHenry: Thank you so very  much for your support.   Again, this is a fine example of how both sides of the aisle can  agree on a commonsense resolution that will help all those who have  been impacted by this shutdown.   I am very pleased to have the support of Mr. McHenry. We have been  trying desperately in the work that we do, as we began this session of  Congress, to show that you can work cooperatively with both sides of  the aisle working together on a bill, resolution, legislation, et  cetera, that really does support and help our families and all the  people in the country who are looking to us for support and leadership.   Again, I thank Mr. McHenry, and I thank all the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle who get this and who understand it and whose  contractors and others are on them saying: What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?   This is our effort, and I appreciate their support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk on the  resolution (H. Res. 77) expressing the sense of Congress that financial  institutions and other companies should work proactively with their  customers affected by the shutdown of the Federal Government who may be  facing short-term financial hardship and long-term damage to their  creditworthiness through no fault of their own.
