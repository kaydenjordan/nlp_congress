 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Cantwell's question is for the House managers:         In his opening remarks, Chairman Schiff said the Ukraine       scheme was expansive and involved many people. Is there any       evidence that Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick       Mulvaney, Secretary of State Pompeo, Attorney General Barr or       anyone on the outside were involved in this scheme to       withhold military aid or obstruction of Congress?    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, thank you so  much for that question.   If we remember Ambassador Sondland's testimony, where he said,  ``everyone was in the loop,'' we don't just have to take his word for  it. During his hearing, Mr. Sondland discussed a July 19 email he sent  to the President's top aides, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, Acting  Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Mulvaney's senior adviser, Robert  Blair, Secretary Rick Perry, and Brian McCormick, Secretary Perry's  Chief of Staff.   We should at least start with, if we are serious about getting to the  truth, issuing a subpoena for State Department emails. If you pay  attention to the slide, in the email, Sondland stated:         I talked to Zelensky just now.        He is prepared to receive POTUS's call. Will assure him       that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and       will ``turn over every stone''. He would greatly appreciate a       call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about       a ``friendly and productive call'' (no details). . . .    Mr. Mulvaney, in the email, acknowledges receipt and responds  shortly: I asked the NSC to set up the call for tomorrow--6 days before  President Trump's now infamous July 25th call in which he told  President Zelensky to conduct investigations into the Bidens and the  2016 election. Mr. Sondland sent an email to the President's top aides  updating them on the status of the scheme.   Again, ``everyone was in the loop.'' On August 11, Ambassador  Sondland emailed Mr. Brechbuhl to ask him to brief Secretary Pompeo on  the statement he was negotiating with President Zelensky with the aim  of ``making the boss happy''--the boss being the President--enough to  authorize the investigation.   Ambassador Sondland wrote to Mr. Brechbuhl:         Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Z--    Mr. Zelensky.       to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The content       will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an       invitation.    And he is talking about the invitation for a White House Oval Office  meeting, which we know was much more critical and important than a  sideline meeting at the U.N.   Yet, further evidence that ``everyone was in the loop,'' Attorney  General Barr reportedly responded at some point--there was a New York  Times article that was done, and Attorney General Barr responded to  that article by stating that he was aware of DOJ investigations into  some countries, and that he was concerned President Trump was giving  world leaders the impression he had undue influence over what would  ordinarily be independent investigations. He cited conversations the  President had with leaders of Turkey and China, further demonstrating  that there was concern about the President abusing the power of his  office for personal, political reasons. Again, it proves that everybody  was in the loop, and we should want to subpoena and review those emails  involving the State Department and others.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mrs. Manager.
