 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 225.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
