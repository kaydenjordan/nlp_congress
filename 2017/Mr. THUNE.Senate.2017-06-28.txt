 Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Lilli Jasper.  Lilli hails from Sioux Falls, SD, and is a rising junior at South  Dakota State University.   While interning on the Commerce Committee, Lilli assisted the  Communication, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee.  She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the most out of  her internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Lilli  for all of the fine work she did for the committee and wish her  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
