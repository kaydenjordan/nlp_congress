 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Master Sergeant Jose J. Gonzalez of La Puenta, California, from my  district, who died on August 21 during combat operations in Faryab  province in Afghanistan.   Master Sergeant Gonzalez was a Green Beret who served with  distinction in the military for 17 years and deployed seven times  during his career as a marine, Army infantryman, and special forces  engineering sergeant.   He was recently assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces  Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.   Master Sergeant Gonzalez served with incredible courage and bravery  and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, the Purple Heart  Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and  many other high honors.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to recognize and extend my deepest sympathy to  Master Sergeant Gonzalez' wife, his children, his mother, his father,  family, friends, and his fellow soldiers in the 1st Battalion, 7th  Special Forces Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.   Mr. Speaker, to the Gonzalez family, please know that the Congress of  the United States grieves with you. The courage, character and  sacrifice that he has made to our country will never be forgotten.   God bless the Gonzalez family. God bless America.                            ____________________
