 Mr. President, last Friday, President Biden said the  following during his speech:         And we have a process in place to manage migrants at the       border. We're working to make sure it's safe and orderly and       humane.    ``[S]afe and orderly and humane.''  [[Page S4834]]    I have to ask, has the President visited the border lately? Oh, that  is right, he hasn't. In fact, other than a driveby by the border when  he was a candidate for Vice President--and by ``driveby,'' I mean his  motorcade literally drove by--the President has never visited the  border. Never. Although I have to say that even reading the news should  be enough to make it clear to the President the situation at the border  is neither safe, nor orderly, nor humane.   In case the President isn't clear about what is happening at the  border, let me just read from one news story from last week. This one  was from NBC News:         A new surge of migrants . . . is overwhelming the Border       Patrol and shelters in El Paso, Texas, where nearly 1,000       have been released near bus stations over the past week in       hope that they will find their own way to their next       destinations in the U.S.    Here is the title of another grim news article from last week:  ``Texas border town requests refrigerators to store migrant bodies  after drownings overwhelm mortuaries.''   ``Texas border town requests refrigerators to store migrant bodies  after drownings overwhelm mortuaries.''   Yet another news outlet reported:         El Paso County Sheriff sounds alarm over Border Patrol       overwhelmed due to migrants.    That article goes on to say:         Sheriff Richard Wiles stated Thursday, ``This incident       raises a law enforcement concern because Border Patrol is so       overwhelmed, undocumented immigrants may be released into       communities with minimal or no screening.''    Does any of this--any of this--make the situation at the border sound  safe or orderly or humane? I don't think so.   The Biden administration has been characterized by recordbreaking  waves of illegal immigration across our southern border, and I mean  ``recordbreaking'' quite literally.   In fiscal year 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended  more than 1.7 million individuals attempting to cross our southern  border illegally--the highest number of apprehensions ever recorded. As  for fiscal year 2022, well, we exceeded last year's recordbreaking  number of apprehensions in June. The final count of apprehensions for  fiscal year 2022 will be well over 2 million. Those numbers only count  migrants who were actually apprehended. CBS News reports that there  were ``an estimated 660,000 successful unlawful border entries that did  not end in an arrest in fiscal year 2021, according to unpublished  [Department of Homeland Security] figures''--660,000.   I don't have to tell anyone except maybe congressional Democrats and  the White House that these kinds of numbers have resulted in scenes of  near chaos at the southern border. Shelters have been overwhelmed.  Border facilities have been overwhelmed. The Border Patrol has been  overwhelmed. Who can forget the scene of 10,000 migrants camped under  the bridge in Del Rio, TX, last September?   Just in case anyone is thinking things at the border have  substantially calmed down, here is yet another headline from this  month, this one from the Dallas Morning News: ``Overcrowded processing  center has Border Patrol releasing more migrants on El Paso streets:  Migrants are being released from facility filled at 3 times its  capacity.''   That is from the Dallas Morning News--``3 times its capacity.''   Over the past few months, the Governors of Texas and Arizona have  been sending some illegal immigrants to places like New York City and  Washington, DC, and there has been a predictable outcry. But what is so  striking about this situation is how upset these places seem to have  become when dealing with just a tiny fraction of the situation that  border communities and border States have to deal with on a daily  basis. Washington, DC, declared a state of emergency. The New York City  mayor was outraged.   While I am in no way dismissing the challenges of dealing with  thousands of illegal immigrants, let me just put this situation in  perspective for a minute. Washington, DC, a city of around 700,000  people, has received somewhere around 9,400 migrants over a span of 5  months. New York City, a city of around 8.4 million people, hasn't even  received as many as Washington, DC. Compare that with the situation in  Eagle Pass, TX, a town with a population of just 29,000, which sees  10,000 migrants a week--a week.   For a party that likes to pride itself on compassion, the lack of  compassion Democrats and the White House display on this issue is  really astounding. Even after catching a tiny glimpse of what it is  like to deal with an influx of illegal immigration, Democrats have  apparently zero compassion for the border communities in States that  have to somehow manage the arrival of thousands of illegal immigrants  on a daily basis, along with all the logistical and security challenges  that involves.   There are real security challenges. Certainly, many of the migrants  crossing our southern border illegally are simply looking for a better  life--even if they are trying to circumvent legal pathways to enter-- but there are also a lot of potentially dangerous individuals coming  across our border and passing through border communities: gang members,  drug traffickers, human smugglers, and other criminals. In 1 recent  week, Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector along the  southern border arrested 21 gang members, 2 sex offenders, and 3  migrants with prior convictions for various crimes.   The White House and Democrats don't just display a lack of compassion  for border communities; they also display a real lack of compassion for  the individuals attempting to enter our country illegally. There is  nothing compassionate about an immigration policy that encourages  individuals to come here illegally, with all of the risks that entails.   Earlier, I mentioned a border town that was seeking increased morgue  facilities because it was dealing with the bodies of so many  individuals who had drowned while attempting to enter this country.  Deaths at the southern border have surged under the Biden  administration, undoubtedly because the administration's lax  immigration policies and obvious lack of concern about securing the  border have encouraged individuals to attempt to come here illegally.   According to Department of Homeland Security numbers that have been  reported, 748 migrants have died at our southern border so far this  fiscal year. That is a lot of lives lost, Mr. President--a lot of  lives. Mr. President, one illegal immigrant speaking to a news outlet  this month said of the border:         It's open, not closed. The border is open. . . . Everybody       believes that the border is open. It's open because we enter,       we come in, free. No problem.    That is the message that President Biden's immigration policies have  conveyed, and the longer that he continues with his de facto open- border policies, the more individuals who are going to be encouraged to  attempt the dangerous journey across our southern border.   Mr. President, the massive spending package, the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act, the Democrats shoved through the Senate last month  contained hundreds of billions for Democrats' Green New Deal  priorities, like tax credits for wealthy Americans to buy electric cars  and more than $80 billion for environmental justice priorities. There  was also, of course, an $80 billion funding infusion for the IRS, a  majority of it allocated for more IRS audits and increased enforcement,  including the hiring of additional IRS agents. Nowhere in that bill  were there any resources for addressing the crisis that has been raging  for more than a year now at our southern border.   During debate on the bill, Republicans gave Democrats five  opportunities to vote for amendments aimed at providing resources to  secure the border. Democrats rejected all of them. Apparently,  Democrats are willing to spend a lot of time and effort and government  money on their Green New Deal and finding new ways to collect taxpayer  dollars to help fund their Big Government spending plans, but when it  comes to protecting Americans and ensuring a humane situation at our  southern border, Democrats just can't be bothered.   I heard the Democratic whip down here, just now, talking about that  there just needs to be a comprehensive immigration bipartisan approach  to this and blaming Republicans for them not being able to do anything  to address this issue. And I just have to say that, one, the Democrats  control all of government in Washington. They have  [[Page S4835]]  the House, the Senate, and the White House, and, to my knowledge, they  have not attempted to bring an immigration reform bill to the floor of  the U.S. Senate. Furthermore, the President reversed all of the  policies from the previous administration that affected the border when  he took office.   Now we have got a situation at our southern border that is just  nothing short of appalling, and if the President really had any  interest in making the process at the border ``safe, orderly, and  humane,'' as he said the other day, he would make securing our southern  border a priority, and it is not. Unfortunately, given his record so  far, I think it is more likely that we will see the scenes of chaos and  human suffering continue.   I yield the floor.
