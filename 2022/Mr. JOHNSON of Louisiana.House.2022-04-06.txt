 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, during the last election, the  Democratic Party managed to win a razor-thin majority here in this  House and a split Senate, 50-50. No objective person can look at those  numbers and suggest that the President of this party, President Biden,  was given any kind of authority whatsoever to try to radically  transform our country, but, you know, that is exactly what he has tried  to do for the worse.   And the latest offense, the latest overstep, the latest overreach is  this President has made the most leftwing nomination to the Supreme  Court in American history.    For those who didn't see this over the weekend, Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson testified in her post-confirmation hearing written questions  for the record: ``I do not hold a position on whether individuals  possess natural rights.''   You heard that correctly. President Biden's nominee for the highest  court in this land cannot say whether individuals possess natural  rights. We can hardly imagine a more un-American position than denying  the first self-evident truth of America.   The central and foundational premise of our great country is that all  individuals are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable  rights. Among those are the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   We have a newsflash for the judge: Those rights don't come from  government; they don't come from any human authority. They come from  our creator himself. We are endowed with those rights by God.   The fact that Judge Jackson cannot or will not acknowledge this  simple fact is disqualifying for the highest court in this land,  period, full stop.   Mr. Speaker, the President's nomination is truly out of step with the  country and this fateful moment.   And the primary job Americans elected President Biden to do was to  help unite this country. This is doing the opposite.   His nomination for the Supreme Court is the latest example of just  how badly he has failed.   I am very thankful to my colleagues for joining me on the floor this  evening to discuss President Biden's radical nominee to the United  States Supreme Court, but also, as you will hear, the myriad number of  other crises the White House is creating at home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller).                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  drawing attention to that. The gentlewoman is exactly right, and some  of the Border Patrol officials have said that they estimate that by  rescinding title 42, that the number of illegal border crossings will  double overnight. So instead of having 7,000 a day, we will go to 18,  20,000 a day. The numbers are just staggering.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend; we always  need a little moment of brevity, don't we? The news is so bad, but the  gentleman pointed out and highlighted how difficult the times are, and  that is a serious subject.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), who holds the distinction of being the highest- ranking military officer ever elected to the United States Congress, my  classmate, president of our freshman class. I still call him the  general.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that  fight and that very worthwhile legislation, and we look forward to  seeing that.   The gentleman is right. The surge in crime is directly related to  border in so many ways because we know dangerous people have come  across that border. It is completely open to MS-13 gang members,  violent criminals, convicted persons, criminals who come from other  countries. You have child predators, even terrorists who have come  across that border. We know this for a fact, and still they won't  change the policies.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. So much  of that is just common sense, and I appreciate him pointing it out.   But sadly, unfortunately, this White House shows no intention  whatsoever of reversing its policies and positions, which could fix  these problems.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to yield next to the gentleman from the  great State of Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, John Adams said facts are  stubborn things, and those are some tough facts. They cannot refute it  because everyone can see for themselves.   By the way, Dr. Babin, I just pulled up the U.S. debt clock, this  thing that everybody can see on their smartphone. Currently, right now,  as we stand here, the national debt is $30,367,412,900. You can't count  it or follow it with the naked eye. Unbelievable. And he is proposing  more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for  highlighting that. It is a serious issue.   The longest-lasting legacy of any President is who they put on those  Federal courts, and, of course, the most important is the highest court  in the land. We cannot overstate how important this is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, that was so well said. I  appreciate the gentleman highlighting that issue. It is one of so many  that we have deep concerns about with this administration and their  budget and everything they do.   We have to protect the sanctity of every single human life. To defend  the defenseless is the job that we have--the first job, the primary  job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of wisdom  there. The gentleman is exactly right. If a judge begins with the  premise that we have no natural rights, that does not bode well for  where that logic leads.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Keller for that.  These words are not hyperbole. This is what the experts are saying.  Customs and Border Patrol agents, those officials who are there every  day watching this chaos, this calamity that has developed, they are the  ones that are giving us these numbers. They project 18,000 illegals a  day. It is just hard to wrap your mind around that.                                time  2000     Absolutely. And these are the results of  policy choices, and they could easily be reversed if the White House  would wake up and do something.   So I thank the gentleman for bringing that to our attention tonight.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard Members from across the country--north,  south, east, and west--who have expressed their outrage and their  concern with all of the terrible policy choices that are leading to  absurd results for our country. These are very dangerous times. There  is no leadership in the White House. There is no leadership in the  administration. There is no leadership from the Democratic majority in  this House or in the split Senate down the Hall. We can turn these  things around, and we can stop these crises if we make different  decisions, but they will not do it.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for my colleagues who have shown up  tonight to articulate this for the American people. We can't say it  often enough or loudly enough.   There is going to be a sea change in November, and we pray that we  can hold on and keep this Republic until then.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
