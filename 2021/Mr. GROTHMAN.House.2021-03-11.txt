 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak one more time  about the current issue at the border.   We have gone from a situation in which 1 year ago at this time there  were 36,000 confrontations at the border to last February 100,000  encounters at the border.   In addition to a three-fold increase, there has been a corresponding  increase in unaccompanied children at the border.   How did this happen? There are several policies that should be  reinstituted immediately.   First of all, prior to President Trump being sworn in, we had a  policy in which the Mexican Government was keeping people on their side  of the border pending an asylum hearing. We have now undone that  policy, which does three things:   First of all, new people arriving at the border are escorted into the  United States and sent somewhere inland.   Secondly, people who have been waiting on the Mexican side of the  border are coming across.   And thirdly, you are sending the message around the world that the  United States is not enforcing their immigration laws the way they are  intended to be enforced. The word gets out, be it in Central America,  be it in Mexico, be it in Asia, be it in Brazil, the United States is  inviting people in. And with that situation comes the three-fold  increase.   Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama  said at one time that 1,000 encounters a day at the southern border was  a bad number. We now have three times what was considered a bad number  under Barack Obama.   The next thing we are doing is, we are getting rid of the agreements  we had in Central America. President Trump maybe tweeted too much, but  he engaged in negotiations with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras so  that people stayed down there, rather than coming through Mexico to the  United States. He did it, to a certain extent, with the carrot and  stick of foreign aid which the United States had sent to those  countries. That policy has also changed. And with the change in that  policy people are streaming up through Central America.   Again, from year to year there has been a 61 percent increase in  unaccompanied children. People purport to say that they care about  children being separated from their parents. Well, when you have more  and more unaccompanied children showing up at the border, what do you  think that means? These children inevitably are going to wind up  separated from their parents, keeping families apart.   I should point out, by the way, another thing that I am told bothers  Central American countries. In this country in an effort to sometimes  keep a child with both parents, if the parents don't get along that  well, courts make an effort to keep both parents in the same region.   I am told that the Central American countries do not like the fact  that the United States sometimes will take children with even one  parent, leaving the other parent behind. I think it would be better if  we improved our relationship with those countries by trying to keep  children with both parents.   Other things that have been done is, sadly, we stopped the border  wall construction. When I was down at the border we learned, with  regard to the border wall, it takes four or five agents to man 2 miles  of the old wall, which was sometimes little more than minor fencing.  Now, with the new wall we need one Border Patrol agent for 2 miles, so  there is a substantial savings there, as well.   The catch and release policies are back, and with it a crisis is  coming. America has to apply more pressure or tell the Biden  administration, please, there is a reason why we have tripled the  number of people, the number of encounters our Border Patrol is having  today compared to this time last year. It is the policies that have  been implemented in the first month and a half of the Biden  administration.   Please, President Biden, go back to the old policies in which people  are held on the southern border and people can get a good hearing on  their asylum claims, rather than creating a system in which, as a  practical matter, people come here illegally and wind up just blending  into the background.   It is unfair to the people who are trying to access our country  legally that people are coming here illegally and skipping ahead of  them. Inevitably, as we take people without vetting them, we are  getting a given number of people taking advantage of our benefits, and  we are getting a number of people who are sneaking illegal drugs across  the southern border.   So, again, we have sent letters to President Biden, and I please ask  him to respond to these letters and let the American public know: What  is your plan to stop 100,000 people a month coming across the border  before that 100,000 becomes 200,000 or 300,000?    And it will become 200,000 or 300,000 because people around the world  are watching the President, and if the President continues to make it  clear he does not intend to enforce the border, people from all around  the world will be coming here.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
