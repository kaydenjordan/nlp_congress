 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the importance  of the reductions and reforms reflected in H.R. 1, which the conference  committee will work on today.   People in my district and across America await meaningful tax reform.  Most Americans paid too much in taxes. In fact, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics reported last year that Americans paid more money in taxes  than they spent on food and clothing. It is no wonder that nearly 60  percent of Americans believe our current Tax Code is unfair--it is.   America's Tax Code is currently chock full of special interest deals,  while families living paycheck to paycheck and job creators need lower  and simpler taxes now.   Throughout this process, my approach has been to evaluate this tax  legislation from one question: Will this improve the lives of the vast  majority of the people in my district?   That answer is, absolutely, yes.   The Tax Foundation projects that the House plan will save the average  family in Michigan about $2,200 a year. That is real money.   Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn. I look forward to  reviewing the conference report and finalizing the tax reduction  package that will provide relief to all Americans.                            ____________________
