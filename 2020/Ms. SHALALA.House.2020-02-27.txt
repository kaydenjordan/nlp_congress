 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 866 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 866         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2339) to       amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect       to the sale and marketing of tobacco products, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and       Commerce now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature       of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee       Print 116-51, modified by the amendment printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) 90 minutes of debate equally       divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.  [[Page H1234]]     Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 866, providing for the consideration  of H.R. 2339, Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco  Epidemic Act of 2020 under a closed rule.   The rule provides 90 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and  Means. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment to make technical  corrections and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill in this rule.   Mr. Speaker, as our Nation anticipates the probability of a pandemic,  here today in the people's House we have the opportunity to save almost  six million young lives that would be cut short by nicotine if we fail  to act.   I am not exaggerating. The CDC has predicted that if the children of  our country continue to use tobacco products at the current rate, 5.6  million children will have premature deaths.   This is a test of our courage. Let's look at the facts:   In 1997, 24.6 percent of all 12th graders reported daily use of  cigarettes, and 36.5 percent reported some use in the past 30 days.  Thanks to smart, tough policies and a national commitment to reduce  cigarette use by children, those numbers dropped to 3.6 percent and 7.6  percent by 2018.   Nearly 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking before the age of  18. If you do not start smoking as a child, it is very unlikely you  will smoke as an adult. This is not a secret. Public health officials  know this, and tobacco companies know this, too. They also know that  nicotine is a highly addictive substance.   This dramatic reduction in cigarette use by children put tobacco  companies in a bind. If children and teenagers have stopped using  cigarettes, and 90 percent of all adult smokers began smoking as  children, how can they maintain their pipeline of customers?   Their answer arrived in the form of a new technology, e-cigarettes  and vaping products. Companies knew that the pipeline of lifetime  smokers was dwindling, so they started marketing new vaping products to  young people through Instagram ads and influencers and other social  media platforms. They also handed out free vaping products at music  events and movies. They clearly targeted children, our children, and  their strategy worked.   Today, 26.7 percent of 12th graders vaped in the last month. This  rate has more than doubled in the last 2 years alone. In 2010, only 1.5  percent of 12th graders reported vaping.   We banned flavored cigarettes in 2009 because they appealed to  children and encouraged them to take up smoking. Tobacco companies  switched to flavored vape products and flavored cigarillos because  these products are not held to the same standard, even though they are  tobacco products and contain nicotine.   In 2018, 67 percent of high school students and 49 percent of middle  school students who used tobacco products in the past 30 days reported  using a flavored tobacco product.   So while kids can't buy cotton candy or banana smash cigarettes, they  can buy those flavors in vaping products or in cigarillos.   For the record, nicotine has health effects beyond addiction.  Nicotine exposure damages adolescent brain development, and brains are  not fully done developing until the mid-20s. Nicotine also contributes  to the hardening of arterial walls, which in turn, may lead to a  cardiac event.   It is time, Mr. Speaker, to ensure our children do not face a  lifetime of nicotine addiction. It is time to finally pass a bill that  protects their health, and that is what the Protecting American Lungs  and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act will do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and let me simply say we can never go too far when we are  protecting our children.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 5 NBC News article  titled ``Federal flavor ban goes into effect Thursday, but many  flavored vape products will still be available.''                       [From NBC News, Feb. 5, 2020]   Federal Flavor Ban Goes Into Effect Thursday, but Many Flavored Vape                      Products Will Still Be Available                             (By Erika Edwards)         A nationwide ban on many flavored e-cigarette products goes       into effect Thursday, but teenagers will still have access to       nicotine vapes, experts say.        The ban covers a number of kid-friendly flavorings, such as       mint and fruit, though menthol and tobacco flavorings will       remain legal. However, the ban only applies to specific types       of devices: cartridge or pre-filled pod devices, like the       ones made popular by Juul. All other devices will be left on       the market.        But limiting access to Juul, which stopped selling all non-      menthol and tobacco flavored pods in November, is unlikely to       have much of an effect on teens already addicted to nicotine.        ``Kids have moved on,'' Meredith Berkman, co-founder of       Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, or PAVE, told NBC News.        Teenagers know that teachers are now educated about how to       detect vaping in classrooms, she said. So they're getting       their nicotine fix in other ways, including products not       covered by the looming ban.        ``Kids are sucking on flavored nicotine pouches to get       through the day until they can get home to their device,''       Berkman said. The pouches are reminiscent of chewing tobacco,       but are advertised as being ``tobacco-free.''        Experts in teen addiction also said there's plenty of       evidence that teens now favor highly concentrated, refillable       nicotine vape products called Smok and Suorin Drops as well       as cheaper, disposable vape pods called Puff Bars--also to be       left on the market after Thursday.        ``I'm not very optimistic,'' Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a       professor at Stanford University who studies teen vaping,       said. ``We really do need to have enforcement of the law       across all tobacco products, regardless of these loopholes.''        ``The new policy does not solve the problem,'' Matthew       Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said,       adding parents need to keep their guard up and educate their       teenagers about the harms of nicotine addiction. ``Millions       of flavored products will remain available.''        Plans for restricting e-cigarette flavors on a federal       level first came up in September, when key national data on       teen vaping was released. It was revealed that from 2017 to       2019, rates of vaping had more than doubled among 8th, 10th       and 12th grade students.        New cases of those lung illnesses have declined       considerably since then. As of Jan. 21 (the latest data       available), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       reports that there have been 2,711 cases of people who've       been hospitalized with EVALI, or e-cigarette, or vaping,       product use-associated lung injury.        All 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., have reported EVALI       cases. Sixty people have died. Many others were left with       lasting lung damage.        Investigations suggested most cases were not associated       with vaping nicotine, but instead THC, the psychoactive       ingredient found in marijuana. Most of those THC vapes came       from drug dealers or friends. Vitamin E oil has been the       leading culprit in the lung damage, though other chemicals       and additives can't be ruled out, according to the CDC.        After Thursday, companies that make any vape products--      including those covered in the ban--will have to meet a May       12 deadline to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to       continue selling their products.        It will take one year for the FDA to review those       applications, during which time products can, and likely       will, remain on the market.        ``It's not a `forever' ban,'' Halpern-Felsher said. ``We       have a long way to go.''     Madam Speaker, many teens today have moved from using  flavored e-cigarettes to other flavored nicotine-laced products. That  includes things like flavored pouches, drops, and pods.   These products are still on the market today. The recent national  ban, which my distinguished colleague referred to, didn't take them off  the shelves. Something more is needed to make sure our children don't  go from one bad addictive product to the next.   The products might be different, but the impacts are the same. It is  a distinction without a difference, Madam Speaker.   That is why we have to pass this bill to keep life-threatening  products out of the hands of our children.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify some misunderstandings related  to the bill that I have just heard.   Some have suggested that H.R. 2339 allows certain cigars to be exempt  from the flavor prohibition.   I want to be very clear. Under this legislation, all tobacco products  are subject to the flavor prohibition, including cigars. In fact, the  text of the definition of cigar product explicitly states that these  cigars cannot contain a characterizing flavor. Under the legislation,  menthol is a characterizing flavor.   The only way to tackle the youth tobacco epidemic is to prohibit all  flavors in all products, which is exactly what H.R. 2339 does.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. DeSaulnier), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am a little confused. I may be a freshman, but I  know that my good friend, Mario Diaz-Balart, usually gives me a little  advanced notice before he presents something.   My Republican colleagues are promising that, if we defeat the  previous question, they will bring up a resolution to condemn the  terrible comments Senator Sanders made regarding the dictator Fidel  Castro.   But let me be clear: Defeating the previous question means that  Republicans can bring up any germane bill or amendment they want. The  key word here being ``germane.''   The resolution is not germane to the rule. That means, under the  House rules, rules that have been in place since the founding of this  institution, Republicans cannot bring to the floor the resolution they  are promising to because it is not germane to the rule.   The vote on the previous question is not a vote on the Diaz-Balart  resolution. It is a vote to end debate on the rule and proceed to  consideration of the legislation at hand, a bill to help prevent kids  from taking up smoking.   I am not disputing the merits of the resolution that my distinguished  Republican colleague is offering as the previous question. In fact, I  support this resolution; and to be very clear, I have requested to be  added as a cosponsor. I was the first Democratic Member of Congress to  speak out against these misguided, ill-informed, hurtful, and  unacceptable comments made by Senator Sanders from Vermont.                                time  1300    Over the last six decades, hundreds of thousands of Cubans have  risked their lives to escape the tyranny of the Castro regime, a regime  of fear, paranoia, and oppression that regularly abuses human rights in  order to stifle free thought and democracy in Cuba to this very day.   Yesterday, my good friend and south Florida colleague, Mr. Diaz- Balart, spoke about the horrors of Castro's Cuba. He so eloquently  explained: ``If anybody wants to know the devastation of socialism and  the tyranny that often is accompanied by socialism, I invite you to  come and speak to some of my constituents, including the thousands-- thousands--of former political prisoners.''   This is a joint invitation. Please, come to my south Florida  community and meet Mr. Diaz-Balart's constituents and meet my  constituents who will make it clear the Cuban regime and other similar  authoritarian regimes across Latin America are instruments of evil and  are not worthy of praise.   I would like to close again by quoting my good friend, Mr. Diaz- Balart: ``The Castro regime is a threat, not only to the national  security of the United States but also to all the democracies in this  hemisphere.''   He is absolutely correct, and I stand with him. I have always stood  with him and alongside our constituents in south  [[Page H1239]]  Florida to denounce the evil Cuban regime.   But today we are here to debate a bill that protects our children  from the dangers of tobacco and nicotine use. I hope my Republican  colleagues will join us in voting ``yes'' on the previous question and  ``yes'' on this rule, so we can move on to consideration of a bill to  reverse the youth tobacco epidemic.   The minority is claiming that they will do something that has been  against the Rules of the House since the very first Congress in 1789.  Clause 7 of rule XVI clearly states: ``No motion or proposition on a  subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under  color of amendment.''   It doesn't matter whether or not a Member would support my  colleague's resolution, which I have not had the opportunity to fully  read since it was introduced just minutes ago. It is completely  unrelated to the public health bill we are discussing right now and  could not actually be offered. The right way to do this would have been  to consult with all of us who have spoken out on this issue and build  support in the traditional way.   I have always joined my colleague, Mr. Diaz-Balart, to consult with  other Members and to join together to denounce tyranny wherever it may  exist.   Madam Speaker, I will close by saying that I have worked on tobacco  issues for years. When I was Secretary of Health and Human Services, we  knew we were facing a problem with youth usage of tobacco products,  particularly e-cigarettes. Thanks to smart and tough policies and  comprehensive outreach campaigns, we succeeded in dramatically reducing  youth cigarette use.   It was an extraordinary public-health achievement.   But here we are again with flavored e-cigarettes and vape products.  Tobacco companies will not give up, but we will not either.   Nicotine exposure during youth and young adulthood is particularly  dangerous. The children who are using flavored e-cigarettes and vaping  products are people who likely wouldn't have taken up smoking  otherwise. This is the public health crisis of the 21st century.   Children don't vote or contribute to our campaigns, but they are our  future. In fairy tales, children are saved by caring adults. We must  save them from disease and death. We are the caring adults of this  generation. We must save them from an industry that would trade their  lives for profit.   It is important to acknowledge that we have made a lot of bipartisan  progress on this public health issue. We have raised the age to buy  tobacco products to 21. But the administration has enacted a very  narrow flavor ban. It is too narrow. It only restricts flavors in  closed pod products like Juul. Further, disposable flavored e-cigarette  products like Puff Bar will still be available in flavors like mango,  banana ice, or lychee. There is clear evidence that teens are already  switching to use these products.   We need a comprehensive policy, and that is what this bill does. H.R.  2339 prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco products and bans the  marketing of e-cigarettes to people under 21 years of age. This is a  comprehensive solution. We need to curb this epidemic now. It is our  responsibility to protect our children's future.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 866         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution       (H. Res. 868) condemning the comments of Senator and       Democratic Socialist Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders       (I-VT), disregarding the history of systemic human rights       abuses, forced indoctrination, and authoritarian actions of       the literacy and education policies of the Communist Castro       dictatorship in Cuba. The first reading of the resolution       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the resolution are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the resolution and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After       general debate the resolution shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the resolution are waived. When the       committee rises and reports the resolution back to the House       with a recommendation that the resolution be adopted, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble and amendments thereto to adoption       without intervening motion. If the Committee of the Whole       rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       resolution, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the resolution.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 868.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
