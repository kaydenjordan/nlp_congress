 Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere  gratitude and appreciation that I have the opportunity to recognize  Matt Blackwell, former senior legislative assistant for South  Carolina's Second Congressional District. I will always appreciate Matt  for his years of service on behalf of the people of South Carolina.   A native of Aiken, South Carolina, and a USC graduate, Matt worked on  a wide variety of issues, including energy, tax, financial services,  transportation and infrastructure, and budget and appropriations.  Beginning as an intern in the office in 2013, it has been an honor to  work with such a dedicated public servant.   It is with mixed feelings, but great happiness, that the office bids  Matt farewell. He will be doing amazing work in his new role as  legislative director for Congressman Neal Dunn of Florida, a  distinguished graduate of Washington and Lee University of Lexington,  Virginia.   I know his parents, State Representative Bart and Paula Blackwell,  and family members join me in recognizing his achievements.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
