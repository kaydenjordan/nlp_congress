 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today beyond  frustrated by the crisis in veterans' healthcare in my community. Right  now, we have just four physicians and only two mental health clinicians  trying to provide care for over 27,000 veterans in San Joaquin County.   Veterans are waiting up to 90 days to even speak to a doctor or get  something as simple as a prescription refilled. That is the longest  wait time in the State of California and, frankly, it is a disgrace.  One of our veterans recently had to have his leg amputated because he  couldn't see a doctor to get his diabetes medication refilled. That is  unacceptable.   I know our local VA staff are doing everything they can, but right  now we need Secretary McDonough to step in and help. We need more  doctors, and we need them now. I have petitions right here in my hand  from veterans across our community begging for a response and an action  plan from the Secretary and the VA. We need answers.   These brave men and women fought and sacrificed for our country, the  last thing they need to do is fight for their healthcare right now. It  is time to fix this.                            ____________________
