 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The true question we face in this pandemic is not when we will get  out of this crisis, but how we will get out of this crisis. And the  keys to our economic freedom lie in this bill: $25 billion for testing  and monitoring; $75 billion for treatment, a national testing strategy;  finally, additional business help for our small businesses, including  $370 billion and $60 billion for our smallest, most vulnerable  businesses.   If we commit to continue to focus on how to survive this pandemic,  then, my fellow Americans, we will.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be removed as  a cosponsor from H.R. 6494.
