Founding pastor of the Lawndale Community Church, the Reverend Doctor  Wayne ``Coach'' Gordon passed the torch to the church's new lead  pastor, Pastor Jonathan Brooks, or as the congregation affectionately  knows him, Pastor J.   Pastor Gordon first heard the call to serve when he was a junior in  high school in Fort Dodge, IA. The call came so clear that he woke his  mother in the middle of the night to share his newfound purpose and let  her know that he was ready to forgo his studies and get started  immediately. His mother heard him out and arranged for him to meet with  the local pastor. That call set in motion a lifetime of service and  selfless commitment to helping others.   He listened to his mother and finished his studies. In 1971, he  graduated from Fort Dodge Senior High School. He attended Wheaton  College in Wheaton, IL, where he played football. From there, he  attended the Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, and he later would  go on to obtain his doctorate in ministry from Eastern Baptist  Theological Seminary.   By 1975, Pastor Gordon had moved to North Lawndale, a predominantly  Black community that at the time was ranked the 15th poorest  neighborhood in the United States. He took a job as a teacher and coach  at Farragut High School. Pastor Gordon, a White guy from Iowa teaching  and coaching in a predominantly Black community, immediately stood out.  His players and students called him ``Coach,'' a nickname that has  stuck with him to this day.   In 1977, Pastor Gordon would marry the woman of his dreams, his  lovely wife Anne. On their first night together in North Lawndale,  their home was broken into. Unfortunately, this would not be the only  time. Many would question what the couple was thinking. Why would they  want to continue to live in such a dangerous neighborhood?   But as one of his mentors, the late-Reverend Tom Skinner would say,  Pastor Gordon and Anne ``continued to continue.'' They refused to live  amongst their neighbors in fear. When others saw a dangerous  neighborhood stricken by poverty, violence, and drug addiction, Pastor  Gordon and Anne saw a community desperate for opportunity. Many turned  their back on North Lawndale, but Pastor Gordon and Anne would not do  the same. They heeded their call to help and made the conscious choice  to live where they served--and they wasted no time getting to work.   They set up a Bible study through the Fellowship of Christian  Athletes. The Farragut High students enjoyed it so much that they  talked Pastor Gordon and Anne into starting their very own church.  While it took some convincing, Pastor Gordon agreed, and the Lawndale  Christian Community Church began its mission of building a better North  Lawndale.   He assembled the congregation before a blackboard and asked what were  the top issues facing the community. No.1 was a safe place for  residents to do their laundry, since the local laundromats were often  sites of violence. The church made room in its basement using donated  equipment to give residents a safe place to do their laundry.   The second issue on the congregation's list was access to quality,  affordable health services in the area. Through several grants from  charitable organizations in Chicago, countless volunteer hours, and  faith, in September 1984, they were able to transform a run-down  Cadillac dealership into the Lawndale Christian Health Center. This  clinic, which started with a staff of just five, has now grown to have  more than 100 medical providers across six locations, transforming  access to healthcare in the area.   Apart from providing services through the church, Pastor Gordon and  other community leaders knew for the Lawndale area to thrive, they  would need a strong economic base capable of attracting businesses,  employing residents, providing goods and services, and supporting the  community. With that goal in mind, Lawndale Community Church began  reaching out to businesses encouraging them to set up shop in the  neighborhood.   Their outreach efforts would pay off. In 1995, the iconic Lou  Malnati's Pizzeria opened a branch of its restaurant in North Lawndale.  Lawndale Community Church owned the property in which the restaurant  operated, and the church converted the four apartments above the  pizzeria into affordable housing units for families. Aside from proving  that North Lawndale could sustain mainstream businesses, Lou Malnati's  also committed to staffing the restaurant with local employees and  donating its profits to the community. And more than 25 years later,  Lou Malnati's remains open for business in North Lawndale.   They did not stop there. To promote homeownership and build wealth,  they opened the Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, which  purchased and rehabilitated abandoned homes and then sold them to  members of the community at a discount. To support health and wellness  in the community, they opened the 60,000-square-foot Lawndale Christian  Health and Fitness Center. And to expand access to legal services,  education, social services, employment, and training opportunities to  young people, they opened the Lawndale Christian Legal Center.   These successful community development efforts have come to be known  as the Lawndale Miracle--and it has laid the foundation for future  investment in North Lawndale and served as a model for community  development efforts in other disadvantaged communities.   But while these achievements may be divine, they are far from  unexplainable. They are a testament to the leadership of Pastor Gordon  and his congregation. They have renovated apartments, built fitness  centers, mentored students, established medical clinics, started  businesses, and helped breathe a new energetic life into the entire  community.   Through it all, Pastor Gordon has remained a dedicated husband to  Anne; a loving father to their three children: Angela, Andrew, and  Austin; father-in-law to Nate and Stacy; and grandfather to Mack,  Brooke, and Langston. I have had the pleasure of knowing Pastor Gordon  and Anne, and I have been fortunate to witness much of the progress  they have helped make. Pastor Gordon is no ordinary preacher. His work  does not end with his sermon. He has used his faith to power a lifetime  of service to help his neighbors and community. While Pastor Gordon may  have passed his torch, I am certain the work of the Lawndale Community  Church is not finished.   Loretta and I thank Pastor Gordon and Anne for their service to the  community, and we wish Pastor J. the best of luck in carrying on the  legacy of the Lawndale Community Church.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
