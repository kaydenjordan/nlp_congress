 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Jazz and  Friends National Day of Readings.   And I continue: ``Mom said that being Jazz would make me different  from the other kids at school, but that being different is okay. What's  important, she said, is that I'm happy with who I am.   ``Being Jazz caused some other people to be confused too, like the  teachers at school.   ``At the beginning of the year they wanted me to use the boys'  bathroom, and play on the boys' team in gym class, but that didn't feel  normal to me at all.   ``I was so happy when the teachers changed their minds. . . . ''   ``Even today, there are kids who tease me, or call me by a boy name,  or ignore me altogether. This makes me feel crummy.   ``Then I remember that the kids who get to know me usually want to be  my friend. They say I am one of the nicest girls at school.   ``I don't mind being different. Different is special. I think what  matters most is what a person is like on the inside.   ``And inside, I am happy. I am having fun. I am proud.   ``I am Jazz.''                            ____________________
