 Mr. Speaker, yesterday we were given the President's budget,  which outlines the President's so-called priorities.   Well, his priorities were pretty clear: Continue to expand government  at the expense of the American people. Expand government, a government  that is at odds with the freedom, well-being, and prosperity of the  American people every single day.   The simple truth is, as my friends in the House Freedom Caucus and a  large number of my other colleagues in the Republican Conference have  been articulating, we need to shrink Washington so that we can grow  America.   We cannot sustain and grow out of the $32 trillion of debt and the  $20 trillion of debt that the Congressional Budget Office just outlined  that we are going to add over the next decade. We will not, as a  country, survive through that if we do not get economic growth to the  3, 3\1/2\, and 4 percent levels that we saw under President Reagan,  President Clinton, and in previous years. You are not going to get  economic growth if you don't get the Federal Government off the backs  of the American people and stop empowering them to target Americans, to  undermine American freedoms.   Biden's budget would increase taxes and implement price controls to  the tune of $3 trillion. That is the President's plan.   What does the media do?   They run around and go: Oh, he is reducing the deficit. He is  reducing the debt.   Yet, by his own measures, he would be increasing the debt another $17  trillion over the next decade.   The American people look to this body and this town with utter  amazement at how stupid we could possibly be. If you set out and tried  to be more incompetent and more stupid than the people that have been  running this town for as long as I can remember, I am not sure how you  can do it.   Seriously. That would be a great exercise. Could anybody, if you put  together 435 people here, 100 people on the other side, Presidents and  bureaucrats, swapped out over the last, say, three decades, could it be  any worse?   William F. Buckley said he would rather be governed by the first 435  people out of the phone book than the 435 people we send here. Is he  wrong?   Seriously, it would be a great inquiry for us to consider.   We are $32 trillion in debt. Our borders are wide open. We have got  American citizens unable to carry out their livelihoods, men and women  in uniform who are being denied promotions and the ability to do their  job in the Defense Department. We have got kids shut out from their  schools, forced into the corners wearing masks, mental health issues,  and they are set back generations in terms of their academic  capability.   That is the best we have got? That is the best we can do?   We reject that. We believe in America. We believe in Americans. We do  not believe that investing in Washington, investing in the Federal  bureaucracy is good for the American people. We believe the opposite.   The President wants to tax and regulate $3 trillion to save  increasing the debt $3 trillion over the next decade, down to $17  trillion. Whoo, boy, that will do it.   We propose an immediate savings of $3 trillion right now by cutting  back  [[Page H1265]]  the woke weaponized Federal bureaucracy that is undermining the freedom  of the American people so that we can make them more free and  prosperous so that they can grow this economy so we can shrink the  deficit, reduce debt, and reclaim the inheritance of being an American  for our kids and grandkids.   Think about what Biden's budget would do. It would spend a total of  $6.8 trillion next year, $500 billion more than this year, $2 billion  for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to increase  regulation of the firearms industry. I have got thousands of Texans  that I represent who are facing being made a felon because a bureaucrat  at ATF decided what precisely a pistol brace might mean for how their  gun is regulated.                                time  1100    Think about that. Just some guy some, some gal sitting in central  Texas bought a weapon under the law, and now a bureaucrat says you have  got to do this, register this, or you are a felon.   Now, I think the Court will strike that down as unconstitutional, but  why would this body, why would any Republican fund the bureaucracy that  is going to make a felon out of the law-abiding citizen back home?   To my Republican colleagues: Don't do that.   How about $3.9 billion for the Department of Homeland Security's  climate resilience programs? Think about that. $3.9 billion for the  Department of Homeland Security, which, by the way, refuses to secure  the homeland, allows 72,000 Americans to die from fentanyl poisoning,  allows cartels to get empowered and slaughter Americans in the streets  of Matamoros in northern Mexico without a peep from this  administration. Nothing. Let's give that department $3.9 billion for  climate resilience programs. Does anybody wonder why the American  people look at us and say what in the hell are you doing?   $2 billion increase for the EPA to target American energy. Now, I  want to remind people, I want to remind all the kids out there watching  this thinking, oh, my God, but the world is going to end, we are going  die, climate change, we are going to get extinguished. Oh, really? Oh,  really?   Why is it that my Democratic colleagues who believe that the  production of CO2 is going to be the end to humanity and the  Earth as we know it will not remotely consider nuclear power, which  produces not an ounce of CO2, but they won't consider it?  Why? Because it is a religion. It is climate fetishism. It is about  government control. It is about being able to target the oil and gas  industry to undermine the well-being of the American people by  empowering bureaucrats so they can feel good about themselves while  China continues to pump out more CO2 than any other country,  ratcheting it up week by week. There are 1,100 coal-fired plants in  China. They build two a week while we sit around and play tiddlywinks  with solar panels and windmills, leaving our grid in Texas unreliable,  now almost 50 percent wind and solar. We have to think, wait, what  happens on a windless, cloudy day? I don't know. How do you want to  power up your schools or your hospitals or your homes or your  businesses? Could it be that you have to rely on coal or gas or nuclear  power? Of course, you do. Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle--not here, of course; of course, with all due respect neither are  my colleagues on this side of the aisle with the exception of the  Speaker. This is just how we do things in Washington. This is debate.   A $2 billion funding increase for the Internal Revenue Service is in  the President's budget. Now, I want every American to understand that.  They just passed a bill last summer supposedly called the Inflation  Reduction Act that gives the IRS another $80 billion to expand. So that  is what the American people want: More IRS agents to go target more  Americans to raise at most by the CBO's own estimate 100 or $200  billion over 10 years? So you're going to spend $80 billion to go  target American citizens to bring in more money. By the way, the IRS  targets poor people and minorities three to five times more than other  Americans. So you're going to go hire more bureaucrats, you got $80  billion, and what does Biden do? Oh, that is not enough. $2 billion  more for the IRS. Genius.   $100 million to the Department of Education in grant funding for  communities to promote racial and socioeconomic diversity in their  schools.   $62 million for the DOJ to exploit the FACE Act to target pro-life  Americans. I could go on and on about the amount of money given to  agency after agency, bureaucrat after bureaucrat to target the American  people. The FBI targeted my now-friend Scott Smith in Loudoun County,  whose daughter was assaulted in a school. He dared to go to the school  board. He got challenged by law enforcement, and the DOJ was going to  be putting him on a list as a domestic terrorist because the National  School Boards Association was colluding with the White House to do so.  Is that what we want to fund: a Department of Justice that would put a  dad on a list as a domestic terrorist because he went to his school  board to try to defend his daughter who was assaulted in a bathroom?   That is what this administration wants to prioritize: Funding a woke,  weaponized bureaucracy that is undermining freedom. They want to fund  the FBI that went after Mark Houck in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for  daring to defend his son when they were outside of an abortion clinic  and somebody was challenging his son when they were exercising their  First Amendment rights, and he defended him without anything  significant happening. They were not prosecuted by State law. The feds  went in, had a SWAT team at 7 in the morning on a Sunday--the whole  family--went into their house threatening Mark Houck.   Is that what we want to fund?   Is that what we want to use the power of government for?   How about the $16,000--I know it is just $16,000; I realize that is  chicken feed in this establishment--in State Department funding for a  pro-prostitution LGBTQ group in Colombia. Is that how we want our tax  dollars spent? That is just $16,000. It doesn't mean anything, does it?  It does.   $1.9 million in Department of Education funding for an Illinois  nonprofit that trains teachers to center equity in the classroom. We  need our kids to know math, how to read, science, how to lead the  world, how to beat China, and we got $1.9 million to center equity,  whatever that hell that means.   $2 million for the State Department's Race, Ethnicity, and Social  Inclusion Unit. As if the State Department is out doing wonderful  things in the first place these days.   How about $158 million in economic law enforcement and military  support for Mexico? Pause. Yes, you just heard that correctly. We, the  taxpayers, are giving $158 million to Mexico for economic law  enforcement and military support while we are getting flooded at our  border, cartels are absolutely running amuck and owning the state of  Mexico as a narco-terror state, running fentanyl into America, and  killing Americans in Mexico. Congratulations, American people, you  bought with $158 million a narco-terrorist state that is undermining  our freedom and liberty killing Americans, endangering migrants, and  endangering Texas. Congratulations, Americans.    $34 million for the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security,  Alejandro Mayorkas. $34 million for Alejandro Mayorkas to screw up  America. Congratulations to the American people on how your tax dollars  are being spent.   $1.7 billion, for the ATF that I described earlier that will make  owners of the 10 to 40 million pistol braces in the United States  felons. $6.3 billion for Anthony Fauci's NIAID, which was weaponized to  completely lock down the United States and force vaccines on millions  of Americans, massively increasing the profit of pharmaceutical  companies--Pfizer and Moderna--making like $100 billion under  government mandates for vaccines--government mandates for vaccines with  liability protection for the companies for a vaccine that even the  morons in the departments over at CDC, NIH, FDA are now at least  acknowledging don't really do much for transmission; but, oh, yes,  let's give them $6.3 billion.   $128 million for the office of the CDC Director who actively mislead  Americans about COVID vaccine efficacy while CDC and Big Tech colluded  to suppress vaccine information, which we know to be true. We saw  testimony yesterday.  [[Page H1266]]    Our own colleague,   Thomas Massie, had his own social media posts  being edited and targeted in a disinformation campaign because anyone  who dared question the wisdom of Anthony Fauci, anyone who dared  question the government mandate that you stick a needle in your arm  because they say so because they politicized a virus and a vaccine, you  are going to be set aside. There was going to be disinformation on  social media, Twitter, in collusion with all of those guys. They were  shutting down free speech.   We should be horrified that the United States of America with a First  Amendment to the Constitution, which is supposed to protect free  speech, but not for   Thomas Massie as a Member of Congress--yes, for  him, too--but for every American, every American regardless of the  ``truth'' of what you are saying, the government doesn't decide what  the truth is. That is the whole point of free speech.   Yet, we are funding the very tyrants in the executive branch shutting  down free speech, mandating vaccines, using the power of government to  go after people and shut down their livelihoods, undermine freedom,  undermine economic activity, and put us $32 trillion in debt so our  kids and grandkids are going to inherit a bankrupt, tyrannical America.   We should change that. We should reject that. The great news is  Americans across this country are rejecting it. They are saying no.  They do want to live free. They don't want a government that is  shutting down their ability to live free or their kids and their  grandkids. They do want to send their kids to schools that teach them  that America is great and good and teach them the tools they need to  succeed in life, rather than teach them that they should be ashamed of  their country or be a victim.   The American people under COVID woke up. More parents are  homeschooling their kids. More parents are looking for private school.  More States are adopting school choice. More businesses are rejecting  the vaccine mandates. More individuals are saying no to those mandates.   God bless the young man who is in the United States Navy who rejected  the vaccine mandate, and because of our bill that we finally jammed  through in December as Republicans isn't being kicked out of the  military, but he is still being harassed, he is still being denied the  commanding officer job he always wanted. He is still being denied the  ability to advance. They are going after him to pay the $75,000 of  previous student loans. That must end.   $122 million for the World Health Organization, which pushed  lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and colluded with the Chinese Communist  Party to cover up its role in COVID's origin, and now with this  administration wants to control our healthcare and control how we are  going to deal with vaccines in the future. Why would any Republican  vote to fund the World Health Organization today? Why? We should not.  We should reject that. We are Americans. We decide how we are going to  live.   $234 million for the EPA's clean water program so-called under waters  of the United States, WOTUS, that put a 78-year-old veteran in jail for  violating the waters of the United States by digging ditches on his  land.                                time  1115    That is your government at work, ladies and gentlemen, $456 million  for EPA ``clean air programs.''   Everybody wants clean air. I don't know anybody who doesn't want  clean air. I don't know any State regulators who don't want clean air.   What we don't want is that to be used as an excuse to carry out the  new methane tax, drive up gas prices via the ethanol mandate, and  destroy reliable coal and natural gas power plants via regulation,  which is precisely what it is going to do.   Yet, we are all going to just sit by as Republicans and go, well,  shrug. I guess that is just what we do. We have to increase government.   All these kids are running around going, ``Well, we have climate  change. What are we going to do?'' How about we embrace clean-burning  American natural gas, develop more nuclear power, and recognize that  China and India are the ones that are vastly growing and producing  CO2 by developing more coal-fired plants while we sit around  and play games, as I said earlier, with wind and solar, leaving us with  unreliable grids and living on unicorn energy policies.   Mr. Speaker, $108 million in woke EPA environmental justice funding  that will funnel through EPA's new Office of Environmental Justice and  External Civil Rights, $108 million of your taxpayer money for  environmental justice when we are $32 trillion in debt, you literally  can't make up how stupid we are. Literally, you just can't. It is,  like, no, no, no.   I mean, imagine the Founding Fathers going: Wait a minute. Hold on.  In 2023, we are going to be $32 trillion in debt. We are not going to  actually secure our borders as a sovereign Nation, allowing them to be  wide open. We are going to submit to the authority of international  organizations to tell us what to do and fund those international  organizations to tell us what to do. We are going to fund massive  bureaucracies to create things like the so-called environmental justice  department with $108 million when we are spending a trillion and a half  dollars more every year than we take in.   I mean, that is just, like, the tip of the iceberg. How stupid can a  people be? The American people aren't stupid. That is why they look at  Congress with utter disdain.   We are stupid unless we change, and that is my request of my  colleagues on this side of the aisle, that we demand change.   When there is a debt ceiling fight this summer, when the President  wants to play chicken and Russian roulette with the debt ceiling  increase to borrow more money to raise our credit card limit, we should  demand change. We should demand actual change. We should demand  immediate change.   When we say return spending for the bureaucratic state to pre-COVID  2019 levels, and when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and  the President say you can't do that, you remind them about the $122  million for the World Health Organization or the $108 million for the  ``environmental justice programs,'' or the $15 million for the United  Nations bodies that develop the Paris Agreement--just that alone.   How about $7 million of Department of the Interior funding for the  monarch butterfly, $20 million in earmarks dedicated to sidewalks--$20  million dedicated in Federal funding for sidewalks.   Boy, there is a real Federal nexus there, huh? Article I, section 8,  thou shalt fund sidewalks. It is asinine.   Yet, that is what we do. It is like breathing for Members of  Congress. Just keep funding crap because, well, I don't know. I have a  dinner to go to, and I can't bother to peel back the appropriations  bills or the big omnibus bill that is sent over by a bunch of Senators  who are running to their steak dinners and can't even bother to do the  appropriations bills in the first place.   This includes 18 Republicans, by the way, who voted for a $1.7  trillion omnibus spending bill, which I will constantly remind all 18  of them and all Americans of those 18 who voted for a massive $1.7  trillion omnibus spending bill that denied us the ability to secure the  border and expanded the size and scope of the Federal Government.   It is not just a singular, one-party problem, ladies and gentlemen.  This body needs a little religion, actual religion, and a little bit of  fiscal sanity religion.   We can change that. We can shrink Washington massively. Right now, in  year one, we can shrink Washington so that we can get it out of the way  and grow our country back to prosperity.   That is step one in reclaiming our American birthright: shrink  Washington, grow America.   We can save more than $3 trillion over the next decade if we cut the  funding of the bureaucracy back to pre-COVID levels and cap future  growth; rescind $91 billion of unobligated COVID money just sitting  over there right now waiting for a bureaucrat to find something to  spend it on; and end the unfair, unlawful $400 billion student loan  bailout that the President promised that is going to be deficit  spending this year.   Just boom, $400 billion of 2023 deficit spending. For what? Paying  off the loan of some kid who went to college, got a sociology degree,  and is hanging out in his parents' basement, tweeting and sitting on  Instagram, and trying to find a job. Oh, no. We have to pay off  [[Page H1267]]  that kid's loan, but the plumber who didn't take out that loan to go to  some liberal arts college filled with a bunch of White elite liberals  patting themselves on the back for how compassionate they are for Brown  people--that is what they do. Let's pay off their loans, but let's make  the plumber eat it. That is crazy, absolutely crazy.   We reward irresponsibility instead of actually telling the  hardworking American who does it all the right way that they are the  one who gets rewarded.   Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to increase the debt  to borrow to fund a $400 billion student loan bailout for rich,  liberal, White elitists, for the most part, as a statistical matter,  while we are leaving out hardworking Americans who didn't take out  those loans like my wife, the daughter of a single mom who took two  jobs, worked hard, and sent her to a State university, who worked to  pay off her loans.    She is still paying them. Mr. Speaker, 20 years since we graduated  from law school, my wife is still paying off the remaining vestiges of  her law school student loans after paying her way and getting loans to  go to Texas A&M and the University of Texas School of Law, doing the  right thing, driving a 2000 Corolla with no options for, like, a  decade.   That is what you do if you are responsible. That is how you are  supposed to live. We can save that money right now and do more good for  the American people than funding and paying off these student loans.   We can reclaim the $80 billion of Internal Revenue Service money that  is sitting in a pot over there right now. We can reform welfare  programs to get people back to work, protecting Social Security  retirement and Medicare benefits in the process.   We can grow America by expanding liberty and promoting economic  growth, forcing policy changes to make the government do its job, curb  regulatory power by enacting the REIN IN Act to make Congress decide if  the regulations by bureaucrats should be enacted if they have a major  economic impact.   These are all things we can do right now and save up to $3 trillion  over 10 years as a first step to shrinking Washington and growing  America. That is our plan. The President's plan is to expand Washington  and undermine America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his  leadership. We joined together with our colleagues at the House Freedom  Caucus this morning to announce what we believe is, I would say, the  bare minimum, if you will, sort of the baseline for resetting the table  on how we deal with spending and, importantly, empowering the American  people by shrinking Washington and growing America because we trust the  people to do it, not government.   This is an age-old debate, but this is something where leviathan,  this great beast, this thing we call the Federal Government, is growing  and expanding in power in ways that concern every American.                                time  1130    Just yesterday, in the House Judiciary Committee, there were  conversations about the power of the Federal Government being used to  chill speech, to target American citizens, to shut down their First  Amendment rights.   Now think about it. Is there anything more concerning than the power  of the government being used to chill the fundamental rights given to  us by our Creator, as reflected in the Bill of Rights, than what we are  seeing right now?   The FTC is going after, right now, targeting, they want to know-- wait--who is involved with all of this. They are actually targeting  journalists, targeting private citizens.   Is that what the power of the government is supposed to be used for,  I would ask the gentleman from Virginia.    I asked earlier, if you set out over the last 2 or 3  decades, to do  [[Page H1268]]  a worse job than the leadership of this country, in this Chamber, the  Senate, the bureaucracy, and the White House, could you imagine doing a  worse job than over the last 3 decades?   I mean, in truth, the amount of debt that has been accumulated,  right--in 2003, when I was a baby staffer for a Senator on the other  side of this building, the national debt was about $6 trillion.    Right. It is now $26 trillion more than that, and the  President is patting himself on the back for saying, well, we are not  going to increase the debt by $20 trillion; we are only going to  increase it by $17 trillion over the next decade by taxing and  regulating the American people into oblivion.   I would just ask the gentleman a last question here, and then we are  going to--in a couple of minutes I want to yield to my friend from West  Virginia.   Would it surprise the gentleman that we are spending $158 million in  economic, law enforcement, and military support for Mexico--so, again,  the American people, you and I, we are funding to the tune of $158  million, Mexico's law enforcement and military, while it is becoming a  narco-terrorist state; cartels are literally killing American citizens  in Mexico; infiltrating our country, causing 72,000 dead Americans from  fentanyl poisoning? This is the thing the American people don't  understand. Does the gentleman agree?    That is correct. If the gentleman doesn't mind, I am going  to end here with a few minutes on the border and then yield to the  gentleman from West Virginia. I thank my friend from Virginia for  coming down.   On that point, what we are funding, 4\1/2\ million encounters of  illegal aliens at the southern border since the beginning of the Biden  administration, with 7,000, 8,000 migrants crossing a day, there are  1.3 million got-aways, and nearly 1.7 million illegal aliens released  into the United States. That means we have released more into our  communities than the population of at least 11 individual States.   Under this administration, there have been surges of known or  suspected terrorists at the southwest border. There were zero in fiscal  year 2019, 3 in fiscal year 2020, 15 in fiscal year 2021, 98 in fiscal  year 2022, and 53 so far after 1 quarter in fiscal year 2023, these are  individuals that are affiliated with known or suspected terrorists at  the southwest border.   Last summer, 53 migrants died in a tractor trailer in San Antonio,  which I represent, cooked in the Texas heat; and that is somehow  compassion?   Mr. Speaker, 880 migrants have died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border  in fiscal year 2022, and that does not count the thousands that have  died across south Texas and other places and ranches; doesn't count the  little girls sitting in stash houses, as we speak, getting sold into  the sex trafficking trade, as Mayorkas and Biden fiddle, while our  Nation's borders are burning.    Just last week, four Americans traveling to Mexico, one of them a  mother of six, they were attacked by cartels in broad daylight. Two are  dead. Two are getting care; and we give $158 million to Mexico for law  enforcement and military.   This is why, today, I am re-introducing my legislation to designate  these drug cartels as the terrorist organization that they are, so that  any individual associated with them, that provides material support to  a designated FTO would be sanctioned and could be pursued, lawfully.   Materials include, but are not limited to providing weapons, safe  houses, lethal substances. Representatives and members of a designated  FTO would be subject to removal. Financial institutions could be  targeted. But the main point is to make clear that these dangerous  cartels are the equivalent of ISIS and al-Qaida, right off our border,  killing Americans, killing Mexicans, turning Mexico into narco- terrorist states; giving China an avenue to get to the United States to  pump fentanyl into our communities, and this administration is doing  nothing.   This Congress must not continue to fund a government that is at war  with the American people, funding a woke weaponized Federal Government  that is undermining our freedom, undermining our prosperity,  undermining our liberty.   It is our duty, as Republicans and all Members of Congress, to use  the power of the purse to defund the executive branch that is  tyrannically at odds with the well-being of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Mooney), my good friend. I appreciate his great service to our country,  and I look forward to hearing from him.                        Returning to the Gold Standard     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia and  appreciate his strong passion in representing the great people of West  Virginia. He is a good friend, and I am glad that he could join us here  today.   Earlier, I was talking about the need for this country to reclaim  economic growth in order to dig ourselves out of the hole that this  absurd institution and lack of leadership from Washington, D.C., has  created for the American people in the form of $32 trillion of debt and  ridiculously stagnant economic growth.   After decades of being able to achieve growth in the 3 and 4 percent  range, we are now sitting in the doldrums of 1-percent-type economic  growth. That might even be rather robust in the era of Joe Biden.   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) to expand  upon this important point.                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I would inquire as to how much time we have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know if I will use every bit of that. I  appreciate the point that the gentleman from North Carolina just made,  because it is critically important and it merits at least one final  repetition, that this great country racked up the level of debt that we  currently have today relative to the size of its economy in 1946. But  why was that? To rid the world of fascism, to confront our enemies, to  defeat those enemies, and to protect this great country.   Then we embarked for 50 years and grew ourselves to the point to be  able to balance the budget by 2000, with strong economic growth. It  took that much time.   Here we sit today in 2023 with $32 trillion of debt, sitting, at the  President's own admission, at 60 basis points of economic growth this  year. He wants his grand solution to be, oh, we will just rack up $17  trillion more debt in the next decade, because I am going to save $3  trillion by taxing the American people and regulating the American  people.   It doesn't work. This is President Biden's actual form of voodoo  economics. He is going to level this country, layer mountains more debt  on our kids and grandkids, all while funding the very things that are  undermining our ability to have economic growth, prosperity, and  freedom.   As I noted before, the millions of dollars going to the EPA to turn  an American citizen into a felon and put him into jail because he had a  pond on his ranch, the millions of dollars in the name of clean air  that are going to methane regulations to drive the price of gas and the  price of energy up for the average American.   Every single American should demand of his or her Representative in  this body that we stand up to a tyrannical executive branch  overstepping its bounds, undermining our freedom, and undermining  economic growth.   Every Member of this body should look to cut spending this year of  the Federal bureaucracy, return it to pre-COVID levels as a baseline,  save $3 trillion by getting government out of the way, restore economic  growth and hope and opportunity for our kids and grandkids, stop  funding the very things that are undermining our well-being, secure our  country, secure our border, have a sparingly used but lethal, nonwoke  military that will kill people and destroy things when they need to,  and restore the greatness of this country by shrinking Washington and  growing America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
