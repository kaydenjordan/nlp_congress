 Mr. President, today I recognize Robert Kraft of  Massachusetts, the 2019 Genesis prize laureate. Recognized as the  ``Jewish Nobel'' prize, organizers grant the award each year to an  extraordinary person recognized for their outstanding professional  achievement and making a significant contribution to improving the  world and inspiring young Jews through their dedication to social  justice and philanthropy. I believe the Genesis prize committee made an  excellent choice in selecting Mr. Kraft.   While known to most as the owner of the New England Patriots, Mr.  Kraft, along with his late wife Myra, has for decades spoke out and  donated generously to organizations combating prejudices, including  anti-Semitism. Most recently, Mr. Kraft announced that all proceeds of  the match between his Major League Soccer team, the New England  Revolution, and the Chelsea Football Club will benefit initiatives to  combat the disturbing trend of rising anti-Semitism and hate crimes in  the United States and around the world. Upon receiving the Genesis  prize, Mr. Kraft announced he would donate the $1 million monetary  award to efforts to combat anti-Semitism.   Mr. Kraft is a true ``patriot'' in all senses of the word. The  Commonwealth, country, and global community owe much gratitude to Mr.  Kraft. I congratulate my dear friend Robert Kraft on his lifelong  efforts to further the Jewish value of tikkun olam, to heal the  world.                            ____________________
