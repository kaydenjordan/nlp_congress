 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I will keep my comments brief because this bipartisan,  commonsense bill is simple.   H.R. 736 would make all agency reports to Congress, and releasable  under FOIA, available on one website at no cost to the American public.   Each year, Federal agencies submit thousands of reports to Congress  that contain a wealth of information that enables the public to better  understand how Federal agencies are, or are not, fulfilling their  respective missions, from ensuring the safety of our drugs and food  supply to protecting the environment and monitoring the soundness of  our financial institutions.   Unfortunately, many, if not most, of these reports simply sit  collecting dust in the committees they are delivered to or are posted  in numerous and confusing places on dozens of agency websites, rarely  to be seen or thought of again.   In fact, the only comprehensive list of congressionally mandated  reports is printed in paper format each year by the Clerk of the House  and is available only by request, provided that one knows it exists.   My bill would, for the first time, create a single website where the  public and Members of Congress can easily search, sort, and download  all congressionally mandated reports from agencies.   Ultimately, this will help us conduct better research and oversight  of these agencies and will allow the public to learn about what  agencies are doing with their hard-earned tax dollars.   This bill is meant to be a window into the workings of government to  ensure that the government's business is done transparently and is  accountable to the people it serves.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward,  commonsense bill and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 736.
