 Mr. President, I rise in objection to this bill because  it is an outrageous attack on life-affirming pregnancy resource  centers. As a pro-life obstetrician, I have had the pleasure and honor  of delivering over 5,000 babies, and I can attest to the lifesaving,  critical, and comprehensive care and resources these centers provide  moms in need.   These pro-life charities not only help women in poverty choose life  instead of abortion, but they also help women after babies are born.  They also provide clothing and diapers and housing assistance and  nutrition and sometimes just putting an arm around their shoulders and  helping them get to their next appointment.   This legislation seeks to shut them down all around the country on  the grounds that they purportedly spread disinformation about abortion.   Under this bill, charities could be fined $100,000 or 50 percent of  the revenues earned by the ultimate parent entity of the charity for  violating the act's prohibition on disinformation related to abortion.   Now, I ask you, who would determine what counts as prohibited  disinformation? There is no doubt it would be bureaucrats with a pro- abortion agenda. Is this not an infringement on our First Amendment  rights?   This bill would turn the FTC into a national abortion disinformation  board with an agenda of suppressing speech and spreading pro-abortion  propaganda.   Nationally, pro-life pregnancy resource centers outnumber abortion  facilities three to one, and that is a good thing--that is a great  thing--and in some States by as many as 11 to 1. Knowing that many  women choose abortion because they feel pressured that they have no  other option, the pro-life movement has placed tremendous resources  into these centers, which exist to offer alternatives to abortion,  usually at no cost.   But right now in America, pregnancy resource centers are the ones in  need of protection as zealous, pro-abortion terrorists have spent the  past 2 months firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy centers  all across the Nation.   These criminals, these terrorists do so not in the name of abortion  access  [[Page S4022]]  but in retribution for daring to defy the ruling abortion regime and  for daring to stand on the side of good in this spiritual battle.   There have been more than 60 pregnancy resource centers and offices  that pro-life groups have attacked and vandalized since the draft  Supreme Court opinion was leaked in May.   Pro-abortion domestic terrorists have claimed responsibility for  these crimes.   Congress should be taking up the legislation instead to affirm, grow,  and protect pregnancy resource centers and praise citizens for their  great work, for volunteering to help and serve their community.   And Attorney General Merrick Garland should abide by his oath of  office and prosecute the law. Therefore, I object.    To answer my colleague, the fraud and deception is  occurring in the abortion clinics. I could tell you story after story  of patients crying in my office who went to Planned Parenthood for a  pregnancy test and were scheduled for an abortion, coming to my office  wondering, Do I have to do this abortion? That is where the fraud and  deception is occurring, that these women aren't being told about the  potential complications of these abortion procedures.   They are not being told that these abortion pills are going to cause  pain and cramping and bleeding, that they could end up in the emergency  room as well. They are not told about the complications from the  abortion procedures. That is where the fraud and deception is present.   You talk about this as reproductive services. You are afraid to say  the word ``abortion'' in these clinics. That is the fraud and  deception. This isn't reproductive services. These are abortions. This  is taking the life of the unborn.    Mr. President, we could never support any part of this  legislation. I think the deception and fraud is occurring on the part  of abortion clinics. This is a threat to our First Amendment rights,  and like I said in my opening remarks, this is just simply  unacceptable.   And that is why we continue to object.    Mr. President, I think this is not the place to try to  rewrite legislation. Of course, I am against all fraud. I think all  fraud is bad. I am all for the truth. I am all for protecting patients'  personal information, but I am also here proud to say what these great  clinics do. I am not sure what you are even accusing them is even true.  I have not witnessed that. The pregnancy clinics that I have seen do  great work for these folks. They truly do sit down and talk with them.  They give them a hand up. They do so many great things.   So I don't know where this fraud and deception is coming about,  except that they are talking to women and saying: Do you realize your  baby has a heartbeat? Do you realize your baby can feel pain at 14  weeks? Do you realize that your baby recognizes the voice of your  husband right now?   So I think those are great things to share with patients; that how  wonderful life is; that we are all wonderfully, beautifully made in the  womb; that life begins at conception. I think that is all the truth  that should be shared with them.   So, no, I don't think there is anything you could do with this  legislation to change it that I could support, and I continue to  object.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before the COVID-19 pandemic, few people  other than scientists and national security experts were familiar with  gain-of-function research. Now, as we continue to search for the origin  of this pandemic and begin to learn more about the dangerous research  that has been largely kept from the public eye, it is becoming a  household phrase.   Before we get started on the current state of play, I would like to  give a brief history of this research and how the Federal Government  has poorly, perhaps even negligently, approached its oversight and  funding.   In late 2011, over a decade ago, the NSABB, which is the NIH's  advisory board, stopped two scientists from publishing an avian  influenza gain-of-function study. Why? Because they were afraid that  this study would educate bioterrorists. That is right. In 2011, a  decade ago, scientists had figured out how to make H5N1--a highly  pathogenic avian influenza--more contagious, which would have been  catastrophic for American agriculture.   Dr. Fauci personally called both scientists and convinced them to  volunteer to pause their experiments. In early 2012, Dr. Fauci  encouraged all influenza scientists to voluntarily pause influenza  gain-of-function research and told them:         It is essential we respect the concern of the public       domestically or globally, and not ask them to take the word       of the influenza scientist.    Dr. Fauci was obviously concerned about the public's perception out  there. Dr. Fauci also, almost prophetically, stated that he worried  about ``unregulated'' laboratories, perhaps outside of the United  States, doing work ``sloppily'' and leading to an inadvertent pandemic.  ``Accidental release is what the world is really worried about.''   In 2014, after several biosecurity accidents in U.S. research labs,  the Obama White House implemented the gain-of-function moratorium on  influenza, as well as MERS and SARS research, because of the potential  risk of lab accidents and inherent gain-of-function danger. These two  moratoriums clearly demonstrate that the U.S. Government and the NIH,  our primary public health Agency, understood the risk associated with  this research and understood the threats it posed.   Despite this pause, though, certain viral gain-of-function research  projects continued at the University of North Carolina, research that  was later shared with a Chinese virologist named Dr. Shi, the Bat Lady.  She was famous for her copious amounts of research conducted on  coronaviruses that live in bats.   Outside of the North Carolina studies, Dr. Fauci failed to heed his  own call on U.S. scientists to pause their gain-of-function studies and  offshored the paused research to China not just once and not just  recently but practically continuously for over a decade. It is  disturbing that one of our top public health Agencies directed this  risky research to be offshored while encouraging the pause on that  exact same research here in the United States.   In 2012, Dr. Fauci gave a new grant to Peter Daszak's EcoHealth  Alliance, a company that America will soon know the name of all across  America. He gave a new grant to Peter Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance for  avian influenza research in China, which was truly gain-of-function  research.   In 2014, Dr. Fauci gave another new grant, another gain-of-function  grant, to Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth for SARS research in China. Through  these grants, Peter Daszak partnered with the Wuhan Institute of  Virology.    In late 2017, the NIH announced a lift on the gain-of-function pause,  apparently without consultation with the Senate-confirmed State  Department or with national security leadership. Significantly, there  was no Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in  place, with only an Acting HHS Secretary at the helm. The NIH  essentially lifted the moratorium on their own by slipping it in  between administrations and self-policing.   Today, we can't see the research records from Dr. Fauci's offshored  projects because the Chinese Communist Party has the possession--or at  least supposedly has the possession--of EcoHealth's records, and the  NIH resists in sharing theirs.   By all accounts, Dr. Fauci and EcoHealth's research in China led to  the COVID-19 pandemic and Dr. Fauci's worst fears that a lab accident  in a foreign lab would become a reality.   At a very important hearing yesterday at the Capitol, hosted by  Senator Paul, before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight, Dr.  Richard Ebright, a renowned microbiologist, declared that it was indeed  possible that this research did lead to the outbreak of COVID-19.   Dr. Steven Quay and Dr. Kevin Esvelt, other expert witnesses on the  panel, agreed that viral gain-of-function offers no civilian use or  benefit. Let me say that again. Both of these doctors agreed that viral  gain-of-function offers no civilian use or benefit but that it is so  risky that it can cause a pandemic that will have a worse impact than a  nuclear attack. It is indeed a weapon of mass destruction.   Despite warnings and past lab accidents, our public health Agencies,  like the NIH, continue to fund this weapon-of-mass-destruction  research, often in China nonetheless. In fact, at one point, the NIH  paid for more viral gain-of-function experiments than the Department of  Defense, according to hearing testimony given by Dr. Fauci on this  topic in 2012.   Shockingly, Congress has minimal insight into the amount of research  that the NIH performs. There is no transparency in the risk evaluation  process, and there is no proper oversight.   Recently--and this is news--our office learned that the USAID is  currently paying $125 million to the Washington State University Paul  Allen School for Global Health to collect potential pandemic pathogens  in high-risk areas for outbreak. Once collected, these samples are  being used in dangerous gain-of-function experiments through their DEEP  VZN grant. This project initially partnered with five countries in  Africa, Asia, and Latin America, but it could expand to others.   The university researchers are collecting, storing, and experimenting  on these pathogens in foreign laboratories in each country. Even worse,  these hazardous research techniques are being taught to foreign  researchers while experimenting with potentially deadly pathogens in  laboratories where the United States has no regulatory control or  authority. No process exists to screen U.S. researchers or foreign  researchers by intelligence analysts for their potential as threat  actors. The United States has no ability to control who the technology  or the deadly pathogens are shared with in these foreign labs and  cannot enforce proper storage techniques.   The USAID is putting everyone at risk right now. Our U.S. public  health Agencies, like the NIH and the CDC, cannot be entrusted to  oversee risky research with the current guardrails that are self- selecting and self-policing. Certainly, our U.S. Agency for  International Development cannot be entrusted. Yet Federal Agencies  continue to dispense funds for gain-of-function research.   Dr. Fauci recently came before Congress and publicly declared that he  had no intention to stop using U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund Chinese  Communist Party research projects.   Folks, this is a national security issue. Since January of 2020, I  have been trying to sound the alarm on this virus--on this issue, on  this weapon of mass destruction--but it is largely falling on deaf ears  in Congress and with the current administration. Yesterday's HSGAC  hearing was the first time Congress had examined this subject since the  outbreak of COVID-19. Unfortunately, none of my colleagues from across  the aisle bothered to show up for this hearing, clearly declaring that  this was not a priority for them. Additionally, mainstream media has  attempted to bury concerns about gain-of-function research and the  possibility of a lab leak.   This is unacceptable. We must pause this research until national  security experts can help create appropriate risk metrics, guardrails,  and processes for this research.  [[Page S4026]]    It is important to note that it is estimated that this research only  comprises less than 0.1 percent of all biomedical research and less  than 1 percent of virology research. Dr. Richard Ebright testified that  because gain-of-function research of concern can cause pandemics, this  small part of the biomedical research enterprise is highly  consequential and requires effective oversight. Certainly, that current  oversight is not effective.   This is a bipartisan national security issue. And anyone who studies  this issue in depth will conclude that viral gain of function is a  weapon of mass destruction.   Anyone who examines this will conclude that COVID is like a nuclear  hand grenade, with its pin pulled out. It has already killed a million  people and can kill millions more. Every witness will conclude, like we  did yesterday, that the potential is much worse than any type of  benefit from this research.   This COVID virus is likely a product of U.S.-funded gain-of-function  research. The research has produced no benefit in 10 years and with  seemingly no benefit on the horizon.   This is why I brought my legislation to the floor today to place a  moratorium on all Federal research projects, grants to universities and  other organizations conducting gain-of-function research and risky  research on potential pandemic pathogens. This is an urgent matter that  must be acted on today.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 3012, and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague for her  kind comments. Certainly, the chairwoman has my commitment to continue  to work with her on the PREVENT Pandemics Act as well.   But if my colleagues do not agree with placing a full moratorium on  gain-of-function research, I ask for unanimous consent to adopt the  SAFE Risky Research Act, which stops Federal funds from being used to  conduct risky research with countries that threaten our democracy and  public health.   We recently learned that USAID has been paying for this dangerous  research in China. We know that this research is being conducted in  Africa, Asia, and Latin America, but we don't yet know all the other  countries where they fund this risky research.   What we do know is that, despite their relationship with the State  Department, this funding is being dispensed by USAID without State  Department security consultations, oblivious to the proliferation  potential.   Federal Agencies that oversee national intelligence maintain lists of  countries that may pose a risk or threat to national security. The  Department of State, for example, maintains a list that includes Burma,  the People's Republic of China, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia,  Saudi Arabia, and others.   This legislation is common sense. We shouldn't be collaborating on  dangerous research with our adversaries.   I think it is obvious that all members of our committee agree with  us. They support this bill and this legislation.   On March 15, the HELP Committee held a markup where this amendment-- the same text that is in this bill--was unanimously adopted in the  bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act. I appreciate Chairwoman Murray  working so hard collaborating with us.   During the markup, she supported this, specifically stating that it  threads the needle in terms of protecting biomedical research  enterprise while taking steps to address some of the concerns she has  heard from other committee members.   Given the inherent risk, NIH's unwillingness to fully cooperate with  congressional oversight, and Senate Democrats' objection to taking the  needed step of placing a complete moratorium on gain-of-function  research, we must at least pass this narrow approach today.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 4778, which is at the  desk; further, that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.
