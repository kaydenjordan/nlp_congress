 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor CentraCare Health's  Director of Community and Government Relations, David Borgert. His  approaching retirement will mark the end of his 21-year career with  CentraCare Health.   As a testament to David's hard work, CentraCare has thrived under his  leadership. Whether it was securing grants and donations; educating his  community on the intricacies of State, Federal, and community issues;  or finding new ways to provide quality care, David has set the standard  in the State of Minnesota.   This is why the Minnesota Hospital Association took notice and  awarded David with the Spirit of Advocacy Award for his tireless  efforts to inform the central Minnesota community about healthcare  reform.   Under David's strong leadership, CentraCare Health has consistently  been recognized for its outstanding work. David Borgert is a beloved  and cherished member of our community because of his dedication to  providing quality healthcare.   His service to our community will be missed and we thank him for his  years of commitment. We look forward to seeing him in his well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
