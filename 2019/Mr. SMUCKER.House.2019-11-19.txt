 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize November as  National Adoption Awareness Month.   According to the Adoption Network, one out of every 25 families in  the United States has an adopted child. That means adoption has  directly touched the lives of one-third of the U.S. population.   Yet, despite the widespread impact of adoption, many more children  still need a loving home. The average child waits for an adoptive  family for more than 3 years, and nearly 115,000 children are waiting  to find their forever home. We can do better.   Many barriers prevent these children from being placed in loving  homes. They include the high and often unpredictable cost of adoption,  and families and birth mothers simply not having enough information  about the option of adoption.   To reduce these barriers and help support increased adoption  placement, I recently introduced the Improving Adoption Outcomes and  Affordability Act. My legislation provides assistance to State or local  governments, public and private adoption agencies, faith-based  organizations, and eligible nonprofits for the purpose of improving  adoption education, providing prebirth counseling assistance to birth  mothers choosing adoption, and helping to cover mental health or  substance abuse treatments to mothers struggling with addiction and  other personal challenges during pregnancy.   Not only will this increased education and counseling improve the  outcome of the adoption for both birth  [[Page H8965]]  mothers and adopting families, but it will also provide more pricing  stability to the overall fees that families pay during an adoption.  Adoptions often cost tens of thousands of dollars, which is a financial  impediment to families making this life-affirming choice. Injecting  more price predictability into the adoption system may be the help that  families need when making the decision to adopt.   Last Congress, bipartisan legislation that I introduced to reduce  known barriers for foster placement was signed into law. This bill  builds on that effort to improve adoption outcomes, and we all will  remain committed to ensuring that every child has the opportunity to  grow up in a safe and loving home.                   Recognizing Ann LeTort Elementary School     Mr. Speaker I rise today to congratulate the faculty,  staff, and students of Ann LeTort Elementary School in the Penn Manor  School District on being recognized as the 2019-2020 National Blue  Ribbon School.   Mr. Speaker, the National Blue Ribbon Schools program was founded  nearly 40 years ago to recognize outstanding public and private  schools, who are making a difference and exemplify excellence. LeTort  Elementary was recognized as an Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing  School.   I would like to thank Penn Manor superintendent Dr. Michael  Leichliter, the Penn Manor School Board, and the leadership and  teachers at Ann LeTort Elementary for working very hard for this  achievement. We know how a quality education prepares students for  success throughout the rest of their lives.   Mr. Speaker, in their application for recognition, school principal  Mrs. Carly McPherson notes that, ``it is evident how individuals  throughout the community are vested in the education of every LeTort  student.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratulate that community for making a  difference in the lives of their students and for being recognized as a  National Blue Ribbon School.                            ____________________
