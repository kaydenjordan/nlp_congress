 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Burr), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from South  Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.'' The Senator from Kentucky (Mr.  Paul) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Lieutenant  Commander Zachary Cress of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration--NOAA--Commissioned Officer Corps, who has served as a  fellow on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee for the  past year.   I want to thank Lieutenant Commander Cress for his hard work from  which the committee greatly benefited. His expertise as a ship driver  and manager of our Nation's marine resources has meaningfully informed  the committee's efforts. He has worked on several pieces of legislation  that have become law, including the National Integrated Drought  Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018. His contributions have  enabled NOAA to carry out its missions more effectively.   Again, I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to  Lieutenant Commander Cress for all of the fine work he has done and for  his continued service to our nation. I wish him success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
