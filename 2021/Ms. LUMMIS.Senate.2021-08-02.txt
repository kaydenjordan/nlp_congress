 Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize my good  friend Dr. Jim Logan, who is being inducted into the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame. Since the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame  was established in 1992, 67 agriculture leaders have been recognized  for their substantial contributions to our great State. I speak for  many when I say Dr. Logan is more than deserving of this distinguished  honor. He built an outstanding career in Wyoming and has risen to the  highest ranks of his profession. Beyond his professional success, he  exemplifies what it means to be an outstanding Wyoming citizen.   Dr. Logan began his studies at the University of Wyoming in 1969 and  continued his education at Colorado State University earning his doctor  of veterinary medicine degree. Upon graduation, he returned home to  Riverton, WY, and joined a veterinary medicine practice. He later  opened his own practice, and for over 40 years, he graciously served  his community. During that time, he established a strong reputation  among Wyoming's farmers and ranchers. He quickly excelled and became a  reputable leader in his profession.   After developing extensive knowledge and expertise in his field, he  generously offered many years of service to the State of Wyoming. Dr.  Logan served the Wyoming Livestock Board in many capacities, including  as the State veterinarian. The agriculture community in Wyoming is  grateful for Dr. Logan's contributions and his commitment to health and  safety for an industry that makes up the very fabric of Wyoming  culture.   As a member of various working groups and regulatory boards, he  helped address some of the most pressing issues affecting our State. He  was a central figure in the development of Wyoming Brucellosis  Designated Surveillance Area regulations. With any decision, he  constantly kept the best interest of Wyoming's livestock producers in  mind. For this, we are thankful.   I would also like to mention that Dr. Logan has exceeded all  expectations in what it means to be a leader in the community. His  passion for agriculture has inspired the next generation of farmers and  ranchers. Dr. Logan is a proud supporter of 4-H and FFA, serving as a  mentor and instructor to young people with a heart for agriculture. He  has also taken on many other leadership responsibilities on several  State and national industry associations and committees, including the  American Veterinary Medical Association, American Sheep Industry  Association, and the Western States Livestock Health Association.  Outside of the agriculture industry, he served as the chairman of the  Riverton Memorial Hospital Board.  [[Page S5560]]    Earlier this year, Dr. Logan announced his retirement as the Wyoming  State veterinarian. While his retirement is a true loss for farmers and  ranchers across the State, no one is more deserving of a happy and  joyful retirement. I want to offer my deepest congratulations on a  successful career. It is my privilege to recognize Dr. Logan's  achievements and honor his induction to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of  Fame. Wyoming is grateful for his decades of service and respect the  personal sacrifices that were made for the State.   Dr. Logan, your contributions and dedication will always be  remembered. As you start your retirement, you can be proud of the work  you have done, but also know that you still have a long ride to enjoy.  Happy Trails.                            ____________________
