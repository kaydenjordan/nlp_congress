 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Sherm Anderson of Powell County for his long-standing  dedication to Montana's timber industry, carrying out his family's  entrepreneurial spirit in his hometown of Deer Lodge and for selflessly  serving the greater Powell County community. His perseverance in his  personal and professional life helps the State of Montana maintain its  vital wood products industry.   Sherm's dedication to healthy Montana forests first began when he was  a teenager driving a logging truck. Years later, he and his wife Bonnie  went on to form the Sun Mountain Lumber forest products company, which  employs hundreds of people and serves as the Treasure State's largest  lumber mill and North America's largest finger joint plant. Sun  Mountain Lumber plays a vital role in the Deer Lodge Valley economy and  continues to have an impact across the State. Earlier this year, Sherm  purchased R-Y Timber, a Livingston, MT, sawmill, that was shuttered  following a devastating fire--and saved even more logging jobs.  Montanans are lucky to have this forest products powerhouse right in  our backyard.   When it comes to Sherm's accomplished work history, he served in the  Montana State Legislature, branched out into real estate and  construction, operates a fitness center, contributes to a local auto  museum, maintains his own 1,200-acre ranch, and most recently invested  in the town's old hospital complex in order to renovate it into  workforce housing. As Sherm continues to weather the volatility of the  timber industry, he understands that collaboration is critical to  keeping important wood product jobs viable and also ensuring our forest  lands remain healthy for generations to come. It is clear Sherm  understands the importance in working with folks from all backgrounds  to make southwestern Montana a better place to live and work.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Sherm Anderson for his passion  to preserve our shared Montana way of life. The Anderson family has  created a multigenerational legacy that promotes fruitful forest  stewardship.``Montana Proud!''                            ____________________
