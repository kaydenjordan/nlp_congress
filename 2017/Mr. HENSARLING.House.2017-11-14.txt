 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 616, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2874) to achieve reforms to improve the financial  stability of the National Flood Insurance Program, to enhance the  development of more accurate estimates of flood risk through new  technology and better maps, to increase the role of private markets in  the management of flood insurance risks, and to provide for alternative  methods to insure against flood peril, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria: the images of the human misery and  the economic devastation are still clearly imprinted on our minds.   Unfortunately, we know that part of this is a result of a failed  National Flood Insurance Program, which, Mr. Speaker, faced three  important challenges.   First, it is a bankrupt program. It is unsustainable. Taxpayers are  on the hook for $1.2 trillion, running an annual actuarial deficit of  $1.5 billion. It has already received two different bailouts, for a  combined total of about $25 billion.   Also, it incents and subsidizes people to actually live in harm's  way.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is a government monopoly that,  notwithstanding subsidized rates, still, unfortunately, has  unaffordable premiums for many.   Today is a good day, Mr. Speaker, because today the House gets to  vote on the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.   I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) for his  leadership on the mapping reforms and reinsurance. I want to thank the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) for his reforms on opening up the  market. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Duffy) for his tireless effort and leadership in bringing this bill to  the floor.   There are a lot of good reforms in this bill, Mr. Speaker, for both  taxpayers and ratepayers. Let me just briefly touch upon two.   It is an absolutely revolutionary reform, Mr. Speaker, that we can  break open the government monopoly and bring in market competition,  innovation competition, and more affordable rates for so many.   Milliman, one of the actuarial experts within the marketplace,  released a study a couple of months ago talking about the market  competition, saying: ``Based on our estimates, this would hold for 77  percent of all single families in Florida, 69 percent in Louisiana, and  92 percent in Texas,'' who all would see cheaper premiums.   We know that is not theory. It is actually happening in the market  today. In the nascent part of the market that is open, people are  getting hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of savings.   One of the great tragedies that I saw in my native State of Texas, in  Houston, was how few people actually took up flood insurance. Think,  Mr. Speaker, if we had competition, if we had advertising, if people  could roll that into their homeowner rates, how many more people would  have been protected by the ravages of these hurricanes.   One more reform, briefly. We have these repetitive loss properties  where people live in areas that flood over and over and over. I met a  couple of families in Houston. They had three floods in 8 years. We  have got to help them.   This bill provides more money for relocation, for flood-proofing, and  for mitigation, than any other flood reform bill, all by 25 percent. We  would prioritize these areas.   We also have to realize that if we are going to make this program  sustainable, we cannot have 1 percent of the properties causing 25  percent of the losses.                                time  1515    Ultimately, if all we do is rebuild the same properties in the same  fashion in the same location, that is neither wise nor compassionate.  We have an opportunity to enact historic reforms. We should do it  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee  and respected member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee and one of the coauthors of H.R. 2874.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross), the vice chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee and the author of the pro-consumer competition title of  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip, who has a slightly  different message.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), another respected member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), a very hardworking member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a senior Democrat and leader on environmental  issues in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee, and the sponsor of the legislation, the 21st Century  Flood Reform Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of horrific images from Hurricane  Harvey. We should never forget them. We should look at this image and  say: Never again.   Yet I hear from my colleagues: Let's preserve the status quo. Let's  again subsidize people to live i harm's way.    I say no, Mr. Speaker. It is time to get these people out of these  neighborhoods. Let's help them. That is why  [[Page H9236]]  this bill has more money for mitigation and relocation than has ever  been in any flood insurance reform bill.   I hear my ranking member say that she cares about affordability. Then  let's give people options.   I hear from people who say: NFIP would have cost me $2,700 a year,  but I was able to find private coverage for $718.   Here is another one: I have benefited from switching to private  market flood insurance from FEMA. I save about $1,000 a year.   Let's save money. Let's save premiums. Let's save lives. Let's vote  ``aye'' on the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, first, I have some good news for my  friend on the other side of the aisle. I would have him pay very  careful attention to title VI of the 21st Century Flood Reform Act. It  has everything to do with the whole Sandy appeals process. We have 25  pages of reforms dealing with what the gentleman was describing,  including Section 601, Penalties for Fraud and False Statements in the  National Flood Insurance Program.   And, indeed, after Sandy, many of the policyholders were wronged and  there was much that we learned from that experience, and we tried to  listen very carefully to a number of our colleagues from New Jersey and  New York and, indeed, took many of the provisions which they have  suggested.                                time  1630    The gentleman from New Jersey, indeed, has some very legitimate  issues and concerns. Many of them, I hope and trust, have been  addressed in this  [[Page H9237]]  bill. It is not too late. I would urge the gentleman to look at that  title IV of the bill and perhaps he would be encouraged to support it.   Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, I must urge rejection of the motion to  recommit because, as you heard from the gentleman from New Jersey, he  says it is all about delay. We can't delay getting people out of harm's  way. We can't delay getting people out of neighborhoods that have  flooded four, five, six, seven times in the last 8 years.   For those who can't afford flood insurance, we can't delay getting  them market alternatives, where, in the 2 percent of the market that  exists today, particularly in Pennsylvania, there are people that are  not just saving hundreds of dollars, Mr. Speaker, but even thousands of  dollars. We can't delay.   We know that this is a program that is unsustainable. It is a  bankrupt program that is being funded, regrettably, by a bankrupt  nation. Taxpayers are on the hook for $1.2 trillion and an annual  deficit of $1.5 billion of actuarial deficit a year.   This thing isn't just broke, Mr. Speaker, it is bailout broke. We  can't delay. We can't delay trying to put this back on a path of  sustainability so the next time we have a serious storm or superstorm,  we want there to be funds available to actually pay claims.   So, no, Mr. Speaker, we cannot delay. We cannot delay, and we cannot  continue to do what we have done in the past in these repetitive loss  areas and have our hands unclean by putting people back in the exact  same neighborhoods that haven't just caused the loss of their property,  but one day may very well cost the loss of their lives. We cannot  delay.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
