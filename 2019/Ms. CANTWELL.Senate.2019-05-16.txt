 Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance  Committee, Senator Grassley, for his leadership on these issues. I look  forward to working with him on the assigned task forces and to working  hard on very important issues that he and I have been working on in the  past--from biodiesel, to energy policy, to a variety of things. I thank  him for that.
