 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  10 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Great Lakes Restoration Initiative     Mr. President, the five Great Lakes are as vital to our  industrial heartlands as the Rockies are to the West or the Atlantic  coastline is to New England. Eighty-four percent of America's  freshwater is in the Great Lakes--84 percent. Around the globe, only  polar ice caps contain more freshwater than do these five Great Lakes.   Lake Erie is one of the biggest lakes in the world. From the boats  and barges that moved goods along the Ohio River and the Erie Canal to  the ships that leave Lake Erie and export grain and steel to the world,  my State of Ohio has a rich history of cultivating this vital natural  resource. In Ohio, families and businesses rely on Lake Erie. Its  waters are critical to farming and to clean energy development and  industry and regional economic competitiveness, to fishing and  recreation and so much that people do every day in my State.   From tourism in Catawba and Put-in-Bay, to fishing at Marblehead, to  vacations and family reunions at Maumee Bay State Park, Lake Erie  benefits our communities and creates jobs in our State, but for more  than a half century, keeping our lake healthy has been a constant  struggle. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes. In the  Western Basin off the shore of Toledo, it is only 30 feet deep--much  shallower in contrast with Lake Superior, which is 600 feet deep on  average.   I remember how polluted Lake Erie was when I was growing up. As a  child, it was obvious the water shouldn't look quite the way it looked.  While improvements have been made, today's problems are different and  in many ways more urgent.   Harmful algal blooms are a constant threat. Because the Western Lake  Erie Basin near Toledo is the shallowest part of the lake, it is  uniquely vulnerable to these blooms, the same way that much of Lake  Erie, 60 or 70 or 80 feet deep, is more vulnerable to pollution.   In August 2014, a bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in Lucas County in  Northwest Ohio, in the Toledo area, without safe drinking water for  nearly 3 days. We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in  our water. This comes from untreated sewage, it comes from urban  runoff, and it comes from farm field runoff. Heavy rains lead to more  combined sewage overflows, more nutrient runoff from our fields, and to  larger and more harmful algal blooms.   Algal blooms leave our lake looking like this. This may be a  beautiful painting in your living room or a striking photograph of  something, but this color here is more the regular, natural color of  Lake Erie, the dark here in the wake of this boat. This green is the  algal blooms, and you can see what this has done to pollute one of the  greatest bodies of freshwater in the world. Would you want to fish  there? Likely not. Would you take your children out on water that looks  like this? Of course not. Does this water look like what you want  coming out of your faucet when you turn on the faucet in Toledo or in  Lorain, where I lived for 10 years, or in Sandusky or Cleveland or  Ashtabula or any city along the Great Lakes?   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we  [[Page S1883]]  know that one effect of climate change in the Great Lakes region has  been a 37-percent increase in gully washers, or heavy rain events that  contribute to blooms. Hotter summers will only make these blooms worse.  The effects of algal blooms like that have profound effects on the  entire ecosystem.   Protecting our lake is one of the biggest environmental challenges  our country faces. We have made progress over the last 8 years, thanks  in large part to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. We have  continued to clean up Lake Erie and its tributaries, we have increased  access to the lake, and we have improved habitats for fish and wildlife  in the region.   Because it is shallow, this Great Lake, Lake Erie, only one of five  Great Lakes and the Great Lake with actually the least water--almost 50  percent of all the fish in the Great Lakes live in this Great Lake. So  you can see what these algal blooms do to aquatic life, to our way of  life when you have these kinds of algal blooms.   We know that the bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is  working. As we celebrate Water Week this week, we should recommit  ourselves to strengthening this program and building on our success.  But in President Trump's budget proposal this week, the administration  proposed entirely eliminating this important program that has been so  successful--entirely eliminating this program that has been so  successful. It is basically a surrender to the algal blooms. It is the  administration--our country, if he speaks for our country--surrendering  and just saying: Give up; we are not going to make the fight.    We have cleaned up Lake Erie because of the Federal EPA, because of  the State EPA, because of the cities and the counties along the lake,  places like Toledo, Lorain, Sandusky, Cleveland, and my wife's hometown  of Ashtabula. We have cleaned it up, but it is a constant struggle  because so many people live along this very shallow, very vulnerable to  pollution Great Lake. That is why we don't give up.   We are not just talking about cutting funding for a program; the  administration budget completely cuts this program, completely ends it.  Taking an axe to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will cost Ohio  jobs, jeopardize public health, and will put our drinking water at risk  and reverse the progress we have made. It is simply something you don't  do in a country like ours. It is unacceptable. I will fight like hell  to protect the Great Lakes, I will fight like hell to protect Lake  Erie, and I will fight like hell to protect the entire lake ecosystem.   The fact is, these five Great Lakes are a natural resource like none  other in the world. Here is what is at risk if the administration's  budget plan becomes a reality: Forty percent of the funds used to  protect the lake from Asian carp would just disappear like that; 1.8  million more pounds of phosphorus would enter the Lake, making algal  blooms like this more likely, just like that; and the cleanup of toxic  sediment in habitat restorations in some of our most polluted rivers  would grind to a halt. Why would they do this? Why would they eliminate  this program? Neither party here wants them to do this. Senator Portman  stands with me on this. Most of the Republican House Members stand with  Democrats like Congresswoman Fudge and Congresswoman Kaptur, who  represent much of the area along the Great Lakes.   There are projects across Ohio that simply couldn't take place  without this program. In Ashtabula, a cleanup project has removed  sediment containing 25,000 pounds of toxic material, transforming the  lower two-thirds of the Ashtabula River. A $61 million project never  would have gotten off the ground without the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative. Look at the new Lake Erie Bluffs Park in Perry Township-- they used $1.6 million from the initiative to leverage other sources of  funding to restore and protect this shoreline.   My Ohio colleagues of both parties have made it clear that zeroing  out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is not an option and that  they will not stand for it.   It isn't just this initiative on the chopping block; the budget makes  deep cuts in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which  monitors these algal blooms. Scientists at Ohio State's Stone Lab play  a key role in protecting our lake, and the reported NOAA cuts would  nearly eliminate the grant funding that supports Stone Lab's mission. I  have been at Stone Lab. I see the work they do. I see the dedicated  dozen or so naturalists, not well-paid--Federal employees or State  employees not particularly well paid. They love nature, they love Lake  Erie, they love our State, they love its natural beauty, and they love  all that it does for us.   When I was young, people wrote off Lake Erie as a dying lake. It was  polluted, it smelled bad, and it looked bad. It was a dying lake. Over  the past century, people have had a habit of trying to write off my  State. We have proved them wrong time and again. The lake is improving.  It is supporting entire industries. It supports jobs. It provides  drinking water. It provides recreation. It is beautiful to look at from  my home in Lorain when I lived there. It is beautiful to look at  anywhere along the coastline of Lake Erie. We cannot allow this  President and we cannot allow Washington, DC, to write off Lake Erie  and the millions of Americans who rely on it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10  minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.   If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.   The Senator from New Mexico.
