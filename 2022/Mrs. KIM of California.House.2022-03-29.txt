 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Brea  Chamber of Commerce CEO and President Heidi Gallegos for her dedicated  service to our community.   Heidi served in the Los Angeles Police Department for 11 years and on  the Board of Trustees for Rowland Unified School District for 12 years.  Most recently, she guided the Brea Chamber of Commerce through the  Great Recession and the COVID-19 lockdowns. Despite unprecedented  economic challenges, Heidi led the chamber to build reserves and remain  successful.   She consistently operates with integrity, energy, and compassion and  has established a reputation for strong, trusted leadership.   I thank Heidi for all that she has done for our community. I am proud  to call her a friend, and I wish her a joyful retirement.                            ____________________
