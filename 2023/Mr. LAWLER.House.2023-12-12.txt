 Madam Speaker, last year, New York Democrats tried to  corrupt our redistricting process by gerrymandering New York's maps to  favor 22 Democrats and 4 Republicans.   They were summarily thrown out in court, with the court ruling that  they not only violated the State constitution, they violated the  process, and they gerrymandered the maps.   A special master appointed by the court drew a fair set of maps that  resulted in 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans being elected. However,  that didn't serve the purpose of New York Democrats, so they filed  another lawsuit.   Today, the court of appeals, in a shameful episode, was stacked and  made a decision to redraw New York's congressional maps for the sole  purpose of trying to favor New York Democrats.   It is pathetic, it is shameful, and it serves only one person, the  leader of the Democratic Conference. He should be embarrassed.                            ____________________
