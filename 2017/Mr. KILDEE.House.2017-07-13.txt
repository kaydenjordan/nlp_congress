 Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans continue to push a flawed  and harmful healthcare bill, TrumpCare. It fails to address the basic  healthcare needs of Americans.   Republicans themselves are deeply divided on the subject. You have  Republicans negotiating with Republicans and they can't come to  consensus. Democrats, meanwhile, have been willing to work to come to  consensus to work together to fix those real issues that we know we  have to address in the Affordable Care Act. We have not been given the  opportunity.   There has been no transparency in any of this discussion, no  hearings, and no public input. The entire process is behind closed  doors. Of course, we know why. This is a bill that kicks millions of  Americans off of healthcare. Twenty-two million people would lose  health insurance. For those lucky enough to get healthcare, they will  pay more for less. Their out-of-pocket expenses will go up. If you are  50 to 64, there will be an age tax.   This is a terrible piece of legislation. It ought to be rejected and  we ought to work together to fix the problems we have.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I align myself with the remarks of my  friend, Mr. Norcross, and that of my friend, Mr. McKinley.   There is bipartisan opposition to this amendment because we know what  it would do. You can talk about it any way you want to talk about it,  but the net effect is reduced wages for workers in the communities we  represent.   I come from Flint, Michigan. I represent folks who play by the rules  and have the right, after working in a trade, to get compensation that  is equal to the quality of the work that they deliver. If we don't  support that, all we are going to do is continue this race to the  bottom.   We all talk about the fact that wages have not kept up. Here is yet  another effort that will undermine the ability of American workers who  work hard every single day to be able to have a decent wage, take care  of their families, put their kids through school, and set something  aside for retirement. This is the American Dream. Back in the 1930s,  this is why this legislation was first put in place. This amendment  would undermine that promise.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote.
