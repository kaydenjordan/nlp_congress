 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th  anniversary of a town in my district, Lindsborg, Kansas, also known as  Little Sweden.   The town was originally settled in 1869 by hardworking Swedish  farmers who, like my great-grandfather, had left Sweden because of the  potato famine.   These farmers were new to America and new to the landscape and  climate of Kansas. Their goal was to establish a home and community  rich in Swedish culture, religion, and business.   Today, Lindsborg is a bright, vibrant community where retailers  feature unique traditional Swedish treats and artwork; where visitors  can walk up and down the streets and Main Street and find more than 15  wild Dala horses painted to represent a unique piece of Lindsborg's  culture. My own family often has one of these Dala horses in their  entryway as folks enter their house.   It is a community that is proud of its heritage and comes together to  carry on a variety of Swedish festivals and traditions honoring its  original settlers.   I, myself, am one-quarter Swedish and very proud of this fact.  Growing up, we kept many Swedish traditions in our family. We  celebrated them whenever we had the occasion. Still today, our  Christmas Eve dinners always feature various Swedish dishes, including  pickled herring, anchovies, hardtack crackers, Swedish candies, and  desserts. My mom, brother, and wife to this day enjoy their annual  pilgrimage to Lindsborg to pick out their very special Swedish  Christmas gifts.   In 2010, I was able to take my mother back to Sweden, along with my  oldest son and daughter, and view the home that my grandfather had  built; the farm where they farmed; the fences they had built out of  stone; the barns they had built out of stone, still functional and  standing today; and the water well my great-grandfather had dug. All of  those parts of the farm were still functioning.   I was able to see the church where my great-grandfather and great- grandmother were married and see the cemetery where many of our  relatives are buried to this day. It is a trip I will never forget.   I am very proud of my Swedish roots, and I am honored to represent  Bethany College and the town of Lindsborg. This town will always have a  very special place in my heart, and it is my honor to sponsor the  resolution that celebrates this milestone for Lindsborg. I can't wait  until this year's Messiah Festival, when we will get to watch them live  there in Lindsborg.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to represent this Swedish community,  something that will always represent so much to my family.                            ____________________
