 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a looming  catastrophe for New York farmers, farmworkers, and consumers across New  York State and the country.   On September 6, the New York State Farm Laborers Wage Board voted to  advance a proposal to lower the State's overtime wage threshold for  farm laborers from 60 to 40 hours per week, despite overwhelming  opposition to the recommendation.   During the public comment period, farmers, farmworkers, and consumers  all turned out in droves to oppose the recommendation. Farmers, who are  struggling with inflation already, are now very worried about keeping  up with yet another price hike. Farmworkers are gravely concerned about  the possible lost hours on the job, cutting their wages. Consumers  should fear even higher increases to food costs, which have already  increased 11.4 percent over the last year, the biggest increase since  1979, with prices continuing to go up.   Their fears are real. Cornell University's College of Agriculture and  Life Sciences projected that the overtime rule's implementation could  force two-thirds of dairy farmers to make significant changes to their  operations, including, and dramatically bad, leaving the industry or  investing in other States.   New York State already leads the Nation in the highest out-migration  of people and jobs. This would be a disaster for our agricultural  community.   Cornell University Ag Sciences also found that half of New York's  fruit and vegetable farmers likely would have to reduce operations or  leave the industry altogether. The second largest apple-producing  county in the entire Nation is Wayne County, located in upstate New  York.   Despite all this, the board still voted to advance the recommendation  anyway. We are incredibly disappointed that the board ignored such  compelling input from important stakeholders, worsening the already  difficult headwinds for New York's agriculture industry. The board  ultimately decided to undermine the very industry and workers they are  supposed to be serving.   This week, I joined upstate farmers for a roundtable discussion  hosted by Dale Hemminger and his son, Clay, at Hemdale Farms in Seneca  Castle, New York. The feedback from the farmers was unanimous: Lowering  the overtime threshold will devastate New York's agricultural industry  and have a critically difficult impact on the future of family farms in  New York and could leave New York as one of the few States in the  country with such an onerous and unreasonable restriction on family  farms.   Family farms, large and small, are the lifeblood of New York's  economy. Everyone thinks it is New York City. It is actually  agriculture.   Now, the recommendation is with the State labor commissioner, Roberta  Reardon. I have and continue to urge her to reject this change and  maintain the current 60-hour threshold. New York family farms and  consumers simply cannot bear any further price increases.   I have also joined my other New York colleagues, Representatives  Elise  [[Page H8127]]  Stefanik and Chris Jacobs, in introducing legislation in Congress known  as the Protect Local Farms Act to stop this misguided policy from  taking effect.   If there are no farms, there will be no nutritious food to feed our  State, our Nation, and, yes, the world, as we face a potential food  shortage worldwide.                            ____________________
