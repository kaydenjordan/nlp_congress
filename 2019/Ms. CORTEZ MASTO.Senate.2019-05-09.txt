 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak as in morning  [[Page S2754]]  business for up to 5 minutes, and that following my remarks, Senator  Rosen be recognized to speak as in morning business for as much time as  she may consume.    Thank you, Madam President. I come to the floor  today to honor my colleague and dear friend, Senator Jacky Rosen, as  she prepares to deliver her maiden speech in this Chamber.   Senator Rosen has spent her career pushing boundaries and advocating  for innovation and inclusivity. She is bringing that vision to the U.S.  Senate, where she has already proved herself to be a strong advocate  for Nevadans by fighting to bolster our State's tech industries,  supporting our veterans, and protecting Nevadans' healthcare.   When Jacky was elected to the Senate, we sat down and talked about  how we could best serve Nevada together. We requested different  committee assignments so we could be sure we were covering all the  issue areas that are important to Nevadans. We made sure our staffs  were connected and working together on projects, not only in DC but in  the great Silver State of Nevada.   We committed to coming together every Wednesday morning in DC to  welcome Nevadans to the Capitol and hear their stories. Those Wednesday  morning constituent coffees are one of the highlights, I think, of both  of our weeks. Anyone lucky enough to work with Jacky knows that she  works tirelessly to build consensus and find solutions that help better  the lives of Nevada families. I am honored to work beside her every day  to serve the people of Nevada. I am proud to call her my friend, and I  want to congratulate her on making her maiden speech this morning. I  look forward to this and to many more as we continue to fight together  for the Silver State.   I yield the floor.
