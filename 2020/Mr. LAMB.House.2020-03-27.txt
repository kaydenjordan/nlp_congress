 Mr. Speaker, I know a firefighter who is going into sick  people's homes still today with no mask.   We all talk like this is war, but did George Marshall, a western  Pennsylvanian, wait for U.S. Steel to join the U.S. war effort in their  own good time? No. He used to say: You cannot fight against the  problem. You have to decide it.   We have given this government money. We cannot give it leadership.  Now is the time to decide this problem. Take this money, buy the masks,  build the ventilators, and protect our people now.
