 Madam Speaker, there have been quite a few  comments from the other side about how this is partisan, and this is an  attack, and we're coming after Donald Trump.   I don't like this President. I don't like his values, or his decision  making, nor his policies or the words he chooses to use. But these  articles are not about a man. They are about the ACTIONS of a man. They  are about the ways in which someone elected to the highest office in  this country abused that office, and violated the basic tenets of the  constitutional balance of power.   I don't want him to serve two terms, but this is about that. This is  about holding the President of the United States, whoever he may be, to  the standards and expectations of that office.   I say that genuinely. I would take this same vote for any President  who abused his office in that way. And any member of this body who  fails to understand what this vote really means--making clear what we  expect of the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, not the person sitting in it--is  deeply and horribly mistaken.   Anyone who fights for democratic values, who values the balance of  power, who wants to ensure the underpinnings of the greatest democracy  in the world remain strong for generations to come, will support these  articles of impeachment as I intend to do.
