 Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose President  Biden's proposal to force blue-collar workers in my district to pay off  the student loans of borrowers who attended universities who are  sitting on billion-dollar endowments.   In my district, there are 599,500 constituents who are not being  asked to but will be forced to pay the student loan debt that people  agreed to take out. This plan is unfair to responsible Americans who  have diligently worked hard and saved money to fund their education.   Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the dedication of our  military members who earned tuition benefits through their service. The  rising costs of higher education deserve careful examination,  particularly concerning the growing number of administrative positions  focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.   We must investigate the significant increase in administrative  expenses that do not directly contribute to providing students with a  quality education leading to meaningful employment.   Universities that charge exorbitant amounts for humanities degrees in  cultural Marxism should bear the responsibility when their graduates  struggle to repay their loans due to a lack of viable employment  opportunities.   I urge my colleagues to prioritize the interest of taxpayers by  opposing this proposal put forth by President Biden.   Mr. Speaker, I see them laughing over there. I don't think the people  that are going to be left holding the bag paying someone else's student  loan debt are laughing.
