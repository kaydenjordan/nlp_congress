 I thank Chairman Alexander and join him in commending  Ms. Lowery for her many years of dedicated and outstanding service to  the HELP Committee, the Senate, and the American people. I greatly  appreciate the sacrifice that Ms. Lowery has made over the past 16  years in assisting the HELP Committee by applying her expertise in  editing, printing, and memorializing our important work. We wish her  all the best in her well-deserved retirement.   We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Ms. Lowery for her  service.                            ____________________
