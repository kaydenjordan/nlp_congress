 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the Eastbank  Little League team from River Ridge, LA, for winning the 2019 Little  League World Series.   Everybody is glad when kids do well, but you are particularly glad  when they are your kids, and these are Louisiana's kids. It is the  first time in history a Louisiana team has won the Little League  tournament, and we are still celebrating.   Egan, Reece, Marshall, William, Gavin, Jeffrey, Ryan, Derek, Connor,  Ryder, Alton, Peyton, Stan, and coaches Scott Frazier, Kevin Johnson,  and Donald Abadie, you have made us proud.   The real story may not be the championship itself but how they won.  After losing their first game to Hawaii, the defending world champions,  the Louisiana team went on to outscore opponents 44 to 8. They averaged  almost as many runs per game as their opponents scored in total during  this streak, and that is amazing.   One of those wins included fending off a comeback in a rematch  against Hawaii for the American championship. I commend the Hawaii team  for their impressive season, which is after an impressive season last  year, but this year it was the Louisiana team's moment.   After the Hawaii victory, they then went on to shut out the Caribbean  team 8 to 0 to bring the world championship home to Louisiana and to  the United States.   Louisianans are known for resiliency. That inborn never-give-up  attitude is why these kids are champions.   These young folks from River Ridge faced adversity they conquered.  They demonstrated character and sportsmanship throughout the ups and  downs. Their wins should make all Americans proud. They certainly make  all of Louisiana proud.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Akard, Cabaniss,  and Byrne nominations expire at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, September 11, and  that if the nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of the Byrne  nomination, the Senate resume consideration of the Bowman nomination  and that at 2:45 the Senate vote on the cloture motions for the Bowman,  Feddo, and Nordquist nominations. Finally, I ask that following the  cloture vote on the Nordquist nomination, the Senate vote on the  Haines, Brown, Grimberg, Seeger, McElroy, and Gallagher nominations as  under the previous order.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my new press  assistant, Cole Avery, be granted privileges of the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 1881 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2035 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, September 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired and the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Akard  nomination under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:45 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, September 11, 2019, at 9:30 a.m.  [[Page S5412]]                                ____________________
