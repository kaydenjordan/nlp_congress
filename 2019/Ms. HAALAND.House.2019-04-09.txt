 Madam Speaker, if we think back to the beginning of this  Congress, we started the first 100 days under an unnecessary government  shutdown. I met with constituents, Federal workers, and businessowners  in my district who were forced to suffer for the President's frivolous  campaign promise.   At the end of the day, we funded the government and made sure Federal  workers received back pay. All the while, we were setting up a path to  work for the people, making our communities a priority, not just the  wealthy and well connected, but people who suffer when they lose a  paycheck and need to rely on accessible healthcare.   We are in a special moment in history, a moment when our freshman  class of House Members look more like the people we represent, and our  experiences reflect the experiences of everyday Americans. I am a  single mother. I often had to piece together healthcare for my daughter  and I, and I am still paying off my student loans. This class of  freshman lawmakers know the struggles that many are going through, and,  with our new majority, it is clear we are working for the people.                                time  1845    We passed the bill that would ensure everyone has an opportunity to  participate in our democracy, while taking steps to end corruption.   The most significant land legislation of our time made it across the  finish line, including provisions of my first bill, to designate land  for everyone to have access to public lands in New Mexico.   It was a huge win for my State, because in New Mexico we value our  natural heritage and resources, and we believe in protecting the places  we hold dear for future generations to enjoy.   The public lands package makes all of those things possible. It is  also a prime example of what our Democratic majority can get done  because we are willing to work across the aisle and push legislation  through.   Our progress includes things like fighting for equality with the  Paycheck Fairness Act and a resolution condemning the President's  transgender troops ban, fighting for prosperity for everyone by  introducing a $15 minimum wage and passing the Dream and Promise Act.   We are also tackling the challenges of our time with the Violence  Against Women Act and forging a path to address climate change with an  unprecedented number of committee hearings uncovering the climate  change realities facing our communities, and we are working on  legislation that will create a Green New Deal for everyone and for our  country.   In 100 days, you can get a lot done, and we are looking forward to  getting more done for the people in the next 100 days.
