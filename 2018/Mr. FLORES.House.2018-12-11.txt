 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6140) to require the Secretary of Energy to establish and  carry out a program to support the availability of HA-LEU for domestic  commercial use, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6140         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced Nuclear Fuel       Availability Act''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish and carry       out, through the Office of Nuclear Energy, a program to       support the availability of HA-LEU for domestic commercial       use.        (b) Program Elements.--In carrying out the program under       subsection (a), the Secretary--        (1) may provide financial assistance to assist commercial       entities to design and license transportation packages for       HA-LEU, including canisters for metal, gas, and other HA-LEU       compositions;        (2) shall, to the extent practicable--        (A) by January 1, 2021, have commercial entities submit       such transportation package designs to the Commission for       certification by the Commission under part 71 of title 10,       Code of Federal Regulations; and        (B) encourage the Commission to have such transportation       package designs so certified by the Commission by January 1,       2023;        (3) not later than January 1, 2020, shall submit to       Congress a report on the Department's uranium inventory that       may be available to be processed to HA-LEU for purposes of       such program, which may not include any uranium allocated by       the Secretary for use in support of the atomic energy defense       activities of the National Nuclear Security Administration;        (4) not later than one year after the date of enactment of       this Act, and biennially thereafter through September 30,       2025, shall conduct a survey of stakeholders to estimate the       quantity of HA-LEU necessary for domestic commercial use for       each of the five subsequent years;        (5) shall assess options available for the Secretary to       acquire HA-LEU for such program, including an assessment, for       each such option, of the cost and amount of time required;        (6) shall establish a consortium, which may include       entities involved in any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, to       partner with the Department to support the availability of       HA-LEU for domestic commercial use, including by--        (A) providing information to the Secretary for purposes of       surveys conducted under paragraph (4); and        (B) purchasing HA-LEU made available to members of the       consortium by the Secretary under the program;        (7) shall, prior to acquiring HA-LEU under paragraph (8),       in coordination with the consortium established pursuant to       paragraph (6), develop a schedule for cost recovery of HA-LEU       made available to members of the consortium pursuant to       paragraph (8);        (8) may, beginning not later than 3 years after the       establishment of a consortium under paragraph (6), acquire       HA-LEU, in order, to the extent practicable, to make such HA-      LEU available to members of the consortium beginning not       later than January 1, 2025, in amounts that are consistent,       to the extent practicable, with the quantities estimated       under the surveys conducted under paragraph (4); and        (9) shall develop, in consultation with the Commission,       criticality benchmark data to assist the Commission in--        (A) the licensing and regulation of category II spent       nuclear material fuel fabrication and enrichment facilities       under part 70 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; and        (B) certification of transportation packages under part 71       of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations.

(2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means Department       of Energy.        (3) HA-LEU.--The term ``HA-LEU'' means high-assay low-      enriched uranium.        (4) High-assay low-enriched uranium.--The term ``high-assay       low-enriched uranium'' means uranium having an assay greater       than 5.0 percent and less than 20.0 percent enrichment of the       uranium-235 isotope.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Energy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nuclear power is a clean and efficient source of zero- emissions energy. Today, it generates approximately 20 percent of our  country's ``always-on, baseload'' electricity for our homes and  businesses.   Most nuclear reactors currently in use are very similar in nature and  operate on a fuel that is generally enriched below 5 percent. The next  generation of advanced reactors under development, however, vary in  size and operation, and they will require flexibility and efficiencies  from an advanced fuel. This fuel, known as high-assay, low-enriched  uranium, or HA-LEU, is enriched at higher levels than what is available  in the current commercial market.   The bipartisan Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act, which I  introduced with my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney), establishes a public-private partnership through the Energy  Department's Office of Nuclear Energy to support the availability of  HA-LEU for domestic commercial use.                                time  1230    A March 2017 survey of 18 advanced reactor developers based in the  United States found that the lack of availability of advanced fuels is  the foremost factor that would impede the development and deployment of  advanced reactor technologies.   Simply put, this bill would ensure that there is a supply of advanced  fuel available for domestic commercial industry purchase for the  advanced reactors of tomorrow.   Global energy demand will continue to increase, and emissions-free  nuclear power is the ultimate source to meet those needs for the next  generation of electricity. It is important to pass this bill to give  American innovators a competitive edge in designing and deploying the  reactors of tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. McNerney for working with me on this  issue, as well as committee leadership and staff for their assistance  in bringing this legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time  until my other colleagues arrive.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is simple. H.R. 6140 will set the stage for powering  electricity in the future in a green manner by allowing for the  development of those new-generation reactors, but we have to have the  fuel to do it. This bill, by working with my good friend Mr. McNerney  from California, does that.   This bill passed the subcommittee in the Committee on Energy and  Commerce by a unanimous voice vote. It also passed the full committee  by a voice vote. It is a bipartisan solution to address a real need to  generate electricity, always-on, baseload electricity, in a zero- emissions manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important  piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
