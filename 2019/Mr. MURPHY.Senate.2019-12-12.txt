 Mr. President, I am on the floor briefly today to remind  my colleagues to remind their constituents that December 15 is the open  enrollment deadline for healthcare at healthcare.gov. This is  incredibly important because if you are uninsured or you are currently  on an Affordable Care Act plan, if you don't renew or sign up by the  15th, you will be frozen out of the marketplace unless you have what is  called a qualifying event.   As we head back for the weekend, I want to ensure we do everything we  can to make sure there are aren't more people who go into the New Year  without insurance than absolutely necessary. This is especially  important because we have seen a big decline in the number of people  who have insurance in this country since President Trump took office.   Obviously, we made enormous progress after the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. We were able to get the percentage of Americans  without insurance down to around 5 percent. That is really  extraordinary. Yet we have seen that progress reverse. We have seen  more and more people go without insurance since this administration  started to wage what is a pretty consistent, remarkable war on the  Affordable Care Act.   As we speak today, the Trump administration is in court trying to get  the court system--the Federal court system--to strike down the entirety  of the Affordable Care Act. If they are successful in that endeavor,  then next year's deadline will not matter because the Affordable Care  Act will be gone; 20 million people will lose their health insurance;  insurers will once again be able to charge you more because you have a  preexisting condition or your kid has cancer or you are a woman.   As we fight that court case, we need to remember that the Affordable  Care Act is still out there and is still very affordable for millions  and millions of Americans. Seventy percent of enrollees who go on to  healthcare.gov find they qualify for financial help, meaning the  sticker price is not actually what you pay. The tax credits in  ObamaCare will help you get that premium lower.   In fact, on average, folks are getting pretty sizable premiums--in  the neighborhood of $500. That could make healthcare incredibly  affordable, even if the sticker price looks out of your range.   A woman in Hartford, named Deborah, visited a local enrollment fair  after receiving a letter saying her premiums actually might be going  up. She said this:         That scared me a little bit so I wanted to come in and have       someone explain it to me whether it was going to go up,       decrease, you know, what were my options. What ended up       happening is that actually my premium went down for the same       plan but I also learned that just because they renew you that       I had the opportunity to go in and say no, I don't want that       plan, I want to choose this plan. I am ecstatic with my new       plan. . . . I got educated on the insurance process and I       like that.    You can still get that help. You can still get somebody on the phone  to walk you through your choices. I really encourage people to do that  by this Sunday.   For folks who do find an affordable plan, I hope you will also step  up and try to help us maintain the protections and the coverages we  have. We have been fighting a battle with the Trump administration. It  doesn't like the Affordable Care Act simply because the President's  name is on it, despite the fact that Americans don't want the  Affordable Care Act repealed. But the administration has been doing  everything within its power to try to make it harder for people to sign  up. The administration has rolled back the advertising for the  Affordable Care Act.   This is what qualifies for advertising today--charts on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. The administration has rolled back the money for the  navigators--the people who help you pick which plan is right for you.  The administration, for a period of time, threatened to stop paying  insurance companies, which chilled the interest of insurers to actually  offer plans on these exchanges. As I mentioned, the administration is  going to court to try to unroll and unwind the entirety of the act  through a court case.   Lastly, though, what you will find, if you go and enroll in some  States, are plans that look like an Affordable Care Act plan on these  websites but actually aren't. They are what we call junk plans, short- term plans--plans that don't really cover anything. They might not  cover maternity care or addiction care or mental health or prescription  drugs. Some of these junk plans don't cover you if you get admitted  into the hospital on a Friday or Saturday.   Be careful of those plans because the sticker price is going to look  really low, but that is for a reason. It is because they don't cover  anything.   The President has allowed for those junk plans to be shown right next  to  [[Page S7015]]  the Affordable Care Act plan. Make sure you are signing up for a  regulated, Affordable Care Act plan. That is a plan that is bronze or  silver or gold, not one of these junk short-term plans that is not  going to be right for the vast majority of Americans.   It is not too late. Sunday is the deadline. If you are in  Connecticut, make sure to go to Access Health CT or your State  exchange, if your State runs an exchange. If not, you can get  healthcare through www.healthcare.gov.  I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
