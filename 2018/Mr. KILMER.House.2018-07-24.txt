 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, which  will allow our servicemembers to terminate their cable, satellite  television, and internet contracts once they receive orders to relocate  for more than 90 days.   Listen, we ask a lot of our military personnel and their families. I  know that because my district is home to so many veterans and Active- Duty servicemembers. I met with these amazing, talented men and women,  and they are so impressive. They step up and they sacrifice. They are  constantly being asked to uproot themselves and their families across  this country and all over the world, often on very short notice; and  when their country calls, the members of our Armed Forces drop  everything. They have our backs, and we should have their backs, too.   Deployed servicemembers and their families shouldn't have to worry  about bills piling up at home when they are gone because they are  locked into contracts for television and the internet. In the last few  days at home with their kids and spouses, they shouldn't have to spend  a second on hold or haggling with a customer service representative.   I am very proud to have worked across the aisle on this bill with  Representative Ryan Costello. Taking care of our military families is  an issue that all Americans, regardless of party, can stand behind, and  I want to express my gratitude to the chairman for his leadership on  those issues and Ranking Member Takano and others on that committee.   Listen, this bill will provide a small measure of relief to our  military members and to their families. It is the least we can do. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.
