 Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment  that my Republican colleagues are not making better use of our  legislative days in August. We could be working together to pass strong  bipartisan bills that secure our elections and punish foreign nations  and companies that hurt our national security. We could be working on  healthcare and protecting people with preexisting health conditions and  reducing the cost of prescription drugs. We could be working on  legislation to strengthen our Nation's guns laws. My colleague, Senator  Nelson, introduced emergency legislation to prevent the Trump  Administration from allowing 3-D gun plans to be posted on the  internet. We spoke on the floor and asked unanimous consent to have a  vote on his bill, and Republicans blocked that effort.   Instead, we are here, voting on Judge Quattlebaum's nomination to the  Fourth Circuit. Judge Quattlebaum was confirmed to his present seat, as  judge on the district court a mere 6 months earlier. Republicans think  it is more important to promote a novice judge than to work on  legislation to secure our elections, protect our national security, or  prevent dangerous people from accessing guns.   I urge Senator McConnell to reconsider the August legislative agenda  and bring substantive bills to the floor for a vote.  [[Page S5682]]
