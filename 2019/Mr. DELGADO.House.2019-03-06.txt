 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Medicare  Drug Price Negotiation Act, a bill that I am proud to cosponsor. This  bill is a critical step in expanding access to quality affordable  healthcare by bringing down prescription drug costs.   Too many of my constituents and too many Americans across this  country can't afford the healthcare coverage they need. There is no  bigger driver of this problem than the skyrocketing cost of  prescription drugs.   The United States pays the highest prices for prescription drugs in  the world, and over the past decade, the prices of 90 percent of brand  name drugs have more than doubled.   How is it that one in five American adults cannot afford the medicine  they need?   In the wealthiest country in the world, it is inexcusable that we  have seniors who have to choose between their prescriptions and buying  groceries, cancer patients who can't afford their drugs, and diabetics  who need to ration the insulin they need to survive.   The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act couldn't be more  commonsense. It allows the Department of Health and Human Services to  negotiate Medicare drug prices, putting consumers first, not the drug  industry.   My constituents sent me here with a clear mandate to fight for  quality affordable healthcare, and this bill is a crucial part of that  work.                            ____________________
