 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and career  of Dr. Dudley Flood, a recipient of North Carolina's highest civilian  award, the North Carolina Award for Public Service, for his  trailblazing leadership in desegregating our State's public schools.   Born in Winton, North Carolina, and a graduate of North Carolina's  Central University, Dr. Flood began his career as an educator teaching  grade school and eventually becoming a principal.   Following his teaching tenure, Dr. Flood joined the North Carolina  Department of Public Instruction, where he made a significant impact  during his 21 years of dedicated service. In the years following the  landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, Dr. Flood and the  late Gene Causby were tasked with facilitating the desegregation of  schools in all 100 counties in North Carolina.   In 1969, Dr. Flood and Mr. Causby began to travel across the State to  help desegregate North Carolina school systems. Beyond the assistance  they provided in navigating this challenging process, it was the visual  of these two men--one Black and one White--working closely together  that made a powerful impression on teachers and students alike.   Through his honorable work, Dr. Flood became a State hero and North  Carolina became a model for school desegregation. By working to ensure  that North Carolina is a place where all students can learn,  irrespective of race, Dr. Flood helped bring together starkly divided  communities and effectively ushered in a new era for public education  in our State.   Dr. Flood retired from public instruction in 1990. Since then, he has  served as executive director of the North Carolina Association of  School Administrators, taught as a visiting professor at multiple North  Carolina colleges and universities, and continued to be active in his  community, including with the Flood Group, a group of people who meet  from across the State.   Now, 90 years old, Dr. Flood has led an incredible career as a  champion for equitable education. Today, his achievements can be seen  in schools statewide as children of all races are able to learn and  play together and support each other's academic success.   As we begin celebrating Black History Month, I am honored to share  his extraordinary legacy with this body. He enhanced the lives of  hundreds of thousands North Carolinians through his example and his  achievements. The people of our State are forever grateful for his  remarkable life and lasting legacy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 900 and ask for its immediate consideration.

Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of February 1, 2022 may be postponed       through the legislative day of March 3, 2022.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.   Madam Speaker, in a moment I will ask to amend the rule to make a  technical correction regarding en bloc debate time.                        Amendment Offered By Ms. Ross     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the pending  resolution with an amendment that I have placed at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 900, providing for the consideration of three  measures: H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act, under a structured rule.  The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, makes in order six amendments, provides en bloc authority to  Chairman Meeks, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 4445, the Ending  Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, under a  structured rule. This rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary. It makes in order one amendment, and  provides for one motion to recommit. The rule also provides for  consideration of H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act, under a  structured rule. The rule provides 2 hours of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, makes in order 261  amendments, provides en bloc authority to Chairwoman Johnson, and  provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same day authority through April 1, 2022, and provides that  requested roll call votes on suspension bills considered on February 1,  2022, may be postponed through March 3, 2022.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the three bills we will  consider under this rule: H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act; H.R.  4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual  Harassment Act; and H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act.   H.R. 4521 will make historic investments to advance the production of  American-made semiconductors, tackle supply chain vulnerabilities, and  turbocharge America's scientific research and technological leadership.   Our Nation has long been a global leader in science and technology,  propelled by companies and universities like the ones in my district  that perform cutting-edge research every single day.   Maintaining this position requires significant investment and  cooperation across the government and private sector.   This bill will increase funding for the National Science Foundation.  It will support the work of the Department of Energy's Office of  Science in fighting climate change. It will empower the next generation  of STEM teachers, researchers, and scientists of all backgrounds.   Our legislation will also establish a new office at the Department of  Commerce charged with leading a government-wide effort to strengthen  supply chains, invest $52 billion to support American semiconductor  manufacturing, and bolster our domestic solar manufacturing capacity.   In addition, H.R. 4521 will reaffirm American leadership abroad by  reasserting our commitment to protect human rights and strengthen  international trade laws to protect American workers and businesses  from unfair trade practices.   I am proud to have led a number of bipartisan bills included in this  legislation that will fund research activities, facilitate public- private partnerships to grow clean energy technologies, and mandate the  development of a national science and technology strategy.   At a time when America faces unprecedented international competition,  H.R. 4521 will reinforce our Nation's global leadership in science,  technology, and innovation. I am thrilled we are bringing it to the  House floor.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4445. Too often in our  country today businesses use mandatory arbitration clauses to cover up  sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.   Forced arbitration has a chilling effect on the ability of survivors  to speak out, allowing businesses to take legal action against  employees simply for seeking justice that was not provided during the  arbitration process.   Last year, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from women  in a variety of disciplines who have faced persistent harassment and  abuse at their jobs. These women bravely recounted both the appalling  behavior they experienced and how forced arbitration kept them from  speaking out about their experiences and aiding others.   I am grateful to these women for their courage in shining a light on  this abuse. Unfortunately, countless other women in our country are  still silenced by mandatory arbitration.  [[Page H350]]    When mandatory arbitration processes are used to preserve the  reputations of companies, rather than to provide due process to  employees facing mistreatment, Congress has a duty to step in. I am  glad we are doing that by taking up this bill today.   Finally, I rise in support of H.R. 3485. Today, 68 countries, more  than one-third of the United Nation member states, still criminalize  same-sex relations. In nine countries, same-sex relations are  punishable by death. That is a human rights violation.   In the United States, freedom is the foundation of our democracy, and  the liberty to love whomever we choose without concern for retaliation  or violence is safeguarded by our Constitution.   Denying the right of entry to foreign nationals who violate the human  rights of LGBTQ people sends a clear message that hate has no home in  the United States.   It is time to pass all three of these bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Morelle), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), who is another distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Appropriations.  [[Page H355]]         Madam Speaker, I do have a few more minutes to share some  information about the America COMPETES Act. Then I would be prepared to  close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In addition to having the privilege of serving on the Rules  Committee, I also serve on the House Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology, which, as a freshman, I can tell you is probably the most  bipartisan place in this entire Congress. It is also a privilege to  represent the science and technology area of this country in the  Research Triangle Park.   I must share information about the work that the Science Committee  has done on this bill. The Science Committee bills included in the  America COMPETES Act are strongly bipartisan. Every one of these bills  either passed the House floor under suspension or passed through the  House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology favorably.   The House is ushering in a bold and prosperous future for American  science and innovation with a suite of bills, including the National  Science Foundation for the Future Act, the Department of Energy Science  for the Future Act, and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology for the Future Act.   The Science Committee provisions included in the America COMPETES Act  were built from the ground up with rigorous deliberation and input from  the scientific community, industry, and other stakeholders on what they  needed most to succeed in the 21st century. These provisions will  ensure that the United States is well equipped to compete globally in  science and innovation. These provisions will help build a strong and  diverse STEM workforce ready to address our greatest scientific and  societal challenges.   Our future prosperity depends on what we do now to nurture the STEM  talent in our country. From clean energy technologies to emissions  measurement, with the bold funding for science and innovation included  in these provisions, we will be able to address a climate crisis head- on. These provisions will strengthen American manufacturing, bolster  our national security, and enhance our semiconductor manufacturing  capabilities.   The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and  innovation. We must invest in our Nation's future, and now is the time.  The United States has endless potential to compete globally in science  and innovation. The America COMPETES Act provides the critical  resources and tools we need to achieve that, not just today but for the  next generation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to add to the comments that I made about  the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.   Our chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, will be retiring at the end of this  session. The contributions that she has made to this Congress and to  the State of Texas have been extraordinary.   I have an ``amen'' from our colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson) has been a model of civility  and bipartisanship on that committee. This bill, the America COMPETES  Act, will just be a crown jewel in her legacy.   Madam Speaker, now is the time for Congress to take comprehensive  action to strengthen our supply chain, support American manufacturing,  and invest in innovation and scientific research. H.R. 4521 will  accomplish these goals, bolster American semiconductor  manufacturing, advance clean energy technology, and reaffirm our  leadership on the global stage. Our workers, businesses, research  institutions, and constituents are depending on us to pass the America  COMPETES Act.    Madam Speaker, we also must pass H.R. 4445. As long as forced  arbitration remains an option, businesses will be able to abuse this  mechanism to put profits over people and silence survivors of sexual  assault and harassment.   Our laws should end practices that enable the abuse of working women.  Ending mandatory arbitration for sexual harassment and assault is a  just way to put an end to one of these practices.   Finally, we must pass H.R. 3485. Our support of LGBTQ rights must not  stop at our border. The global LGBTQ community deserves the full  support of American diplomacy.   The Global Respect Act enshrines our commitment to equality in our  foreign policy, and I am proud to support this bill.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 900         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R.  [[Page H356]]       6184) to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to       the scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6184.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution, as amended.
