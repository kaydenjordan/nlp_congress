 Madam Speaker, earlier this morning,  the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition hosted a hearing to  examine SNAP technology and modernization.   SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was formerly  known as food stamps. The Agriculture Committee has conducted a  thorough review of SNAP over the past 30 months.   This program is critically important to 42 million Americans who  utilize it each month. It is the largest domestic hunger safety net  program in the country, and it is imperative that it remains viable so  we can continue to serve so many who are struggling. That is why, at  today's hearing, we discussed technology and modernization  [[Page H4803]]  of SNAP, including areas to enhance program integrity, streamline  delivery of services, improve the customer experience, and ease  administrative burdens.   In just 2004, EBT, or electronic benefit transfer, was completed.  This is the electronic system that allows a recipient to authorize  transfer of their supplemental benefits to a retailer to pay for  products. This was a tremendous step forward toward improving the  program.   As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I look forward to  continuing to improve the efficiency of SNAP.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend  from Pennsylvania, Representative Smucker--he is doing a great job  representing his congressional district and being a strong voice for  Pennsylvania--for hosting this important Special Order tonight focused  on career and technical education.   I appreciate my good friend, Representative Krishnamoorthi, who is  with me and is leading the charge with the piece of legislation that I  hope we will see on the House floor in the weeks to come.   As co-chair of the House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I  often say that a high quality career in technical education can help  restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. Now, this statement is one  I truly believe in.   For many Americans, those rungs have been displaced for different  reasons, whether it is training that they have had, access to training,  access to quality, effective training; whether it has been poverty;  whether it has been unemployment, underemployment, all things that take  away rungs on the ladder of opportunity, this career and technical  education can truly restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity.   It is undeniable that career and technological education has helped  many Americans obtain the knowledge and skills they need to break the  cycle of poverty and achieve a lifetime of success.   The first step to increasing access to CTE programs, as we refer to  them, across the United States is modernizing the Federal investment in  these programs, and it has been more than a decade since Congress has  updated the Federal law governing CTE programs. This is problematic,  due to the fact that so much about our society and our Nation's  workforce has changed during this time. Since the last time the Perkins  Act was reauthorized, we have new skill sets, new jobs, new industry,  new opportunities, new technology.   So, for example, today, more than 1 million positions remain open in  the trade, transportation, utility sectors, and an additional 315,000  manufacturing positions are currently unfilled. If we are to embark on  a new era of American manufacturing and improved infrastructure, we  need a qualified and well trained workforce to fill these positions.  That is the number one asset of any business. It is not the location;  it is not the compliance; it is not the marketing. It really is a  qualified and trained workforce.   With all this in mind, I have worked with my colleagues in  introducing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the  21st Century Act  [[Page H4806]]  once again this Congress. Last Congress, this bill did pass unanimously  out of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and was  widely supported on the House floor by a vote of 405-5. Unfortunately,  things bogged down in the Senate, with a lot of good legislation at the  end of the last congressional cycle, and so here we are again, which is  okay, because we have taken the opportunity to make this just a little  bit better, too. We had some small refinements, but some improvements.  We used our time effectively.    Now, this robust reauthorization of the Perkins Act will help ensure  that Federal policies accurately reflect the challenges and realities  facing today's students, workers, and employers. Additionally, the bill  supports innovative learning opportunities and stronger engagements  with employers. By promoting work-based learning at the Federal level,  more employers will build relationships with students through hands-on  experience. This type of learning is invaluable to students with a wide  range of interests and learning styles.   I am proud to see this bill pass out of the committee unanimously  once again last month. I am looking forward to its consideration on the  House floor and in the Senate in the future.   Now, if we are serious about improving our Nation's workforce and  providing greater opportunities for all Americans, we will work  together to move this bill through the legislative process. After all,  this new bill, as I have said before, does restore rungs on the ladder  of opportunity.   The impact of increasing access and quality of career and technical  education is far-reaching. Take, for example, maybe a 15-year-old girl  who when in school was uninspired, her head is on her desk. She doesn't  learn in the typical way that many of us do, where people talk at you  and teach, but if you can put something in her hands, the tools of  career and technical education, that could be a welder, a set of  wrenches, it could be a paint brush, it could be a stethoscope, farm  implements, she is inspired, and she does great, she excels.   I just heard about a young boy today, who is a young man now, but as  a young boy was on the spectrum scale, he had some issues of autism. I  was so inspired to hear this today. This young man went into career and  technical education as a welder. And today, he is making a significant  amount of money, more than what his teacher was making, right out of  high school, as a welder because of what career and technical education  did.   The young couple facing unemployment and underemployment who is at  the kitchen table trying to decide how to make ends meet, and this is  an opportunity to get back into the workforce. The middle-aged worker  who has been working the line manufacturing who would like a promotion,  do a little better by his family, bring more money home, it provides  and serves that person. The family who is stuck in poverty maybe for  generations, stuck in poverty so long, they don't even remember what  was the incident that put them into poverty generations ago, but this  is a way to break that cycle of poverty.   And certainly the successful business owner, who is doing all the  right things, and she is invested in her business and has grown the  business and has a great product and a great location and a great  marketing plan, great compliance plan, because of regulation issues,  but she is closing her business, because, Madam Speaker, she can't find  qualified and trained workers to keep that business going, let alone  grow it. These are all examples of folks who will benefit from this.   I really want to thank my colleagues for their enthusiastic support  of career and technical education. On a day when I know there are other  places where there are pressures to be this evening, you are right here  on the House floor and leading the cause for career and technical  education, and I am very thankful for that. Once again, thanks to  Representative Smucker for his leadership and tonight's Special Order.
