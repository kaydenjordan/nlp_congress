 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Monday evening, reports came out that  Rupert Murdoch, owner of FOX News, acknowledged in a deposition that  hosts of the network promoted the false narrative that Donald Trump won  the 2020 election.   Asked if he could have stepped in to prevent this, Mr. Murdoch  acknowledged that he could have but chose not to--he could have stepped  in but chose not to--and expressed regret for not doing so.   To this day, several FOX News hosts continue promoting the Big Lie.  They keep spreading the Big Lie despite mounting evidence that, behind  the scenes, many top hosts and executives at FOX have recognized that  the stolen election narrative is entirely bogus. Nevertheless, they  continue broadcasting it all the time.   This morning, Leader Jeffries and I wrote a letter to Mr. Murdoch  demanding that he do what he should have done a long time ago: Order  Tucker Carlson and other hosts on FOX News to stop spreading lies about  the election. They need to stop giving a platform to dangerous and  entirely unfounded conspiracy theories that eat at the wellspring of  our democracy, and they need to admit on the air that they were wrong  to engage in such negligent and destructive behavior.   Sadly, too much damage has already been done to our democracy. A  significant segment of voters--by some measures, as much as 30 percent  of the electorate--still do not believe that the 2020 election was  legitimate. What FOX News hosts have done is flat-out dangerous-- dangerous. When people doubt that elections are on the level, that is  the beginning of the end of this wonderful democracy because elections  are our wellspring. They are the core of what the Founding Fathers set  up. It was the great novelty of the Constitution that has spread around  the world.   When conspiracy theories like the Big Lie are allowed to grow,  violence can ensue, as we all saw for ourselves on January 6.   Mr. Murdoch's testimony is all the more alarming after Speaker  McCarthy is reportedly allowing Tucker Carlson to review highly  sensitive security camera footage of the events surrounding the violent  January 6 insurrection. Sharing that footage is a grave mistake that  risks emboldening the supporters of the Big Lie.   Mr. Murdoch, FOX News executives, and hosts all have a choice--a very  important choice: They can continue broadcasting lies about our  elections and further erode trust in our democracy or they can admit  their mistake, start telling the truth, and move beyond this shameful  chapter in their company's history by coming clean with their viewers  and with the American people. We hope Mr. Murdoch  [[Page S541]]  heeds our call. The survival of our democracy is too important.                          Railway Safety Act of 2023    Mr. President, on the new bipartisan bill, later today, a bipartisan  group of Senators, including Senators Brown and Vance of Ohio and  Fetterman and Casey of Pennsylvania--a bipartisan group--plan to  introduce the Railway Safety Act of 2023.   In the aftermath of the terrible accident in East Palestine, this is  precisely the kind of proposal we need to see in Congress--a bipartisan  rail safety bill, one that includes provisions relevant to the accident  that happened a month ago.   I salute them for this fine bipartisan effort and commit to them that  I am going to work with the sponsors of the bill to move this bill  forward. We should pass it--a bipartisan bill--here in the Senate and  hopefully in the House. I will do whatever I can to make sure that  happens.   The bill is as smart as it is necessary. It includes provisions to  increase safety protocols for trains with hazardous materials, new  requirements for crews operating trains, and increases the fines that  can be imposed on rail companies that engage in reckless behavior.   We must do more because an accident like the one in East Palestine  didn't come out of the blue. On the contrary, the Chair of the NTSB  said the Norfolk Southern derailment was 100 percent preventable. The  fault here lies with rail companies that spent years lobbying to slash  crucial safety regulations intended to keep people safe. It has created  a dangerous culture where the profit motive is king above all others,  even above the need to keep people safe.   There are countless small towns just like East Palestine across  America with rail lines running through them. In my dear State of New  York, there are lots of them, particularly in Upstate. They are all at  greater risk when rail giants work together to slash safety, slash  worker compensation, and place shareholder returns above everything  else.    Republicans have been trying mightily to turn ESG into  their newest dirty little acronym. They are using the same tired  attacks we have heard for a while now--that this is more wokeness, that  it is intrusion into the markets, and on and on and on.   But Republicans are missing or ignoring an important point: Nothing  in the DOL rule imposes a mandate.   Again, let me repeat that: Nothing in the rule they seek to undo  imposes a mandate.   It merely says that if fiduciaries wish to look at ESG factors and if  their methods are shown to be prudent--it is a very narrow rule--then  they have the freedom to do so--the freedom to do so. It is literally  allowing the free market to do its work.   This isn't about ideological preference. It is about looking at the  biggest picture possible for investors to minimize risk and maximize  returns.   Why shouldn't you look at the risks posed by increasingly volatile  climate incidents? Why shouldn't they consider aging populations or  other trends that could impact their portfolio?   In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies already publish  ESG reports today.   The present rule gives investment managers an option. The Republican  rule, on the other hand, ties investors' hands--no freedom for  companies to choose what they think is right.   Republicans talk about their love of the free market, small  government, ``let the private sector do its work,'' but their obsession  with eliminating ESG would do the opposite, forcing their own views  down the throats of every company and every investor.   I say: Let the market work. Let the market work. Mr. and Mrs. Free  Market Republicans, what the heck are you doing here? Imposing your  views on these companies?   If the market naturally leads to the consideration of ESG factors,  then Republicans should practice what they have long preached and get  out of the way.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have to admit I come to the floor sort  of confounded. For a long time, my Republican friends prided  themselves--prided themselves--for being the party of free markets, the  party of small government, the party opposed to injecting political  ideology into the decisions of private investors and managers and  companies. But apparently all that was talk because, today, our  Republican friends are making an effort to limit free market choice and  inject hard-right ideology into private sector decision making.  Republicans are attempting to force corporations and managers, against  their will, to turn back the clock 50 years, even if it means getting a  lower return on investment--even if it means getting a lower return on  investment.   Now, the facts here are not difficult. The Department of Labor  recently introduced a rule recognizing that retirement fiduciaries may  consider ESG factors when making investment decisions. The Republican  proposal, meanwhile, wants to undo that rule, and, across the country,  Republican State legislators are trying to punish managers who dare  consider, on their own volition, ESG.   Note, Mr. President, that I said ``may''--not ``must''--when  describing the rule because the rule that the DOL has put in effect is  completely optional. Let me repeat that. The DOL  [[Page S556]]  rule is completely optional while the Republican measure is a mandate.  In fact, the current rule goes out of its way to make sure that  decision making remains solely in the hands of the fiduciary. Nothing  changes the fact that investment decisions must be shown to be prudent  above all else.   Now, the hard right has made a lot of noise trying to make ESG their  dirty little acronym. They say this is about wokeness, that this is a  cult, that it is some grave intrusion into finance. It is the same  predictable, uncreative, unproductive attacks they use for anything  they don't like.   But this isn't about ideological preference. ESG is about looking at  the biggest picture possible so the investors can make decisions that  decrease risk while increasing returns. In fact, more than 90 percent  of S&P companies already publish ESG reports today. So none of this is  new. It has been a long-established practice, one that Republicans  suddenly say they don't like and want to forbid.   But why shouldn't managers evaluate the risks posed by an  increasingly volatile climate if they deem it helps them get a return  on their investment? Why shouldn't they consider the consequences of an  aging population or other trends that could impact their portfolio? And  even a better question is this: Why are Republicans going out of their  way to prohibit investors from making the best possible choices as they  manage their funds? Why are Republicans trying to forbid investors from  considering climate and other factors if they believe it would help  them get a better return?   The bottom line is this: The present rule gives investment managers  an option. The Republican rule, on the other hand, ties investors'  hands. Republicans talk about their love of the free market, small  government, letting the private sector do its work, but their obsession  with eliminating ESG would do the opposite, forcing their own views  down the throats of every company and investor. The Republican  amendment, again, would force their own views down the throats of every  company and investor.   You know what we say on this side? Let the market work. If that  naturally leads to consideration of ESG factors, then Republicans  should practice what they have long preached and get out of the way.   I thank my Democratic colleagues who are joining us in opposition to  this measure.   I yield the floor and call the question.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  notices of issuance of final regulations from the Office of  Congressional Workplace Rights be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              ____________________
