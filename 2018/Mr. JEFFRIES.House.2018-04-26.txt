 Mr. Speaker, the American people face a clear choice  about the way forward: the Republican raw deal or the Democratic better  deal.   House Republicans want to take away healthcare from more than 23  million Americans--raw deal; Democrats want to strengthen the  Affordable Care Act and dramatically lower the cost of prescription  drugs--better deal.   House Republicans have a fake infrastructure plan that will do  nothing to repair our Nation's crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels-- raw deal; Democrats have a real infrastructure plan that would invest  $1 trillion and create 16 million good-paying jobs--better deal.   House Republicans passed a tax scam where 83 percent of the benefits  went to the wealthiest 1 percent in America simply to subsidize the  lifestyles of the rich and shameless--raw deal; Democrats want a  permanent tax cut for working families so we can put more money into  the pockets of everyday Americans--better deal.   House Republicans want to cut more than $2 trillion from Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--raw deal; Democrats want to  strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so that senior  citizens from throughout the land can live out their golden years with  grace and dignity. That is A Better Deal.   House Republicans are all about chaos, crisis, and confusion;  Democrats are working to deliver better jobs, better wages, and a  better future.   The American people deserve A Better Deal.                            ____________________
