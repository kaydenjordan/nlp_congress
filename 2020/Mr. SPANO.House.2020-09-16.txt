 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Army combat veteran and medic  Sergeant Kari Padilla.   Sergeant Padilla honorably served our Nation from 2005 to 2013 with  tours  [[Page H4476]]  in Iraq and Germany and helped establish a vital aviation field  hospital supporting Middle East and Afghanistan deployments.   Though no longer in uniform, she continues to serve, having been the  community outreach coordinator for the Post 9/11 Veterans Corps the  past 4 years. In this capacity, she increased Veterans Corps  participation by 35 percent annually and their social media following  by 4,000 percent. It is this level of dedication and excellence that  exemplifies her concern for other servicemembers.   More recently, Ms. Padilla was named president of the 9/11 Veterans  Corps, a well-deserved recognition. I know she will do an amazing job  in this capacity and build upon her past successes.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot thank her enough for her service, passion, and  dedication. She continues to make the 15th District in our country a  better place to live, work, and play.   Kari, you represent the best our Nation has to offer and, today, I  salute you for your many sacrifices.                            ____________________
