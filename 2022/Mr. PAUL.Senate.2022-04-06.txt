 Mr. President, while it is not possible to  specifically recognize every Vietnam veteran who honorably served our  Nation, each time we celebrate one, we also focus our attention on  thousands of others, many of whom lost their lives decades ago.   Today, I want to honor David Michael Thomas, who followed in the  footsteps of his own father, Glenn Elmore Thomas, a personal bodyguard  for Dwight D. Eisenhower, and joined the U.S. Army in 1970. Specialist  Thomas was stationed outside the Tan Son Nhut Air Field with the 519th  Military Intelligence Battalion, 525th Military Intelligence Group for  2 years. He received the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam  Service Medal with 2 Stars, Vietnam Campaign Medal with 60 Device,  Meritorious Unit Citation, and the Army Commendation Medal.   Upon his return from Vietnam, he graduated from Western Kentucky  University in my hometown of Bowling Green and, most notably, met his  future wife, Julia Kirk at the Baptist Student Union. Together, they  embarked on his 40 years of pastoral ministry in seven different  States, finally retiring back in our community. He and Julia are  blessed with four children and a host of grandchildren and great- grandchildren.   His legacy of serving others, first in the Armed Services and then in  pastoral ministry, continues in a unique way with which I have a  personal connection. His daughter, Amy Bee, is a constituent service  representative in my office in Bowling Green. She is one of the many  talented staff members  [[Page S2038]]  who help Kentuckians navigate the highly complex problems that they are  experiencing with Federal agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service,  or the Veterans Administration. Men and women who have exhausted every  avenue of their own resources count on professionals like Amy--and her  talented colleagues--to resolve their issues in a timely way. It is a  unique and highly demanding form of service and reflects the values  modeled by Amy's father and grandfather.   Later this month, David Thomas--and a plane full of fellow veterans-- will come to Washington with an Honor Flight Bluegrass excursion. Each  one of these veterans has his or her own story to tell, and by sharing  a glimpse into the life of David Thomas, we salute them all.                            ____________________
