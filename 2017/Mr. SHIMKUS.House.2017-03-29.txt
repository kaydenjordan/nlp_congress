 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Robert  Dillingham who led us in the opening prayer. He is a pastor in the  Illinois Great Rivers Conference of the United Methodist Church where  he serves Farina, Illinois.   Reverend Dillingham is both a chaplain and a volunteer firefighter  with the Farina Fire Department and is also a chaplain with the Mutual  Aid Box Alarm System, division 54. He serves as a hospice chaplain with  the Hospital Sisters Health Systems through St. Anthony's Memorial  Hospital in Effingham, Illinois, where he serves patients from over 20  counties in the central part of my congressional district.   In addition to his service as chaplain, Reverend Dillingham is also  on the board of the Farina food pantry and is a clergy care guide,  where he is a pastoral presence in the lives of over 70 pastors.   It is my honor to welcome Reverend Dillingham and his wife, Ashley,  who is in the gallery today, and personally thank him for offering this  morning's prayer.                            ____________________
