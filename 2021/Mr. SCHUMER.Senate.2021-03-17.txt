 Mr. President, in a second, I will move the PPP bill to  the floor. I hope--and I ask our Republican colleagues to cooperate-- that we can move this bipartisan PPP proposal without delay. It passed  the House overwhelmingly. A vast majority of Democrats and Republicans  voted for it. I hope we can move it quickly here in the Senate as it  expires on March 31, and there are some changes that were made in the  ARP that people need time to adapt to and implement. To allow a lapse  would not be the right thing to do for so many of our small business  people across the country. So I am hoping that our Republican  colleagues will move the bill with the same alacrity with which it  passed in the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority. I think  there were fewer than 10 votes against it.                            ____________________     With that, Mr. President, I understand that there is a  bill at the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, now let me proceed to my remarks.   First, on the terrible tragedy in Georgia, the people of Atlanta, GA,  and the surrounding communities were just shocked last night by a  series of shootings that left eight people dead, six of whom were of  Asian descent.   The motivations behind this devastating tragedy are still unknown,  but there is a legitimate concern that these killings may have been  racially motivated. Over the past year, the Asian-American community  has faced a rising tide of abuse and violence in the wake of COVID-19,  driven by ignorance, by misinformation, and by age-old prejudices  against the Asian-American community. Tragically, hate crimes against  Asian Americans have skyrocketed.   There is bigotry in the land and far too much of it. These dark  forces have always existed in America, but, recently, they seem to have  been unleashed. The sort of superego that puts  [[Page S1578]]  these things down seems to have weakened, and the id seems to have  strengthened.   We cannot lose for a moment our vigilance against these forces of  hate, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination.   I love the Asian American community. They have done so much for  America. I see it in my borough of Brooklyn, in my city and State of  New York, and throughout the country--hard-working people, people who  do so much for our country at every level. They are welcome here. That  is America. Yet, bigots have increased hate crimes and maybe even  possibly led to the deaths of these people.   So I hope that all Americans first will realize that there is too  much hate in the land, that hate against one group is hate against any  group, and we should all, Americans of every background and race and  creed, color, and religion, gender, and sexual orientation, band  together against the haters. It is so un-American.   E pluribus unum--out of many, one. That is what America has always  been. That is what America must continue to be, and our voices must  speak out.                            ____________________     Second, on nominations, the Senate is once again making  excellent progress this week confirming President Biden's nominees. We  began the week by confirming a history-making Cabinet member, Interior  Secretary Haaland. Yesterday, we confirmed Isabel Guzman as the SBA  Administrator. Today, we will confirm another consequential  administrative appointment, the U.S. Trade Representative.   President Biden has named Katherine Tai, the daughter of proud  immigrants from Taiwan, a veteran of the Office of the Trade  Representative under President Obama, and one of our country's most  seasoned experts in international trade. That--Ms. Tai--is what America  is all about.   We welcome her. We give her a great position of authority because of  her expertise. And maybe--you know, I will leave it at that. It is a  great contrast to the tragedy I was talking about a few minutes ago and  the ascension of another proud American of Asian ancestry here.   As U.S. Trade Representative, Ms. Tai will play a crucial role in  enforcing existing trade deals and making sure that American workers,  businesses, and researchers can compete on a level playing field. She  will be an essential player in restoring America's credibility with our  trading partners and promoting international cooperation to tackle some  of the world's biggest problems, from the global pandemic to climate  change.   I have not a single doubt that Ms. Tai is the right person for the  job, and I look forward to the Senate giving her a well-deserved  promotion later today                            ____________________     Now on S. 1, democracy reform, today Senate Democrats  are introducing the No. 1 bill of the 117th Congress, S. 1, to stand up  to voter suppression, end dark money in politics, and reinvigorate  American democracy in the 21st century.   Make no mistake, democracy reform must be a top priority of this  Congress, and I will put S. 1, the For the People Act, on the floor of  the Senate.   For too long, we have let really important parts of our democracy  wither. Unlimited dark money flows into campaigns. Special interests  have way too much influence in Washington. And worst of all, there is a  concerted, nationwide effort to limit the right of American citizens,  particularly people of color, to vote.   Throughout America's history, we have seen a continuous cycle of  expansions in our democracy being met all too often by vehement  backlash from those who wish to maintain an exclusionary status quo.   Earlier this year, we witnessed only the latest example in the form  of a violent insurrection right here in this Chamber, right here in  this Capitol, an attack fueled by the insidious lies of the former  President aimed at overturning the results of a free and fair election.   In the wake of the November election, one of the safest and most  secure in American history, dozens of Republican-led State legislatures  have seized on the former President's big lie and introduced hundreds  of bills aimed at tightening voting rules under the nasty guise--the  nasty, malicious, and false guise--of election integrity. These bills,  sadly, are aimed at Americans of color--Black Americans, Latinos,  Native Americans.   Despicable efforts to target these historically disenfranchised  communities have become a central component of the electoral strategy  of one of America's major political parties. Shame on them. Shame. It  is infuriating. Infuriating. When you lose an election, you are  supposed to win over the people you lost, not stop them from voting.  That is un-American, autocratic, and against the fundamentals of our  democracy, but this is happening in States all across the country--all  across the country.   Maybe the most reprehensible effort is underway in Georgia, where  State Republicans are trying to limit absentee and mail-in voting, make  it harder to post a ballot by drop box, and disallowing early voting on  Sunday, a day when many churchgoing African Americans participate in  voter drives. Does anyone on the other side of the aisle think taking  away Sunday voting in Georgia is not bigoted? What is the rationale?  Stop it, if you want to stand for equality and justice.   Our country has supposedly come a long way since African Americans in  the South were forced to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar in  order to vote. But some of these voter suppression laws in Georgia and  other Republican States smack of Jim Crow in the 21st century rearing  its ugly head once again.   These laws and their various cousins in Republican State legislatures  across the country are collectively one of the greatest threats to  modern American democracy. According to a recent report in the  Washington Post, these laws could strain every available method of  voting for tens of millions of Americans, potentially amounting to the  most sweeping contraction of ballot access in the United States since  the end of Reconstruction, when Southern States curtailed the voting  rights of formerly enslaved Black men.   If one party believes ``heads we win; tails you cheated''; if one  political party believes that when you lose an election, the answer  isn't to win more votes but, rather, to prevent the other side from  voting, then we have serious and existential threats to our democracy  on our hands.   This is no political dispute. It goes way beyond that to the core-- the core--of what America is all about. That is why we need S. 1 so  badly, a bill that would combat all of these voter suppression efforts  by restoring critical parts of the Voting Rights Act; a bill that would  make it easier, not harder, to vote by automatically registering  American voters when they get a driver's license; a bill that would  limit dark money and corruption in our politics and much more.   There are a lot of problems in our country--healthcare and climate  change and income inequality--but we designed a democracy that would  allow competing interests in our country to come together and agree on  solutions. If our democracy doesn't work, we have no hope of solving  any of our other problems.   S. 1 is going to be a top priority this Congress. We will fight and  fight and fight to get this done legislatively. Failure is not an  option. Too darn much is at stake                            ____________________     Now on the American Rescue Plan, I would like to  continue shining a spotlight on different aspects of ARP. The  legislation helped so many people and so much of the country, it is  easy to forget many crucial parts of the bill. So later today, I will  be joining my dear friend Representative Velazquez from New York to  talk about how the American Rescue Plan helps Puerto Rico, which is too  often an afterthought in Federal legislation.   The American Rescue Plan will do three historic things for the people  of Puerto Rico, American citizens all.   First, it will deliver Federal dollars to the island's earned income  tax credit for low-wage workers for the first time ever.  [[Page S1579]]    Second, it will expand eligibility for residents to claim the child  tax credit. Prior to the ARP, only families with three or more children  in Puerto Rico could claim the child tax credit. Why those American  citizens were treated differently than all the others was beyond me and  strikes me as nasty. But now every family can.   Third, the ARP bill will add $1 billion--$1 billion--in food  assistance. Residents of American territories don't receive traditional  food assistance programs like those in the United States, such as the  SNAP program, but instead their governments receive block grants that  have been capped by the Federal Government.   The American Rescue Plan makes sure that Puerto Rico, which suffers  devastating rates of poverty, 43 percent, and especially childhood  poverty--an unacceptable 57 percent of all the children in Puerto Rico  live in poverty. So we want to make sure that Puerto Rico receives its  fair share of Federal food assistance.   The American Rescue Plan may be the greatest anti-poverty effort in a  generation, and we make sure that Puerto Rico is part of it.   Now let me turn my attention to schools. One of most enduring images  of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the empty classroom. For 12 months,  teachers have done their level best to keep their students engaged with  remote learning, but there have been incredible difficulties. Too many  students don't have reliable internet. Too many parents can't be there  to help young kids log on and keep up with their work. Simply put,  there is no replacement for having kids in the classroom. We need to  get our schools to reopen as quickly and as safely as possible.   Now, my Republican colleagues have made a lot of noise about  reopening our schools, but they don't want to dedicate any resources to  actually getting it done. We need money to do this. There are many more  expenses under COVID.   Through the American Rescue Plan, Senate Democrats delivered the  single largest investment in American education ever. We are proud of  that. Proud. Let me say it again. Through the American Rescue Plan,  Senate Democrats delivered the single largest investment in American  education ever--ever--$170 billion to repair the damage caused by this  pandemic, three-quarters of which will go directly to K-12 education,  prioritizing school districts that need it the most. This will help  schools update ventilation, hire more nurses and janitors, make  classroom sizes smaller, and make getting kids to and from school safe.   In short, the American Rescue Plan will greatly accelerate the safe  and effective reopening of schools. Once kids are back in the  classroom, the American Rescue Plan will help make sure they can stay  there and succeed. After what has been a lost year for too many  students, this bill provides significant support for learning recovery  programs--afterschool programs, summer school programs, and other  resources to help kids catch up and get back on track.   Through the American Rescue Plan, we have made a life-changing  investment in our students. It is one of the many ways this bill will  help us recover from the crisis and come back stronger than ever  before.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
