 Mr. Speaker, this week Republicans plan to  vote on TrumpCare to push 24 million Americans off healthcare coverage  and saddle families across the country with massive health costs.  TrumpCare is an assault on families and a broken promise to the  American people.   Twenty-four million people will lose their health insurance. It will  terminate the assistance that people depend on to afford quality  coverage. It will destroy the Medicaid program, the bedrock of our  social safety net for more than 50 years.   Medicaid covers 74 million children, pregnant women, people with  disabilities, and seniors with long-term care needs. Under TrumpCare,  deductibles and out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket and families will be  exposed to crushing health costs. Premiums will rise dramatically-- particularly, for older Americans--because TrumpCare allows insurance  companies to charge five times higher than what others pay for the  average, five times higher for our near senior citizens. This means  thousands and thousands of dollars more in premiums, which low-income  seniors cannot afford.   TrumpCare shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and  cuts $880 billion from Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible bill, and it puts the entire  healthcare system at risk.                            ____________________
