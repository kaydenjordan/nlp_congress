 Mr. Chair, during Roll Call votes on amendments to  H.R. 5961, two of my votes were not recorded correctly. On Ogles No. 8,  I intended to vote ``aye''. On Porter No. 10, I intended to vote  ``aye''. Had my vote been recorded correctly, I would have voted  ``aye'' on rollcall No. 683 and ``aye'' on rollcall No. 685.             Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Jackson of Illinois
