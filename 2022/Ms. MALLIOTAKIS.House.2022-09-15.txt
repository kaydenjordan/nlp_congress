 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of my constituent, Leon Wallace, who recently passed away at the  age of 85, and to share with the Nation his contributions to our  community and country.   Leon was a native Staten Islander who grew up in West Brighton and  Mariners Harbor, attended P.S. 18, and graduated from McKee High School  in 1956.   Leon enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where he served as a jet mechanic  while stationed in Guam and later returned to service with the Army  National Guard's 117th Calvary. He put his life on the line for our  country at a time when our country did not afford him equal rights as  an African American. That shows you how truly special he was.   Not only was Leon a dedicated member of our military but he was a  steward of outstanding service to our community. After his time in the  Air Force, Leon dedicated his time to helping individuals with  developmental disabilities and their families. He was also a member of  the NAACP, USIVO, and the 369th Veterans Association, as well as St.  Philips Baptist Church, and recently, even completed the New York State  chaplains' course to minister to other vets in need.   To many across our community, he was referred to as Uncle Leon. He  was well-known for his uplifting sayings and positive perspective.  Whenever you asked him how he was doing, he would smile and say, ``I am  too blessed to be stressed.''   I was proud to call Leon a friend. This is our last photo together  from June. I know I speak for so many in our community when I say that  his presence will be missed.                            ____________________
