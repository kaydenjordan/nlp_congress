 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing the Hardin High School Marching Band for being selected to  represent Montana at the 2020 Independence Day Parade in Washington,  DC.   Countless hours of practice, dedication, and hard work earned these  young musicians this prestigious honor, and I am proud they are  representing the Treasure State on the national stage.   While making their way to Washington, DC, these students will have  the opportunity to travel on a 10-day journey across the country before  reaching the Nation's Capital. They will get to experience some of  America's national attractions like Mount Rushmore, Wrigley Stadium,  and the National Football Hall of Fame. The memories these young  leaders will make on this trip will last them a lifetime.   It is my honor to recognize the Hardin High School Marching Band.  Their talent and musical ability is a testament to the quality of the  music education programs we have in Big Sky Country. I know that they  will make all of Montana proud.                            ____________________
