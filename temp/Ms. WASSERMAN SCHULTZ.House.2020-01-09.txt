 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in full, enthusiastic support for this legislation which is  long overdue. For decades, chemical corporations like 3M and DuPont  knowingly manufactured products containing forever-toxic chemicals  known as PFAS.   Our Federal Government has confirmed that PFAS can adversely affect  growth and learning in children, lower a women's chance of getting  pregnant, increase cholesterol, hinder the immune system, interfere  with hormone regulation, and even increase the risk of cancer.   As a cancer survivor myself, and as chairwoman of the Appropriations  Committee Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, I find it unconscionable that I have veterans coming to  me to complain that their families are dying due to the Department of  Defense's decades-long use of these chemicals.   As a member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, I have told 3M and  DuPont to their faces that I don't know how they sleep at night. They  poisoned our water and contaminated the bloodstream of millions of  people all for profit.   It is past time that the Federal Government step up and do something  about it, and we do that here today. I commend Congresswoman Dingell  for her work and so many of my colleagues who have fought so far and so  long, including the chairman.
