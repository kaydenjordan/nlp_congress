 Madam Speaker, the attempted insurrection of our  government on January 6 last year is a stain that will forever live on  our country, but equally dirty were the other attempts to illegally  overturn our November 2020 elections, including the shady Trump  campaign efforts to place false electors in seven States, including my  home State of Wisconsin.   Violent attacks on Capitol Police and breaking into the U.S. Capitol  are very visual scenes of the illegal schemes, but we cannot let the  more stealthy, yet very strategic, plots of trying to place illegal  electors to overturn the will of the voters in swing States go by  unnoticed or unpunished.   Just yesterday The New York Times released a memo by the Trump  campaign written a month and a half prior to January 6 setting up the  case to install false electors in Wisconsin and six other States.   The problem with these schemes was it also needed complicity from  then-Vice President Mike Pence, who chose his country over his party  and didn't illegally overturn the election as the Trump campaign  wanted.   Those involved with this illegal attack on our Republic should be  investigated and held accountable by both the January 6th Select  Committee as well as the U.S. Department of Justice. Forged documents,  false claims, and other illegal actions are crimes and are no different  than the violent attack on the Capitol Building itself. And for that,  our Nation deserves justice.                            ____________________
