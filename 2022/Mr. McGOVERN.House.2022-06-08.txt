 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1153 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1153         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2377) to       authorize the issuance of extreme risk protection orders. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in       the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-46,       modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7910) to amend       title 18, United States Code, to provide for an increased age       limit on the purchase of certain firearms, prevent gun       trafficking, modernize the prohibition on untraceable       firearms, encourage the safe storage of firearms, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature       of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary       now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       117-48 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) two hours of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or       their respective designees; (2) proceedings under section 3       of this resolution; and (3) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.  The proceedings referred to in section 2 of this       resolution are as follows:         (a) after debate pursuant to section 2 of this resolution,       the Chair shall put the question on retaining each title of       the bill, as amended, in the order specified by the Chair;        (b) the yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered on       each of the questions under subsection (a); and        (c) after disposition of the questions under subsection       (a), the Chair shall put the question on engrossment and       third reading of the  [[Page H5349]]       text comprising those portions of the bill retained pursuant       to subsection (a).        Sec. 4.  In the engrossment of H.R. 7910, the Clerk shall       conform title and section numbers and make related       corrections to cross-references in the event a portion of the       bill is not retained pursuant to section 3 of this       resolution.        Sec. 5.  House Resolution 1151 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 6.  House Resolution 1152 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 7.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 1097, agreed to May       10, 2022), is amended by striking ``June 10, 2022'' each       place it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``June 17,       2022''.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1153, for two measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 2377 under a closed  rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides 1 hour of  general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee, and provides one motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7910 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 2 hours of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee. It provides that following debate the House will vote  separately on retaining each title of the bill and provides one motion  to recommit.   Additionally, the rule deems passage of H. Res. 1151 and H. Res.  1152.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority through June 17.   Madam Speaker, I am struggling to put into words right now the  tremendous pain that so many Americans feel in the wake of the mass  shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, pain because, once  again, we are burying America's children.   The hopes and dreams and futures of our kids, birthday parties and  bar mitzvahs, and summer breaks and high school graduations stolen by a  senseless, unceasing drumbeat of gun violence. The lives of innocent  shoppers ended in a hate-fueled rampage of white supremacy.   It does not have to be this way. What kind of country are we if we  let this happen and do nothing? What does that say about our values and  our priorities as a society?   I am so deeply disappointed and frustrated as a Member of Congress,  but even more as a parent. What happened in Uvalde is unconscionable.   For God's sake, the parents had to submit DNA because the bodies of  their fourth graders were unrecognizable. They had to identify them by  their shoes because the exit wounds produced by an AR-15 were so large  that their bodies were torn apart by the bullets.   Madam Speaker, 18-year-olds can't even rent a car, but they can buy  guns that can tear people apart. It just doesn't make any sense.   When I think of the trauma the parents had to go through, burying  their kids, knowing that this could have been prevented if bills like  the ones we are considering today were passed into law, it is beyond  heartbreaking.   There are no words, just sadness, when I think of my kids. Then, I  think of all the parents who won't get to watch their own kids grow up.   For Uvalde, for Parkland, for Sandy Hook, for Buffalo, and all the  mass shootings that have torn apart communities all across this  country, I am pleading with my colleagues: Do not throw away this  opportunity to get something done. Do not let partisan talking points  get in the way of reasonable gun safety measures.                                time  1230    None of these ideas are extreme. In fact, they are what the vast  majority of people in this country want us to do.   This vote will unequivocally show where each and every one of us  stands: on red flag laws, on raising the age to purchase a  semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21, on gun trafficking and straw  purchases, on ghost guns, on the safe storage of firearms, particularly  when a minor is likely to gain access to them, on bump stocks, and on  large-capacity magazines.   We will have separate votes on all of these issues. This week there  will be no excuses.   Really, think about that list. None of these proposals are aimed at  taking firearms away from law-abiding gun owners. They are aimed at  stopping people from getting slaughtered in their schools, in churches,  in grocery stores, in homes.   These bills would have stopped the shooters in Buffalo and Uvalde  from buying their guns.   Madam Speaker, I am pleading with my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to work with us, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The gentlewoman said Republicans stand ready to address school safety  and other root causes of gun violence.   I include in the Record a May 26, 2022, article from The Texas  Tribune entitled: ``Texas already `hardened' schools. It didn't save  Uvalde.''                   [From The Texas Tribune, May 26, 2022]         Texas Already ``Hardened'' Schools. It Didn't Save Uvalde.                    (By Jolie McCullough and Kate McGee)         Four years after an armed 17-year-old opened fire inside a       Texas high school, killing 10, Gov. Greg Abbott tried to tell       another shell-shocked community that lost 19 children and two       teachers to a teen gunman about his wins in what is now an       ongoing effort against mass shootings.        ``We consider what we did in 2019 to be one of the most       profound legislative sessions not just in Texas but in any       state to address school shootings,'' Abbott said inside a       Uvalde auditorium Wednesday as he sat flanked by state and       local officials. ``But to be clear, we understand our work is       not done, our work must continue.''        Throughout the 60-minute news conference, he and other       Republican leaders said a 2019 law allowed districts to       ``harden'' schools from external threats after a deadly       shooting inside an art classroom at Santa Fe High School near       Houston the year before. After the Uvalde gunman was       reportedly able to enter Robb Elementary School through a       back door this week, their calls to secure buildings       resurfaced yet again.        But a deeper dive into the 2019 law revealed many of its       ``hardening'' elements have fallen short. Schools didn't       receive enough state money to make the types of physical       improvements lawmakers are touting publicly. Few school       employees signed up to bring guns to work. And many school       districts either don't have an active shooting plan or       produced insufficient ones.        In January 2020, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School       District received $69,000 from a one-time, $100 million state       grant to enhance physical security in Texas public schools,       according to a dataset detailing the Texas Education Agency       grants. The funds were comparable to what similarly sized       districts received.        Even with more funds and better enforcement of policies,       experts have said there is no indication that beefing up       security in schools has prevented any violence. Plus, they       said, it can be detrimental to children, especially children       of color.        ``This concept of hardening, the more it has been done,       it's not shown the results,'' said Jagdish Khubchandani, a       public health professor at New Mexico State University who       studies school security practices and their effectiveness.        Khubchandani said the majority of public schools in the       United States already implement the security measures most       often promoted by public officials, including locked doors to       the outside and in classrooms, active shooter plans and       security cameras.        After a review of 18 years of school security measures,       Khubchandani and James Price from the University of Toledo       did not find any evidence that such tactics or more armed       teachers reduced gun violence in schools.        ``It's not just guns. It's not just security,''       Khubchandani said. ``It's a combination of issues, and if you       have a piecemeal approach, then you'll never succeed. You       need a comprehensive approach.''                      Insufficient Active Shooter Plans         Since the shooting, GOP lawmakers have repeatedly suggested       limiting access to schools to one door.        ``We've got to, in our smaller schools where we can, get       down to one entrance,'' Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick offered at the       press conference Wednesday. ``One entrance might be one of       those solutions. If he had taken three more minutes to find       that open door . . . the police were there pretty quickly.''        There are still questions about the timing and details of       the tragedy, however, including whether the shooter busted a       lock to get into the school or if a door was unlocked. A       state police official reported Thursday that the door       appeared to be unlocked but that it was still under       investigation.        Khubchandani and education advocates said locking doors and       routing everyone through one entrance is already standard       practice in most districts. And safety leaders said locking       exterior doors is a best practice, but it's one strategy that       needs to be strictly enforced.        ``Sometimes convenience can take priority over safety and       you can have a plan in place, you can have policies in       place,'' said Kathy Martinez Prather, director of the Texas       School Safety Center at Texas State University. ``They're       only as effective as they're being implemented.''        At Wednesday's press conference, Abbott emphasized that the       package of school safety laws passed in 2019 required school       districts to submit emergency operations plans to the Texas       School Safety Center and make sure they have adequate active       shooter strategies to employ in an emergency.        State law dictates that districts must be able to show how       they will prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters       like active threats, but also extreme weather and       communicable disease. These plans must include training       mechanisms, communication plans and mandatory drills. Schools       must create safety committees and establish a way to assess       threats.        But a three-year audit by the center in 2020 found that out       of the 1,022 school districts in the state, just 200 had       active shooter policies, even though most districts reported       having one. The audit revealed 626 districts did not have       active shooter policies in place and 196 districts had       insufficient policies.        Just 67 school districts had viable emergency operations       plans overall, the report found.        Martinez Prather wouldn't say if Uvalde's emergency plan       was considered adequate because of ongoing investigations       into the shooting. But said the center's review did not find       any areas of noncompliance.        The audit reviewed school districts' emergency plans in       June 2020, and Martinez Prather said she was ``absolutely''       surprised that so many schools did not have clear-cut plans,       especially after the Santa Fe shooting and others around the       country.        ``Our attention to this issue should not be as close to the       nearest and latest school shooting,'' she said. ``We need to       keep sending that message that this can happen at any point       in time and to anybody.''        She said the center has spent the last year and a half       following up with schools to get their plans up to standard.                     Arming Teachers and Staff With Guns         Texas leaders have already shunned the idea of restricting       gun access in the aftermath of the Uvalde shooting. In fact,       in recent years, Texas lawmakers have loosened gun laws after       mass shootings.        Instead, lawmakers point to the nearly decade-old school       marshal program in Texas as another measure to deter and       prevent mass shootings. That program was created in response       to the deadly shooting at an elementary school in Newtown,       Connecticut, that left 26 people dead, including 20 first-      graders.        Designated school employees who take an 80-hour training       course and pass a psychological exam are allowed to keep a       firearm in a lockbox on school grounds, an idea most       attractive to rural schools in areas where law enforcement       response can take longer.        After the school shooting in Santa Fe, state lawmakers       removed the cap that limited schools to one marshal per 200       students. Today, according to the Texas Commission on Law       Enforcement, which oversees the training for the program,       there are 256 marshals across the state.        While lawmakers tout it as a potential tool to prevent mass       shootings, just 6% of school districts use it, according to a       report from the Texas School Safety Center. Martinez Prather       at the Texas School Safety Center said many school districts       say it's expensive  [[Page H5351]]       and the training is time-consuming for educators.        Meanwhile, 280 schools are utilizing an unregulated option       known as the Guardian Program, which allows local school       boards to approve individuals in schools to carry concealed       weapons. Each ``guardian'' must have a handgun license and       take 15 to 20 hours of specialized training by the Texas       Department of Public Safety.        Nicole Golden, executive director of Texas Gun Sense, said       she's concerned by the ``minimal'' level of training school       staff go through before they are approved to have a weapon in       the classroom.        ``These aren't law enforcement officers,'' she said.       ``These are school staff who have some training, and there's       really not a lot of data to support that that's the safe       direction to go in.''        Plus, Golden said, placing more guns on school grounds can       be problematic when data shows students of color are       disproportionately disciplined.        When lawmakers decided to expand the number of marshals in       Texas schools in 2019, Black students and parents said the       idea made them feel less safe in school, knowing they are       disciplined more than other students.        The study from Khubchandani and Price pointed to a 2018       shooting at a high school in Kentucky where the shooter       killed two and injured 14 students in 10 seconds.        ``Armed school personnel would have needed to be in the       exact same spot in the school as the shooter to significantly       reduce this level of trauma,'' the researchers wrote. ``Ten       seconds is too fast to stop a school shooter with a       semiautomatic firearm when the armed school guard is in       another place in the school.''                          $10 per Student for Safety         Big changes often take big money, and officials have noted       that the 2019 school safety bill gives about $100 million per       biennium to the Texas Education Agency. The agency then       distributes the money to school districts to use on       equipment, programs and training related to school safety and       security, a little less than $10 per student based on average       daily attendance. The money can be used broadly, ranging from       physical security enhancements to suicide prevention       programs.        According to a self-reported survey of districts by the       Texas School Safety Center, more than two thirds of school       districts have used this money for security cameras. 20% used       it for active shooter response training. Nearly 40% of       districts installed physical barriers with the allotment.        But Zeph Capo, president of the Texas chapter of the       American Federation of Teachers, said that money wasn't       enough to pay for the more expensive projects lawmakers were       suggesting.        ``Districts ended up spending money on some programs, some       electronic AV equipment, but I don't think it was nearly       enough to do what needs to be done in most of the schools,       which is really change the structures of the buildings so       there's better control over entrance and egress,'' he said,       noting that AFT believes more gun restrictions is a better       solution.        The TEA also received a separate one-time $100 million pool       of money to provide grants to districts specifically for       physical security enhancements, like metal detectors, door-      locking systems or bullet-resistant glass.        It's unclear how Uvalde CISD spent the $69,000 it received       from the state to enhance its physical security. School       officials did not respond to questions Wednesday. As of the       May 2 report, the district had spent about $48,000 of the       grant, which is set to end at the end of the month.        Other remote town school districts received comparable       grants per their student population, according to an analysis       by The Texas Tribune. For example, the Sulphur Springs       Independent School District in East Texas has only a slightly       larger student population and received about $71,000 in grant       funds.        According to a district document, Uvalde CISD, which       enrolls around 4,100 students, had a variety of so-called       hardening measures in place that lawmakers and school safety       leaders recommend.        The district employed four district police officers,       installed perimeter fencing meant to limit access around       schools, including Robb, and instituted a policy that all       classroom doors remain locked during the day.        There are campus teams that identify and address potential       threats, and schools hold emergency drills for students       ``regularly.'' The district employed a threat reporting       system for community members to raise concerns. Some schools       had security vestibules at their entrances and buzz-in       systems to get inside from the outdoors.        But a security vestibule, which is basically a secure lobby       to the school, can be a huge expense for school districts       already tight on money. In 2019, the Waller Independent       School District estimated that the addition of two of these       entrances to the junior high school would cost $345,000.       Security cameras at a small elementary school can cost more       than $20,000, according to industry experts.        In recent years--even before the Santa Fe shooting--school       districts have begun to rely on bond proposals to find the       money to implement some of these changes.        But Texas voters have expressed hesitancy at the ballot box       to approve such bonds in recent years, which the Texas       Association of School Boards attributed to the lingering       pandemic and political polarization. Recent changes by the       Texas Legislature have also complicated bond requests for       schools after it started to require districts to write,       ``This is a property tax increase,'' on bond project signs,       even when the proposals wouldn't affect the tax rate.        Overall, Monty Exter, a senior lobbyist with the       Association of Texas Professional Educators, said the per-      student allotment and one-time grants set aside for school       security could never pay for the types of construction       projects lawmakers have touted publicly in the wake of the       shooting.        ``Thinking about making significant changes to 8,000-plus       campuses, $100 million doesn't necessarily go that far,'' he       said.     Madam Speaker, we keep hearing that the epidemic of  mass school shootings can be solved by hardening schools. Guess what?  Robb Elementary had been hardened. We can harden schools all we want,  we can turn them into fortresses, but unless we deal with the  underlying issue, it is going to keep happening.   The gentlewoman from Minnesota also said mental health is a root  cause. I include in the Record a Bloomberg article published May 27,  2022, entitled: ``Republicans Push Unfounded Mental Health Claim for  Gun Violence.''                       [From Bloomberg, May 27, 2022]      Republicans Push Unfounded Mental Health Claim for Gun Violence                              (By Emma Court)         Republican politicians from Senator Ted Cruz to Texas       Governor Greg Abbott have been quick to blame mental illness       following a deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that       killed 19 children and two teachers.        The problem with that thinking is that the evidence doesn't       support it--even if common sense suggests a mass shooting,       especially of children, is not the act of a person who is       mentally well.        While reporting from Texas following the May 24 shooting       makes clear the Uvalde gunman, Salvador Ramos, was a deeply       troubled individual, state officials have said he had no       documented mental health issues. Research shows that only a       very small percentage of violent behavior is connected to       mental illness.        ``If we magically cured all these serious mental illnesses       tomorrow, which would be wonderful--imagine the alleviation       of suffering--our violence problem would go down by about       4%,'' said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and       behavioral sciences at Duke University.        Firearm violence is a greater risk for young males,       individuals with a violent childhood and those who abuse       drugs and alcohol. While mental illness can contribute to gun       violence, the vast majority of those suffering from mental       illness will never engage in violent acts, Swanson said.        Attributing school shootings to mental illness, meanwhile,       increases the stigma around such conditions, which include       depression, schizophrenia and psychosis, according to       experts.                                  Gun Deaths         National Rifle Association leaders are expected to shift       the focus away from gun policies that put deadly weapons in       the hands of the public when their national convention kicks       off in Houston on Friday. The organization called the Uvalde       massacre ``the act of a lone, deranged criminal'' in a       statement.        Around 45,000 people died from gun-related deaths in the US       in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention. More than half those deaths were suicides, and       many of the remainder were murders.        Guns are also now the leading cause of death among children       and adolescents, surpassing car crashes, drug overdoses and       drownings, according to recent CDC data.        Texas is fiercely pro-gun rights, and Abbott last year       signed legislation allowing Texans to carry handguns without       a license.        Abbott, at a press conference in Uvalde, suggested that       access to guns isn't the issue.        ``We haven't had episodes like this before,'' Abbott said.       ``One thing that has substantially changed is the status of       mental health in our communities.''        In truth, shooters in the US have tried to kill in places       like schools, malls and bars for decades.        Cruz, who is expected to be at the NRA event, has described       the shooting as the actions of a ``violent psychopath.'' He       also said none of the gun-law proposals made by Democrats       would have stopped it.        Democrats have been quick to dispute those claims. ``Spare       me the bull,'' Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut said to       reporters after urging his colleagues to take action against       gun violence.        Other countries have mental health problems too but rarely       have mass shootings, President Joe Biden said in a May 24       speech in which he pleaded for gun reform and called for       standing up to gun manufacturers.        ``They have mental health problems. They have domestic       disputes in other countries. They have people who are lost,''       Biden said. ``But these kinds of mass shootings never happen       with the kind of frequency they happen in America.''                           Widespread Misconception         Many people associate mental illness with violence, likely       because of how these conditions are portrayed in the media,       including in reporting about shootings like Uvalde.        Mental illness can also be an easy scapegoat for making       sense of tragedies like  [[Page H5352]]       Uvalde, which are devastating and hard to comprehend, said       Lynsay Ayer, a senior behavioral scientist at Rand Corp., a       nonprofit research organization.        ``People want to explain it, to say `this person wasn't       thinking rationally, wasn't thinking like you and me,       something went wrong in their brain wiring,' '' she said.       Blaming mental illness is ``convenient, but it's overly       simplistic and runs the risk of hurting people who have       mental health problems.''        People with mental health disorders are, in fact, more       likely to be the victims of violence than a perpetrator, Ayer       said.        Using mental illness as an explanation for such events also       plays into outdated tropes, like the idea that ``something is       wrong with'' those individuals, said Hannah Wesolowski, chief       advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.        ``I think people confuse having a mental health condition       with being troubled, and they are not one and the same,'' she       said. Mental illness is defined by specific medical       guidelines. It's also widespread, affecting one in five US       adults every year.        Gun violence remains poorly understood. One reason: Since       1996, Congress has limited federal funding of research into       the subject. While that's now changing, gaps in understanding       remain. Studying mass shootings is also challenging because       such events are relatively rare, Ayer said.        (Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for universal       background checks and gun-safety measures, is backed by       Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg       News parent company Bloomberg LP.)     Madam Speaker, let me set the record straight.   Yes, we have people with mental health issues in America. So do other  countries. Only here in America do we have widespread, fatal gun  violence to the extent that we do, so spare us the lectures.   I should say, under GOP Governor Greg Abbott, Texas is last--last--in  the Nation for mental health access.   Just one final thing. We keep hearing about the inconveniences of  these proposals: safe storage, background checks, waiting lists. I get  it. There may be some inconvenience here, but stack that up against the  carnage, stack that up against the mass shootings, the daily killings  in this country. I mean, for once, can we put that first over the  inconvenience of going through a background check? This is a moment I  hoped that we could actually do something, but instead we are  complaining about inconveniences. Give me a break.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Bowman).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from Minnesota made a reference to the  United States in comparison to other countries. I am holding this chart  up here. You may not be able to see, but this is the number of gun  deaths. The U.K. is way down here, France, Germany, Denmark,  Switzerland, all free countries. You may not be able to see because it  is so small, compared to the United States. You sure as hell can see  the number of gun deaths here in the United States. It is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable. And it is about time that Democrats and Republicans  all agree that it is unacceptable, and that is what this debate is  about.   If we want to talk about other countries around the world that are  free, lots of countries that enjoy freedom do not have the number of  gun deaths and massacres. Their parliaments and their Congresses are  not meeting to grieve over the execution and the mass killing of little  children in schools like we do on a regular basis.                                time  1245    The only question for people here is whether we are going to do  anything or whether this is going to be business as usual: Take the  money from the gun lobby and do nothing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I began this debate by appealing to my colleagues to  try to find common ground and come together and do something about this  gun violence epidemic. And yet, we hear the same old tired red State  versus blue State talking points directly from the gun lobby.   Madam Speaker, since it was brought up, I include in the Record an  April 4,  [[Page H5354]]  2022, Yahoo News article entitled, ``Republican-controlled States have  higher murder rates than Democratic ones,'' according to the study.                     [From Yahoo! News, April 4, 2022]   Republican-Controlled States Have Higher Murder Rates Than Democratic                                Ones: Study                               (By Ben Adler)         Republican politicians routinely claim that cities run by       Democrats have been experiencing crime waves caused by failed       governance, but a new study shows murder rates are actually       higher in states and cities controlled by Republicans.        ``We're seeing murders in our cities, all Democrat-run,''       former President Donald Trump asserted at a March 26 rally in       Georgia. ``People are afraid to go out.''        In February, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., blamed Democrats for       a 2018 law that reduced some federal prison sentences--even       though it was signed by Trump after passing a GOP-controlled       Congress. ``It's your party who voted in lockstep for the       First Step Act that let thousands of violent felons on the       street who have now committed innumerable violent crimes,''       Cotton said during a speech in the Senate.        Last December, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, told Fox News       viewers, ``America's most beautiful cities are indeed being       ruined by liberal policies: There's a direct line between       death and decay and liberal policies.''        But a comparison of violent crime rates in jurisdictions       controlled by Democrats and Republicans tells a very       different story. In fact, a new study from the center-left       think tank Third Way shows that states won by Trump in the       2020 election have higher murder rates than those carried by       Joe Biden. The highest murder rates, the study found, are       often in conservative, rural states.        The study found that murder rates in the 25 states Trump       carried in 2020 are 40 percent higher overall than in the       states Biden won. (The report used 2020 data because 2021       data is not yet fully available.) The five states with the       highest per capita murder rate--Mississippi, Louisiana,       Kentucky, Alabama and Missouri--all lean Republican and voted       for Trump.        There are some examples of states Biden won in 2020 that       also have high per capita murder rates, including New Mexico       and Georgia, which have the seventh- and eighth-highest       murder rates, respectively. And there are Trump-supporting       states with low murder rates, such as Idaho and Utah. Broadly       speaking, the South, and to a lesser extent the Midwest, has       more murders per capita than the Northeast, interior West and       West Coast, the study found.        Those findings are consistent with a pattern that has       existed for decades, in which the South has had higher rates       of violent crime than the nation as a whole.        ``We as criminologists have known this for quite some       time,'' Jennifer Ortiz, a professor of criminology at Indiana       University Southeast, told Yahoo News. ``States like       Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama have historically had high       crime rates.''        Criminologists say research shows higher rates of violent       crime are found in areas that have low average education       levels, high rates of poverty and relatively modest access to       government assistance. Those conditions characterize some       portions of the American South.        ``They are among the poorest states in our union,'' Ortiz       said of the Deep South. ``They have among the highest rates       of child poverty. They are among the least-educated states.       They are among the states with the highest levels of       substance abuse. All of those factors contribute to people       engaging in criminal behavior.''        ``I thought that was a very good study,'' Richard       Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of       Missouri-St. Louis and former president of the American       Society of Criminology, told Yahoo News about the Third Way       report. ``In Republican states, states with Republican       governors, crime rates tend to be higher. I'm not certain       that's related to the fact that the governor is a Republican,       but it's a fact nonetheless.''        (While the Third Way study divided states by presidential       vote in 2020, using gubernatorial party affiliation leads to       similar results because most states have recently chosen the       same party for governor and for president. Based on       presidential vote, eight of the 10 states with the highest       murder rates lean Republican, versus seven of the top 10 if       one uses the governor's party.)        Although murder rates tend to be highest in the South, the       biggest increases in 2020 were found in the Great Plains and       Midwest, according to Third Way. The largest jumps were in       Wyoming (91.7 percent higher than in 2019), South Dakota (69       percent), Wisconsin (63.2 percent), Nebraska (59.1 percent)       and Minnesota (58.1 percent). Wyoming, South Dakota and       Nebraska all voted for Trump and have Republican governors.       Wisconsin and Minnesota voted for Biden and are led by       Democrats.        Few large cities are governed by Republicans--only 26 of       the 100 largest U.S. cities have Republican mayors--making       apples-to-apples comparisons difficult. But cities that do       have Republican mayors do not have lower murder rates than       similarly sized Democratic-led cities, the study found.        Some experts warn against the impulse to use crime data to       score quick political points.        ``Being a Republican or Democratic state or city is       correlated with many other issues,'' David Weisburd, a       professor of criminology and executive director of the Center       for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University,       wrote in an email to Yahoo News. ``That means that the murder       rate may be due to the state being Republican, or it may be       due to the fact that Republican states have many other risk       factors related to crime or murder rates. Even with a very       comprehensive modeling of all of these factors, it is very       difficult to get a valid causal result for explaining crime       rates.''        That argument cuts both ways, however. Weisburd also thinks       the claims of Trump and other Republicans who say Democrats       have caused a crime wave in the cities and states they govern       are unfounded. ``I don't think this argument can be supported       no matter which way you go,'' Weisburd said.        Murder rates in the U.S. rose dramatically in 2020 from       record lows, and the increases are similar across states--      regardless of partisan preference. For homicides in 2020,       Third Way found a 32.2 percent uptick in Trump-backing states       versus a 30.8 percent rise in those that voted for Biden.       Some states with large cities, such as New York and       Pennsylvania, saw larger-than-average increases: New York       went up 47 percent and Pennsylvania is up 39 percent. But the       largest increases were in rural, Republican-led states,       including Montana (+84 percent and South Dakota (+81       percent).        The higher national murder rate is naturally causing public       concern, although violent crime does remain far below its       early 1990s high point. ``Using the FBI data, the violent       crime rate fell 49 percent between 1993 and 2019,'' from 757       incidents per 100,000 people to 379 per 100,000, the Pew       Research Center noted last November. Between 2019 and 2020,       the murder rate jumped from 6 homicides per 100,000 people to       7.8 homicides per 100,000, but that was still 22 percent       below the rate in 1991 of 10 homicides per 100,000.     Madam Speaker, Republicans would rather point fingers  than look in the mirror, but a recent study found that the highest  murder rates are often in conservative, rural States. The five States  with the highest per capita murder rate: Mississippi, Louisiana,  Kentucky, Alabama, Missouri--all lean Republican.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the summary of a December 16,  2021, report from Everytown Research & Policy, entitled, ``City  Dashboard: Murder and Gun Homicide Report.''                  [From Everytown Research, Dec. 16, 2021]          Summary: City Dashboard: Murder and Gun Homicide Report                      (By Everytown Research & Policy)         In the midst of one public health epidemic, COVID-19, 2021       and 2020 were also two of the deadliest years on record for       another public health crisis--gun violence. The United States       saw a 33 percent increase from 2019 to 2020 in the rate of       gun homicides. This upward trend continued--but slowed--      through the end of 2021 during which time there was an       additional 7 percent increase in gun homicides relative to       2020.        Due to limited funding and inconsistent data collection,       data on city gun violence is too often old, incomplete, and       conflicting from one federal agency to another. Below is the       most recent, available, reliable data on murders (firearm and       non-firearm) from 2016 to the first three quarters of 2021       and on gun homicides from 2016 to 2020 in nearly 500 cities.     Madam Speaker, I will debunk some myths. Chicago, New  York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco do not have the highest gun  violence rates in the country.   You don't measure gun violence rates by the raw number. These are big  cities. Of course, they are going to have more gun deaths than other  places. You measure these rates by measuring per 100,000 people. When  you do that, these cities aren't even in the top 20.   Jackson, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; St. Louis, Missouri; New  Orleans; Memphis--the list goes on and on. Find a new talking point.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 28, 2018, piece  from ABC News entitled, ``Trump calls for raising minimum age to buy  all guns to 21.''                       [From ABC News, Feb. 28, 2018]         Trump Calls for Raising Minimum Age To Buy All Guns to 21                             (By Jordyn Phelps)         President Trump again called for raising the minimum legal       age to purchase all guns to age 21 during a meeting with       lawmakers on guns and school safety Wednesday, while       suggesting that those who are staying silent on the topic are       ``afraid'' to come up against the NRA,        ``I'm going to give it a lot of consideration,'' Trump       said. ``People aren't bringing it up because they're afraid       to bring it up. You can't buy a handgun at 18, 19 or 20. You       have to wait until you're 21. You could buy the weapon used       in this horrible shooting at 18. You are going to decide--the       people in  [[Page H5355]]       this room pretty much--are going to decide. I would give very       serious thought to it.''        While noting the NRA's opposition to proposals to raise the       minimum age to purchase firearms, the president made the case       that raising the minimum age is common sense.        ``The NRA is opposed to it and I'm a fan of the NRA. No       bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people.       Great patriots. They love our country but that doesn't mean       we have to agree on everything,'' Trump said. ``It doesn't       make sense that I have to wait till I'm 21 to get a handgun       but I can get this.''        The president also signaled his support for the Manchin-      Toomey proposal that was defeated back in 2013, and is in the       process of being reworked, that calls for expanding       background checks on guns sales to include firearms sold at       gun shows and on the internet.        The president suggested that the measure failed back in       2013 because President Barack Obama was in office at the       time, saying ``that was your problem,'' in reference to       Obama. But in fact, Obama backed the bill at the time.        He asked Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, if the       bill he's sponsoring with Senator Joe Manchin, a West       Virginia Democrat, would proposing raising the purchasing age       for certain guns.        ``We don't address it,'' Toomey told the president.        ``You know why, because you're afraid of the NRA,'' the       president said in reply.        Wednesday evening, the NRA responded to Trump's proposals.        In a statement, spokesperson Jennifer Baker said: ``While       today's meeting made for great tv, the gun-control proposals       discussed would make for bad policy that would not keep our       children safe. Instead of punishing law-abiding gun owners       for the acts of a deranged lunatic our leaders should pass       meaningful reforms that would actually prevent future       tragedies.''        ``They can start by fixing the broken mental health       system,'' her statement continued, ``strengthening background       checks to ensure the records of people who are prohibited       from possessing firearms are in the NICS system, securing our       schools and preventing the dangerously mentally ill from       accessing firearms.''        At the White House meeting, the president repeatedly       expressed his support for legislation to improve the nation's       background check system but said such a measure should not       also include a provision to expand concealed carry law to       allow people with concealed carry licenses to carry their       firearms across state line.        ``I'm with you but let it be a separate bill,'' Trump told       Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who was gunned down       during a congressional baseball practice last year. ``You'll       never get this passed if you add concealed carry to this,       you'll never get it passed. I don't think--again, you'll       never get it passed. We want to get something done.''        The president also vowed to ban bump stocks through       executive action, telling the lawmakers that the rapid-fire       devices are ``gone.''        ``I'm going to write that out. We can do that by executive       order,'' the president said, noting that ``the lawyers'' are       working on the language.        Last week, Trump said he ordered the Justice Department to       move to ban the rapid-fire devices that were used in the Las       Vegas massacre last year. Bump stocks were not used in the       Parkland shooting.     Madam Speaker, the very person that everybody on the  other side of the aisle is so afraid to take on, so frightened of, says  that we should raise the age to 21.   Madam Speaker, former President Donald Trump said it himself: ``You  can't buy a handgun at 18, 19, or 20. You have to wait until you're 21.  You could buy the weapon,'' meaning an AR-15, ``used in this horrible  shooting at 18 . . . It doesn't make sense.''   I mean, come on. Trump said this in 2018, and these guys here are  telling us that somehow this is a violation of the Constitution? Give  me a break.   We are here to try to save the lives of America's kids. And there  should be more outrage on the other side of the aisle, not the usual  talking points that we hear over and over and over again from the gun  lobby. If this isn't important, then nothing is.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me remind everybody that 21 people were killed in Uvalde, 19  children. Ten people were killed in Buffalo. I say that because I think  my colleagues need to be reminded about why we are here today, not to  talk about the budget, but to talk about saving lives.   I also remind them that the shooter in Buffalo and the shooter in  Uvalde went in and legally purchased an AR-15 at 18 years old.   Our bill that we are talking about here today would have prevented  that. Whatever they are doing for the previous question--I don't know  what it is--would not.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon),  a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, you got to be kidding me. The gentleman from Missouri  comes down here for 3 minutes and unloads on everybody here about a  technical provision that doesn't even spend any money. It is a  technical provision to allow us to go forward with our appropriations  work.   Not a mention of the children who were killed in Uvalde or the people  who were killed in Buffalo--not a mention. What the hell is wrong with  this place?   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record--since the gentleman didn't  have the dignity to acknowledge those who were killed--the names of  those who were murdered in Uvalde and Buffalo.

Madam Speaker, I will respond to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this Business Insider article  entitled ``Host Republican leaders told their Members to vote against  eight gun-safety bills, citing opposition from the NRA and Gun Owners  of America.''                        [From Insider, June 8, 2022]     House Republican Leaders Told Their Members To Vote Against 8 Gun-  Safety Bills, Citing Opposition From the NRA and Gun Owners of America                             (By Bryan Metzger)         House Republicans are poised to vote against eight bills       aimed at preventing gun violence on Tuesday, in part due to       opposition from powerful pro-gun groups on the right.        House Democratic leaders have scheduled votes for Wednesday       evening on the ``Protecting Our Kids Act''--a package of       seven gun violence-related measures that includes raising the       age for legal purchase of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns       to 21, closing the ``bump stock'' loophole, and other       measures aimed at preventing the illegal trafficking of guns.        The House will also vote on the ``Federal Extreme Risk       Protection Order Act,'' a federal ``red flag'' bill that       would allow family members and law enforcement officials to       temporarily block firearm access to those who a court       determines pose a danger to themselves or others.        In a ``whip notice'' sent to rank-and-file members on       Tuesday afternoon, House GOP leadership urged a ``no'' vote       on all eight bills, referring to the seven-bill package as       the ``Unconstitutional Gun Restrictions Act.'' They wrote       that House Democrats had ``thrown together this reactionary       package comprised of legislation that egregiously violates       law-abiding citizens' 2nd Amendment rights and hinders       Americans' ability to defend and protect themselves and their       families.''        The email also noted the opposition of the National Rifle       Association and Gun Owners of America, including links to       talking points from the NRA about both the gun package and       the red flag law. Leaders also noted the opposition of       Heritage Action for America, an advocacy group tied to the       conservative Heritage Foundation.        ``Due to the importance of this issue, votes on this       legislation will be considered in future candidate ratings       and endorsements by the NRA Political Victory Fund,''       declares one of the memos shared by party leaders.        It's not uncommon for party leaders to note the opposition       of outside groups to major pieces of legislation. For       example, in a February whip notice urging Republicans to vote       against a major piece of legislation aimed at boosting the US       semiconductor industry, GOP leaders noted the opposition of       the Federation for American Immigration Reform, National       Taxpayers Union, and Americans for Prosperity.        But the two gun groups' inclusion--and the NRA's threat to       downgrade candidate ratings or withhold endorsements should       any Republicans back the measures--underscores the enduring       influence of pro-second amendment groups on the right,       despite the NRA's recent financial troubles and shrinking       membership.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman mentioned our gun laws, and just to  demonstrate the absurdity of the gun laws that are in place, I include  in the Record the Texas Parks & Wildlife ``Migratory Game Bird Hunting  Methods'' list of regulations, which is valid September 1, 2021 through  August 31, 2022.              [From the Texas Parks & Wildlife, Sept. 1, 2021]                    Migratory Game Bird Hunting Methods                        (By Texas Parks & Wildlife)                      Harvest Information Program (HIP)         No person shall hunt migratory game birds in this state       unless that person is HIP-certified in Texas. The federally-      mandated Harvest Information Program (HIP) improves harvest       information for all migratory game birds. Hunters who buy a       Migratory Game Bird Hunting Endorsement, including Super       Combos, will be asked a few simple questions about their       migratory bird hunting activities.        Please report Migratory Game Bird bands. Check migratory       game birds harvested (especially doves) for leg bands and       report them to reportband.gov.                              Means and Methods         Shotguns, lawful archery equipment, falconry, dogs,       artificial decoys, and manual or mouth-operated bird calls       are legal.        A shotgun is the only legal firearm for hunting migratory       game birds. Shotguns must not be larger than 10-gauge, must       be fired from the shoulder, and must be incapable of holding       more than three shells. Shotguns capable of holding more than       three shells must be plugged with a one-piece filler which       cannot be removed without disassembling the gun, so the gun's       total capacity does not exceed three shells.        Hunting is permitted in the open or from a blind or other       type of concealment or from floating craft or motor boat       provided that all motion resulting from sail or motor has       ceased. Sails must be furled and motor turned off before       shooting starts.        A craft under power may be used to retrieve dead or       crippled birds; however, crippled birds may not be shot from       such craft under power.        No person, while hunting waterfowl anywhere in the state,       may possess shotgun shells containing lead shot or loose lead       shot for use in muzzleloaders. Approved shot includes steel       (including copper, nickel or zinc-coated steel), bismuth-tin,       tungsten-iron, tungsten-polymer (e.g. moly-shot), and any       other nontoxic material approved by the Director of the       USFWS.                             Baiting Regulations         Directly or indirectly placing, exposing, depositing,       distributing or scattering of salt, grain, or other feed that       could serve as a lure or attraction for migratory game birds       to, on or over areas where hunters are attempting to take       them is prohibited by federal law. Hunters are responsible       for knowing whether an area is baited or not.        For further information on federal regulation regarding       baiting:        USFWS Dove Hunting and Baiting.        USFWS Waterfowl Hunting and Baiting.        A hunter may hunt migratory game birds including waterfowl,       coots and sandhill cranes:        on or over standing crops, standing flooded crops and       flooded harvested crops;        over natural vegetation that has been manipulated;        on or over a normal soil stabilization practice that is       defined as a planting for agricultural soil erosion control       or post-mining land reclamation conducted in accordance with       official recommendations of State Extension Specialists of       the Cooperative Extension Service of the U.S. Department of       Agriculture (USDA);        on or over lands or areas where seeds or grains have been       scattered solely as a result of a normal agricultural       practice which is defined as a planting, harvesting or post-      harvest manipulation conducted in accordance with official       recommendations of State Extension Specialists of the       Cooperative Extension Service of the USDA. Does not include       the brocast spreading of seed that is normally drill-planted;        over crops or natural vegetation where grain has been       inadvertently scattered as a result of entering or leaving a       hunting area, placing decoys or retrieving downed birds;        using natural vegetation or crops to conceal a blind,       provided that if crops are used to conceal a blind, no grain       or other feed is exposed, deposited, distributed or scattered       in the process.        A person may hunt doves over planted crops that have been       manipulated for the purpose of hunting. Waterfowl and       sandhill cranes may not be hunted where grain or feed has       been distributed or scattered as a result of manipulation or       livestock feeding.                             Unlawful Activities         It is unlawful to:        hunt migratory birds with the aid of bait, or on or over       any baited area;        hunt over any baited area until 10 days after all baiting       materials have been removed and a game warden has confirmed       removal of baiting materials;        place or allow the placement of bait on or adjacent to any       area where migratory game birds could be attracted for the       purpose of hunting migratory game birds by any person;        hunt waterfowl or sandhill cranes over manipulated planted       millet in the first year after planting;        hunt waterfowl or sandhill cranes over crops that have been       manipulated, unless the manipulation is a normal agricultural       post-harvesting manipulation in accordance with official       recommendations of State Extension Specialists of the       Cooperative Extension Service of the USDA;        use any firearm other than a legal shotgun; use a trap,       snare, net, fishhook, poison, drug, explosive or stupefying       substance; use live birds as decoys; use recorded or       electronically amplified bird calls or sounds; or use a       sinkbox;        hunt from or by means of motor vehicles or aircraft of any       kind (including stationary) except paraplegics and single or       double amputees of legs may hunt from stationary motor-driven       conveyances;        use motor-driven land, water or air conveyances or       sailboats to concentrate, drive, rally or stir up any       migratory game bird; or        hunt where tame or captive live ducks or geese are present       unless such birds are or have been for a period of 10       consecutive days prior to such taking confined within an       enclosure which substantially reduces the audibility of their       calls and totally conceals such birds from the sight of wild       migratory game birds.     Madam Speaker, shotguns used for duck hunting can't  hold more than three shells. Let me repeat: In order to protect the  duck population in Texas, shotguns cannot hold more than three shells.  Imagine if our Republican friends could muster the same courage to  protect America's children.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15  seconds.    Madam Speaker, we have no further requests for time on  our side, and I am ready to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record Newsweek's May  27, 2022, article entitled ``More Children Have Been Shot Dead in 2022  Than Police in the Line of Duty.''                       [From Newsweek, May 27, 2022]   More Children Have Been Shot Dead in 2022 Than Police in the Line of                                    Duty                            (By Gerrard Kaonga)         More children have been shot and killed in the U.S. this       year than police while on duty, according to new data.        The Officer Down Memorial Page website records the death of       police officers across the country and honors them for their       service.        As well as showing a picture of the deceased officer, it       also shows where they were stationed, the date of their death       and the cause.        According to the website, in 2022, 20 officers have been       killed after being involved in a shooting.        In comparison, in 2022, 24 students have been killed as a       result of shootings at school, according to data collected by       Education Week.        ``School shootings, terrifying to students, educators,       parents and communities, always reignite polarizing debates       about gun rights and school safety,'' the Education Week       report read.        ``To bring context to these debates, Education Week       journalists began tracking shootings on K-12 school property       that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths.''        According to the Education Week report, there have been 27       school shootings in 2022 and 119 in total since 2018, when       they began tracking such incidents.        The Robb Elementary School shooting, which resulted in 21       people being killed--19 children and two adult staff, lifted       the number of children killed in school shootings above the       number of police officers shot dead in the line of duty.        The other school shootings that brought the total number to       24 deaths included an attack at Tanglewood Middle School,       Greenville, South Carolina, on March 31.        A 12-year old student was shot and killed at the school. At       the time, this was the youngest age a student had been killed       in a school shooting in 2022.        Another incident that contributed was the Eisenhower High       School shooting, Yakima, Washington, on March 15, that       resulted in one student being killed and another injured.        There was also a shooting at East High School in Des       Moines, Iowa, on March 7 that resulted in a 15-year-old boy       being killed and two female students getting injured.        The second shooting of 2022 that resulted in a fatality of       a student was at the South Education Center, Richfield,       Minnesota, on February 1.                       Large Number of School Shootings         A shooting outside the South Education Center left a 15-      year-old student dead and a 17-year-old student critically       wounded.        The first incident of 2022 that resulted in a student's       death was at Oliver Citywide Academy, in Pittsburgh,       Pennsylvania on January 19. This resulted in a 15-year-old       boy  [[Page H5360]]       being shot and killed as he waited to go home.        President Joe Biden addressed the issue in a speech on       Tuesday and said it was time America stood up to the gun       manufacturing industry. Biden also reflected on the frequency       of mass shootings in America in his speech.        ``It's been 3,448 days--10 years since I stood up at a high       school in Connecticut--a grade school in Connecticut, where       another gunman massacred 26 people, including 20 first-      graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School,'' he said.        ``Since then, there have been over 900 incidents of gunfire       reported on school grounds. Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High       School in Parkland, Florida. Santa Fe High School in Texas.       Oxford High School in Michigan. The list goes on and on,''       Biden said. ``And the list grows when it includes mass       shootings at places like movie theaters, houses of worship,       and, as we saw just 10 days ago, at a grocery store in       Buffalo, New York.''        ``I am sick and tired of it. We have to act. And don't tell       me we can't have an impact on this carnage,'' Biden said.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Madam Speaker, will the bills before us pass the Senate? I sure as  hell hope so. None of these proposals are extreme. Quite the opposite.  In fact, they are what the vast majority of people in this country-- Democrats, Republicans, Independents--want us to do. Maybe they will  get changed in the Senate. Even if our Senate colleagues do not take up  these exact bills, I will tell you what this process we are going  through will absolutely do and why our efforts here are worthwhile.   This process will unequivocally show where each and every one of us  stand in the wake of this unspeakable tragedy. More importantly, it  will demonstrate which of the solutions we are putting forward have  majority support in this half of the Congress.   As our Senate colleagues discuss gun violence solutions, they will  have no doubt as to where the House of Representatives stands on red  flag laws; raising the age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to  21; gun trafficking and straw purchases; ghost guns; safe storage of  firearms, particularly when a minor is likely to gain access; bump  stocks; and large-capacity magazines.   We will have separate votes on all of these issues. This is on top of  the background check bill and the Charleston loophole bills we have  already sent them.                                time  1330    This week there will be no excuses. We will vote on these ideas one  issue at a time. None of these proposals are aimed at taking guns away  from law-abiding citizens. They are aimed at stopping people from  getting slaughtered in their schools, in their churches, in grocery  stores, and in their homes. These ideas won't solve every problem or  stop every shooting, but no sane person can come to the conclusion that  these proposals would not save lives.   I know that things like background checks and waiting until you are  21 to buy an AR-15 and smaller magazine capacity may seem like an  inconvenience to some people. But when stacked up against the carnage  we have seen in this country, I think we can all live with a little  inconvenience.   Madam Speaker, I cannot be any clearer. These bills will keep people  from dying, but only if they become law or if similar bills become law.   I know that everybody hates Congress. Hell, I even hate Congress  sometimes. But, Madam Speaker, don't listen to the NRA or extremists on  this bill. Vote your conscience.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1153         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 7967) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act to direct district attorney and prosecutors       offices to report to the Attorney General, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 9. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 7967.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
