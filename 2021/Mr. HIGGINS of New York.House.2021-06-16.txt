 Mr. Speaker, it was recently announced that  the European Union is lifting travel restrictions to allow Americans to  visit once again.   Over a year under the crush of a devastating global pandemic, highly  effective vaccines have made this game-changing moment possible.   Still, our border between the United States and Canada remains  closed, leaving people unable to access their property and keeping  loved ones separated for over 15 heartbreaking months.   This move by the EU would allow my Buffalo neighbors to take a 9-hour  flight to Paris, France, but they can't take a 90-minute drive to  Paris, Ontario.   The administration has set a goal of returning to a pre-pandemic  sense of normalcy by July 4. For many living along the northern border,  normalcy includes the ability to cross to check  [[Page H2829]]  on their property and to see their family again.   It is time to open the U.S.-Canadian border.                            ____________________
