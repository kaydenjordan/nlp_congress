 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the ongoing,  unprecedented disaster that is occurring at our southern border and  underscore the need for immediate action.   In August, Customs and Border Patrol agents encountered 203,597  illegal immigrants at our southern border. That was an increase of 307  percent compared to the last August of the Trump administration.   This also put the U.S. at over 2 million encounters for fiscal year  2022. This is the first time ever that we have eclipsed 2 million in a  single fiscal year, and we have about 1 month to go.   Despite all these facts, Vice President Harris said last week that  the border is secure. If our so-called border czar thinks that this is  secure, it is no wonder that we are continuing to see no viable  options, and this problem continues to explode without a solution.   The Biden administration must take swift and immediate action at the  southern border. We must restart the border wall construction, invest  in proven technologies, empower Customs and Border Patrol agents to  enforce the law, and hire more Customs and Border Patrol agents to  support the men and women who are already giving us honorable service  there.                            ____________________
