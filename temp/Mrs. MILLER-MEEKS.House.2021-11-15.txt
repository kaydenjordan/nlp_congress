 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  generosity and Iowa nice spirit of a couple from my district.   Recently, Brent and Amy Brightman, the owners of Brent's Firehouse  Coffee in Camanche, presented the Camanche Police and Fire Departments  with $2,000 each in what they hope to be the first of an annual  donation to their city's first responders.   When asked about the generosity of their donations, Brent, who has  served as a volunteer firefighter in Camanche for over a decade, said  that they started Brent's Firehouse Coffee not only to support their  community but to support first responders.   Iowa has some of the best businesses and first responders, and I am  beyond proud to see our community come together to support one another.   I thank Brent, Amy, and the first responders of Camanche for their  continued and unwavering service to our community.                            ____________________
