 Mr. Speaker, Americans have too much to lose for  Congressional Republicans to play chicken with their health insurance.   Take a family in my district, Kevin and Kim Filiatraut. Kevin and Kim  are young parents of two beautiful children, ages 7 and 5. As an  attorney in Cleveland, the family uses insurance through Kevin's  employment. Kim's job of 15 years at KeyBank was outsourced to India in  2014. They own a home, and their children go to public schools in Bay  Village.   In 2015, at age 39, Kim was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer.  When it was found, it had already spread to her liver, and she has been  on chemotherapy ever since and will be evermore. There is only hope and  medicine, indefinitely.   She is covered now, but with this preexisting condition, a repeal of  the ACA is daunting. The ACA establishes that she can never be denied  enrollment, but congressional Republicans could take this surety away  with their brash, nearsighted objective of full repeal of the ACA.   Why would we get rid of something that does so much good for Ohioans,  for Americans, with nothing and no plan to replace it?   Kim's treatment costs over $500,000 a year. Repeal of the ACA could  very well bankrupt this family.   And according to The Washington Post, repealing the Affordable Care  Act will kill more than 43,000 people in our country, annually. Repeal  of the ACA would be the most anti-life measure ever considered or  passed by this Congress.   Please vote against repeal now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding President Trump's  strange admiration for Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Our President  seems to side with Russia over Ukraine and is defaulting to tyranny  over liberty.   Despite ample evidence from our defense community and European  allies, President Trump still casts doubt on whether Moscow is backing  Russian forces who have killed over 10,000 innocent Ukrainians and who  recently killed at least eight more Ukrainian soldiers and 40 civilians  and turned off water and electricity in the invaded region.   When Bill O'Reilly asked our President if he respected Putin, a known  killer, the President replied: ``There are a lot of killers. You think  our country's so innocent?''   The President equates Mr. Putin's actions with those of our country.  It is not the first time this has happened.   Every time President Trump says something Putin likes, it is  broadcast on Kremlin-owned propaganda machines like RT. This is a  dangerous threat to liberty.   President Trump openly admires and appeases Putin, whose tenure is  known for human rights abuses, brutal suppression of political dissent,  and mysterious deaths of journalists and political opponents, like  Vladimir Kara-  [[Page H1059]]  Murza who wrote a letter critical of Putin to the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee regarding the nomination of Secretary Tillerson.  Last Thursday, while in Moscow, he fell into a life-threatening coma  believed to be caused by an unknown poison.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to normalize what President Trump is  doing. We cannot afford to take our country back to an era of unchecked  Russian aggression.   We need freedom. That is what is at stake.   I include in the Record a February 6, 2017, article by Julie  Hirschfeld Davis.                               [Feb. 6, 2017]           Trump Seems to Side With Russia in Comments on Ukraine                        (By Julie Hirschfeld Davis)         Washington.--President Trump cast doubt on whether Moscow       is backing separatists engaged in the recent escalation of       fighting in eastern Ukraine, appearing to side with President       Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has long denied involvement       in the conflict despite evidence to the contrary.        Mr. Trump said he did not take offense at the outbreak of a       lethal bout of fighting in Ukraine that came within a day of       a phone conversation he had with Mr. Putin, saying of the       recent clashes, ``we don't really know exactly what that       is.''        ``They're pro-forces,'' Mr. Trump said of the Ukrainian       separatists in an interview that aired on Monday on ``The       O'Reilly Factor,'' on Fox News. ``We don't know, are they       uncontrollable? Are they uncontrolled? That happens also.       We're going to find out; I would be surprised, but we'll       see.''        Mr. Trump's comments were the latest indication that his       desire for warmer relations with Russia may be coloring his       view of the conflict in Ukraine, which pits the country's       military--trained and equipped in part by the United States       Army--against Russian-backed separatists. Moscow has denied       involvement in the three-year conflict, despite evidence that       it has provided equipment and fighters to support separatist       forces in eastern Ukraine.        The president's push for a friendlier relationship with Mr.       Putin has alarmed Ukrainian officials, who fear that the       pressure former President Barack Obama applied on Russia to       withdraw its unacknowledged military forces from eastern       Ukraine will wane.        A telephone call Mr. Trump held on Saturday with President       Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine raised further questions about       his position on the conflict and his administration's       commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for the       annexation of Crimea.        In an official account of the call, Mr. Trump had said he       was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve the       conflict. But the statement referred to helping to ``restore       peace along the border,'' while the violence has been playing       out inside eastern Ukraine.                                   ____________________
