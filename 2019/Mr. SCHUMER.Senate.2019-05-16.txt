 Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Casey for,  as usual, his thoughtful, erudite, on-the-money remarks--this time  about judges. I am going to talk about that in a minute.   We see something happening here. We see State after State trying to  repeal Roe. When we ask our Republican colleagues directly ``Do you  want to appeal Roe?'' they are usually silent. Their votes on judges  say they do, and that is what they are doing. The voters should hold  them accountable. I will get to that more in a minute, but I wanted to  follow up on the remarks about judges by my good friend from  Pennsylvania.
