 Madam Speaker, life has been hard for the American  people as President Biden concludes his first year in office.  Unfortunately, too many in this Chamber have bowed down to the most  radical fringes of the Democratic Party.   The sad reality today is liberals in Congress have no clue what every  day, hardworking Americans are going through. They care more about  pushing their radical agenda than helping working families. The result  is more inflation, higher gas prices, unconstitutional vaccine  mandates, broken supply chains, and Americans struggling to make ends  meet.   On our side of the aisle, Republicans are committed to making sure we  get the American people back to work, ensuring that small businesses  can find employees to help keep their businesses open, making sure  Americans have uninterrupted access to goods, and getting our country  roaring back with a strong economy and safe communities. Those are the  issues that Americans really care about.   Here in Washington, Republicans will use our congressional authority  to hold the Biden administration accountable for the Afghanistan  debacle where we don't know how many Americans are still left behind in  Afghanistan, for choosing to wreck our energy sector, handing Putin the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and for allowing the southern borders to be  kept wide open. Where once we were energy independent a year ago, now  we are begging OPEC to please produce more.   Madam Speaker, after only a year of the Biden administration and his  radical governing of our country, we have had enough. The American  people have had enough. Our people, our country deserve better.
