 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, the thoughts of everyone  in the Senate are with the people of Florida, who are in the midst of  one of the worst storms ever to hit the State, as Hurricane Ian made  landfall yesterday.   Ian made landfall as a category 4 hurricane, with wind speeds  reaching 150 miles an hour and storm surges reaching reported heights  of 18 feet. About 2 million people are now without power, and  communities that dot the coastline are seeing 3 to 4 feet of flooding.   Thankfully, Ian was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning, but  the damage has already been severe, and the road to recovery will be  long.   I will continue to monitor the situation in Florida over the coming  days, and the Senate stands ready to help Floridians with whatever they  need to stay safe and rebuild their communities.   I want to thank all the first responders, National Guardsmen, and  local officials, volunteers, and every single person who placed  themselves in harm's way to keep their communities safe.                                  H.R. 6833    Madam President, now on CR funding, with a little more good-faith  negotiation between Democrats and Republicans, I am hopeful that today  is the day we will finish passing a continuing resolution to fund the  government until mid-December. Government funding is set to run out  Friday at midnight, roughly 40 hours from now, and there is no reason  at all for us to get anywhere near that deadline.   Over the past 24 hours, both sides have continued holding fruitful  negotiations to reach the finish line. We have some more work to do, a  little more, but we are close--close enough that I hope we can finish  up today, but both sides need to keep working together for that to  happen.   I urge both sides to keep going because this CR is filled with many  good things that both sides can support, like $12 billion in emergency  aid for Ukraine, to help Ukrainians with more weapons, intelligence  gathering, and aid to keep the government afloat at a time of war.  Seven months since the conflict began, it is crystal clear that  American assistance has gone a long  [[Page S5510]]  way to helping the Ukrainian people resist Putin's evil, vicious  aggression. But the fight is far from over, and we must--we must-- continue helping the brave, valiant Ukrainian people.   The CR also includes items like emergency aid to help communities  across the country hammered by natural disasters, including flooding in  States like Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas, as well as  disasters in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and New Mexico, which suffered--New  Mexico suffered its worst wildfires in the State's history earlier this  year.   Through the CR, we will also reauthorize FDA user fees for another 5  years, which is vital if we want to avoid any slowdown in the review of  new lifesaving drugs and medical devices that millions and millions of  people rely on. Reauthorizing these user fees will also prevent  thousands of hard-working FDA employees from being furloughed, many of  whom are crucial for this lifesaving review process. Finally, by  passing a CR, we will help millions of families afford their heating  and utility bills over the winter by investing $1 billion in the LIHEAP  program.    I want to recognize Senator Jack Reed and Senator Maggie Hassan for  making sure we included this funding in the CR, because thanks to their  efforts many families will have a break this winter by lowering their  utility bills.   In short, there is every reason in the world for both sides to get to  yes on finalizing the CR before the end of today. Democrats will  continue working with our Republican colleagues in good faith to find a  path to the finish line.   I want to thank our terrific chair of the Appropriations Committee,  Senator Leahy, as well as Ranking Member Shelby, for all of their hard  work on the CR. I hope this is the last CR of Chairman Leahy's  illustrious career, because we are all hopeful that the omnibus will be  the last funding bill we will do later this year.   I also want to thank all my colleagues on the committee who have  worked day and night to avoid a shutdown, as well as their dedicated  staffs. And I want to commend Senator Shelby, who has worked with  Senator Leahy in a very cooperative way.   The last thing the American people need right now is a pointless  government shutdown. I am optimistic that we are on track to avoid one,  well before the funding deadline. I thank all my colleagues for their  good work and cooperation, and I encourage them to keep going so that  we can finish the work later today.                       Nomination of Arianna J. Freeman    Madam President, on another matter, the Senate will return to the  consideration of another brilliant nominee to serve on the Federal  Bench, Arianna Freeman, nominated to serve as circuit court judge for  the Third Circuit.   Ms. Freeman is not only eminently qualified, but she is historic. She  would be the first-ever Black woman to sit on the Third Circuit,  joining in the proud company of many Biden nominees who are helping to  make the bench a more accurate reflection of our country. That is  something all of us are proud of.   A graduate of Swarthmore and Yale, Ms. Freeman would join the bench  after working with the Federal Community Defender Office for the  Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She has dedicated her career to  making sure all people, regardless of wealth or status, have equal  representation before the law. I am confident that her perspective will  be an asset to the Third Circuit, and I look forward to her  confirmation later this morning.                            Senate Accomplishments    Madam President, on our accomplishments in this Congress, finally, as  Americans are set to go to the polls in little over a month, it is time  to summarize the things that this Democratic majority has done in the  past 2 years and make clear the options that face the American people  in this election.   When Democrats assumed the majority in 2021, I promised the Senate  would address the challenges our country faces, head on and without  delay, not with timid solutions but with boldness and courage. Twenty  months later, because of Democratic leadership, we have lifted our  country out of crisis. We have a lot of work left to do, but let's take  a look at some of the major accomplishments that passed through the  Senate under this majority.   In the wake of the tragedies in Uvalde, Buffalo, and so many other  shootings, we promised the time had come to break the grip of the NRA.  So we passed the first gun safety bill America has seen in 30 years.   In the wake of high costs, dwindling tech jobs, and an emboldened  Chinese Communist Party, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act to boost  high-end manufacturing here in America, to turbocharge America's  semiconductor industry, and to secure the largest down payment in  scientific research in decades.   After years of veterans waiting around for help to treat their  cancers, lung diseases, and other ailments caused by toxic exposure,  often from burn pits, we passed the PACT Act and secured the largest  expansion of veterans' health benefits in ages.   And, finally, in the face of high energy costs and soaring healthcare  costs, as well as the ravages of climate change, Democrats passed a  groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act, which will lower people's  energy bills, make prescription drugs more affordable, cap insulin  costs for seniors on Medicare, and create millions of clean jobs for  years to come through the largest green investments in American  history--the largest green investments in American history. It will  reduce the amount of carbon that goes into the atmosphere by 40 percent  by 2030, a huge accomplishment that will make the lives of every  American now and in the future better. Passing the Inflation Reduction  Act, along with ratifying the Kigali Amendment last week, is the  strongest one-two punch against climate change any Congress has ever  taken.   I am very proud of my caucus for sticking together. With 50 votes, it  ain't easy. And this is only what we have gotten done since June.   To save our country from the worst of COVID, we passed the American  Rescue Plan to put shots in people's arms and checks in people's  pockets. We passed the first infrastructure law in years to fix our  roads, our bridges, our highways; to expand broadband to poor and rural  communities; and to protect our kids from the dangers of lead piping.   We reformed our Postal Service after decades of neglect. We  reinstated VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, to protect women from  abuse, after years of inaction. We took a stand on Asian hate crimes  and declared lynching a Federal hate crime after a century of delay. We  also unanimously ended forced arbitration for sexual harassment in the  workplace. And we confirmed the first Black woman ever to sit on the  Supreme Court of the United States when we confirmed Ketanji Brown  Jackson.   Now, these are just some of the accomplishments of the Democratic  majority. None have been easy in the longest 50-50 Senate ever, but I  am confident that America will be a better nation because of all the  things we have done in the last 2 years.   And the fight--the fight--will keep going. With every fiber of our  being, Democrats will never back away from protecting a woman's  fundamental right to choose. MAGA Republicans, meanwhile, pushing  national abortion bans, prosecutions of women and doctors, and bans  with no exceptions for rape or incest, show the contrast between the  parties--one moving forward and one looking backward and following the  MAGA dictates to the far, far right.   Democrats will also lower costs and build ladders to help people get  into the middle class and give people the means to prosper in the  middle class once they get there.   Republicans, meanwhile, have already made it clear whose corner they  are in--the rich, the executive class, the megacorporations. Without  missing a beat, Republicans gladly cut taxes for billionaires and for  big business, while openly calling for Social Security and Medicare to  go on the chopping block year after year. And for good measure, while  Democrats want to keep taxes low for working and middle-class  Americans, some on the other side have openly called for raising  taxes--raising taxes--on working families.    So the contrast here is not hard to grasp. The choices between the  parties run deep; the consequences to our  [[Page S5511]]  country, enormous. We have many challenges left to overcome as a  nation, but the choice is now between the party that will build on all  the progress we have made or one that will undo everything we have  worked to accomplish, between a party that will protect our freedoms  and a party that will conspire to take them away, between a party that  believes America is at its best when we invest in all people or a party  that will only look after the ultrarich.   Remember, their major accomplishment when they had the majority was  tax cuts for the very wealthy. I am confident that Americans will know  which party is fighting in their corner.   I want to thank all my colleagues for their excellent work over the  past 2 years, and I look forward to building on all that work we have  accomplished to set America on a path to prosperity in the 21st  century.                              Order of Business    Madam President, for the information of the Senate, we expect to vote  on the confirmation of the Freeman nomination to be United States  Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, upon reconsideration, at 11:30  a.m. today. Additional votes are expected this afternoon.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to  reconsider the vote on the confirmation by which Executive Calendar No.  1043, the nomination of Arianna J. Freeman, of Pennsylvania, to be  United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, was not confirmed.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which  Executive Calendar No. 1043 was not confirmed.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for any  nominations confirmed during today's session of the Senate, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session; that it be in order for Senator Braun to  offer amendment No. 5765; that at 1:45 p.m., all motions and amendments  other than the substitute be withdrawn; that no further amendments be  in order to the bill; that substitute amendment No. 5745 be agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time; and that  the Senate vote on the passage of the bill, as amended, with 60  affirmative votes required for passage, without further intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, there  will be two rollcall votes at 1:45 p.m. The first vote will be on the  passage of the continuing resolution to fund the government through  December 16. The second vote will be on the confirmation of the Gomez  nomination upon reconsideration.  [[Page S5516]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, in a few moments we will vote on the  continuing resolution to fund the government through mid-December.   This legislation avoids a very bad thing, shutting down the  government, and does a lot of good things: money for the people of  Ukraine, funding for communities reeling from natural disasters, aid to  families with their heating bills--just to name a few. I am very  thankful to all the Senators, particularly Chairman Leahy and Ranking  Member Shelby, who made this possible.   This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation, following many other  bipartisan bills that we have done in this session, and I am glad that  we came to a timely conclusion and didn't go right up to the brink and  risk a shutdown. Millions and millions of people can breathe easy  knowing that we have done this in a timely way and the money to  continue the government will be there.   Of particular importance is the money to Ukraine. These people have  struggled so valiantly. Make no mistake about it. American weaponry and  help have helped them turn the tide of the war. We cannot stop now, and  we are not going to.   The heat program is so important. Winter is coming upon us. The  program is running out of money. While we probably will get more money  in the omnibus in December, between now and Christmas, there are going  to be a lot of cold days, and people are going to need that heat money.   The money for natural disasters--in my judgment, as a result of  climate change, we have many more disasters, so we need more help, and  this will go to many States and many parts of the country.   So I want to thank, again, Senator Leahy. I want to thank Senator  Shelby. I want to thank the members of the Appropriations Committee. I  want to thank all the staff--mine and others--who worked so long and  hard to get this done.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, the CR is a great bipartisan bill that  is going to help a whole lot of people, and we are keeping the  government open with ample time.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 45, which was  submitted earlier today and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Madam President, I move to proceed to the motion to  reconsider the vote on confirmation by which Executive Calendar No.  670, the nomination of Lisa M. Gomez, of New Jersey, to be an Assistant  Secretary of Labor, was not confirmed.    Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which  Executive Calendar No. 670 was not confirmed.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the  conclusion of morning business on Tuesday, October 11, the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 467, H.R. 7900.

Proceeding to the NDAA will save us valuable time, enabling  us to get more done. But Members should be prepared for an extremely-- underline ``extremely''--busy agenda in the last 2 months of this  Congress.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S5524]]     Mr. President, when I made the announcement for the  information of Senators, I said we will return--the next vote, rollcall  vote, will be on November 14 at 5:30 p.m. That is correct, but that is  a Monday, not a Tuesday.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.

Respondek; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  any of the nominations; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of the Senate, the President  of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the majority and minority  leaders be authorized to make appointments to commissions, committees,  boards, conferences, or interparliamentary conferences authorized by  law, by concurrent action of the two Houses, or by the order of the  Senate until 3 p.m., Monday, November 14.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Cardin, Duckworth, Kaine, Schatz, Schumer, Van Hollen, and Warner be  authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions through  November 14, 2022.

I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
