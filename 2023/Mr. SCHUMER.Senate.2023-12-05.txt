 Mr. President, later today, President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy will address Senators through a secured video at our  classified briefing on the war in Ukraine. This will be at least the  third time President Zelenskyy has addressed Senators since the  beginning of the war. The last time he spoke to us, his message was  direct and unsparing: Without more aid from Congress, Ukraine does not  have the means to defeat Vladimir Putin.   Without more aid from Congress, Ukraine may fall. Democracy in Europe  will be in peril. And those who think Vladimir Putin will stop merely  at Ukraine willfully ignore the clear and unmistakable warnings of  history.   It is, therefore, urgent for the Senate to pass a security  supplemental. Last night, I filed cloture on a motion to proceed to a  vehicle the Senate can use as a supplemental package. We will have our  first vote on this vehicle Wednesday in the afternoon. I urge my  colleagues to think about what is at stake in this moment in history. I  implore them to do what is necessary to protect America's security.   If we allow Vladimir Putin to march through Europe, if we abandon  Ukraine in its hour of need, it will make the world a more hostile  place for democracy and Western values. It will send a message to the  world that America is not up to the task of protecting democracy and  Western values in this century. It will be a gift to the Chinese  Communist Party, to the regime in Iran, to adversaries around the world  who want nothing more than to see our demise.   The Ukrainians are fighting valiantly. They haven't asked for  American troops, with the concomitant casualties and pain that would  cause. All they need is adequate weaponry. How can we turn them down?  How can we turn them down?   There is only one right answer. We must do what America has always  done through her history: defend democracy, stand up to autocratic  thugs like Putin, and put our adversaries on notice that America's  resolve will not falter.  [[Page S5720]]    Now, the Senate's supplemental package remains on hold because our  Republican colleagues have insisted that they need an immigration  proposal to pass. While immigration is important, it is a separate  issue from foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel and humanitarian aid to  Gaza and the Indo-Pacific. It is a difficult issue we have debated and  never come to a conclusion on for decades. It is extraneous to this  debate.   Some of our Republican leaders say: Well, that is what the public  wants.   Yes, the public wants border, but it is unrelated to Ukraine. Our  Republican friends are saying they will defend democracy only at a  price unacceptable to Democrats, and the price is forcing Congress to  accept radical immigration policies that come straight from Donald  Trump.   One Republican Senator said yesterday--listen to this. He said:         This is not a traditional negotiation, where we expect to       come up with a bipartisan compromise on the border. This is a       price that has to be paid in order to get the supplemental.    No compromise--why are we sitting down and talking if there is never  going to be a compromise? What that Republican Senator said, Mr.  President, is the textbook definition of hostage-taking.   I want to be clear. First, Democrats want to deal with the problems  of immigration and the border. We have been trying for years. But--I  also want to be clear--if Republicans had not brought up immigration,  an important but separate and partisan issue that has been debated for  decades, Ukraine funding would not be in danger right now.   This mess was created entirely by hard-right Republicans, and,  alarmingly, Republican leadership has gotten behind them. And most of  those hard-right Republicans who say we must have border don't want to  vote for aid for Ukraine, in any case.   If funding for Ukraine fails, it will not be a bipartisan failure. It  will be a failure solely caused by the Republican Party and the  Republican leadership because it was a decision of that Republican  leadership, pushed by the hard right, many of whom want Ukraine to  fail, to make border a precondition to supporting Ukraine.   Let me say that again because the logic is perfectly clear and  irrefutable. If funding for Ukraine fails, the failure will solely be  on the Republican Party because it was the decision of the Republican  leadership, pushed by the hard right, many of whom want Ukraine to  fail, to make border a precondition to supporting Ukraine.   Now, even though we warned Republicans about the dangers of injecting  partisan border issues which threaten to derail aid to Ukraine, we sat  down at the negotiating table in good faith. We said from the get-go we  would be willing to compromise. Everyone would like to come to a  compromise on border--a bipartisan compromise, a real compromise, not  one side demanding everything, as that one Republican Senator said.    For 3 weeks, Democrats have tried to be reasonable with our  Republican colleagues to see if we can find some common ground on  immigration. Some days, these negotiations look promising. We have been  more than willing to show compromise. But, sadly, each time we try to  meet Republicans at the middle, they have been moving the goalposts  back, proposing nasty policies like indefinite detention for asylum  seekers and sweeping powers to shut down our entire immigration system,  which has been a hallmark of America for centuries.   After Speaker Johnson said last week that only policies along the  lines of H.R. 2 can make it through the House, Republican negotiators  here in the Senate gave up even pretending to show compromise. That is  why the negotiations broke off Friday night. Republicans pulled the  goalposts way back and proposed many items plucked directly from H.R. 2  or very similar to it--the same H.R. 2 that got not a single Democratic  vote here in the Senate, the same H.R. 2 that couldn't even pass on the  House floor, when it is attached to Ukraine, because it needs  Democratic votes to pass it because 30 Republican Congressmen won't  vote for any Ukraine aid. So despite Democrats' best efforts,  negotiations have been going in circles.   Look, we want to find a way to solve immigration with our Republican  colleagues. We know this is an important issue. We have many Members  who represent border States and border communities. But if Republicans  are holding up aid to Ukraine because they want us to work with them on  border, the onus is on them to present to us a realistic, bipartisan  proposal that can actually pass the Senate, with aid to Ukraine as  well. And we need a bipartisan proposal that can get the broad support  of Democrats, not just one or two while the rest of us are strongly in  opposition.   Again, if Republicans want to bring up immigration right now, right  in the middle of trying to pass aid to Ukraine and other issues, the  onus is on them to present serious bipartisan proposals that can get  broad support from Democrats, not just one or two Democrats. And if  Republicans are unable to produce a broadly bipartisan immigration  proposal, they should not block aid to Ukraine in response.   They should not be resorting to hostage-taking, as the Senator from  Texas seems to be admitting. That would be madness--utter madness. It  would be an insult to our Ukrainian friends, who are fighting for their  lives against Russian autocracy, and it could go down as a major  turning point where the West didn't live up to its responsibilities and  things turned away from our democracies and our values and toward  autocracy.   Ronald Reagan would be rolling in his grave--rolling in his grave--if  he saw his own party let Vladimir Putin roll through Europe.   So, once again, I urge my Republican colleagues to think carefully  about what is at stake with this week's vote. What we do now will  reverberate across the world for years and decades to come, and  history--history--will render harsh judgment on those who abandon  democracy for Donald Trump's extreme immigration policies.    Madam Vice President, today is historic. Vice President  Harris has just cast her 32nd tiebreaking vote--the most tiebreakers  ever. I join all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, thanking  the Vice President for her leadership and for making the work of the  Senate possible.   The record Vice President Harris sets today is significant not just  because of the number but because of what she has made possible with  tiebreaking votes. Without her tiebreaking votes, there would be no  American Rescue Plan, no Inflation Reduction Act, and we would not have  confirmed many of the excellent Federal judges now presiding on the  bench. Every time duty has called, Vice President Harris has answered  more than any other Vice President in our Nation's long and storied  history.   Today, I also want to thank the Vice President for doing all of this  while juggling the immense responsibilities of her office. She has led  the charge on protecting freedom of choice. She has fought for climate  justice, criminal justice reform, and commonsense gun safety. Our  children--our children--will live in a healthier, more secure, more  prosperous nation thanks to her lifetime of service.   So thank you, Vice President Harris. This is a great milestone, and  yours is an even greater legacy. Let us continue working together to  make life better for all Americans.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Thank you, majority leader.    As for a little housekeeping after that history, I ask  unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak, followed by Senators  Hagerty and Kaine, prior to the recess; further, that all postcloture  time be considered expired at 2:15 p.m.; and further, that following  the confirmation vote on the AliKhan nomination, the Senate recess for  the all-Senators briefing until 4:30 p.m.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I have the happy duty of asking unanimous  consent that the Senate consider the following nominations en bloc--it  is a lot of numbers, so I will read them slowly for the sake of being  transcribed--Calendar Nos. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 82, 83, 84, 85,  86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103,  104, 105, 106, 107, 110, 111, 112, 113, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,  136, 137, 138, 139, 180, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 189, 190, 191,  192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 199, 200, 201, 203, 204, 205, 224, 225,  226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241,  242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 248, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 289, 290, 291,  293, 294, 295, 296, 325, 326, 327, 330, 331, 332, 336, 337, 339, 340,  342, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386,  387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422--excepting  Col. David D. Berkland, Col. Benjamin R. Jonsson, COL John W. Sannes,  COL Andrew O. Saslav, CAPT Brian J. Anderson, Brig. Gen. Scott A. Cain,  Brig. Gen. Paul D. Moga, and BG Lawrence G. Ferguson; that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate,  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Now, Mr. President, today, hundreds--hundreds--of  military families across the country can breathe a sigh of relief. The  Senate has now unanimously confirmed hundreds  [[Page S5734]]  of military nominations that were held up for 10 months by a single  person: the Senator from Alabama. Thank God, these military officers  will now get the promotions they so rightfully earned.   I am happy that, after so much unnecessary delay by one Senator, we  have finally moved forward and given these men and women the promotions  they deserve. And we will work to confirm the rest of the nominees that  were on hold very soon.   While today's confirmations are good news, these holds should never  have happened in the first place. Unfortunately, resolving this impasse  took too long, risking our national security and throwing the lives of  so many military families into discombobulation. I am glad that  pointless and gravely damaging ordeal has finally, finally ended.   Now, let this incident be a warning: No one--no one--should attempt  this in the Senate again. The senior Senator from Alabama has nothing  to show for his 10 months of delay--no law is changing in any way-- except for the damage he did to our military readiness and the pain he  caused to military families. If every Senator did what Senator  Tuberville tried to do and held up military confirmations because of  this or that partisan issue, no matter how deeply felt, it would grind  the Senate to a halt. It would be a catastrophe for our military.  Holding up military nominations was an unsuccessful and risky strategy  in this instance and should never, ever happen again.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who spoke  out in defense of our military families. I want to thank, particularly,  Senator Reed, the chair of the Armed Services Committee; Senator  Klobuchar, the chair of the Rules Committee; and I really want to thank  Senators Ernst and Sullivan for their courage in helping break the  logjam after so, so many months. For all those who played a part in  bringing this impasse to an end, thank you. Thank you. It took  patience. It took resolve. But we have emerged on the right side of  where we should be.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 352.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, December 5,  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have two requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                             COMMITTEE ON FINANCE    The Committee on Finance is authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10 a.m., to conduct a  hearing.                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m. on Wednesday, December 6; that following the prayer and pledge,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the Rayes nomination; further, that the  cloture motions filed during yesterday's session ripen at 12:30 p.m.;  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's  session, that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:58 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 6, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
