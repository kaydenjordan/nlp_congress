 So I'm telling all of my colleagues, this is the       fight of our life.         And what we've got to do is fight in Congress,       fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online,       fight at the ballot box.         Fight him in Congress, fight him in the courts,       fight him in the streets.         This is the fight of our lives.        Vice President BIDEN. Fight of their lives.         So Donald Trump will not be able to run for       office again.
