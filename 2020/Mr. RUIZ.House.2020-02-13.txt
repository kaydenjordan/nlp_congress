 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tribal leaders  from around the country gathered in Washington, D.C., for the National  Congress of American Indians' 2020 Winter Executive Session.   NCAI was founded in 1944 with the mission to protect and enhance the  sovereign rights of Tribal nations and to secure a prosperous future  for Native communities.   In fact, initially, NCAI had to fight against many restrictions and  injustices perpetrated by this very body. It is this complicated and  challenging history that is the backdrop of the work we do here today.   It is important, then, that the United States Government works to  honor Tribal sovereignty, promote self-determination, and fulfill the  trust responsibility to Native Tribes.   We must also pass advanced appropriations for the Indian Health  Service and provide resources to upgrade the roads, schools, and  internet access across Indian Country.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to take up these issues immediately  and do our part to support our Tribal partners.                            ____________________
