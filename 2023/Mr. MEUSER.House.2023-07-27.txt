 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, during the debt ceiling  negotiations, some of my colleagues across the aisle baselessly claimed  that Republicans were cutting funding for our Nation's veterans, which  was entirely unfounded and untrue.   As Members of this House, Republicans have always supported those who  served our country, and our MILCON-VA funding legislation this past  week further proves this fact.   In this year's appropriations bill, not only did we not cut funding  for veterans, but rather we fully fund their healthcare and benefits  programs to ensure our veterans receive the timely care they have  rightfully earned and deserve.   Additionally, the GOP is continuing to fight to improve the quality  of life of Active Duty servicemembers by supporting the construction of  new family housing units and childcare centers. In my district, Fort  Indiantown Gap is receiving a significant level of funding for  necessary upgrades.   Our bill, Mr. Speaker, also keeps ideology and politics out of the  care of veterans by, quite frankly, rightfully prohibiting from our  military the use of funds to advance such things as critical race  theory and disallowing the implementation, administration, and  enforcement of President Biden's executive orders on diversity, equity,  and inclusion.   These functions and plans probably have a place in society, where  appropriate, but certainly not in our military because in the military,  we continue to respect all Americans who are willing to serve.   Republicans as well, Mr. Speaker, just recently passed the strongest  NDAA in history, which included the largest pay raise in 20 years for  our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and our marines. Despite this,  only a handful, Mr. Speaker, of our Democrat colleagues voted for it.   House Republicans have supported and will continue to support our  military and those who risk their lives and make the sacrifices  necessary to serve our great country, and I am appreciative.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to support H.R. 4366.                            ____________________
