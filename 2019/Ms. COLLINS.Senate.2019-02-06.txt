 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Reviving  America's Scenic Byways Act, a bill I have introduced with my colleague  from Maryland, Senator Cardin. Our bill seeks to revive the long- dormant process within the U.S. Department of Transportation through  which some of our Nation's most remarkable roadways can earn the  prestigious designation of ``National Scenic Byway.''   The National Scenic Byways Program began as a grassroots effort to  help recognize, preserve, and enhance selected roads throughout the  United States based on one or more cultural, historic, natural,  recreational, and scenic qualities. Today, there are more than 150  distinct roads nationwide that have been recognized as National Scenic  Byways--including several which have gained the honor of being named an  ``All-American Road.''   I am proud that my home State of Maine boasts not only three National  Scenic Byways, but also the Acadia All-American Road. These roadways  provide Mainers and tourists alike with spectacular views and memorable  experiences, while at the same time spurring much-needed economic  activity in the surrounding areas. The National Scenic Byways program  represents a true win-win scenario by protecting precious corridors and  providing tangible benefits for local communities.   Despite this program's proven value, its nomination process has been  inactive since the passage of the 2012 surface transportation funding  bill (also known as MAP-21). As a result, numerous roadways across the  country have been prevented from pursuing National Scenic Byway  designation.   In fact, a recent survey found that at least 44 State scenic byways  across the country are prepared to seek national designation as soon as  the program is reopened to nominations. It is critical that we provide  these local byways the opportunity to seek the Federal designation and  reap its demonstrated benefits.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which in  turn supports the preservation of America's  [[Page S921]]  most unique roadways and the facilitation of increased economic  activity in the regions that they serve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Wicker):   S. 359. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude  from gross income certain Federally-subsidized loan repayments for  dental school faculty; to the Committee on Finance.
