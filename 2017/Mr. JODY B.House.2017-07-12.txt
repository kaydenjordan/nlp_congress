 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this amendment.   As we all know, over the past 8 years, the world certainly has become  a more dangerous place, and we face a variety of threats that, quite  frankly, we are not keeping pace with, and we simply cannot continue a  pattern of underfunding our military.   Yes, we must keep our financial house in order, but we absolutely  cannot afford to allow the quality of our national defense to decline  by further defense budget cuts.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
