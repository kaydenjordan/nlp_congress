 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity and support for  one of America's greatest friends and allies, but one the Obama  administration has sadly abandoned in its last days in office: the  State of Israel.   Since September of 2015 alone, in Israel, 42 people have been killed  in terrorist attacks, and 602 people, including four Palestinians, have  been injured. Yet, last month, the United Nations Security Council felt  the need to condemn Israel with a misguided resolution the United  States should have vetoed.   In fact, as long as Israel has been part of the U.N., it has been  treated with little respect and almost openly disdained. In 2016, there  were more resolutions regarding Israel at the U.N.  [[Page H62]]  than there were regarding Syria, North Korea, Iran, South Sudan, and  Russia combined. That is simply an unacceptable way to treat the only  peaceful democratic state in the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join together in sending  a strong, bipartisan message this week to rebuke this misguided  resolution so we can get back on a path to a peaceful solution to  conflict in the Middle East.                            ____________________
