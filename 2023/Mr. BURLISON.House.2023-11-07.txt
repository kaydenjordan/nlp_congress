 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment,  which would prohibit funds from going to the Charging and Fueling  Infrastructure Program. This grant program was created in 2021 in the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to strategically deploy electric  vehicle charging stations around the country.   The reason that I filed this amendment is simple. It is not the role  of the Federal Government to subsidize the electric vehicle charging  industry.   After spending billions of taxpayer dollars and bribing the affluent  to buy electric vehicles, it turns out only one-third of the population  wants to even buy one or aspires to buy one, and two-thirds are not  even considering purchasing one. The two-thirds who are not considering  it don't want to be forced to pay for the others.   Maybe you like electric vehicles. In fact, I actually do, personally.  I test-drove a Tesla and loved it, but it would be immoral for me to  force my neighbors and compel them through the force of government to  subsidize my new electric vehicle.   In essence, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul. The fact is, this  program will cost taxpayers $2.5 billion dollars, which will all be  debt, for something that most Americans cannot afford and are unable to  appreciate.   It is not the government's job to pick winners and losers in the  energy market. That is the role of consumers and businesses operating  in a free market.   Here we are, once again, using tax dollars to subsidize and force a  product on people where there is little demand. If the direct cost to  taxpayers doesn't bother you, the indirect costs, including the higher  energy prices, the cost of making the electricity grid more reliable,  and increased dependence on China are arguably worse.   When the government subsidizes the EV infrastructure, it does so by  raising energy prices for everyone. The installation of new charging  stations also makes our electricity grid less reliable, further putting  Americans at risk to having blackouts, brownouts, or other reliability  issues.   Finally, maybe worst of all, it is not just that Americans are being  priced out of affordable, reliable energy; it is not just that we are  rigging the market against our own constituents, but we are also  selling them out to the Chinese Communist Party.   These electric charging stations and electric car batteries require a  massive amount of resources from China, which controls the world's  critical minerals supply chain.   America was energy independent just 3 short years ago, but through  the government electric vehicle scam we have allowed Communist China to  establish an EV monopoly all while Americans get poorer. It is time  that we stop forcing Americans to foot the bill for other people and  instead focus on making our energy system more reliable and affordable.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we didn't have to subsidize or have grant  programs to create the very robust infrastructure of fuel stations that  exist across this country. It happened on its own through the free  market. That is all I am suggesting.   The average price of an electric vehicle now is around $66,000, and  the median income is less than that. It is $59,000 a year. So when the  government subsidizes an electric vehicle infrastructure, it is not  free money. It is not free. It is taxpayer money. Because of the  situation we are in, this is all debt.   It is not just a one-time cost, as well. These subsidies are a  continuous drain on the public funds that could be used for real hard  infrastructure that all Americans can use, things like roads and  bridges.  [[Page H5511]]    The average family is priced out entirely from purchasing an EV in  the market but is still paying for it on the back end with higher  energy costs, higher taxes, and a less reliable grid.   Ultimately, it is the poorest people in this country who are hit the  hardest when the Federal Government redistributes tax dollars to  subsidize the EVs for those who can't afford it.                                time  1715    This is basically a reverse Robin Hood. I repeat, it is a reverse  Robin Hood. Instead of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, we  are taking from the poor, and we are giving it to the rich. We are  making them pay taxes on someone else's luxury item while telling them  to stop using cheap, reliable energy that they need to survive.   The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is just another  classic example of the government picking winners and losers. If  Americans want a product, then the market will reflect that without our  need to artificially increase the demand.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
