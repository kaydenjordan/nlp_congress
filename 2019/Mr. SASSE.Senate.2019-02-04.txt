 Mr. President, thank you.   In a few minutes, the U.S. Senate is going to have an opportunity to  condemn infanticide. One hundred U.S. Senators are going to have an  opportunity to unanimously say the most basic thing imaginable, and  that is that it is wrong to kill a little newborn baby. Every Senator  will have the opportunity to stand for human dignity, to stand for the  belief that in this country all of us are created equal, because if  that equality means anything, surely it means that infanticide is  wrong.   Frankly, this shouldn't be hard. Politicians come to this floor every  single day and talk about how they care for the poorest or the weakest  or the most marginalized members of our society. In recent weeks, I  have heard it stated this way in powerful, eloquent, and, from some  ambitious Senators, very clear terms about human dignity.   One of my distinguished colleagues recently on the campaign trail  declared rightly ``that the people in our society who are the most  often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and the  vulnerable.'' Amen to that.   Another Democratic Senator seeking the Presidency said they seek to  ``build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind.''  Amen to that.   Giving words of hope and encouragement, a third Senator reminded us  that ``no matter where you live in America . . . you deserve a path to  opportunity.'' Amen to that.   A fourth continued that this individual was committed ``to fight for  other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own.'' Yet again,  Amen.   But, sadly, in the last week, these beautiful and inspiring words  have been choked out by the ugliness and the cruelty from another  public official. In Virginia, disgraced Governor Ralph Northam  tarnished the American idea of equality under law. He betrayed the  universal truth of human dignity, and he turned the stomachs of  civilized people, not just in this country but in every country on  Earth.   Governor Northam endorsed infanticide. He said:         The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be       resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family       desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the       physicians and the mother.    This was the quote--that the infant would be kept comfortable and  resuscitated if that is what the mom and doctors wanted to do, and then  they could have a debate about what to do next. He was literally  talking about allowing space and time for a discussion about  infanticide--no euphemisms or weasel words there. Infants can be kept  comfortable and resuscitated, and baby girls could be left cold and  alone to die.   Just a few years ago, the abortion lobby was really clear in its talk  about hoping that abortion would be safe and legal, but rare. This was  the slogan. Abortion would be ``safe, legal, and rare.'' Now we are  talking about keeping a baby comfortable while the doctors have a  debate about infanticide. That is what we are talking about here on the  floor tonight. We are not talking about second-trimester abortion. We  are not having some big, complicated discussion about a mother's  reproductive freedom. As important as all of those debates are, we are  actually talking about babies that have been born.   The only debate on the floor tonight is about infanticide. The  abortion industry's PR army couldn't defend this. Many in the national  media decided to overlook it, but none of us in this body can escape  it. What we are talking about on the Senate floor tonight is  infanticide.   Instead of saying he misspoke and instead of offering an apology, the  Governor of Virginia decided to double down on the ugliness and  cruelty. This is not about a clump of cells. This is about fourth- trimester abortion. That is actually what we are talking about here  tonight.   Governor Northam is a disgraced coward, and he has such an abysmally  low belief of human dignity that he couldn't say this basic truth: It  is wrong to let babies who have been born die. He couldn't say it.   This isn't about Republicans and Democrats. We are way beyond that.  Everyone in the Senate ought to be able to say unequivocally that the  little baby deserves life, that she has rights, and that killing her is  wrong. Tonight every Member of this body has that chance.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act prohibits exactly  the kind of infanticide Governor Northam was endorsing. That is it. It  is based on the simple idea that every baby deserves a fighting chance.  It is a simple idea that every human being is an image bearer. Even the  weakest and most marginalized among us is no less human, and every one  of us has a moral obligation to defend the defenseless.   It is my understanding that some of my Democratic colleagues are  prepared to object tonight. I humbly say that I don't understand why,  and I beg you from the bottom of my heart not to do so.   Please don't betray the ideals that have been so eloquently  expressed. Please don't reduce truths to an empty campaign slogan, and  please don't take the principle of dignity and equality this cheaply.   There are two sides of the debate on the floor tonight. You are  either for babies or you are defending infanticide. That is actually  what the legislation is before us.   Please don't block this legislation. Please don't let Governor  Northam define you. Don't let an extremist pro-abortion lobby and  pledge hold you hostage. Please don't protect infanticide.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 130 and that  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    With all due respect, Mr. President----    To the Senator from Washington, the bill we are talking  about before this body tonight is because New York and Virginia--New  York already and Virginia in debate--are having a conversation about  removing exactly these protections. This debate is about infanticide  and infanticide only, and this is a sad day for this body.   It shouldn't be controversial to say that a newborn child deserves to  be treated with dignity and humanity. It shouldn't be difficult to say  that babies who survive an abortion shouldn't be left to die cold and  alone on that table.   I am sad, but I am not discouraged. I am actually encouraged by the  strong group of Senators who cosponsored this legislation and who have  come to the floor to support it tonight, and I am encouraged by the  millions and millions and millions of pro-life Americans who continue  to speak the truth in love. There is legislative work we need to do,  but, far more importantly, in the movement for love and life and  science and little babies, what we need to have happen is a lot more  persuasion and a lot more conversation with our neighbors. A number of  my colleagues on the floor tonight are prepared to do just that, and I  look forward to listening to their eloquent and love-based, science- based speech.   Thank you.    Mr. President, this is gross, what has happened here  tonight. We should pass this by unanimous consent. If we continue being  unable to pass it by unanimous consent, a lot of us are going to  continue to fight for a rollcall vote because it is the right thing to  do. Those little babies aren't Republicans or Democrats; they are  babies. They need protection from all of us.   I thank the Presiding Officer.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 9, which was  received from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be  agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all time postcloture on S.  1 be considered expired at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 5.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration S. 1 and that the  Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings; finally, that all time during recess, adjournment,  morning business, and leader remarks count postcloture on S. 1.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:37 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, February 5, 2019, at 10 a.m.
