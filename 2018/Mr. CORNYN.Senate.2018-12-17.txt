 Madam President, at 5:30, we will be voting on the first  procedural step to take up criminal justice reform legislation that  started back in 2013 when I introduced a bill we called Federal prison  reform. This legislation is based on prison reform, but it has taken on  some additional attributes relative to how we sentence and how judges  sentence people convicted of various crimes.   Let me explain a little bit about why this should be a priority for  the Senate and for the Congress and for the country. We know the cycle  of crime is all too common. People commit crimes. They serve time in  prison. They get out of prison. They commit another crime. They serve  time again in prison. They are released.   A few years ago, this is what one young man in Houston said when he  was talking about his own experience: He called himself a ``frequent  flyer''--somebody caught in that revolving door of prison and crime.  [[Page S7641]]    In Texas, in 2007, or thereabouts, we had some farsighted visionary  leaders, actually, who decided instead of just being tough on crime,  which Texas has always had a reputation for, we needed to be smart on  crime too. A little more than a decade ago, Texas prisons were bursting  at the seams. We had more people incarcerated in Texas prisons than any  State in the Nation, and tragically we also had high recidivism rates.  So it was obvious we were doing something wrong, and we needed to up  our game.   The Legislative Budget Board in our State estimated that in the next  5 years, Texas would need as many as 17,000 new prison beds to house  the growing inmate population. So two options became clear: build more  costly prisons with the same tragic results or fix the system, and we  chose the latter.   I would say, some of our colleagues and some of the critics of the  underlying bill say: Well, the best way to keep communities safe is to  keep criminals in prison. There are some people, sadly, who will never  take advantage of the opportunity to transform their lives through  faith-based programs, deal with their drug and alcohol addiction, learn  a skill, get a GED; in other words, there are some people,  unfortunately, we can't save, but there are others who understand they  have made a mistake and paid their debt to society and want to turn  their lives around. Those are the type of people this criminal justice  reform bill speaks to.   In the beginning in my State, the decision was largely driven by  cost. The estimated pricetag to build new prisons exceeded $2 billion.  You can imagine what that does to a State's budget, but instead of  leaving taxpayers with the bill and just moving on, a visionary group  of State legislators decided to dive further into the problem to try to  understand it better and propose cost-effective ways to fix it. These  fixes came in a number of forms which, looking back on it now, seem  pretty obvious, pretty intuitive but, at the time, really was  revolutionary.   First were improvements in our parole system, which means that once  people got out of prison, people were then supervised while out of  prison to make sure they met the conditions of their parole. They  didn't get involved with the same bad company that helped them get in  trouble in the first place, and they didn't start using drugs again,  and they kept fully employed.   So this parole supervision targeted 10 percent fewer revocations and  graduated sanctions for small rules violations such as missed meetings.  That is particularly important because one of the first indications  that somebody who is on parole is in trouble is when they don't show up  for their meeting with their parole officer. In the past, that was just  pretty much blown off until those missed meetings began to accumulate,  and then, ultimately, that individual found themselves arrested, back  in jail, and ultimately back in prison. So rather than letting these  small infractions pile up, eventually sending the person back to  prison, each misstep was dealt with swiftly and surely.   In 2005, $55 million was appropriated to Texas probation departments  to make improvements in how we supervise people who had once been in  prison, with most of the funds going toward reducing caseloads. In  other words, parole officers, probation officers, if they have to  handle so many cases, they can't give them the individual attention  they need and that the formerly incarcerated individual will benefit  from. That brought the number of cases down from nearly 150 in some  areas to 110 probationers per officer. This allowed for closer  supervision and constant application of sanctions when called for.   The results were pretty dramatic. In 2005, our State was paroling  21,000 prisoners, 11,000 of whom returned to prison after committing  other crimes. So that means a little more than 50 percent were  eventually going back to prison. A decade later, putting in place these  reforms, the State paroled 28,000 prisoners, and about 4,500 came  back--or only 16 percent. So we went from about half of the people in  prison being paroled without much supervision and much help to only 16  percent because of these reforms.   These reforms, as I said at the outset, may not look so obvious--and  it seems so intuitive that it seems clear to us today--but at the time,  it was pretty groundbreaking.   As we all know, for many politicians, one of their biggest fears when  it comes to their next election is being accused of being soft on  crime, but, again, this is not about being tough on crime or soft on  crime, this is about being smart on crime and getting the best results.   The decline in revocations led to the savings of $119 million for  Texas taxpayers--more than double the initial investment in these  programs.   Second were improvements to prison alternatives for low-level,  nonviolent offenders. Judges and prosecutors and corrections officials  were frustrated by the number of these individuals who kept ending up  right back where they started, with no real change in their trajectory  and certainly no more hope for their future. So the State started to  provide funding to increase access to things like substance abuse  treatment, drug courts, and mental illness treatment.   Again, the reason why people end up in prison often has very little  to do with their desire to live a life of crime; many of them feed  their addiction by theft and other crimes. People who are mentally ill  who go to jail or prison, without a diagnosis in treatment, don't get  any better, and when they get let out of jail and prison, they just go  back deteriorating until they become a danger to themselves and others.   In addition, mandatory prerelease programs were expanded to reduce  the backlog of inmates waiting to complete these requirements. In other  words, there were a lot more people who wanted to go through these  programs because they recognized the benefit to themselves and their  families, but they just simply couldn't get into the programs because  there weren't enough slots.   For example, the expansion of a drug treatment plan brought down wait  time from 1 year to 4 months. If you are somebody with a drug problem,  and you are told: ``We don't have room for you. Come back in a year,''  that can be, obviously, discouraging and not result in getting them the  help they need.   Moving the wait time for drug treatment down from 1 year to 4 months  moved two-thirds of the waitlist into treatment, after which they were  released, only to see a more hopeful and better outcome.   In Texas, the model worked. Not only did we avoid building new  prisons, we have actually closed eight prisons in Texas. Again, this  sounds a little shocking if you are from other parts of the country  where you hear about our tough-on-crime reputation, but because of  these reforms, we were actually able to close eight prisons because  they were no longer needed. We quickly saw a reduction in both  incarceration and crime rates by double digits at the same time.   To me, this is the essence of criminal justice reform. There are some  who say: We need to do criminal justice reform because, well, we simply  imprison too many people. There are others who say: Well, we imprison  people for offenses that are disproportionate to what they have done.  To me, the essence of criminal justice reform is reducing the crime  rate--in other words, increasing and improving public safety.   Other States took notice of what was happening and started to do the  same. Georgia, Rhode Island, and North Carolina quickly followed suit,  and we have seen several other States across the United States adopt  similar reforms.   When I say we saw a reduction in both incarceration and crime rates,  let me give a couple of numbers.   From 2005 to 2016, Texas's FBI index crime plummeted by more than 34  percent. In the same period, the incarceration rate dropped 23 percent.  Those are pretty shocking and surprising numbers. The crime rate went  down 34 percent, and the incarcerate rate dropped 23 percent. You would  think the opposite would be true--that with incarceration rates going  down, the crime rate would go up--but because of these visionary  programs and reforms, they simply worked in tandem to both reduce the  incarceration rate and improve public safety at the same time.   It is clear now, based on experience, that these reforms and outcomes  are real. I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate  Judiciary Committee since 2013 to try to bring these  [[Page S7642]]  reforms now to the national level. The FIRST STEP Act is our  opportunity to do just that this week in the Senate.   Thanks to the primary sponsors of the FIRST STEP Act--the Senator  from Illinois, who has joined us here in the Chamber, the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, Mike Lee, Pat Leahy, and  others who have worked on this bill. Sheldon Whitehouse and I worked  primarily on the prison reform bill.   The current bill has undergone some major improvements over the last  few weeks, which I am very proud of. The previous version of this  legislation had a number of very positive attributes. In fact, more  than three-quarters of the bill was based on the CORRECTIONS Act that  Senator Whitehouse and I introduced in 2014, which is the prison reform  component of the legislation. But the remainder--the sentencing  elements in the bill--was more controversial, and many of my concerns  were shared by members of the law enforcement community.   As I was gauging where Members stood on the bill, it was clear that  many could not support the old version of the bill and needed the  primary sponsors of the bill--whom I mentioned a moment ago--to work  with them to try to make it more acceptable to law enforcement, which  was going to send a signal to many other Senators about whether they  should get behind the bill.   We have all learned how to get things done here in the Senate, and  that is not to just point out the problems with legislation but to  listen and work together to find solutions, and that is exactly what we  did. We spent a lot of time talking to national law enforcement  organizations and those in Texas. I know we all value the input of our  sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement professionals, and  we tried to work with them to figure out how we could make this bill  stronger. I listened to feedback from our Nation's police officers and  sheriffs, and we all got to work. We had meetings, we negotiated, and  we compromised with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as  friends across the Capitol in the House.   We also worked with the White House, whom we have all stayed in  constant contact with on this issue since the Trump administration took  office nearly 2 years ago. Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law,  has been relentless in his pursuit of getting this criminal justice  reform bill done, and I know each of us who has been involved in this  legislation has talked to him almost on a daily basis, sometimes many  times in a given day.   This bill is the product of those negotiations and those changes, and  I am not the only one who is happy with the result. Since these  improvements have been made, the bill has been endorsed by a number of  important groups, including the National Association of Counties, the  Texas Municipal Police Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, and  the Council of State Governments. I appreciate the dedication and hard  work of our colleagues who worked on this to get the bill to where it  is today.   Before tonight's cloture vote, I want to correct some misconceptions  floating around about what this bill will and will not do.   There are some who, for example, say that this legislation will put  violent criminals and sex offenders back on the streets, which is  completely false. Let me say that again because I think it bears  repeating. This bill will not allow dangerous, violent criminals to be  released early. That is pure fiction.   Not everyone is eligible to earn the credits that lead to early  release based on their participation in these programs which I talked  about a moment ago. This bill specifically lists 48 offenses that  disqualify offenders from earning time credits, including crimes such  as murder, specified assault, carjacking that results in injury or  death, and unlawful possession or use of a firearm by violent criminals  and drug traffickers.   Simply put, we use the most modern social science evaluation tools to  find out who is at low risk of reoffending. They are the ones who get  the benefit of these programs because we think these are the ones who  are most likely to have a good outcome and not end up back in prison.  We have disqualified violent offenders, including anybody who either  used or displayed or happened to be carrying a firearm during the  course of committing their offense.   Those who have not committed one of those crimes aren't automatically  eligible. In fact, nobody is automatically eligible for the benefits of  this program. As I said, they have to be evaluated to be at minimum or  low recidivism risk. That decision isn't made by Congress; it is made  by the experienced law enforcement professionals and wardens in the  Federal Bureau of Prisons who work with these men and women every day.   It is important that we look at people who are at low risk of  recidivism and low risk to public safety in the community because what  we can do is use the resources not to keep people like that behind bars  unnecessarily but to focus on the truly violent criminals who are not  likely to be rehabilitated because, frankly, they don't want to be  rehabilitated. Focusing on the most dangerous criminals and keeping  them behind bars, while providing relief to those who earned that time  credit, just makes common sense.   Some people are falsely claiming that the FIRST STEP Act will  retroactively release illegal immigrants and top-level drug traffickers  by increasing the good time credit by 7 days a year. Again, that is  simply not true. All the bill does is clarify Congress's original  intent when it comes to good time credit.   Good time credit is different from the earned credit for  participating in these various programs. But you can imagine how  important this is to the safety of the jailers, wardens, and public law  enforcement officials in the prisons because it gives inmates hope that  if they lead exemplary lives while in prison, they have greater hope of  earning good time credit and getting out earlier.    All this does is clarifies Congress's original intent that 54 days of  good time credit be available rather than the 47 days that the Bureau  of Prisons had interpreted under previous law that was more ambiguous.  So that is not a change to what Congress intended but merely a  clarification of preexisting congressional intent.   In addition, some of the bill's detractors are claiming it will allow  gang members and high-risk inmates to be transferred to lower security  prisons in order to be closer to their homes. This, too, is false. Gang  members and high-risk inmates will not be transferred to lower security  prisons under this bill. While the bill does call for inmates to be  transferred to a prison within 500 miles of their release residence,  that only applies if there are no security concerns and is subject to  availability of beds and other conditions.   For example, a member of the dangerous MS-13 gang is held in maximum  security over 500 miles from their release residence. There happens to  be a minimum-security prison within 500 miles of their release  residence. They would not be transferred. We simply don't transfer  violent criminals to medium-security prisons because they happen to be  within 500 miles of their residence.   There has been a lot of mythology, misunderstanding, and  misrepresentation of what is in the bill. The goal of this bill is not  to release broad swaths of criminals--in fact, it is just the opposite.  This legislation allows prisons to help criminals transform their  lives, if they are willing to take the steps and responsibility to do  so, so that we are not perpetuating the cycle of crime that continues  to plague communities across the country and to drain taxpayer dollars  in the process and damage public safety.   I thank all of our colleagues who have worked so hard on this  legislation. I think one of the most important attributes of a  legislator--certainly of a Senator--is to listen to our constituents,  listen to the feedback from our Members, and help build a better bill  that will garner significantly more support than it otherwise would  have had. I am confident that the Senate will pass this bill, and we  can soon send it to the President's desk for his signature.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                      Recognition Of The Minority Leader     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Louisiana (Mr.  Cassidy), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator  from Nevada (Mr. Heller), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), and  the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea''.
