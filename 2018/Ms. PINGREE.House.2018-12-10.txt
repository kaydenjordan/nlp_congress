 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Veterans Benefit and Transition  Act of 2018. Frankly, it is always a good feeling to be able to speak  for commonsense legislation put together in a bipartisan fashion for  the good of America's veterans.   In particular, I welcome the inclusion of section 504, the Veterans  Fair Debt Notice Act. I introduced this last year in response to  frustrations veterans have been experiencing with the VA's debt  management system. It incorporates some refinements made in the Senate  companion bill introduced by Senator Deb Fischer, which demonstrates  the bipartisan nature of this effort.   The legislation improves the way that veterans are notified about  debts that they may owe from the VA benefits program. Because of the  VA's failure to notify or due to confusingly worded letters or letters  that actually just never reach the vet, many veterans in Maine and  elsewhere are shocked to learn that they owe debts, and for many, they  have missed the deadlines to dispute or seek forgiveness for the  alleged debt.   This bill directs the VA to work with veterans service organizations  to develop standard notification notices that are written in plain  language that anyone can understand and it also allows veterans to  receive notices electronically.   To promote accountability, the bill requires the VA to report to  Congress on the new standard and on the VA's efforts to reduce the  number of errors in its debt notification system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their  work in support, and I urge passage.
