 Last week, I introduced H. Res. 815,  which commemorates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the State of  Israel as well as President Donald Trump's courageous decision to move  the American Embassy to Jerusalem.   Over the past 70 years, the Israeli people have demonstrated  resiliency of the human spirit while overcoming tremendous obstacles.  Every day Israelis endure the threat of terrorism in their lives, but  they remain optimistic about the future of their country.   As Americans face a similar enemy in the global war on terrorism, we  must continue to strengthen our relationship inspired by Ambassador Ron  Dermer.   By holding fair and free elections and vigorously legislating in its  parliament, Israel is a shining model of democracy. I am grateful for  another remarkable year of freedom with the bold leadership of Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this  Special Order, which is Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust.    I am particularly grateful to be here  tonight with Congressman Lee Zeldin from New York for promoting the  restoration of integrity at the Department of Justice and the FBI with  a second special counsel.   Today I rise in honor of the days of remembrance of victims of the  Holocaust officially designated by President Donald Trump last week.  President Donald Trump will always be appreciated for establishing next  month the American Embassy to be relocated and established in  Jerusalem.   A recent study has found that the knowledge of the atrocities that  occurred during the Holocaust is waning as we get further and further  removed from the horrible events. The phrase ``We Remember'' is used to  emphasize the importance of remembering exactly what happened to ensure  that it never happens again.   It is in this context that I stand today, not only in honor of those  murdered at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust, as well as  those who survived, but to continue to speak the truth about what  happened there and hope that it never fades from our collective  memories, to be never repeated. All citizens should tour the Holocaust  Museum here in Washington to learn the shocking truth of Nazi  inhumanity.   In 1933, Adolf Hitler ascended to power in Germany not through force  but through an appointment to chancellor by the sitting President Paul  von Hindenburg. He devised a fictional tale about the need for ethnic  purity to be successful. The German people were desperate and  susceptible to lies and deceptions, and, sadly, many eventually  followed Hitler into the atrocities that followed.   The level of deception Hitler and the Nazis were willing to go to, to  gain unilateral authority, was apparent early on. In February of 1933,  just a month after Hitler was appointed chancellor, the German  Reichstag parliament building was burned, and they immediately blamed  it on their opponents. This allowed Hitler to take advantage of this  situation and issue a decree that placed constraints on the press and  banned political meetings.   By June of the same year, the Nazis declared themselves as the only  legal party in Germany, and the Nazis passed a law allowing for forced  sterilization of those with a genetic defect. The first openly anti- Semitic law was passed in September 1933, prohibiting Jews from holding  land 6 years before the start of World War II.   After German President Paul von Hindenburg, who appointed Hitler as  chancellor out of political expediency, passed away, Hitler named  himself as fuhrer, gaining the power of both chancellor and President.  One of the most shocking aspects of this ascent, looking back, is that  Hitler received 90 percent support from German voters who approved of  his new powers.   After Hitler took complete control of Germany, the laws persecuting  Jewish people escalated rapidly. One month after naming himself the  fuhrer, the Nuremberg race laws were decreed. These laws banned  interracial marriages between Jews and Germans and established that  only those who were German or had German ancestors were able to be  citizens. The rights of the Jewish people living in Germany slowly but  surely dissipated without much attention from the international  community; that is, until the Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass,  the night of November 10, 1938.   German SS agents and local citizens were encouraged to smash windows  of Jewish-owned stores, buildings, and synagogues as the local law  enforcement stood by and watched. Although many Germans, especially  those who saw the destruction, disapproved, Hitler was able to quell  any concerns through his control of the media. This event changed the  nature of the German persecution of the Jewish people from economic,  political, and social to beatings, incarcerations, and murder.   By January 1939, Hitler issued the most public statement regarding  his plans to the German parliament. Hitler's goal, in no uncertain  terms, was ``the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.''   In addition to Hitler's domination over the Jewish people in Germany,  he began to expand his empire to neighboring European nations. The  hostile takeover began in Austria, though the union of the two  countries had been a popular concept for decades. Therefore, there was  not much resistance originally from the international community.   It took the German invasion of Poland on September 2, 1939, for  Britain and France to finally declare war on Nazi Germany. The invasion  occurred in collaboration with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who had a  joint Nazi-Soviet pact with a secret protocol to invade Poland with  Nazi and Soviet tanks providing for the partition of Poland. It would  take two years for the United States to follow suit and declare war  against Germany, after the surprise attack by the Axis partner Japan at  Pearl Harbor.   Despite Britain and France declaring war, that did not slow the Nazis  advancing across Europe. On April 9, 1940, they invaded Denmark and  Norway; and on May 10, they invaded France, Belgium, Holland, and  Luxembourg. By June 14, the Nazis were occupying the French capital of  Paris.   The start of World War II also coincided with the Nazis' increased  brutality against the Jewish people. The same month that Britain and  France declared war, Reinhard Heydrich issued instructions for the SS  to gather Jews in ghettos. One month later, the Nazis would seal those  ghettos so no one, meaning no Jewish person, could escape.    On March 26, 1941, the German Army High Command gave the Reich Main  Security Office approval to initiate SS murder squads throughout the  eastern front. These squads, known as the Einsatzgruppen, were  responsible for murdering the intelligentsia and cultural elite in  Poland. This murder squad mainly killed civilians.   Heydrich, upon inspecting the impact of the murder squads on his SS  agents, decided these tactics were too costly, demoralizing, and did  not kill victims quickly enough. That led the Nazis to increase their  use of gas to murder the innocent Jewish people, which caused the death  toll to increase exponentially.   By the end of 1941, America was drawn into the war by the surprise  murderous attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, who, at this point,  were part of the Axis powers, which included Germany and Italy. On  December 11, after Germany declared war on the United States, President  Franklin Roosevelt declared war against Germany, declaring: ``Never  before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty, and  civilization.''   America then concentrated 90 percent of its resources to defeating  Hitler. On January 20, 1942, the Wannsee Conference was held just  outside of Berlin, where senior Nazi officials and SS met to coordinate  their Final Solution. The Final Solution to the Jewish Question was the  official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was  not limited to the European continent. This resulted in the deliberate  and systematic genocide of the Jewish people.   Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust, began the  introduction of extermination camps. The goal was mass extermination.  This horrific Final Solution was carried out at other execution and  concentration camps across Europe. Sadly, the largest was at Auschwitz.  Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners,  who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners  took place in 1941, September. Auschwitz II-Birkenau also went on to  become a major site of the Nazi Final Solution.   The conditions in these concentration camps were too horrific to  imagine. There was a barbaric selection process upon arrival where only  those who were able-bodied and strong would survive the night. The rest  were sent to gas chambers. The gas chambers were described clearly in  ``The Buchenwald Report.'' An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to  Auschwitz, of which at least 1.1 million people were murdered. Around  90 percent of those were Jews. Approximately one in six Jewish people  killed in the Holocaust died at that camp.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the distinguished Congressman from Texas  (Mr. Gohmert), who represents the First District of Texas, to speak for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  Gohmert for his leadership.   We have been joined by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney),  who has served our country so well on the General Assembly of New York  and now here in Congress, Congresswoman Claudia Tenney.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Claudia Tenney very much for her heartfelt presentation, and we  appreciate her military family.   While I am concluding, I would like to recognize a few Holocaust  survivors in South Carolina. May we never forget their pain and  suffering, as well as their family and friends who have become beloved  citizens of the State of South Carolina.   Ben Stern, born in 1924 in Kielce, Poland. Ben spent 6 months in the  Kielce ghetto, where he was beaten and threatened to be hung for  leaving the ghetto to get food for his family. Then he was taken to a  forced labor camp called Henrykow, after which he never saw his family  again. He then was transferred to Auschwitz, where he was sorted and  sent to Birkenau.   After being transferred again due to the Russians closing in, Ben was  forced to participate in a death march where all those left standing at  the end were murdered. He had fallen over just before those executions  because he could no longer walk. Ben was later found by the American  Army and rescued weighing 89 pounds but alive and liberated.   Bert Gosschalk, born in 1920 in a little village in Holland. He was a  member of the resistance. After a failed resistance attempt to blow up  a railway to take away Nazi's access, he and his wife were caught. Bert  was then taken to the SS headquarters for questioning. There, he spent  all day on his knees without food or water.   While he was being questioned at the SS headquarters, a Dutch  resistance group ambushed the German police. To retaliate, the Nazis  brought all the prisoners to where the Germans had been ambushed and  murdered all of them. Bert came back to discover there were only seven  or eight men who survived, and, thankfully, he was one.   Bluma Goldberg, born in Poland in a town called Pinczow. Bluma joined  her sister at a labor camp where they stayed for 2 years making  bullets, where they worked 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week.   As the Russians moved closer, Bluma was sent to Bergen-Belsen  concentration camp, where disease ran rampant and everyone was covered  in lice. After 3 months, Bluma was able to go with her sister Burgau,  where they painted numbers on airplanes.   Renee Kolender, born in the city of Bochnia, Poland, in 1926. In  1941, Renee was taken from the Kozienice ghetto to a labor camp in a  Polish town called Skarzysko. There, Renee stayed for 3 years with her  mother and brother making ammunition.   As the Russians moved closer, Renee was moved to a labor camp closer  to Germany where they made parts for machines that made bullets.  Eventually, she was rescued by a Jewish policeman, and it was all over.   Pincus Kolender was born in the city of Bochnia, Poland, in 1926. In  1942, Pincus and his brother were take from the ghetto, where they  lived for about 2 years, to Auschwitz. When Pincus arrived, he was  lined up before the gate to be sorted where he was sent to a camp  instead of the crematorium.   Inside the camp, his head was shaved, and he was tattooed with the  number ``161253.'' Pincus described the life in the camp, of which he  said: ``The hunger was also terrible. We used to search for a potato  peel and fight over it. We were constantly, 24 hours a day, always  hungry.'' Every few months, a selection occurred where those who looked  feeble were sent to the crematorium. Eventually, Pincus was saved by  General George Patton's Fifth Army.   Other survivors include: Rudy Herz, born in a very small town called  Stommeln on the outskirts of Cologne, Germany, in 1925; Trude Heller,  born in Vienna in 1922. She was 15 years old in March 1938 when Hitler  took over Austria, and upon coming to America, she served as the First  Lady with Mayor Max Heller of the beautiful city of Greenville, South  Carolina.   Francine Taylor was born in Poland in 1928. Her family moved to  France when she was 2 years old. They were living in Paris on June 14,  1940, when the French capital fell.   Leo Diamantstein, born in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1924.   I am grateful for this opportunity to highlight these people and this  important issue during these ``Days of Remembrance,'' and I am hopeful  that we will make preserving this history and telling these stories a  priority.   We will never forget the lessons we have learned from the horrific  tragedy in history. We must protect natural God-given rights and do all  in our power to prevent these types of crimes against humanity.   Helping the world to not forget is an extraordinary artist of West  Columbia, South Carolina, Mary Burkett, who has produced drawings of  the murdered children of the Holocaust. These loving portraits were  placed, last week, on display at the Embassy of Israel in Washington by  Ambassador Ron Dermer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, April 17, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
