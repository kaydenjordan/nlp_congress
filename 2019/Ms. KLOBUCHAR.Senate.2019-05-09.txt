 Mr. President, today I wish to express my opposition  to recent nominees who have come before the Senate.   First, I would like to express my opposition to the nomination of  Janet Dhillon, who was confirmed to serve as Chair of the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, by a party line vote  yesterday. The EEOC has a critical mission to enforce the Federal laws  that make it illegal to discriminate against workers on the basis of  their race, religion, national origin, or disability, and it was the  first Federal agency to take the position that title VII of the Civil  Rights Act protects employees from workplace discrimination based on  their sexual orientation. Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned  that Ms. Dhillon has refused to commit to uphold the EEOC's current  interpretation of title VII as covering LGBTQ workers. I am also  concerned by arguments that were made in legal briefs by the Retail  Litigation Center under Ms. Dhillon's leadership, including arguments  in support of policies to make it more difficult for employers to be  held liable for harassment. It is for these reasons that I would not  have voted in support of Ms. Dhillon' s nomination.   I also want to comment on my opposition to Cheryl Stanton's  nomination to serve as Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at  the Department of Labor. Before Ms. Stanton's nomination, she served as  executive director of the South Carolina Department of Employment and  Workforce, in which capacity she garnished wages to collect  unemployment insurance overpayments and had a public dispute with a  staff member who refused to institute a personnel action after raising  ethical objections. I voted against invoking cloture on Ms. Stanton's  nomination and would have voted against her confirmation.   Finally, I want to address the nomination of Joseph Bianco for the  United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which I opposed  in the Judiciary Committee due to concerns regarding his record on such  critical issues as privacy and civil liberties. I am also concerned  that the Senate advanced Judge Bianco's nomination even though neither  home State Senator returned a positive blue slip.   Thank you.                            ____________________
