 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Savannah Police Corporal Doug ``Twin'' Herron.   Corporal Herron recently passed away after experiencing an  unspecified medical emergency while working an off-duty assignment.   He was hired at the Savannah Police Department in January 1988 and  was promoted to corporal in 1994. In 2002, he was promoted to star  corporal.   For the last 2 years of his life, he worked at the Savannah Impact  Program, which focuses on at-risk youth and adults. His dedication to  this program is a true testament to the man that he was.   Corporal Herron always put the community first. He dedicated his  career in policing to bettering the lives of others.   Corporal Herron was a hero, and the entire Savannah community will  never forget the good that he did.   Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest condolences to his family.                            ____________________
