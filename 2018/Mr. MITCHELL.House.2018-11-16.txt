 Mr. Speaker, my district, the 10th Congressional  District of Michigan, is the proud home to Selfridge Air National Guard  Base, one of our Nation's premier National Guard bases, home to more  than 40 national defense and homeland security tenants, including all  branches of the military, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border  Protection.   I rise today to commemorate the groundbreaking ceremony for  Selfridge's newest tenant organization, the Eisenhower Veteran Care  Transition Center. When completed, the facility will provide  residential rehabilitation and reintegration programs for up to 42  veterans at a time who are suffering from service-related conditions,  including post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and  more.   This new veteran care transition center ensures that our wounded  warriors  [[Page H9552]]  receive the essential care they earned, allowing them to continue to  live independently in our community.   I am thankful to the leadership of Selfridge, including General John  Slocum, the 127th Wing and Selfridge Air National Guard Base commander,  for working hard to bring this resource to southeast Michigan and  Selfridge, and ensuring that veterans in this area get the best  possible care.                            ____________________
