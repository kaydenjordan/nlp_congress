 Madam Chair, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R.  467, the HALT Fentanyl Act.   The fentanyl crisis has touched every community across our State and  country. We need to take serious, bipartisan action to address this  epidemic and save lives.   Unfortunately, the legislation on the floor tonight misses the mark.   The HALT Fentanyl Act does not address how these dangerous drugs  enter our country, nor does it include any measures to address the  underlying demand driving the substance use crisis.   This bill simply preserves the status quo by continuing to schedule  fentanyl-related substances as schedule I, which has been the case  since 2018, and under current law, will be the case until December of  2024.   Scheduling alone will not change the overdose crisis. We need to  broaden our scope.   Madam Chair, I urge this body to instead consider a public health  approach to address this crisis. I am leading with Lisa Blunt Rochester  and   Don Bacon, a bipartisan, alternative bill that would address both  the supply of and demand for illicit fentanyl in this country.                                time  1815    Our bill, the STOP Fentanyl Overdoses Act, will enhance fentanyl  surveillance through investments in technology, dedicate resources to  strengthen law enforcement response, and improve data collection of  seized drugs.   The bill will also help reduce the demand for illicit drugs by  expanding access to recovery resources, protecting people who  administer opioid reversal drugs, and supporting education on the harm  of drug misuse.   The STOP Fentanyl Overdoses Act is an alternative to the scheduling- only approach on the floor. An issue this complex requires an equally  comprehensive solution.   Fentanyl doesn't care about our politics and neither should our  approach to addressing the overdose crisis.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to consider my alternative,  bipartisan solution.
