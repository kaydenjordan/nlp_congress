 Mr. Speaker, this past week, Americans gathered  nationwide with friends and family to celebrate the founding of our  democracy. They enjoyed days off to spend time with their loved ones,  and they celebrated our national values as red, white, and blue lit up  the sky.   Yet again, the joyful celebrations of Americans were met with further  acts of senseless gun violence, because for far too many across the  country, gunshots were confused for fireworks on our day of  independence, leaving countless numbers dead and over 100 injured.   Mass shootings have marred our Nation more times than there have been  days this year.   Mr. Speaker, there is no freedom in living in fear. There is no  celebration when our holidays transform into tragedy. Gun violence must  be stopped, and this body must act once again to save lives.                            ____________________
