 Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Rhode  Island. I will not occupy the Senate floor for very long.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader     Mr. President, the community of Benton, KY, is  continuing to pick up the pieces after last week's harrowing shooting.   I wish, once again, to thank our law enforcement and first responders  for their heroism, and I would also like to recognize Marshall County  Judge-Executive Kevin Neal for his leadership when his community needed  it the most.   For most of us, this tragedy is barely even conceivable, but to the  parents of Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, it is now a painful reality.  Bailey Holt was 15 years old, and her mother said that she had a  ``perfect, sweet soul.'' She has been described as compassionate,  confident, and comfortable being herself. When she wasn't busy cheering  for the University of Louisville Cardinals, Bailey was always ready  with a kind word or a friendly gesture for those who needed it.   On social media, her family and friends are using the expression ``Be  Like Bailey,'' encouraging everyone who sees it to act with charity.   Preston Cope, who was also 15, was known for being kind, soft-spoken,  and a quick learner. He loved reading about history and playing  baseball for Marshall County High School and the Calvert City Sluggers.  Preston's friends remember his ability to inspire them and to make them  laugh.   One of Bailey and Preston's classmates called them ``the nicest  people I ever met. They never had anything negative to say. They always  had a smile on their face.''   This weekend, friends and family gathered at the high school gym by  the hundreds to remember Bailey and Preston and to comfort one another.   As the other injured students fight to recover and the entire  Marshall County community continues to grieve and heal, they will have  Bailey and Preston's example to draw on and they will have the prayers  of their fellow Kentuckians, of us here in the Senate, and of the  entire country.                              Work of the Senate    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, a great deal of work  remains in the Senate in the coming days. Bipartisan discussions  continue on a variety of important issues, including immigration,  border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and funding for our Armed  Forces. With our February 8 deadline fast approaching, it is vital that  we continue these serious and constructive talks.   Last week, the administration provided its framework for immigration  legislation. As I noted, it builds upon the four pillars for reform  that the President has consistently put forth and indicates what is  necessary for him to sign a bill into law. As discussions continue in  the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the  aisle should look to this framework as they work toward an agreement.   The President's proposal has received praise as a serious effort to  solve some of the problems with our broken immigration system. Not  surprisingly with a subject this complicated, it has also received  criticism from both the right and the left. Constructive critiques are  one thing, but the type of irresponsible racial invective used yet  again on this subject by the Democratic leader of the House is  decidedly unhelpful.   These comments are precisely the kind of divisive partisanship that  dim the prospects that a bipartisan compromise could become law. The  American people elected us to legislate, not to trade insults. To  resolve President Obama's unlawfully established DACA Program and other  important issues in immigration, I would urge my Democratic colleagues  to put serious, good-faith discussions ahead of cheap, partisan point  scoring.                          Nomination of David Stras    Mr. President, now on another matter. These negotiations aren't the  only important business before us this week. We will also consider  another of President Trump's well-qualified judicial nominees, David  Stras, of Minnesota, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Eighth Circuit. Judge Stras serves as an associate justice of the  Minnesota Supreme Court. Three of his former colleagues on that court,  now retired, praised him in an open letter last year for his sterling  academic record, his considerable experience, and his ability to hear  cases ``with objectivity and an open mind.''   Their testimony confirmed Judge Stras's well-known reputation for  thoughtfulness, fairness, and intellectual excellence. I look forward  to voting to advance his nomination and to send this capable jurist to  the Federal bench.   Mr. President, the Senate will vote to take up a measure to ensure  that the most vulnerable in our society are granted the protection they  deserve under law. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  reflects a growing mainstream consensus--mainstream consensus--that  unborn children should not be subjected to elective abortion after 20  weeks.   There are only seven countries left in the world that permit this,  including,  [[Page S531]]  unfortunately, the United States, along with China and North Korea. It  is long past time that we heeded both science and commonsense morality  and remove ourselves from this very undistinguished list.   Some refer to this legislation as Micah's Law in honor of a little  boy who was born premature at just 22 weeks. Today, Micah Pickering is  a healthy 5-year-old boy. He shows what can happen when we give life a  chance.   This afternoon, every one of us will go on record on this issue. On  the commonsense side of this issue are 63 percent of Americans,  according to a recent survey, and every other country in the world,  save seven. There is no reason why this should be a partisan issue. I  hope our Democratic colleagues will not obstruct the Senate from taking  up this bill.   I urge every one of my colleagues to join me in voting to advance it  this afternoon.                          State of the Union Address    Mr. President, now, on a final matter, the President delivers his  first State of the Union Address tomorrow. I am especially looking  forward to his remarks on tax reform and the state of our economy.  Already hundreds of businesses have announced significant bonuses, pay  increases, new jobs, and expanded benefits. Just last week, we learned  that Verst Logistics, which is based in Walton, KY, and employs nearly  1,600, has distributed bonuses to full-time employees. The company's  CEO told workers: ``I want to be sure that you and your families share  in the benefits of your accomplishments and the new tax reform  legislation.''   When I hear my Democratic colleagues denigrate tax reform bonuses as  ``crumbs,'' I think about workers like these. I think about the Verst  worker who came to her boss with tears in her eyes when she received  word of her bonus. It was Christmas. She and her husband had recently  had their fifth child. Money was tight. Mom and dad had enough saved up  to buy gifts for the kids but were planning to skip presents for each  other, but tax reform changed that. Thanks to the tax reform bonus she  earned, this employee and her husband could go out to a nice dinner and  buy each other Christmas gifts after all. The CEO says he has never  been hugged so hard in his life.   It is a shame that none of my Democratic colleagues voted for tax  reform--not a single one of them--and it is jarring to hear some of  them now denigrate the pay increases and the benefits that only wealthy  people could deem insignificant. Maybe in San Francisco or New York an  extra $500 or $1,000 is no big deal, but try telling that to families  in North Dakota, Missouri, and Montana. Try telling that to that mother  of five. I suspect you would get an earful.   Tomorrow evening when the President describes tax reform's impact for  middle-class Americans, every one of us should stand and applaud.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 101, which was  received from the House.
