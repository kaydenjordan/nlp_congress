 Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic majority in this House  will not limit its response to mass shootings to just thoughts and  prayers. We will listen to gun violence survivors, not gun company  lobbyists. We finally will respond to the demands of more than 90  percent of Americans who want stronger background checks.   In the 9 years since the Supreme Court's disastrous decision in  Citizens United, gun companies and other wealthy special interests have  been able to dump unlimited money into our elections. In 2016, the NRA  spent more than ever before and watched candidates they help elect  ignore the gun violence crisis: nearly 40,000 Americans killed in 2017  and horrific mass shootings in Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Thousand Oaks,  and Parkland.   To release the grip of wealthy special interests on Congress,  Democrats have introduced historic reforms as our top priority in H.R.  1, to make it easier to vote, to get money out of politics, to end  corruption, and to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn  Citizens United.   Mr. Speaker, no matter what the issue--climate change, healthcare,  the economy, or gun violence--it is time for Congress to start working  for the people. This week, that work has begun.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 53 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  January 8, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
