 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the third  anniversary of the Village Exchange Center in Aurora, Colorado.   Founded in 2017, the Village Exchange Center has become a thriving,  collaborative nonprofit and a home for immigrants, refugees, and  community members throughout the Aurora-Denver metro area.   In Aurora, we recognize that our diversity is our strength. In our  public schools alone, over 150 languages are spoken by students. This  is where VEC comes in, helping build bridges between the multiple  cultures, faiths, and nationalities that now call Colorado home.   This year VEC is embarking on an ambitious new initiative called  Village Farms at Stanley, a vertical farm near Stanley Marketplace.  Village Farm will help empower diverse, intergenerational communities  through education, training, food, and farming.   On its third anniversary, I wish VEC continued success in bringing  people together in paving the way toward health and economic  opportunities for our diverse communities. Together, we can build a  vibrant community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
