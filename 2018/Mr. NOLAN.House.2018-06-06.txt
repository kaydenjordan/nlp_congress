 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I didn't thank Chairman  Shuster for his leadership on this important legislation, subcommittee  Chairwoman Napolitano and the other members of the committee and the  staff as well.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is pretty straightforward. It simply  expresses a sense of the Congress that the construction of a new lock  at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our  national economy, to our national security, and to our vital  infrastructure.   Why? Well, really briefly, that lock is a gateway for the Port of  Duluth and all of the commerce out of Lake Superior. That is the iron  ore; that is the corn; that is the soybeans; that is the forest  products, all of which are essential to our national security, our  national economy.  [[Page H4821]]    I would just cite one thing. Homeland Security did a study. They  found that 13 percent of the Nation's gross national product goes  through those locks, which is why we have military protection there;  because if those locks fail from a military attack or if they fail from  obsolescence, which we are in danger of having occur, it would throw  the country into a great depression.   So let me just conclude by saying that these locks and the rebuilding  of them are vital to our national security, our national economy, and  our vital important infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
