 Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, the American  people have mobilized in extraordinary and unprecedented ways in times  of national crisis, but the enemy we face today has required a  different response.   To defeat COVID-19, we have asked most Americans to do what comes so  unnaturally to them: stay home. We have asked businesses to shutter,  employees to stop going to work, and churches to close. Entire  industries have lost their consumer base overnight.   The American people didn't cause this crisis but are responding the  way they always do: by being smart, tough, and compassionate. We owe it  to them to give them this support.
