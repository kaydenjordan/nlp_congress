 Mr. President, I wish to rise today to extend my  heartfelt congratulations to the Fledderman family and the employees at  Batesville Tool & Die, Inc., BTD, as they celebrate their 40th  anniversary. Headquartered in Batesville, IN, BTD has become a global  manufacturer of superior metal stampings for appliance, industrial, and  automotive markets.   Founded in 1978 by Ron Fledderman, BTD started with a single press  and a small tool room. The current second-generation president and CEO,  Jody Fledderman, took the reins in 1989 with the same promise to his  customers: to provide quality, low-cost products with technical  expertise. Today the company is estimated to be a multimillion-dollar  business with nearly 1,000 employees. As a member of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is important that we recognize  the value small and medium-sized businesses have in rural communities  like Batesville, IN.   I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Fledderman family  and the workers at Batesville Tool & Die, Inc., for their 40 years of  dedicated customer service and economic innovation.                            ____________________
