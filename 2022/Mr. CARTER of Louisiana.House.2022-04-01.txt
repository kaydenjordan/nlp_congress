 Mr. Speaker, the COVID pandemic has produced  a rise in drug abuse, violent crime, and other indicators of collective  trauma. These are pressing issues that urgently need resources devoted  to them. We must stop wasting precious resources on marijuana offenses.   Law enforcement simply cannot afford to chase small-time pot  offenders while violent and random crime continues to be on the rise  nationwide. The ACLU reports States are wasting billions annually  enforcing cannabis laws. This is money, time, and effort better spent  on investing in true community safety.   Further, Americans overwhelmingly want marijuana reform and 91  percent report that they believe that it should  [[Page H4097]]  be legalized. Congress is long overdue in marijuana reform and  decriminalizing this substance, but we have a long journey ahead to  achieve social justice and criminal justice reform.   The war on marijuana is a costly relic of the past. Let's vote  ``yes'' today so we can build a safer and more equitable tomorrow.
