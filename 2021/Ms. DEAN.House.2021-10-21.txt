 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  underlying resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that this is not just about  Mr. Bannon. This is about our rule of law, our democracy, and  protecting it for future generations.   On January 6, a mob, incited by the lies of a political leader,  descended on the Capitol. Nooses, vandalism, death threats to elected  officials, Americans remember the violence that took place here.                                time  1300    Beltway chatter often focuses on the winners and losers of that day.  But on that day, we all lost. Americans lost their lives, and we nearly  lost our democracy. That is why we created a bipartisan January 6  commission. We know that unless we do our jobs, the ultimate losers  will be future generations who will wonder what happened to our Nation.   The commission's work is serious and has no time for the games of Mr.  Bannon or anyone else who would disregard the rule of law. Our  Constitution and our courts have made it clear that Congress has the  power to investigate. This power is vital to the protection of our  democracy, and it must be respected.   I think a lot about our late, dear colleague, Elijah Cummings, and  his words still sit with me. He said that when we are dancing with the  angels, the question will be asked: What did we do to ensure we kept  our democracy intact?   I stand before you, Mr. Speaker, with that quote on my heart,  thinking of my own four grandchildren and when they learn of January 6,  they will see a time when America descended into violence, destruction,  and desecration; when Americans attacked Americans and threatened our  democracy.   And what did I do?   What did we all do to protect our democracy?   So I lend my voice to hold Mr. Bannon in contempt and support the  bipartisan select committee for their work in keeping our democracy and  our future intact.
