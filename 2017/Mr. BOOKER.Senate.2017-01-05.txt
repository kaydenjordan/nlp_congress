 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am really proud to stand here, having  represented New Jersey now a little bit over 3 years in the U.S.  Senate. I have to say that I have developed a great respect for my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I have a deep belief that this  is a body that can do good things for the American people. We don't  always agree, and too many things are not getting done, but I have seen  this body at its best. I have seen our ability to rise to the occasion.  Along the way, I have made friendships and found respect for people and  my colleagues across the aisle, as well as fellow Democrats.   I have witnessed occasions where Members of both parties have put  principle before partisanship and evidenced a willingness to actually  embrace personal political risk to stand up for what they believe is  right and honorable and in the best interest of our country. Given  this, this is a day in which I rise with painful disappointment.  Frankly, I feel a deep sense of astonishment and even a sense of  crisis. Thus, I feel a deepened determination to fight with everything  I have against the efforts of my Republican colleagues that I believe  will harm our country as a whole but particularly the most vulnerable  people in our country.   This is about the Republican push, really the race--what I believe is  a reckless race--to repeal the Affordable Care Act without putting  forth any legislation, any proposal, any plan on how they intend to  replace it. This is fundamentally dangerous, and it will hurt millions  of Americans. I have heard over the past month people rightfully  saying: Well, this is how the Affordable Care Act was implemented.   I understand the frustrations that have resulted from that, and  people think this was jammed through along partisan lines many years  ago using similar legislative tactics. The truth is, that is simply not  the case. The Affordable Care Act went through a long and arduous  process and received input from doctors, nurses, patient groups,  medical specialists, medical professionals of all types.   The Affordable Care Act started with listening sessions, then  hearings, then came the advice and counsel of policy experts,  businesses, market experts, insurance companies, health nonprofits,  hospitals--literally thousands and thousands of people over thousands  of hours, often through public discourse, putting forth ideas that  actually shaped and changed legislation. I wasn't in the body then. I  was a mayor in Newark, NJ, but I know this occupied months of debate.   Years later, Republicans are seeking to undo this work with a kind of  plan to move forward. They are saying that they have a plan, but no  plan exists.   I am a big believer that there are things we can and we must do to  improve health care in America, to improve the Affordable Care Act, but  what I have to make clear is that it is profoundly irresponsible to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and not put anything in place. There is  no plan.   This is at a time that everyone agrees--people in the Republican  Party and Democratic Party continue to talk about the achievements of  the Affordable Care Act, things that they want to maintain, things they  believe make a real difference. Those are things I have heard  Republicans praise and even say again they want to protect. These  things are making a lifesaving difference for millions of Americans.   Let's be clear. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that  we should not give the power back to insurance companies to deny people  health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Let's be clear.  Most people believe that we should allow young people, young adults to  stay on their parents' plans up to the age of 26.  [[Page S100]]  We also believe that requiring health plans cover preventive services  is a profoundly important thing to do for individuals in this country,  but it actually saves Americans money by pushing people to do  preventive care--mammograms, birth control, and mental health care-- without cost sharing. These are logical things that the majority of  Americans believe in, such as closing the prescription drug coverage  gap, which too many seniors on Medicare and people with disabilities  have had to face, known as that doughnut hole. We believe in  prohibiting insurance companies from charging women more money simply  because of their gender. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe  in requiring the insurance companies to spend more on patient care and  less on administrative costs, and the insurance companies shouldn't be  allowed to gouge the American people while making massive profits at  the same time.   There is so much that people believe in and want to have preserved,  and these are tremendous things for America. There are bank account  savings; there are lifesaving policies, all of which are popular with  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. They are popular with people  on both sides of the aisle in this body.   Some Republicans have said that what they are doing will not threaten  these accomplishments, but this couldn't be any further from the truth.  The way they are going about this puts the health care system in a  perilous position. The health care system is complicated in nuance, and  to think you can repeal something without replacing it right away shows  a lack of understanding of what is going to happen and what the  consequences will be.   What the Republicans are doing now is quite contrary to what the  Democrats did before the ACA passed in 2010. Republicans are not  putting forth a proposal. They are not speaking to the health care  needs of all Americans. They are not inviting professionals from all  different backgrounds to help shape a plan for America. They are not  even fulfilling what I heard countless Republicans on the campaign  trail, including our President-elect, say: They would repeal and then  replace. They are just not replacing.   The replace part put forth by the mantra of many Republicans has not  materialized. It doesn't exist. There is no plan to replace, no  statement of principles, no outline of features, no framework for a  plan, no explanation of how they would pay for the things they claim  they like. There is no specific timeline for when a plan might  materialize or even any substantive hint of what many Republican  colleagues plan on doing to address the crisis--the crisis that will  surely come as a result of repealing the Affordable Care Act without  giving forth any replacement.   I say time and again: Show us the plan before you repeal this  legislation. If you do not do that, you will be responsible for pain,  suffering, chaotic markets, and for many Americans' health care  problems. There are many people who don't understand this. They listen  to the political rhetoric, and they think: Hey, you might be that one  who, if you are wealthy enough or secure enough, if you are a Member of  this body, in fact, this concept of repealing and maybe figuring out a  replacement down the road might sound good. But if you are one illness  away from bankruptcy, if you know and remember the challenges of having  a child with a preexisting condition, if you know that one injury, one  unexpected fall could place your family in peril but for the insurance  you have, if you are one of the 20 million Americans who used to be  uninsured and now you have insurance, you know how perilous this moment  is. You know that you can't afford the recklessness of any politician-- a Republican move that equates to jumping off a cliff and then packing  your parachute on the way down.   Repealing without replacing is simply irresponsible, it is dangerous,  and it is threatening to our country's well-being. People--families,  children, the elderly--will suffer.   This is a moment where we need Republican leaders to tell the truth  and say: We want to improve our health care system. We may not believe  in ObamaCare, but we can't tear it down unless we do the responsible  thing and put forth a replacement.   Right now, what we have is political rhetoric that is not just  rhetoric. It is perilous. It is dangerous. It is threatening to our  Nation. This will inflict immediate catastrophe upon families, causing  millions to lose their health insurance, and it will unleash chaos with  market uncertainty and cost spikes.   There is no defense for what is being done. I don't understand it.  There is no logic here whatsoever. Elections were won. You now have the  floor and the ability to put forth your great vision for health care in  America, but doing it backward and repealing something and not offering  up a plan is truly putting politics before people. This is a move of  grand political theater that comes with profound public consequences  affecting millions.   As a Democratic Senator, some people will say that this is just  political rhetoric, but these are not just partisan words. This is the  truth and don't take my word for it. Look at the words of other more  thoughtful--other very thoughtful people, Democrats and Republicans,  businesspeople and nonprofit leaders, conservative think tanks and  nonpartisan groups, speaking with a chorus to the point I am making.  Experts across sectors, across industries, and across the country are  taking a hard look at what a repeal will mean for the American people  without a replacement. People from all across sectors of our country  are saying what the Republicans are doing is reckless, and the  consequences are dire.    Take the American Medical Association, the preeminent association of  physicians. Mind you, this is an organization that opposed the  enactment of the Affordable Care Act. They have urged--this chorus of  doctors has urged that ``before any action is taken, policymakers  should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will  replace current policies. Patients and other stakeholders should be  able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can  make informed decisions.''   The American Medical Association isn't a political organization. They  are thoughtful people whose fundamental concern is the doctors in this  Nation and the health care of the people. Another respected  organization representing American hospitals made it clear. The  American Hospital Association warned that Republican action of  repealing without a plan would result in an ``unprecedented health care  crisis.''   Are Republicans listening to doctors and hospitals or are they  rushing forth, willing to risk a crisis for our country, and for what?  They are a President for 4 years, a Congress for 2. What is the rush to  put forth a plan and just repeal? Will they listen to these experts?  What about the president of America's leading cancer group, the  American Cancer Society? Will they listen to them? They urge Congress  to ``consider the future of the Affordable Care Act. It is critically  important that cancer patients, survivors and those at risk of the  disease don't face any gap in coverage of prevention or treatment. . .  . Delaying enactment of a replacement for 2 or 3 years could lead to  the collapse of the individual health market with long-term  consequences.''   This organization is respected by people on both sides of the aisle  and is not playing partisan games. They are calling out the truth; that  it is a reckless Republican move to repeal without replacing. Will  Republicans listen to the American Diabetes Association? Folks with  diabetes are Independents, Republicans, and Democrats, and this is an  organization respected by people on both sides of the aisle. They say:         The Association strongly opposes going back to a time when       . . . treatment for preexisting conditions like diabetes       could be excluded from coverage; when people could find their       insurance coverage was no longer available just when they       needed it most.    What is the Republican plan to address these concerns and to pay for  these concerns? Will they listen to private businesspeople? They, too,  join in the chorus of Americans urging that Republicans not endanger  the lives and livelihoods of millions.   The Main Street Alliance. We all have main streets in our States and  our communities. A group representing these small businesses from  across the country urges lawmakers to consider the devastating effect a  repeal without  [[Page S101]]  replace would have on small businesses:         Small business owners depend on healthy and vibrant       communities to keep us profitable in the engines of economic       growth. . . . Changes to our current health care system are       needed, but not in the form of cuts to critical programs or       through taking away our health coverage.    There are some Senators who are speaking out. It is not the entire  Republican caucus. There are some who are saying exactly what I am  saying. Yet we are still rushing toward a vote, even with Republican  Senators having the courage to stand up. Just yesterday Republican  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, before voting to proceed to this  measure, said: ``It is imperative that Republicans do a replacement  simultaneous to a repeal.'' I respect my Republican colleague for  saying what is common sense and speaking up against the reckless  actions being taken by the Republican Party as a whole, and some fellow  Republican Senators have joined him in similar statements, including  Lamar Alexander, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee. The Republican from Tennessee, who noted in an  interview in November 2016 that when it comes to the ACA, ``what we  need to focus on first''--Senator Alexander said--``is what would we  replace it with and what are the steps that it would take to do that?''   Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine shared in an interview last  month that she was ``concerned about the speed in which this is  occurring'' and expressed concern over what would happen to her  constituents in Maine who had signed up for insurance through the ACA,  saying: ``You just can't drop insurance for 84,000 people in my  State.''   I not only talk about Republicans in this body, but there are  conservative think tanks focused on our country that are speaking out  now as well. The American Enterprise Institute said in a 2015 report  that ``repealing the law without a plausible plan for replacing it  would be a mistake.''   So here we have it from all over the country, people across the  political spectrum, experts, market analysts, insurance executives,  doctors, nurses, hospital leaders, patient groups; these people in our  country who are beyond politics and even beyond their opinions of the  Affordable Care Act when it was enacted are now speaking in a chorus of  conviction in one voice: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act without a  clear plan to preserve the things that are making America healthier and  more financially strong and secure. Don't recklessly rush into a  politically motivated move that would endanger the health care of  millions of Americans, increase the costs for millions of Americans,  throw insurance markets into chaos, endanger our hospitals' financial  stability, and put our most vulnerable Americans into crisis: our  seniors, people in nursing homes, retired coal miners, people  recovering from drug addiction, the poor and other underserved  communities.   We are America, and this is a time that we must call, not to party  rhetoric but to who we are and what we stand for. We cannot let this  repeal without replacement happen. We must know what the Republican  plan is so experts, market analysts, insurance folks, doctors, everyone  understands what will happen. Americans will be hurt. It is time to put  our country and the people first. There is no rush. The voters gave  this body 2 years. It gave the Presidency 4 years. We must now fight  these efforts. We must resist. We must call to the conscience of  neighbors and appeal to the moral compasses of our Republican leaders  to do what they said they would do--put forth your plan. Let the  American people know what they are going to do and do not thrust  millions of your fellow country men and women off a cliff and shout  promises to them as they fall: ``Hey, don't worry. We will figure  something out before you hit the ground.'' Where is the honor in that  strategy? Call the public together, gather your experts, put forth a  thoughtful process, and develop what you think is better, what improves  upon what we have now, what doesn't diminish our unassailable gains  that we have had but build upon them. Give us a plan, not empty  promises. Give America hope. Don't plunge millions into despair and  uncertainty. Show decency, not costly craven politics. We know who we  are as a country. Profound are the words, ``We hold these truths to be  self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by  their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these  rights, Governments are instituted among  Mr. President, today, I introduced the Protect American  Families from Unnecessary Registration and Deportation Act of 2017, or  the Protect American Families Act. This critical bill would advance  civil and human rights by ensuring we protect American immigrants from  being wrongfully targeted by the Federal Government because of who they  are or how they worship. I thank Senators Elizabeth Warren, Brian  Schatz, Ed Markey, Patty Murray, Bernie Sanders, Patrick Leahy, Jeff  Merkley, Mazie Hirono, and Ron Wyden for joining me on this important  legislation.   Enshrined in the Constitution are the ideas that all people are free  to practice the religion of their choice and that we will not  discriminate because of your faith or national origin. Creating a  Federal immigration program that requires people to register their  status with the Federal Government on the basis of their religion,  race, ethnicity, gender, age, nationality, national origin, or  citizenship is contrary to those values. Because the United States is  the world's beacon of democracy, we must lead by example and live the  values we preach.   Yet, in troubling times we have not always stayed true to our values.  During World War II, soon after Imperial Japan attacked United States  Naval Base Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive  Order 9066. That order authorized the Secretary of War to designate  particular areas as military zones, which allowed for the removal of  Japanese Americans from certain parts of the United States.  Subsequently, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to  internment camps.   Similarly, in 2002, the year following the tragic terrorist attacks  on September 11, the Federal Government created the National Security  Entry-Exist Registration System, NSEERS. This Federal program required  non-citizen visa holders from certain countries to register with the  Federal Government. The registration process included fingerprinting,  photographs, and interrogation. Once an individual registered, NSEERS  required the person to regularly check in with immigration officials.  Finally, NSEERS monitored people who registered with the program to  ensure that no one remained in the country longer than the law  permitted them.   Inconsistent with the American values of religious freedom and  nondiscrimination, the NSEERS program wrongly targeted males over 16  years old from the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain,  Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait,  Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia,  Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and North Korea.  Thus, 24 out of the 25 countries listed in the NSEERS program were Arab  and Muslim countries. This was another moment in our nation's history  where our leaders succumbed to the politics of  [[Page S117]]  fear and adopted a program that tore at the very fabric of our country.   Immigration-registry programs do not make the public more safe. The  purpose of NSEERS was to identify and capture terrorists. Yet, despite  registering over 83,000 people, the program yielded zero terrorism  convictions. Without proof of a single terrorist related conviction,  the NSEERS program did not do its job of keeping the homeland safe.   But immigration-registry programs do result in discrimination. The  fact that NSEERS led to the forced registry, interrogation, and  deportations of immigrants from predominantly Muslim or Arab countries  is proof that broadly defined enforcement programs often result in  racial and religious profiling. That is why the United Nations and  major American civil rights groups condemned NSEERS for unfairly  singling out Muslims. By targeting Muslims, NSEERS sent the wrong  message that America does not welcome immigrants from certain lands.   While the Obama administration dismantled the NSEERS program, this  alone will not prevent the incoming administration from attempting to  follow through on its threats to create a registry based on religion or  national origin. On the campaign trail President-elect Trump called for  a ``total and complete shutdown'' of Muslim immigrants entering the  United States. Additionally, he has called for ``extreme vetting'' of  immigrants reminiscent of NSEERS. It is incumbent upon congressional  leaders to ensure that the United States does not sacrifice its values  in the face of fear.   Today, I introduce the Protect American Families Act to ensure that  America protects the rights and liberties of American immigrants from  overly broad, ineffective, and discriminatory registry programs. This  bill would prohibit the Federal Government from requiring noncitizens  to register or check in with the Federal Government simply because of  their religion, race, ethnicity, age, gender, national origin,  nationality, or citizenship. Banning the creation of a discriminatory  registration program is not only consistent with our democratic values,  but it allows law enforcement to focus resources on the real threats to  our safety.   The bill has commonsense exemptions. Data collection is critical in  our fight against terrorists, and the bill allows the government to  collect routine data on the entry and exit of noncitizens. The bill  would also protect important immigration programs like Temporary  Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure, the Visa Waiver Program,  and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. This provision makes clear  that legitimate Federal programs that confer immigration benefits are  not prohibited by the ban on enforcement immigration programs that  target immigrants and other vulnerable Americans.   In his First Inaugural Address, President Roosevelt said that ``the  only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Unfortunately, he failed  to live up to that statement when he issued Executive Order 9066. But  we have a chance to fulfill that vision. We have a chance to stand up  against fear and stay true to our American values in the face of  hardship. I am proud to introduce the Protect American Families Act  today, and I urge my colleagues to support its speedy passage through  the Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I introduced the Protect American  Families from Unnecessary Registration and Deportation Act of 2017, or  the Protect American Families Act.
