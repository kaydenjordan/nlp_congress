 Madam President, on February 24, approximately 1 month  ago, Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked and unjustified war against  his neighbor, the free, democratic, and sovereign nation of Ukraine.   The bipartisan Senate delegation visit to Europe led by Senator Ernst  that I joined over this past weekend was truly extraordinary. It has  reinforced my already strong belief that the United States must do all  that it can to provide lethal aid to the courageous Ukrainians fighting  for their families and their freedom, as well as to provide the  humanitarian assistance necessary to ease the suffering of the  Ukrainian people.   The Presiding Officer was on this trip, as well.   Like the Senator from West Virginia, who just spoke, my most  memorable conversation was with a young mother named Katarina, who had  two children, one age 8 and one age 6, with her. I met her at the  Polish refugee welcome center. It was only a few miles from the  Ukrainian border.   She said to me:         I want to live in peace. I want to be back in Ukraine, but       I have to keep my children safe.    She was weary-looking but determined to keep her children safe. This  young mother and her two children were leaving the only country she had  ever known. She left her husband behind, not knowing when or if she  would see him again--all in order to keep her children safe.   We have only to watch the scenes of what Putin is doing to try to  destroy Ukraine and to break the will of its people. He has bombed  apartment buildings, schools, theaters, shelters, humanitarian  corridors. He has bombed a maternity hospital. What does that tell you  about this man, this war criminal? What more do we need to know?   The only way that we can end this humanitarian crisis is to provide  Ukraine with the weapons, supplies, ammunition, and other assistance  that they need to bring to an end this Russian war of aggression. We  must provide, without further delay, the Ukrainians with the MiG  fighter aircraft that have been held up by this administration and  which Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has requested. We must ensure that  Ukraine receives additional anti-aircraft defenses, including the S- 300, whether directly from our stocks or those of our allies.   We must ensure that the Ukrainians have the means to fight and defend  their people from these ongoing atrocities ordered by Putin. And we  know of--we saw firsthand--their extraordinary bravery, their  determination to fight for their country, to put everything they have  on the line.   Every moment, every hour, every day counts. We do not have time for  endless debate and delay that costs the lives of innocent Ukrainians.  As the Ukrainian leader told us, the administration must stop telling  Putin what America will not do. It must say what we will do.   The administration should also make every effort in collaboration  with Congress, when necessary, to ease the process of allowing  Ukrainians with family members here in America to come stay with them  until it is safe to return home. I know many Mainers are eager to help.   Finally, I want to acknowledge the terrific American soldiers that we  met, including several from the great State of Maine. Many of them left  their families with days' or even hours' notice over the past few  weeks. They rapidly deployed to Germany, Poland, and other NATO allies  to deter Russia's aggression and defend these NATO members from any  Russian threats. Each of these members of our military were motivated,  patriotic, and impressive, and I am so grateful for their service.   I have read that President Biden is considering stationing our troops  close to the frontline to send an unmistakable message to the Russians  on a more permanent basis, and I hope that he will indeed do that.
