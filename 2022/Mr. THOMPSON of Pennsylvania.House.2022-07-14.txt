 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about an incredible American hero from the small town of Freeport,  Pennsylvania.   Corporal Joseph Rodney Chapman was drafted into the U.S. Army in  1942, and he fought with the 80th Infantry Division in World War II. He  fought across France, was wounded twice in the process, and earned a  Bronze Star for his heroic actions to destroy a German machine gun and  its crew.   In the spring of 1944, as the Allies continued to drive the enemy  into retreat, Corporal Chapman found himself under enemy fire and was  taken as a prisoner of war.   After returning home to Pennsylvania, he worked for the post office  in Freeport for 35 years as a mail carrier and clerk. He was married to  his late wife, Mary, for 69 years, and he just celebrated a very happy  100th birthday this past October.   Mr. Speaker, Corporal Chapman is the epitome of the American spirit.  Therefore, I am incredibly proud to introduce legislation today that  would rename the very post office Mr. Chapman worked at in his honor.  He has devoted his life to his country and his community, and for that  we owe him a great debt of gratitude.                            ____________________
