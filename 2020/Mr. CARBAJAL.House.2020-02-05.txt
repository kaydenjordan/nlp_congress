 Madam Speaker, today, I rise because there is an  epidemic in our country. One hundred Americans die every day from gun  violence. We are 25 times more likely to die from guns than people who  live in comparable nations.   Gun violence is personal to me. When I was a young boy, my sister  took her life with my father's revolver. In 2014, my community was  devastated by the Isla Vista shooting that killed six people and left  14 injured.   I rise because there are commonsense solutions to curb this violent  trend. One of those is my bipartisan Extreme Risk Protection Order Act  of 2019, which will help ensure people who have demonstrated that they  are at risk of hurting themselves or others temporarily don't have  access to guns. The bill passed out of the committee. I now ask the  House to bring this legislation to the floor.   The House has already sent two bipartisan background check bills to  the Senate; yet, Senate Majority Leader McConnell has not acted. There  is no excuse.   I will continue to rise until we end this epidemic.                            ____________________
