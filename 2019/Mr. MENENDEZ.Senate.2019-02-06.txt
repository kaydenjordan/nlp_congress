 Mr. President, today I wish to express my deep concerns  regarding President Trump's suspension of U.S. participation in the  Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces--INF--Treaty and decision to withdraw  from the treaty in 6 months.   Before diving into the substance of this misguided decision, I am  compelled, as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, to object to the process.   The President is pulling out of this treaty, a treaty that was  approved by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 93-5 and that has been in  force for three decades, without official notice or any meaningful  consultation with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the  congressional committee charged with responsibility and jurisdiction  over treaties and without the approval of the Senate.   This was despite multiple opportunities to explain the rationale for  this decision, including a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing  on arms control and Russia. In that hearing, senior officials from the  Department of State and the Department of Defense provided no  indication that a decision to withdraw was even imminent, nor that U.S.  forces envisioned any military operational benefit from near-term  withdrawal.   Article 2 of the Constitution endows the President and the Senate  with shared power over treaties, including an exceptionally high bar  for advice and consent. This President's unilateral decision to  withdraw from the INF, without any meaningful engagement with the  Senate, much less the approval of this body, is impossible to square  with this shared constitutional power.   In that vein, I urge all of my colleagues to focus not just on the  substance of the President's decision but also on the process. INF is  not alone; it is one of several treaties that the President has  jettisoned without any input from the Senate. He is eroding the  constitutional powers and institutional prerogatives of this body, and  we cannot be silent.   Even if the President had followed a sound process, this decision is  misguided on substance. It is another example of the President and his  team's apparent belief that destroying international agreements, with  little or no thought given to how to address the underlying problem, is  the solution to a complex security issues.   In this case, there is no doubt, what the problem is and where it  comes from.   Russia, and Russia alone, bears the responsibility for the  degradation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. It has  brazenly violated the treaty and has been unwilling to take the steps  necessary to come back into compliance.   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has succinctly laid out  Russia's efforts to undermine the INF treaty. He stated ``the  Intelligence Community assesses Russia has flight-tested, produced, and  deployed cruise missiles with a range capability prohibited by the  Treaty.''   Why is Russia doing this? Again, according to Director Coats: Russia  is developing missiles to ``target critical European military and  economic infrastructure'' with both conventional and nuclear  capabilities. Russia is seeking the means to coerce our European and  Asian allies by ``posing a direct conventional and nuclear threat'' to  them.    Russia's violation of its INF treaty obligations and its nuclear  threats against Europe are not particularly surprising. It fits within  a pattern of malign behavior that seeks to undermine the security  framework that contributed to the peaceful end to the Cold War. Russia  has suspended its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed  Forces in Europe and of course  [[Page S914]]  violated the core principles of the Helsinki accord by annexing Crimea  and invading Ukraine.   The question has never been whether Russia is violating the INF  treaty. It is and has been in violation. The question is how the United  States should respond.   Throughout the process of trying to bring Russia back into  compliance, I have raised serious concerns about the Trump  administration's approach. As is the case with most major foreign  policy challenges facing the United States, the Trump administration  lacks a coherent strategy. In this case, they do not appear to have any  realistic plan to address the threat that new Russian missile  capabilities pose to the interests of the United States and those of  our allies.   By withdrawing from INF at this time, the United States is providing  Russia with a pass on its obligations and giving them the unfettered  and unconstrained opportunity to expand the deployment of their new  missile system. The U.S. does not have the assets in place to defend  against Russia's new missile, nor is it anywhere close to developing,  manufacturing, and deploying a similar system that would operate as a  counter to it.   So the President is shredding the INF treaty without any credible  alternative. It is not just bad policy; it is dangerous to European  security. The path the administration has chosen leaves our allies  vulnerable to Russian aggression, and at this moment, there is no  recourse for the United States or our allies.   It is within this vein of poor foreign policy planning that I want to  discuss a second issue related to INF. In 2021, the United States will  face the decision whether to extend New START. I am extremely concerned  that President Trump has no appreciation or understating of the  importance of arms control treaties and that this deficiency will lead  him to abandon all limitations on U.S-Russian nuclear forces.   We have historically negotiated and entered into agreements with our  adversaries recognizing that we are dealing with hostile powers that  cannot be trusted. We build in metrics that account for a probability  of efforts to deceive and dodge. In high stakes agreements, provisions  outlining U.S. intelligence verification and compliance are essential.  In the universe of arms control agreements with Russia, we conduct on- site inspections of military bases and facilities, and we require data  exchanges in order track the status and makeup of their nuclear forces.   In assessing the value of an arms control agreement, we consider  whether our participation in the agreement advances our national  security interests.   Let's be clear: The New START treaty clearly advances vital U.S.  national security interests. Through our inspection regime, we are able  to verify that Russia is adhering to the limitations the treaty places  on the size of Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal. Through our data  exchanges and our verification regimes, we gain extremely valuable  insights into the size and location of their nuclear forces.   At a time when Russia is engaged in malign behavior all over the  world and Putin is pressing to reassert Russian power, it is critical  we maintain key leverage points to protect against a revisionist  Russia. New START is one of those points, and I urge my colleagues and  the administration that, in light of ongoing Russian compliance with  New START, we must extend the treaty for an additional 5 years.   I strongly urge the administration try a new approach and develop a  coherent strategy to stabilize our arms control regime. The  relationship with the Russian Federation remains a challenge, but we  must address these arms control issues and negotiate a durable  agreement that ensures stability in our nuclear forces.   Neither an unconstrained nuclear arms race nor blind faith in arms  control agreements serve U.S. national security interest. American  security is best served through a strong, credible deterrent that  operates within a legally binding, stable, and constrained arms control  environment.                            ____________________
