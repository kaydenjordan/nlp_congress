 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this censure  resolution that is blatantly Islamophobic, anti-democratic, and an  utter waste of time.   This resolution is as dishonest as it is unproductive. Any Member who  denies that Congresswoman Tlaib has opposed the killing of civilians-- Israeli, Palestinian, and American alike--is willfully ignoring the  truth.   Representative Tlaib was elected by voters in Michigan to do exactly  what she does best: advocate for a better, safer, more just world. She  leads with love, speaks truth to power, and seeks justice even when her  life and that of her family and her staff are threatened.   As a daughter, mother, sister, friend, advocate, and effective, duly- elected, three-term, first-ever Palestinian-American Member of  Congress, she has been a much-needed voice in an institution that has  too often failed to listen.   Today, Republicans are again attacking a Democratic colleague just  because they don't like what she has to say. It is another shameful but  predictable ploy of distraction from the real traffickers of hate who  are obsessed with policing progressive women of color.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this offensive resolution for every little girl  from Michigan to the Middle East who sees herself when they see the  leadership of Representative Rashida Tlaib, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.
