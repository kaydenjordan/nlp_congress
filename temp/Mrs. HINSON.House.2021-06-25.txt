 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Michael  Nesslage, who has served as fire chief in Hiawatha, Iowa, for the last  16 years. I want to congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement  this week.   Chief Nesslage dedicated his professional life to protecting and  serving others. As Hiawatha's fire chief, Chief Nesslage successfully  started ambulance service in the area and spearheaded the creation of a  volunteer firefighter program. Not only did Chief Nesslage help  establish the program, but he also closely coached and mentored those  seeking careers as first responders.   Chief Nesslage continues to be a role model for our entire community.  [[Page H3152]]    When I was a State representative, we worked very closely to pass  GEMT legislation. I am very proud we got that done.   Madam Speaker, I know I speak for the entire Hiawatha community in  saying that we are so thankful for Chief Nesslage's years of selfless  service and dedication to keeping Hiawatha safe.   I thank Chief Nesslage and wish him and his family the best as they  begin this new chapter.   Madam Speaker, it is an honor to now serve Chief Nesslage in  Congress, and I appreciate his service.                            ____________________
