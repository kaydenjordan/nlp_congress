 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary  career of a very special constituent of mine named Tina Panetta who  lives in Silver Spring and has been a public servant here on Capitol  Hill for many decades. She is popularly known as ``Mother on the  Hill.''   Born in the small town of Ovindoli, Italy, Ms. Panetta came to the  U.S. in 1955 with her two sons and husband, Ettore, to seek a better  life. Five years later, Tina became a citizen, and in January of 1961,  she gave birth to her youngest child, Maria Teresa.   In 1968, despite being unable to read, write, or speak English, she  began serving as a waitress in the U.S. Senate cafeteria. Over the  course of her decades-long career on Capitol Hill, Tina touched the  lives of Senators, Representatives, Vice Presidents, Presidents, and  their families.   When Tina sprained her ankle, then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey  accompanied her to the nursing bay. When Tina was bedridden, she  received bouquets of flowers and get-well cards from many Senators and  Representatives.   Former Senator Paul Simon once said that Tina's story is ``the story  of America.'' On her 90th birthday, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier said  that she is ``an inspiration to the Nation.'' On her 93rd birthday,  Senator Durbin wrote that the Senate has ``deep respect and admiration  for her.''   I am here today to remind my colleagues and my constituents of Tina's  wonderful legacy here on Capitol Hill. At a time of polarization,  Tina's story reminds us of our common bonds, both in Congress and in  the country.   I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sincere thanks to  Tina for  [[Page H23]]  her many years of service to our country.                            ____________________
