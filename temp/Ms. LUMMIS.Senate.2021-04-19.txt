 Madam President, I rise to honor the true heroism of  Officer Jacob Carlson of the Casper, WY, police department. On May 6,  2018, Officer Carlson risked his life to save his fellow officer and  the lives of several young children when a routine traffic stop turned  deadly. Every day, police officers must remain vigilant because, as we  have seen, even routine enforcement actions can go sideways at a  moment's notice. That happened to Officer Carlson, and his actions  speak to his character. He put his life on the line to protect his  fellow officer and his community. His courage is inspiring, and I am  proud to call him a son of Wyoming. For this action, Officer Carlson  has been awarded the Congressional Badge of Bravery, and it is a badge  he earned.   His years of service and dedication to the Casper Police Department  were cut short by what happened, but Officer Carlson's career of  service as a police officer and former service in the U.S. Army is a  legacy for which he can be proud.   Officer Carlson is a remarkable example of the highest caliber of law  enforcement professionals. He is the hero we describe when we teach our  children and grandchildren about the police officers who protect our  communities.   Officers such as Officer Carlson who protect our great State  reinforce my belief that Wyoming truly is the best State in the Nation.  When Americans want to see an example of how police officers should  comport themselves, they can look upon Wyoming as the shining example.  Officer Carlson's actions on May 6, 2018, exemplify why.   The State of Wyoming is blessed to have not only one brave officer  deserving of this honor. The second officer is one of the people  Officer Carlson protected in the face of adversity, Officer Randi  Garrett, whose courage and heroism was also on display that day, is  equally deserving and will be honored with a Congressional Badge of  Bravery.   My sincere thanks to Officer Carlson for making Casper and the State  of Wyoming one of the greatest, safest places to live.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor Officer Randi Garrett,  whose experience and skill and whose strong character helped save lives  on May 6, 2018.   Not only did Officer Garrett act with poise under intense pressure  when a routine traffic stop turned violent, but while in immediate and  real danger, she kept her focus on her mission, and helped to save the  lives of two innocent children and the life of a fellow officer because  of it. I shudder at the thought of what might have happened had Officer  Garrett not acted with speed and purpose. Officer Garrett has been  awarded the Congressional Badge of Bravery for her actions, and I am so  proud of her for it.   Officer Garrett is a shining example of what steadfast commitment,  leadership and decisionmaking under pressure looks like. It is because  of officers like Randi that the people of Casper can feel safe and  secure in their community.   As we approach the third anniversary of Officer Randi Garrett's  heroism, I know that her acts that day won't be forgotten by the Casper  community and by those whose lives she helped to save. For without  them, it is unknown the tragedies that may have occurred. Instead, she  serves as an example today to every young woman and girl interested in  serving their community as an officer. I can think of no better example  for young women across the State of Wyoming to aspire to.   Now, as she receives the Congressional Badge of Bravery, I hope it  serves as a reminder of a day when her courage was called upon and she  answered. This prestigious award is also being given to her counterpart  who was there with her that day, Officer Jacob Carlson. Just as they  faced danger together, this badge acts as yet another bond that the two  of them will continue to share.   My sincere thanks to Officer Garrett for her continued service and  dedication to the city of Casper and our great State.                            ____________________
