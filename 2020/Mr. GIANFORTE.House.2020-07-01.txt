 Mr. Speaker, the Sidney and Kinsey Irrigation  Districts serve more than 130 family farms that irrigate nearly 12,000  acres of farmland in eastern Montana.   A recent decision by the Bureau of Reclamation has upended 70 years  of how Sidney and Kinsey irrigators have received project use power to  pump water.   The change will increase power costs from 2.5 percent of their annual  budget to nearly 40 percent.   Losing this power would put these family farmers and companies out of  business.   My amendment will fix this issue by restoring the original  arrangement that has been in place for 70 years.   I urge support for it.               Montana Should be Able to Sell its Coal Overseas     Mr. Speaker, Montana should be able to sell its coal  overseas.   Washington State is preventing construction of coal export terminals,  effectively shutting down exports of Montana coal and  unconstitutionally interfering with interstate commerce.   My amendment will continue the Federal permitting process if  Washington State remains on its unconstitutional path.   Building a coal port that supports good-paying union jobs in  Washington and good-paying jobs across Montana should be a bipartisan  winner.   I urge adoption of this amendment.                            ____________________
