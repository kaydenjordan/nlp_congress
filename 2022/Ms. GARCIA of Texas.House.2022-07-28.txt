 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate House  Democrats' efforts to lower costs for working families across America.   For months now, Democrats and the President have been working closely  together to lower the prices of gas for Americans. We have focused on  people's pocketbooks, not politics.   As a result, gas prices have been decreasing for 5 straight weeks,  down around 70 cents since last month. In fact, $3.99 a gallon is the  most common price in America today. Mr. Speaker, I saw the $3.99, and  lower, in the Houston area over the weekend.   On average, drivers are saving $35 per month. For residents in my  district, this can mean the difference between a warm family meal or  going hungry.   While Republicans in Congress have no solutions to lower prices and  remain focused on other matters, like stripping women of their  reproductive rights, House Democrats will continue delivering results  for the American people. We are the party that puts people over  politics.                            ____________________
