 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4917) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to provide  testimonial subpoena authority, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4917         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``IG Subpoena Authority Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY PROVISIONS FOR INSPECTORS                     GENERAL.         The Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) is       amended--        (1) by inserting after section 6 the following new section:       ``SEC. 6A. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY.         ``(a) Testimonial Subpoena Authority.--In addition to the       authority otherwise provided by this Act and in accordance       with the requirements of this section, each Inspector       General, in carrying out the provisions of this Act (or in       the case of an Inspector General or Special Inspector General       not established under this Act, the provisions of the       authorizing statute), is authorized to require by subpoena       the attendance and testimony of witnesses as necessary in the       performance of the functions assigned to the Inspector       General by this Act (or in the case of an Inspector General       or Special Inspector General not established under this Act,       the functions assigned by the authorizing statute), which in       the case of contumacy or refusal to obey, such subpoena shall       be enforceable by order of any appropriate United States       district court. An Inspector General may not require by       subpoena the attendance and testimony of any current Federal       employees, but may use other authorized procedures.        ``(b) Nondelegation.--The authority to issue a subpoena       under subsection (a) may not be delegated.        ``(c) Panel Review Before Issuance.--        ``(1) Approval required.--        ``(A) Request for approval by subpoena panel.--Before the       issuance of a subpoena described in subsection (a), an       Inspector General shall submit a request for approval to       issue a subpoena to a panel (in this section, referred to as       the `Subpoena Panel'), which shall be comprised of three       Inspectors General of the Council of the Inspectors General       on Integrity and Efficiency, who shall be designated by the       Inspector General serving as Chairperson of the Council.        ``(B) Protection from disclosure.--The information       contained in the request submitted by an Inspector General       under subparagraph (A) and the identification of a witness       shall be protected from disclosure to the extent permitted by       law. Any request for disclosure of such information shall be       submitted to the Inspector General requesting the subpoena.        ``(2) Time to respond.--        ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),       the Subpoena Panel shall approve or deny a request for       approval to issue a subpoena not later than 10 days after the       submission of such request.        ``(B) Additional information for panel.--If the Subpoena       Panel determines that additional information is necessary to       approve or deny such request, the Subpoena Panel shall       request such information and shall approve or deny such       request not later than 20 days after the submission of such       request.        ``(3) Denial by panel.--If a majority of the Subpoena Panel       denies the approval of a subpoena, that subpoena may not be       issued.        ``(d) Notice to Attorney General.--        ``(1) In general.--If the Subpoena Panel approves a       subpoena under subsection (c), the Inspector General shall       notify the Attorney General that the Inspector General       intends to issue the subpoena.        ``(2) Denial for interference with an ongoing       investigation.--Not later than 10 days after the date on       which the Attorney General is notified pursuant to paragraph       (1), the Attorney General may object to the issuance of the       subpoena because the subpoena will interfere with an ongoing       investigation and the subpoena may not be issued.        ``(3) Issuance of subpoena approved.--If the Attorney       General does not object to the issuance of the subpoena       during the 10-day period described in paragraph (2), the       Inspector General may issue the subpoena.        ``(e) Regulations.--The Chairperson of the Council of the       Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, in       consultation with the Attorney General, shall prescribe       regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.        ``(f) Inspector General Defined.--For purposes of this       section, the term `Inspector General' includes each Inspector       General established under this Act and each Inspector General       or Special Inspector General not established under this Act.        ``(g) Applicability.--The provisions of this section shall       not affect the exercise of authority by an Inspector General       of testimonial subpoena authority established under another       provision of law.'';        (2) in section 5(a)--        (A) in paragraph (21)(B), by striking ``; and'' and       inserting a semicolon;        (B) in paragraph (22), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by inserting at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(23) a description of the use of subpoenas for the       attendance and testimony of certain witnesses authorized       under section 6A.''; and        (3) in section 8G(g)(1), by inserting ``6A,'' before ``and       7''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my bill, H.R. 4917, the IG Subpoena  Authority Act. H.R. 4917 would provide inspectors general the authority  to subpoena contractors, grant recipients, and former Federal employees  for testimony necessary for their investigations.   Inspectors general perform a critical role in the performance of the  Federal Government by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. In fiscal  year 2016 alone, Federal inspectors general identified potential  savings of over $45 billion. Nearly half of those savings were  identified in the course of the IG's investigative work.   Congress, the American people, and the agencies themselves rely on  inspectors general reviews to find areas for improved efficiency and  effectiveness, but those reviews are limited by the IG's inability to  compel contractors and former employees to cooperate. The IG Subpoena  Authority Act gives inspectors general a much-needed tool to fulfill  their investigative function under the Inspector General Act.   To effectively identify waste, fraud, and abuse, IGs should be able  to conduct a thorough and complete investigation. To conduct a thorough  and complete investigation, however, IGs need to be able to talk to the  people involved.   Unfortunately, inspectors general haven't always been able to obtain  testimony from those key individuals. They collect testimony from  Federal employees, but sometimes the employees resign or retire before  the inspectors general can review them. In fact, the IG community has  informed us of many cases that went cold when witnesses left the  agencies or refused to testify voluntarily.   This bill seeks to address these gaps in the evidentiary record by  permitting IGs to subpoena the testimony of witnesses during the course  of an audit or investigation. The bill establishes procedures to ensure  the authority is not abused.   To prevent abuse, inspectors general must get approval from a  subpoena review panel that will be made up of three other inspectors  general. The review panel must approve or deny the subpoena request  within 10 days of the request being filed.  [[Page H9071]]    Further, if a subpoena request is approved by the panel, the  requesting IG must notify the Attorney General of the pending subpoena.  The Attorney General is then able to review the subpoena and may object  to its issuance if it will interfere with an ongoing Department of  Justice investigation. An IG must complete all of these steps prior to  issuing the subpoena.   A version of this bill already passed the House once before. Last  Congress, the committee worked on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to  enact the Inspector General Empowerment Act. When it first passed the  House, the Inspector General Empowerment Act included testimonial  subpoena authority for IGs. Although the provision did not make it into  law, I hope that changes this year.   I would like to thank the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity  and Efficiency, especially the Department of Justice Inspector General  Michael Horowitz, who chairs the Council, and Peace Corps Inspector  General Kathy Buller, who chairs its Legislation Committee, for their  work in support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Ms. Buller  supporting the legislation.           Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and             Efficiency,                                                      June 7, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Oversight and Government           Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Russell,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy, Ranking Member Cummings, and       Representative Russell: We appreciate your efforts to address       the Inspector General (IG) community's long-standing interest       in obtaining testimonial subpoena authority (TSA) for all IGs       and would like to outline our views on H.R. 4917, the IG       Subpoena Authority Act. For many years, the Legislation       Committee of the Council of the Inspectors General on       Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) has included TSA among its       legislative priorities.        The authority in H.R. 4917 would assist government       oversight by providing a critical tool to address fraud,       waste, and abuse by authorizing all IGs to subpoena the       attendance and testimony of certain witnesses, as necessary,       to fulfill the functions of the Inspector General Act of       1978, as amended (IG Act). CIGIE supports the language in the       bill aligning the scope of TSA with the IG's existing       documentary subpoena authority, found in Section 6(a)(4) of       the IG Act. While requiring that any subpoena be necessary in       the performance of IG work, the language does not limit who       may be subpoenaed, other than with respect to current Federal       employees (as they are already generally required to       cooperate with OIGs).        Congress has already granted some IGs TSA under the IG Act       or through other laws. The Department of Defense Office of       Inspector General (DOD OIG) was provided TSA under Section       1042 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010,       codified at Section 8(i) of the IG Act. As noted in the       Congressional record, DOD OIG has used this authority       judiciously and sparingly. The Department of Health and Human       Services OIG also has testimonial subpoena power in certain       circumstances. Moreover, IGs overseeing appropriations under       the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 received       TSA to be exercised through the now-sunsetted Recovery       Accountability and Transparency Board.        Following the practice of those IGs who already have or had       TSA, CIGIE is committed to ensuring that the authority will       be used appropriately and fairly. In short, CIGIE echoes       Ranking Member Cummings's belief that IGs would ``act       responsibly and use this authority only when absolutely       necessary,'' and that appropriate safeguards provide checks       on potential abuse.                               THE NEED FOR TSA         While the current IG documentary subpoena authority under       the IG Act is a powerful tool, it is a tool with inherent       limitations. Most notably, Federal employees who are the       subjects of IG investigations can retire or resign while       being investigated. In such cases, limitations on IG       documentary subpoena authority or other IG Act authorities       can thwart IG investigations. For example, this could impact       the ability to pursue the investigations considered under the       Official Personnel File Enhancement Act.        These limitations have had negative, real world effects on       IG oversight and can impact Congressional initiatives. As       Chairman Gowdy has recognized, ``[y]ou're only as good as       your access to information and witnesses.'' An informal       survey of the IG community revealed TSA would have       strengthened IG oversight throughout the Federal government       as illustrated in the following examples:        One agency's OIG conducted an investigation of a senior       staff member who allegedly modified official documents and       impersonated an official, before retiring during the       investigation. The former senior staff member was not       receptive to being interviewed after retiring. Because the       OIG lacked TSA, the OIG could not compel testimony from the       retired senior staff member to conduct an effective       investigation.        In connection with an OIG's review of alleged safety issues       at an agency facility, the OIG was unable to interview the       central person identified in the allegation or that person's       supervisor since both had left Federal service and declined       voluntary interviews. The unavailability of those key       witnesses hampered the OIG's ability to fully investigate       alleged safety issues or to address a key objective of the       inspection, which was to identify factors that may have       contributed to leadership being unaware of those issues.        During another OIG's investigation into a small business       owner who received two Federal grants for overlapping       business proposals, key individuals declined to be       interviewed by the OIG. One of the employees confessed to       destroying company documents and creating new ones at the       request of the owner. After the confession, other individuals       involved declined to be interviewed. Without TSA or the       cooperation of another employee or the owner, the OIG was       unable to pursue obstruction and other potential charges       against the subjects.        Another agency's OIG faced obstacles when investigating       fraud associated with a loan program. The loan officer was       the only source of information to determine the individual       associated with the borrower. The OIG was unable to       effectively complete the investigation because the bank       declined to make the loan officer available for an interview.        A different OIG discovered a contractor was being paid for       services it did not provide, and only minimal information       could be collected through documentary subpoena authority.       Attempts to contact the contractor were unproductive. If that       OIG had TSA, the OIG could have compelled the contractor's       representative to be interviewed.        An OIG was reviewing third-party contractors retained by       the agency to provide healthcare services to eligible       individuals. The OIG could not determine if the contractors       provided proper notifications to individuals about their       eligibility for the services. Without the ability to compel       the contractors to testify, the OIG could rely only on       records, which did not contain specific information on which       to base conclusions.        Yet another OIG was unable to effectively examine potential       false and fraudulent billing after discovering an       unauthorized subcontractor was performing the majority of       work under a large contract. As the subcontractor was not in       a direct contractual relationship with the agency, the OIG       had to rely on documentary subpoenas. If that OIG had TSA, it       could have fully examined the potentially false and       fraudulent billing.        An investigation conducted on behalf of the Integrity       Committee was unable to obtain evidence from a former senior       level OIG employee who had retired from Federal service and       declined to speak with investigators. The investigation       concluded without the former senior level OIG employee's       evidence.        Another OIG encountered a significant obstacle while       conducting an audit where several former government officials       refused to be interviewed. Without the ability to compel       their testimony, the OIG had to report their refusal to the       appropriate Congressional oversight committee. Only after the       OIG reported this refusal to Congress did these former       government officials finally agree to be interviewed. If that       OIG had TSA, it would not have needed Congressional       intervention to complete its oversight work.                     SUBPOENA PANEL AND OTHER PROVISIONS         With respect to the IG subpoena panel created in the bill,       and given the nature of the authority being granted, we       understand the interest of Congress in putting in place an       additional check on the use of TSA. While, in our view, the       provision is unnecessary, we do not object to its inclusion.       CIGIE requests, however, that two additional points related       to the language of the legislation be reconsidered. First,       the non-delegation clause in the proposed IG Act Section       ``6A(b)'' may create problems for OIGs subject to the Federal       Vacancies Reform Act. Most relevantly, it could limit long-      serving acting IGs from exercising the authority when the       acting IG is no longer able to perform the ``duties and       functions'' designated solely to the IG. To avoid this issue,       we recommend that this provision be removed. Second, with       respect to the proposed IG Act Section ``6A(e)'', having the       CIGIE Chair issue guidelines to IGs, rather than promulgate       regulations, would achieve Congress's intent of standardizing       and governing the use of TSA without requiring CIGIE to       undergo a lengthy and resource-intensive rulemaking process.       Moreover, it will be more economical to update or modify       guidelines as needed.                 SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS         The benefits of this legislation are reflected in the       support expressed by government oversight stakeholders for       providing IGs with TSA. Importantly, bi-partisan support for       providing IGs with TSA has come not just from the House       Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but also from the       unanimous consent it received in the House of Representatives       last Congress. Other important government oversight       stakeholders have also expressed how government oversight       would benefit from OIGs  [[Page H9072]]       receiving TSA. For example the Office of Special Counsel       wrote to Senate leadership describing how providing IGs with       this authority will enhance IG efforts to reduce government       waste and abuse, and how TSA has been helpful in reprisal       investigations undertaken by the Office of Special Counsel.       Nongovernmental organizations emphasized in a May 2016 letter       to Congress that OIGs are essential to a well-functioning       Government, and noted that providing access to agency       information, including through TSA, would allow OIGs to       conduct proper oversight. As evidenced by both Congressional       and stakeholder support, TSA will benefit the IG community in       carrying out its oversight operations.                                  CONCLUSION         CIGIE appreciates your continued support of our work and       the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's       efforts to improve government oversight through H.R. 4917. In       the decades since the IG Act's passage, IGs have saved       taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and improved the       programs and operations of the Federal government through       their independent oversight. Testimonial subpoena authority       would further improve the ability of IGs to detect and       prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal operations. As       Representative Russell stated, ``Inspectors General are an       essential partner for Congress and by extension to we the       people that empower government,'' and ``we must provide       Inspectors General with the tools they need to fully       accomplish their mission. Testimonial subpoena authority is       one such tool, and a critical one at that.''        Thank you for your continued support of CIGIE and its       member IGs. We remain available to continue to work with you       and the Congress on the important issues addressed in this       legislation. If you have any questions, please do not       hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                   Kathy A. Buller,                                Chair, CIGIE Legislation Committee.     Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would like to thank my Democratic  colleagues for their support and thoughtful dialogue, particularly the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), who sponsored this bill with me.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the chief complaints of the American people is  that we can't hold our government accountable. This bill goes a long  way to correct that.   In the future, no longer will people be able to simply walk away from  agencies and duties in government without any accounting. We have built  in the safeguards, and we have worked in a bipartisan way, so that we  can achieve that aim.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4809) to increase access to agency guidance documents, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4809         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4809, the Guidance Out of  Darkness, or GOOD, Act, which was introduced by my colleague and friend  from North Carolina, Mr. Walker.   Regulatory guidance is widely used by agencies. The guidance applies  to industry and taxpayers alike. However, we really don't know the full  universe of agency guidance.   Professor Nicholas Parrillo of Yale Law School, who testified before  the Oversight and Government Reform Committee earlier this year said,  ``There is no comprehensive compilation of guidance, but everyone  agrees its volume is oceanic.''   The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been looking into  agency use of guidance over the past year, and we found this is an area  of government in need of reform.   H.R. 4809 introduces much-needed elements of transparency and  consistency to the process of disseminating agency guidance documents.   In 2007, the Office of Management and Budget issued what is known as  the ``Good Guidance Bulletin.'' This bulletin requires Federal agencies  to follow certain best practices when issuing significant guidance  documents, which are those that are the costliest to comply with or are  otherwise exceptionally impactful.   The Good Guidance Bulletin requires agencies to maintain lists of  their significant guidance documents on their websites so that they can  be readily found by the people and entities the documents affect. The  GOOD Act expands this posting requirement to all guidance documents.  Regulated entities shouldn't have to search high and low to find out  how agencies interpret the laws and regulations that affect every  sector of the economy. The public deserves to have this information,  and this legislation will make these policy documents more accessible  to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker), the sponsor of this bill, my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4887) to modernize Federal grant reporting, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4887         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Grant Reporting Efficiency       and Agreements Transparency Act of 2018'' or the ``GREAT       Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are to--        (1) modernize reporting by recipients of Federal grants and       cooperative agreements by creating and imposing data       standards for the information that grants and cooperative       agreement recipients must report to the Federal Government;        (2) implement the recommendation by the Director of the       Office of Management and Budget, under section 5(b)(6) of the       Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006       (31 U.S.C. 6101 note), which includes the development of a       ``comprehensive taxonomy of standard definitions for core       data elements required for managing Federal financial       assistance awards'';        (3) reduce burden and compliance costs of recipients of       Federal grants and cooperative agreements by enabling       technology solutions, existing or yet to be developed, by       both the public and private sectors, to better manage data       recipients already provide to the Federal Government; and        (4) to strengthen oversight and management of Federal       grants and cooperative agreements by agencies through       consolidated collection and display of and access to open       data that has been standardized, and where appropriate,       transparency to the public.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4887, the GREAT Act, introduced  by Congresswoman Foxx of North Carolina.   The GREAT Act would amend previously enacted legislation to improve  reporting on Federal grants.   In 2014, Congress enacted the Digital Accountability and Transparency  Act, or DATA Act. The DATA Act required the Office of Management and  Budget and the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a  pilot program to alleviate reporting burdens for grant recipients.   Through the pilot, it became clear that grant recipients often have  to enter the same data multiple times, and there is no single location  where all the data can be analyzed. This redundancy is burdensome for  both the grant recipient and for those conducting oversight of Federal  awards.   In fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government awarded over $660 billion  in grants. Congress has a fiscal responsibility to review this  spending, but without standardized data, it is difficult to do.   The GREAT Act fixes both of these problems by tasking the Office of  Management and Budget and an executive branch agency with creating  standardized reporting elements for Federal awards. The data elements  must be machine readable, nonproprietary, and comply with standards in  the DATA Act.   The GREAT Act requires the data collected to be made publicly  available within 4 years of enactment. The bill exempts personally  identifying information, sensitive data, and data otherwise exempt from  public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.   The GREAT Act increases transparency for public and private  oversight, helping to ensure taxpayers get the best possible return on  their $660 billion investment in Federal grants.   Improved reporting processes will also ease the burden on grant  recipients, so these individuals and organizations can focus on doing  the work, rather than filling out duplicative information.   The GREAT Act is supported by the DATA Coalition, the National Grants  Management Association, and the Association of Government Accountants.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Foxx and Representative Gomez for  their work on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is a sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4431) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for  interest payments by agencies in the case of administrative error in  processing certain annuity deposits for prior military service, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4431         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4431, the Correcting  Miscalculations in Veterans' Pensions Act, introduced by Congressman  Carter of Georgia.   Civilian Federal employees earn an annuity as a part of their service  to the country. Newly hired civil servants with prior Federal service,  such as members of the military or the Peace Corps, can pay a deposit  to count their prior service toward that annuity. This allows an  individual to increase their pension upon retirement by counting  previous, noncivilian service in the annuity calculation.   Under Federal retirement rules, there is a set period of time in  which the individual can pay the service deposit. If a deposit isn't  paid within this period of time, interest is assessed.   For example, someone wishing to pay a military service deposit must  do so within 2 years of starting civilian service. On the third  anniversary of civilian employment, interest will begin to accrue  annually until the deposit is paid in full.   From time to time, agencies make mistakes that can cause an  individual to be assessed interest that would not otherwise be owed.  Most commonly, the problem arises when an agency provides inaccurate  information about the amount or due date of the deposit. But under  current law, agencies cannot fix those mistakes, meaning the civil  servant has to pay the cost of the agency's mistake.   A 1996 opinion by the Government Accountability Office found the  Department of Energy was prohibited from paying the interest assessed  as a result of an agency's mistake on a military service deposit  without a change in the law. The agency made a mistake, and the agency  wanted to pay the difference. But under the restrictions of current  law, the individual had to cover the interest payments that accrued  through no fault of his own.   This bill fixes that problem to ensure civil servants do not pay the  cost of agencies' mistakes. Specifically, the bill authorizes Federal  agencies to pay interest assessed on military service deposits,  AmeriCorps service deposits, and Peace Corps service deposits, if the  interest is a result of an agency error.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, Mr. Carter, for his  work on this important bill. I look forward to hearing from him in a  moment.   I would also like to thank Chairman Harper from the Committee on  House Administration for their support in bringing this bill to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 2018.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On November 16, 2017, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 4431,       the Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans' Pensions Act       without amendment, by voice vote. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, with additional referral to the Committee on House       Administration.        I ask you allow the Committee on the House Administration       to be discharged from further consideration of the bill to       expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no way       affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on House Administration represented on the conference       committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter       and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,      Trey Gowdy.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       4431, The Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans Pensions       Act. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall within       the Jurisdiction of Committee on House Administration.        I realize that discharging the Committee on House       Administration from further consideration of H.R. 4431 will       serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives       and agree to do so. It is the understanding of the Committee       on House Administration that forgoing action on H.R. 4431       will not prejudice the Committee with respect to appointment       of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim. I request       that your letter and this response be included in the bill       report filed by your Committee, as well as in the       Congressional Record.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5896) to amend title 5, United States Code, to modify the  authority for pay and work schedules of border patrol agents, and for  other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendments made by section 2 shall take effect on the       first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the       day that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 5896, the Border Patrol Agent Pay  Reform Amendments Act of 2018, introduced by my friend, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Hurd).                                time  1930    The U.S. Border Patrol is vital to the Nation's security interests.  Border Patrol agents secure the international land border and the  coastal waters of the United States. They protect the American public  from dangerous people and dangerous materials.   Previous human capital management systems at the agency resulted in  uncertain hours and overtime pay abuses. In 2014, Congress passed the  Border Patrol Agency Reform Act to create a new pay system. This new  system was designed to help the Border Patrol meet its mission by  increasing the number of hours worked by agents, providing more  reliable schedules and paychecks for agents and saving taxpayers around  $100 million, annually.   Since enactment, several organizations have identified problems with  the law's implementation, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection,  the Office of Personnel Management, and the National Border Patrol  Council.   H.R. 5896 seeks to address some of these implementation changes. It  gives the Border Patrol additional flexibility to meet its staffing  needs at specific locations. It removes the disincentive for agents to  receive advanced training by  [[Page H9080]]  allowing them to incur an overtime debt in lieu of a decrease in pay  and by raising the amount of training an agent can receive before the  debt accrues. H.R. 5896 allows agents to apply compensatory time off  accrued for travel toward the overtime debt.   To prevent gaming the system, the bill retains limitations on  overtime pay during an agent's control period, which is the period of  highest pay, generally just prior to retirement. However, the bill  switches from the current system, where the CBP controls the agent's  schedule, to a method which lets the agent work any of these three pay  levels, but with only a portion of their overtime pay computed into  their retirement.   The bill allows agents to take leave without pay, often used for  fulfilling National Guard and Reserve training requirements, without  incurring an overtime debt that they must make up, as they do under the  current system.   It allows Border Patrol agents at the level 2 and basic rates of pay  to work compressed schedules, as they did prior to the 2014 pay system  change. Agents will still work the required number of overtime hours  ordered under the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act.   Finally, the bill makes a series of final changes resulting from OPM  and CBP experiences in implementing the law.   I would like to thank Representative Hurd for his enormous work on  this important legislation. In addition, I would like to thank the CBP,  OPM, and the National Border Patrol Council for working with the  committee to get the bill where it is today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6846) to require the United States Postal Service to  establish new ZIP codes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ESTABLISHING NEW ZIP CODES.         Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Postal Service shall designate a single, unique ZIP       code for, as nearly as practicable, each of the following       communities:        (1) Miami Lakes, Florida.        (2) Storey County, Nevada.        (3) Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside in the Town of       Southampton, New York.        (4) Ocoee, Florida.        (5) Glendale, New York.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6846, introduced by the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart). The bill would require the United States  Postal Service to establish new ZIP Codes in Miami Lakes, Florida;  Ocoee, Florida; Storey County, Nevada; Glendale, New York; and  Flanders, Northampton; and Riverside in the town of Southampton, New  York.   H.R. 756, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017, which the Committee  on Oversight and Government Reform reported earlier this Congress,  would also have established these new ZIP Codes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart) to tell us more about the need for a new ZIP Code in his  district.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3398) to amend the Real ID Act of 2005 to permit Freely  Associated States to meet identification requirements under such Act,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3398         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``REAL ID Act Modification for       Freely Associated States Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT.         (a) Definition of State.--Section 201(5) of the Real ID Act       of 2005 (49 U.S.C. 30301 note; Public Law 109-13) is amended       by striking ``the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,''.        (b) Evidence of Lawful Status.--Section 202(c)(2)(B) of the       REAL ID Act of 2005 (49 U.S.C. 30301 note; Public Law 109-13)       is amended--        (1) in clause (viii), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (2) in clause (ix), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(x) is a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands,       the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau       who has been admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant       pursuant to a Compact of Free Association between the United       States and the Republic or Federated States.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, the United States solidified a unique  international relationship by signing the Compact of Free Association  with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of  Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Collectively, these three  sovereign nations are referred to as the Freely Associated States.   Under the Compact of Free Association, citizens from the Freely  Associated States can live, work, and study in the United States as  legal nonimmigrants without a need for a visa.   In 2005, Congress enacted the Real ID Act, which enacted the 9/11  Commission's recommendation to set Federal standards for driver's  license and other sources of identification. However, the Real ID Act  of 2005 made no mention of the Freely Associated States or the compact.  Instead, the law referred to ``the Trust Territory of the Pacific  Islands,'' a now-defunct entity that ceased to exist in 1994. The  former trusteeship predated the current self-governing status of Freely  Associated States as established under the Compact of Free Association.   As a result of this error, citizens of the Marshall Islands,  Micronesia, and Palau are often forced to settle for temporary driver's  licenses that expire after a year, costing these citizens access to  work, housing, transportation, and other opportunities. Because some  employers have been reluctant to hire or retain temporary-licensed  carriers, many of these citizens lose access to work, housing,  transportation, and other opportunities.   The omission also greatly disadvantages these citizens to other  nonimmigrants who are able to obtain standard licenses lasting up to 8  years, if they meet the Real ID Act eligibility requirements.   H.R. 3398 corrects this drafting error in the Real ID Act. Fixing  this error in  [[Page H9082]]  the law clarifies the legal eligibility of the citizens of these three  nations for full-term driver's licenses, honors the terms of our  Compact of Free Association, and reaffirms our partnership with the  three nations.   I would like to thank Representative  Don Young, the gentleman from  Alaska and my friend, for his work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young), the sponsor of this bill.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
