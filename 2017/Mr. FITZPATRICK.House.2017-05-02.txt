 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible actions of a group of individuals in my community.   On April 3, 2017, an amazing physician and amazing mother, Amy Reed,  experienced what should have been a catastrophic cardiac arrest at Penn  Medicine's community radiology center in Yardley, Pennsylvania. Yet,  because of the amazing efforts of a series of professionals, Amy  survived this event.   I would like to recognize the following individuals:   The advanced life support paramedics from the Yardley-Newtown area,  Mr. Mark Horner and Mr. Chris Adams;   St. Mary Medical Center's cardiac surgeon, Dr. Veluz, and the entire  cardiac surgery, anesthesia, and perfusion team at the St. Mary Medical  Center in Langhorne, Pennsylvania;   The PennSTAR trauma critical care air rescue helicopter crew, Ms.  Shiloh Kramer, Mr. John Goddard, and Mr. George Huey;   Cardiac critical care nurses, Ms. Coleen Nicolosi, Ms. Darian  Parkinson, and Ms. Laura Glorioso-Moyer, who took intensive care of Dr.  Reed in her initial resuscitation.   Thereafter, a corps of highly specialized surgical critical care  nurses played an intensive role in her ongoing recovery. Mr. David  Alfano, Ms. Carrie Brewster, Ms. Rachael Coyle, Ms. Catherine  DeLaurentis, Mr. Michael Duca, Ms. Christina Felix, Ms. Cortney  Johnson, Ms. Anita McAlee, Ms. Erin McCormick, Mr. Sebastian Romagnano,  Ms. Lina Sivadasan, Ms. Christine Steffon, Ms. Joann Vernon, Ms. Gina  Vizzarri, Ms. Meghan Welsh, and Ms. Danielle Wright all are to be  commended for their professionalism and extreme skill in recovering Dr.  Reed and giving her a second chance at life.   After 5 days in a coma, Amy has emerged and is neurologically intact.  The actions of these professionals led to Amy's life being saved. Their  conduct can only be characterized as heroic.   Amy is loved by family and many friends in Bucks County, and by many  thousands more across the United States for her role as a champion and  a spokeswoman for women's health and patient safety. And because of the  efforts of the medical professionals who saved her life, I have the  opportunity to continue working with Amy to advance her crucial  mission.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that small businesses  drive the American economy. Across the United States, small businesses  create about two out of every three new jobs.   Since 1963, every President has designated this week National Small  Business Week to celebrate these economic engines and encourage  policies that allow them to thrive. When our local small businesses  succeed, they create opportunity, invigorate communities, and preserve  the district character of our local economy. That is why I have  committed to visit 100 small businesses across my district this year  and every year, to better appreciate the needs of local small  businesses and help them create good-paying jobs in our community.   During my visits, I have heard common themes: a Tax Code that is too  complex, burdensome one-size-fits-all regulations from Washington, and  lawmakers too focused on partisan bickering rather than on working  together to grow our economy.   As we turn our attention to small businesses this week, let's put  these concerns at the forefront and get to work on solutions.                            ____________________
