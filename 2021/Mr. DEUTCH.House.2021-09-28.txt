 Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand here today in support  of this legislation, H.R. 1228, the Libya Stabilization Act.   This bipartisan bill, which I introduced with my friend, ranking  member of the Middle East, North Africa and Global Counterterrorism  Subcommittee,   Joe Wilson, clarifies and strengthens American policy  in support of a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the Libyan conflict.   The United States cannot afford to ignore this conflict. For years,  fighting in Libya has undermined the stability of North Africa,  exacerbated a humanitarian crisis, put the human rights of civilians-- Libyans as well as migrants in Libya--in jeopardy, and it has impeded a  return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks. Foreign interference has only  escalated the conflict.   The Libya Stabilization Act will deter foreign interference in Libya  by placing sanctions on those who deploy mercenaries, support militias,  violate the U.N. arms embargo, and commit human rights violations in  Libya.   It authorizes U.S. support for efforts to strengthen good governance,  promote anticorruption efforts, support free and fair elections, and  foster economic recovery.   The Libyan people deserve a future free from foreign meddling, from  conflict and corruption, and from economic turmoil. They deserve to  choose their leaders in free and fair elections.   That is why the United States must establish a clear and principled  policy towards Libya. That is why I was proud to introduce this  legislation in the 116th Congress and again in this Congress, to  clarify U.S. policy towards Libya and empower the United States with  sanctions authority to revitalize diplomacy, secure our national  interests, stabilize Libya, and provide peace and opportunity for the  Libyan people.   I have been heartened to see the Biden administration take a more  active role in U.S. diplomacy over Libya, which is a primary goal of  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, the Libya Stabilization Act is a critical  demonstration of Congress' interest in ending foreign intervention and  consolidating Libya's political gains, both before and after the  December elections. It is a demonstration that the United States is  ready to play an active, engaged role in achieving long-term peace and  stability in Libya.   That is why this bill is so important, and that is why I am proud to  stand here in support of H.R. 1228. I urge all of my colleagues to join  me in voting for this legislation.                                time  1400
