 Mr. Speaker, for too many communities in southeastern  Pennsylvania, the steady toll of gun violence day in and day out is a  horrifying reality.   Right now, my region is at the epicenter of a staggering uptick in  gun violence taking place in the background of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the first 3 months of this year, over 300 people in the city of  Philadelphia have been shot. Over 50 have been killed, and 5 of those  were children.   Mr. Speaker, the gun violence measures we are voting on this week  close major loopholes in our gun laws that have allowed people, who we  all agree should not have guns, to purchase guns without completed  background checks.   While our colleagues across the aisle claim these laws won't prevent  gun violence, that is not true. Even with the loopholes, Federal  background checks have prevented over 3 million sales to people we all  agree should not have guns.   When required and enforced, background checks work, and they have the  power to keep guns out of dangerous hands and off our streets.   Congressional complacency in addressing this issue has made our  country less safe and put children and our most marginalized  communities at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support these bills.                            ____________________
