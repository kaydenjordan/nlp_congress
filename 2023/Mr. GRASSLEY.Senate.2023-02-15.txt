 Mr. President, the media likes narratives that split  issues neatly into two opposing positions and often Republican against  Democrat.   There is one narrative that has been repeated so often it has become  conventional wisdom. It holds that President Biden and Democrats in  Congress have been 100 percent committed to opposing Russia's invasion  of Ukraine, but Republican support is softening.   That misleading narrative was briefly scrambled when the  Congressional Progressive Caucus sent a horribly naive letter calling  for President Biden to engage in direct diplomacy with Russia.   Clearly, there are factions on both sides of the aisle hesitant about  backing a Ukrainian victory. There is also confusion about who in U.S.  politics is most behind Ukraine winning the war.   Let's be clear, the most fervent supporters of victory for Ukraine  are Republicans.   Meanwhile, the Biden administration gets credit for being all in for  Ukraine, when in fact it is more accurate to say that it is, at best,  three-quarters of the way in. And it has been dragged this far by  events, public opinion, and some of our bolder European allies.   Speculation about future Republican support for Ukraine is often  framed in terms of Biden's chances to get the aid he might want, but no  one asks why President Biden let $2.2 billion worth of authority passed  by Congress to draw down existing weapons for Ukraine expire on  September 30 unused.   I have been pleased for the most part with President Biden's  rhetorical defense of Ukraine's right to self-defense. But I have been  puzzled by some of the delays in sending crucial military aid.   I see signs that the Biden administration is afraid of what will  happen if Ukraine is helped to push Russia back into its own borders.  It is understandable to be concerned about the risks when dealing with  a nuclear armed aggressor. But Putin has backed away from his nuclear  saber-rattling in the face of Western resolve. And there are even  greater risks in not stopping Russia's aggression now. In fact, in my  view, we got where we are now because we acted too timidly in the past.  Repeating that mistake now will only invite more aggression in the  future.   In early February of 2021, shortly after President Biden took office,  I gave a speech wondering whether President Biden's tough-on-Russia  rhetoric would be matched by his administration's actions. I reminded  the Senate that 12 years earlier, in the early days of the Obama-Biden  administration, then-Vice President Biden went to Munich to deliver a  speech calling for the United States to hit the ``reset button'' with  Russia. Two years prior to Biden's speech, at the same annual  conference, Vladimir Putin had sharply criticized the United States and  suggested we were a threat to world peace. Moreover, just 6 months  prior to calling for a ``reset,'' Russia had invaded and occupied a  significant portion of the Republic of Georgia, which it still occupies  to this day.   Calling on the United States to ``hit the reset button,'' as  Secretary of State Clinton later symbolically did with Russian Foreign  Minister Lavrov, strongly suggested that the breakdown in relations  with Russia was somehow our fault. President Reagan's Ambassador to the  U.N., Jeane Kirkpatrick, famously identified a tendency among some of  her fellow Democrats to ``blame America first.'' I put the shameful  Obama-Biden Russia reset policy squarely in that tradition. Relations  with Russia became bad because Putin saw the United States as an  obstacle to his imperial aspirations. That is not our fault. I am  concerned that some corners of the Biden administration have not fully  dispensed with the naivety behind the so-called Russia reset.   Let's recall just how mistaken the Obama-Biden Russia policy was.  Many people remember the arrest of Anna Chapman and nine other deep  cover Russian spies living as normal Americans. The FBI had been  monitoring this spy network until agents saw signs that Chapman  suspected the jig was up. The FBI needed to arrest the whole network  before she had a chance to warn them and they all fled the country.   However, it just so happened that Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian  President--at least in name--was in town. Medvedev was meeting with  President Obama about all the areas of cooperation between the U.S. and  Russia made possible by the reset, plus a photo op eating hamburgers  together. To not upset this chummy meeting, the arrests of the Russian  spies were postponed until Medvedev was on a plane back to Moscow.   Remember, in order to get around term limits, Vladimir Putin drafted  his loyalist, Medvedev, to be the puppet President until Putin could  run for President again. This was a transparent shell game. But there  was naive hopeful talk that Medvedev was a reformer who might steer  Russia in a more democratic, pro-Western direction. Anyone following  Medvedev's recent rhetoric about Ukraine knows that is far from true.  He remains totally loyal to Putin and has been serving as his  rhetorical attack dog.   When Russia invaded and occupied parts of Ukraine in 2014, the Obama  administration had angry words for Putin. The reset was on the rocks.  But the practical response of the Obama administration was to deny  Ukraine defensive weapons, sending only non-lethal aid. President Obama  urged Ukraine not to fight to avoid escalation and to settle the matter  diplomatically.   Russia has a history of using negotiations to create frozen  conflicts. Russia will snatch a piece of land, then demand a ceasefire  and negotiations, allowing it to keep the ill-gotten gains  indefinitely.   Obviously, maintaining the status quo with Russia occupying parts of  Ukraine did not result in a lasting peace. It just led Putin to think  he could get away with it again. Perhaps he would have if he hadn't  gone big.   Having succeeded in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, Putin  figured he might as well go big and grab the whole country. It hasn't  worked out for him as he hoped, but he hasn't given up on his initial  goals either, even now. Those who had put hope in resetting relations  with Russia have been mugged by reality.   But behind the current tough talk, I worry that some in the Biden  administration, maybe President Biden himself, still cling to a hope  that we can reach an understanding with Putin. Like Jeane Kirkpatrick,  who remained a Democrat throughout her service in the Reagan  administration, there are many Democrats today who have a clear-eyed  view of Russia, including many colleagues in this body. I just wish  President Biden would listen to them rather than those in his  administration who let concerns about antagonizing Putin keep us from  doing everything we can to save Ukrainian lives.   The administration has eventually relented and given Ukraine many  [[Page S421]]  weapons systems it had repeatedly said ``no'' to. But there are still  weapons we could transfer to Ukraine today that would bring the end of  the war closer and save lives; yet the administration is refusing  because of fear of ``escalation.''   We have seen that our HIMARS system has allowed the Ukrainian  military to destroy ammunition depots and supply lines, making it  possible for the Ukrainians to liberate significant territory. We have  seen the videos of Ukrainian soldiers greeted with tears of joy by  liberated civilians who have endured brutal Russian occupation.   However, we did not transfer the HIMARS until June, months into the  war. And we denied the Ukrainians longer range missiles for the HIMARS.  There are reports that we even modified the systems before delivery to  make sure they could not shoot longer range missiles. This is  apparently based on a misguided concern about threatening Russian  territory.   Recently, the Biden administration has announced it will send Ukraine  the ground-launched small-diameter bomb, which is double the range of  the current HIMARS rockets, but which still fall far short of the range  of the Army Tactical Missile System that Ukraine has been asking for.   Despite its success in retaking some of its own territory, Russia  cannot seriously claim to be concerned about a Ukrainian invasion.  Ukraine is the one that is being brutally invaded and occupied by  Russia. And Ukraine has every right under international law to target  Russian bases from which Russia is launching missiles at electrical  plants and apartment buildings. Moreover, as the Lithuanian Prime  Minister pointed out on her most recent visit to the United States,  Ukraine needs these longer range missiles to attack Russian positions  inside Ukraine itself.   The most clear-eyed leadership about the war is coming from those who  know Russia the best, like the leaders of our Baltic allies. When  Americans see Iranian-made drones and Russian cruise missiles crashing  into apartment buildings, killing old women and young children, our  hearts break. But knowing that many of these attacks are being launched  from Russian-occupied Crimea, within range of the missiles we have been  denying to Ukraine, makes the death and destruction even more  heartbreaking.   The more advanced weapons Ukraine can obtain quickly, the faster the  war will end. The U.S. and many of our allies have now announced  delivery of tanks to Ukraine, something previously off the table. But  it isn't clear if this decision was taken in time for the tanks to  arrive in sufficient quantity to play a role in a spring  counteroffensive or to help Ukraine defend against Russia's renewed  offensive efforts, which are underway now. We should not be afraid of  Ukraine winning.   President Macron of France has expressed concern about humiliating  Putin. It is true that a defeated Putin would be dangerous, but a  victorious Putin would surely be even more dangerous. Precisely because  Russia has long been dangerous, we have built up military stockpiles in  case we need to defend our allies in Europe from a possible attack by  Russia.   Some of those stockpiles are now being used very effectively to  degrade the Russian military and the threat it poses. This is being  done by the Ukrainian military without a single American soldier in  battle.   Some people have expressed concerns that we could give too much  military aid, reducing what we need in case we have to fight a war.  Obviously, we need to ensure our own potential defense needs are taken  care of. I have been following closely what we have left and what we  have given. Our military stockpiles are not public, but I can say that  do not see any cause for alarm. Keep in mind that the level of stocks  our military has determined we need is based on possibly having to  fight the Russian military, but the Russian military as it existed  before the full scale invasion on February 24. Since the Ukrainians  have significantly diminished the Russian military, the threat to the  United States is greatly reduced. So our requirements for ammunition  and equipment are also now also lower.   The Russian war against Ukraine has also shaken us from our peacetime  complacency about the state of our defense industrial base. Efforts are  now underway to rejuvenate our ability to replenish our stockpiles of  arms and ammunition. This will help not only with our efforts to aid  Ukraine, but will greatly improve U.S. readiness to deal with potential  threats in the near future, such as from China. There are also  understandable concerns about the cost to the American taxpayers of  replacing the equipment given to Ukraine.   Aside from the fact that some of this would be replaced with upgraded  versions soon anyway, the cost benefit of a Ukrainian soldier  destroying a Russian tank with one of our Javelins is enormous. The  Russian military is being destroyed for pennies on the dollar and zero  cost in American blood. Then just think of what the cost in American  blood and treasure would be if Russia did attack one of our NATO  allies.   And make no mistake, Russia's imperial ambitions do not stop with  part, or even all of Ukraine. Estonia's Prime Minister often points out  ``If Putin wins, or if he even has the view that he has won this war,  his appetite will only grow.'' That is exactly what happened after  Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.   Putin's background is in the overlapping world of the KGB and Russian  organized crime. In that world, only strength is respected, and  weakness invites aggression. Let's not repeat past mistakes. Preventing  future Russian aggression will greatly enhance American security and  avoid major costs down the road. That makes it in America's national  interest to support a decisive Ukrainian victory as soon as possible.                            ____________________
