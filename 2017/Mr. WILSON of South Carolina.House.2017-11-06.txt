Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers  are with all those who are grieving at the First Baptist Church in  Sutherland Springs, Texas.   This morning, I was grateful to join the Israeli-American Council at  their fourth National Council Conference to celebrate our ally, Israel,  and the special relationship we have formed over many years with the  people of Israel. It was meaningful to be greeted by National Chairman  Adam Milstein, and to discuss issues with Dr. Miriam and Sheldon  Adelson.   The Israeli-American Council is the fastest growing Jewish-American  organization in the United States, and works every day to foster a  strong and positive relationship between the United States and the  Israeli people.   I am grateful for their many accomplishments, and I wish them  continued success in strengthening the American-Israeli relationship in  the years to come through mutual economic success, creating jobs while  promoting peace through strength with military cooperation.   South Carolina has always appreciated its Jewish heritage as home of  the largest Jewish population of any State at the time of the American  Revolution.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
