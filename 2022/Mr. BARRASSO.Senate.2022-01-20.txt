 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the  Democrats' radical agenda.   For weeks now, America has been breaking records with cases of  coronavirus. The scavenger hunt for tests has resulted in long lines  and empty shelves. We have just had the worst jobs report of the year-- last year--with inflation at a 40-year high. Crime is out of control in  big cities run by Democrats. The southern border is being overrun by  hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants every single month. Our  foreign policy is in shambles; our friends are endangered; and Vladimir  Putin, China, North Korea, and Iran are emboldened.   The American people are deeply worried about all of these issues. Yet  Democrats in Washington are offering no solutions on these pressing  problems. Democrats created many of these crises in the first place,  often through incompetence, mismanagement, and weakness. Now, under  President Biden, they are making them worse.   Democrats just spent 5 months trying to pass the most expensive  spending bill in American history. It was a bill nobody asked for  except for the radical base of professional activists. The bill would  have led to the largest tax increase in 50 years, trillions of dollars  in new spending and new debt, and even higher inflation.   Democrats tried to pass this on the narrowest of margins. Democrats  failed. As soon as the bill was pronounced dead, Democrats scrambled to  change the subject. Democrats know they can't solve the inflation  crisis, the supply chain crisis, the coronavirus crisis, or any of the  other disasters created by the Biden administration. By ignoring these  problems, they are practically admitting that, as Democrats, they have  no solutions.   So what are they doing instead?   Well, they have tried to manufacture another crisis. They have  invented a phony moral panic about election laws. Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris have repeatedly lied about our elections. They got Major League  Baseball to move the All-Star Game to a Democrat State. They got  Hollywood stars and journalists and wealthy corporations to parrot  their talking points. Now they have former Presidents Obama and Clinton  getting involved. It has been a shameful effort to frighten the  American people and further divide our Nation.   When Joe Biden was a Presidential candidate, he said he would ``heal  the country.'' He said he would ``restore the soul of the nation.''  Just 1 year into his Presidency, we have found out that that was all  for show. Joe Biden has been one of the most divisive and partisan  Presidents in American history, and, today, he is on track to be the  least popular President in modern times.   I understand why Democrats are desperate to change the subject. Yet  Democrats are failing on the election issue as well. If Democrats think  they can win on the idea of a Federal election takeover, they are  wrong. Joe Biden is so unpopular in Georgia he couldn't even get Stacey  Abrams to show up to his rally in Atlanta. She is running for Governor.  She is a political celebrity. Election law is her main issue. Yet she  wouldn't be seen in public with Joe Biden, and, frankly, I don't blame  her.    Two days later, Joe Biden came to Capitol Hill to convince Democrats  to change the rules of the Senate. He failed again. Brave Democratic  Senators did the honorable and courageous thing. They kept their word.  They said they would not destroy this institution for short-term  partisan gain. They deserve the respect of every Member of this body.  Joe Biden tried to push them around, and he failed.   The latest Quinnipiac poll has Joe Biden with a 33-percent approval  rating just 1 year into his term in office. He has lower economic  approval ratings than Jimmy Carter. Yet Senator Schumer asked Democrat  Senators to follow Joe Biden over the cliff.   Yesterday, in his almost 2-hour press conference, President Biden  talked about taking his message on the road and campaigning with  Democrat candidates. I want to see which Democrat candidates actually  want to stand with him as more and more Members of the House announce  their retirements because they know, and they can see the writing on  the wall.   Senator Schumer wanted a vote in this body on the Washington election  takeover and on changing the rules of the Senate. The American people  have utterly rejected both of these ideas. The vast majority of the  American people support voter identification. If you want a ballot,  show your ID. They support making voters show a photo ID in order to  get a ballot. This includes a majority of Democrats, who think it is an  important thing to do for ballot integrity and accountability and  security.   If Democrats want to fix our election laws, they ought to do  something about what is happening in the majority leader's hometown.  Just last month, the New York City Council voted to let 900,000  noncitizens vote in New York City's elections--noncitizens. This is a  larger group than the margin of victory in this last New York mayoral  election. In other words, this new group of voters--not citizens of the  United States--could swing and determine the outcome of the next  election for the mayor of New York. This is the majority leader's  hometown.   Where is the ballot integrity, accountability, and security there for  American citizens?   Before Chuck Schumer lectures the American people about our  elections, he ought to fix the problems in his own hometown.   Democrats are OK with vaccine passports, and they are OK with  noncitizens voting, but they are not OK with voter ID, at least on the  legislation that they brought to the floor. Democrats continue to fail  to listen to and to fail the American people. Democrats are failing on  inflation, on coronavirus, on immigration, on crime, and on national  security. By voting on elections and on Senate rules, Democrats are  admitting they have absolutely nothing to offer the American people on  the key issues and concerns that are impacting the lives of people all  across this country.   There is plenty of work to do right now. We have to stop unnecessary  government spending to get inflation under control. We need to support  law enforcement. We need affordable energy. That is what people want.  We need to make sure that our schools stay open. We need to make sure  that they teach our children skills, not ideology. We need to secure  our border. So, yes, there is plenty of work for this Senate to do.  Republicans have been more than willing to work with Democrats on all  of these important issues.   The American people are looking for solutions. Yet the majority  leader is giving them pointless exercises and show votes. It is time  for the majority  [[Page S368]]  leader to abandon this political wish list. Let's get to work on the  issues facing the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I often hear from people in Wyoming who  are concerned about the changes being proposed in Washington, DC. When  the Federal Government changes the rules, authorities, or standards, it  can significantly impact critical Wyoming industries.   In the ``Wyoming Livestock Roundup,'' a weekly news source for  Wyoming's ranchers, farmers, and Agribusiness community, Sarah L. Falen  authored an opinion editorial titled ``The Government's Word: Should We  Trust It.''   She raises concerns about the Biden administration's rule revoking  the Trump administration policy prohibiting prosecution for  accidentally harming migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty  Act. While there has been a lot of discussion about the impact on the  energy industries, Sarah Falen points out how the new rule could affect  the agriculture industry. It is important that Congress note these  consequences and the uncertainty created by the Biden administration's  rule.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the opinion editorial written by Sarah L. Falen.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 The Government's Word: Should We Trust It?                            (By Sarah L. Fallen)         Americans trust the U.S. government less and less. In fact,       according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in the       federal government hovers around 40%. Yet, with the       revocation of the Trump Administration's rule that prohibits       prosecution for accidentally harming migratory birds under       the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Biden       Administration is asking citizens to do just that, ``trust''       the federal government.        People involved in industries such as energy or agriculture       have a clear understanding of how environmental legislation,       originally passed with the best intention, has been       weaponized to negatively affect their livelihoods. One of the       lesser known, but just as dangerous environmental swords is       the MBTA. While it is easy to see that energy industries,       such as oil and gas, wind or even solar would be impacted by       the Biden decision, this Act has the potential for very       serious impacts on the agriculture industry.        The MBTA is a statute that allows for the criminal       prosecution of any person who ``incidentally takes'' a       migratory bird. To understand the breath of this Act, there       are two important concepts. First, nearly all birds in the       U.S. are considered migratory. Second, what constitutes an       ``incidental take.'' The MBTA states that ``it [is] unlawful       at any time, . . . to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, . .       . any migratory bird . . .'' 16 U.S.C. 703(a). If you read       that language, it would make sense that this Act is referring       to someone who intends to kill a migratory bird. That       commonsense reading is what the Trump MBTA rule enforced . .       . only those engaged in an action that purposefully ``takes''       a migratory bird would be subject to fines and prison time.       This is not how the Biden Administration reads that language.        According to the Biden Administration, even if a person is       doing something that accidentally harms a migratory bird,       that person can still be criminally liable. Thus, someone can       be prosecuted for an action or inaction that is otherwise       legal, but just so happens to ``take'' a migratory bird.        We should all be concerned about the Biden Administration       allowing ``incidental take'' to be prosecuted because there       is no limit on what can be prosecuted. This means that if a       farmer uses a pesticide that is legally administered and a       migratory bird just so happens to ingest that pesticide, he       could be subject to criminal prosecution. The MBTA allows for       up to a $5,000 fine or six months in prison for an incidental       take.        The scenarios under which a person can accidentally kill a       migratory bird are infinite and can be ridiculous. Yet, the       government expects us to believe that they will only       prosecute ``foreseeable'' accidental killings of migratory       birds. It is foreseeable that a bird can ingest a legally       administered pesticide. Are farmers now risking prison time       for growing the food that feeds America and the world?        The Biden Administration has entertained the idea of an       ``incidental take permit'' that might remove some of the       liability for birds that are accidentally killed, however       they have not developed the idea enough to know what the       permit would look like. There aren't any standards for what       actions would be exempt from liability under the permit       system and the MBTA office doesn't have enough staff to begin       handling the undoubtedly thousands of permit applications       they will receive.        The government has often implemented rules, promising it       will not take advantage of its authority, but time after time       this has proven to be just a way to get a rule approved or       legislation passed. From wolves and grizzly bears to ever       changing definitions of ``navigable waters,'' the government       has proven that its word should not be trusted and the MBTA       is no exception.                            ____________________
