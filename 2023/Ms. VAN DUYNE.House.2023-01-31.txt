 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  497, the Freedom for Health Care Workers Act.   The people of north Texas have expressed their opposition to  President Biden's authoritarian COVID-19 vaccine mandate for a variety  of reasons.   Today, I would like to highlight the concerns that I have heard from  firefighters and EMTs back home. The Biden administration's COVID-19  vaccine mandate is not only an overreach of government power, it has  also become a public safety threat.   Since the vaccine mandate took effect, fire and EMT departments in  north Texas have struggled to fully staff their departments.   This administration claims the vaccine requirement is in place to  ensure patients have access to safe and essential care, but what about  the people who experience a medical emergency, dial 911, and must wait  longer for care due to staffing shortages?   Our local firefighters, paramedics, and EMTs provide lifesaving care.  A fast response time can quite literally make the difference between  life and death. It is already difficult to recruit and retain people to  work in these stressful roles. The Federal Government shouldn't make it  any harder.   The healthcare system is being overburdened by this unnecessary  mandate, which has only worsened the EMS staffing shortage.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to cosponsor this bill. I urge my colleagues  to join me in voting for H.R. 497 today.
