 Madam Speaker, Build Back Better. Three simple  words, yet these words mean so much to my constituents and many  Americans across the country.   Building back better means that 96 percent of children in my district  benefit from a permanent and expanded child tax credit. Yes, you heard  right: 96 percent of the children in my district.  [[Page H5880]]    Recently, Secretary Yellen told us that the child tax credit has  already reduced poverty in our country by 25 percent, just with the  first three checks. Imagine what continuation of this important program  will do.   This is huge for American families who are struggling to put food on  the table, with Latino and Black families suffering the most. The child  tax credit would help the parents of almost 8.8 million children  nationwide who are going hungry during this pandemic.   Madam Speaker, now is the moment. It is time to do better for our  children.   The Build Back Better agenda will bring universal pre-K to our kids  and end childcare deserts, an issue that affects children and families  in my district and across America. Without pre-K or childcare, parents  are forced to choose between their family or their job.   In fact, just a few months ago, I visited a childcare facility that  struggled to keep up with the demand due to the lack of childcare  infrastructure in Houston. We need to invest in this critical  infrastructure for children, for working parents, and for care workers.   Madam Speaker, care workers are essential. They care for our loved  ones every day and keep this country running. We need to build back  better with investments for our care workers so that their families can  have better futures. We need to build back better for the almost one in  two adults over 65 in Texas with multiple chronic medical conditions.   Altogether, the Build Back Better agenda will make sure that millions  of people in this country and in my home State of Texas gain affordable  healthcare coverage. I represent a district that struggles to get vital  coverage because the Republican-controlled State government has refused  to accept the Federal dollars to expand Medicaid. This is how we build  back better for the people who need critical care.   Families deserve that. They also deserve to unlock the American Dream  through affordable housing so they can live with dignity. We need  investments in first-generation home buyers and affordable housing,  housing vouchers, and more infrastructure so that families can say ``mi  casa es su casa.''    The Build Back Better agenda will do just that, but we must work  hard. We must work hard to also provide a pathway to citizenship for  the hundreds and thousands of Dreamers, TPS holders, and essential  workers. They have been contributing to our economy, keeping this  country running, and making it prosper.   The Build Back Better agenda will deliver on the American Dream  promise and the values on which this Nation of immigrants was founded.  It would fulfill the ``give me your tired, your poor, your huddled  masses yearning to breathe free.''   The Build Back Better agenda is an American agenda fulfilling this  promise. The Build Back Better agenda is by and for the American people  that will allow our country, our families, and our women to heal from  this horrible pandemic and build back better with wealthy people and  corporations paying their fair share.   This is why we are here in Congress, fighting for the people,  fighting for our children, and building a better future so our mothers  can rejoin the workforce, so our seniors can get care that will allow  them to live with dignity, so our children can get the care they need  without having to worry about poverty or going to school hungry, so our  families can say ``mi casa es su casa'' and live with dignity in their  own homes.   This is how we build back better for all. Our country doesn't leave  anyone behind, so this is how we honor the 329.5 million Americans:  building back better for everyone. This is how we honor every single  one of them.   Madam Speaker, our time is now. We must get this done. So let's go  and build back better now.                            ____________________
