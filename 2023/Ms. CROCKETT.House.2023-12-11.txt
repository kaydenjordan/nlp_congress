 Mr. Speaker, every Member here likely knows at least  one family in their district whose life has been impacted by someone  struggling with addiction.    This comes at a time where companies are also now trying to use the  courts to avoid liability and escape having to compensate families for  their role in targeting communities and peddling pills all in the name  of increasing profits.   Addiction is painful and it is dangerous. It is a dangerous struggle  that too many Americans suffer from. Today, this illness is exacerbated  by the prevalence of fentanyl. Fentanyl is 50 percent stronger than  heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Because people can't see,  taste, or smell it, those struggling with addiction don't even know  when they are putting their life at risk.   To be clear, fentanyl is one of the leading causes of overdose- related deaths today. Now, more than ever, we need to attack this  problem from a holistic approach. This is coming from, again, the  gentlewoman from the State of Texas. We know that there is not just a  one-trick pony on this. We have got to make sure that we address this  side of it, as well as our struggles at the border.   Not only do we need more technology at our points of entry to  interdict fentanyl, but we will also need to give our constituents the  necessary tools to know whether or not they are about to subject  themselves to fentanyl. One way to do this is to arm them with fentanyl  testing strips.   I am grateful to Representative Gooden, my Republican co-lead, for  supporting my bill, the Test Strip Access Act, to Senators Hassan and  Cornyn for introducing it in the Senate, and to the Energy and Commerce  Committee for incorporating it into the SUPPORT reauthorization.   My bill will allow fentanyl and xylazine testing strips to be  purchased  [[Page H6797]]  under the overdose prevention programs grants. Access to these testing  strips can literally mean the difference between life and death.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the SUPPORT Act  so we can give our constituents the tools to be safe and ultimately get  them the help they desperately need to treat their illness.                                time  1700
