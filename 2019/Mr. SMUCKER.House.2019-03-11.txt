 Mr. Speaker, Friday was International Women's Day and,  today, I rise to recognize the service of a remarkable woman in my  district: Ms. Patricia Sincavage of Lititz, Pennsylvania.   Ms. Sincavage has served as an occupational therapist at the Lebanon  Veterans Affairs Medical Center since 1978. She joined the VA after  graduating from Elizabethtown College. The Lebanon VA serves about 80  percent of the veterans who reside in my district.   She has spent the entirety of her professional career giving back to  our veterans. Occupational therapy can assist veterans in continuing to  take care of their health needs while still doing the activities they  enjoy simply by adapting or doing things differently.   Ms. Sincavage is retiring from the VA after 43 years of service. She  has four children, 11 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. She has  served our Nation's veterans well, and it is an honor to recognize her  today.                            ____________________
