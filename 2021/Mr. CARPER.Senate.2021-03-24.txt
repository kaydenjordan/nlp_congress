The Food Bank of Delaware began its work in 1981 out of a modest  basement in the Northeast State Services Center in Wilmington. Today,  it is the largest hunger relief organization in the State. In the last  fiscal year alone, the Food Bank of Delaware distributed more than 15  million pounds of food, served more than 49,000 households through its  mobile pantry program, distributed 143,000 backpacks stocked with food  to at-risk youth, provided nearly 28,000 supplemental food boxes to  seniors, and inspired volunteers to give 49,000 hours of their time to  help at its 2 warehouses and food distribution events.  [[Page S1765]]  But the Food Bank's work didn't stop there--it continues to address  root causes of hunger by providing education and resources to those  experiencing food insecurity so they can lift themselves out of poverty  and advocate for others. Its culinary program has successfully  graduated more than 700 students since the program began in 2002, and  its graduates can be found in some of the finest restaurants around the  country.   I particularly want to highlight the work the Food Bank of Delaware  and its 54 full- and part-time employees have done and continue to do  since March 16, 2020, when they were called to respond to the  overwhelming need brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time  they facilitated 33 mass drive through food distribution events  throughout Delaware serving 42,847 households, served 34,706 households  through the Healthy Pantry Centers at its Newark and Milford locations,  distributed 153,431 Farmers to Families Food Boxes, and provided  353,009 meals and snacks to homeless Delawareans housed throughout the  State to slow the spread of the coronavirus.   On behalf of both, U.S. Senator Chris Coons and U.S. Representative  Lisa Blunt Rochester, I rise today to honor the Food Bank of Delaware,  its employees, and volunteers for 40 years of continued dedication to  the health and nourishment of the citizens of Delaware. We know your  impact on the lives of so many has been great, and your goal of ending  hunger is one we will continue to work together on until we can reach  the goal of eradicating food insecurity for all in Delaware.                            ____________________
