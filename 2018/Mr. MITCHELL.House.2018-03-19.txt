 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from West  Point, Georgia, and I want to also thank the Georgia and Alabama  delegations' Members who, as part of the Tax Truth Squad, have come  here tonight to share examples of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act on their districts.   The last major tax reform was conducted 31 years ago. I believe many  people, many businesspeople and workers, had simply given up on the  idea that we would actually achieve what we achieved at the end of last  year. In less than three months since the tax reform bill passed, as my  colleague said, more than 440 companies have given a pay raise,  bonuses, increased 401(k) contributions, or, in the case of utility  companies, lowered their rates dramatically. In Michigan, rates will be  lowered this year by $400 million.   This number of 440 doesn't even include small mom-and-pop businesses  on Main Street. At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax  reform bonuses, announced already this year, in 3 months. The direct  bonus announcements have already passed $4 billion. Small-business  owners are showing unparalleled confidence in the economy as the  optimism index reached record high numbers in February according to the  NFIB Small Business Economic Trend Survey. Let me say that again:  record high numbers, all as a result of what we achieved at the end of  the year.   This optimism in economic strength is reflected in data recently  released. Last month, the United States economy created 313,000 new  jobs.                                time  1945    More importantly, 800 million people reentered the labor force who  weren't trying to go to work. The unemployment rate remained the same  at 4.1 percent, what most people call full employment. Equally  important, wage growth over last year increased 2.6 percent; 2.6  percent already in terms of wage growth.   These are good things for Americans, for wage earners; and, as my  colleague said, even more importantly, a good thing because they keep  money in the pockets of workers and families to make decisions on what  to do with their hard-earned money rather than depend on those of us  here, frankly, in Congress or, worse, bureaucrats, to spend it for  them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members of Georgia and Alabama as part  of the Tax Truth Squad to put their stories forward tonight.
