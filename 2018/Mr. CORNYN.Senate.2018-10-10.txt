 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as you know this week we are voting and  considering an important bipartisan piece of legislation known as  America's Water Infrastructure Act, the most sweeping infrastructure  package to be considered by Congress this year. It will literally  reauthorize billions of dollars of spending for our Nation's ports,  harbors, and waterways, and it will end wasteful spending on water  projects that are no longer necessary.   I thank Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper for spearheading  this legislation through the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  They deserve a tremendous amount of credit for bringing us to where we  are today.   Drinking water, wastewater systems, dams, levees, ports, and  reservoirs matter to every single community in America. They are  usually not front and center on our priority list, though, so people  naturally take them for granted. We take it as a given that water will  be available, that it will be treated and filtered, that wastewater  will somehow be transported wherever it needs to go, and that dams and  levees will hold up when they are put to the test by rising floods.   Actually, though, that is not the case in many parts of the world,  and we in America do take that for granted because usually none of  these present a problem to most Americans. None of these problems  happen in the United States if public and Federal resources are  allocated in the right ways, and that is why we can't afford to let our  guard down and be lax when it comes to maintaining these important  national treasures.   That is what makes this bill we are voting on so crucial. It is not  just a drop in the bucket, so to speak. It is one of the main reasons  the bucket--  [[Page S6737]]  our Nation's entire public water capacity--functions at all.   As Chairman Barrasso has said, many pieces of our water  infrastructure systems are aging and in need of serious attention. They  need to be repaired, replaced, and other long-awaited projects need to  begin.   I know that because some of those projects happen to be in my State  of Texas. Following last year's devastating Hurricane Harvey, a  catastrophic rain event, the likes of which the Houston region had  never seen before, the gaps in our infrastructure became acutely  apparent. As we began the recovery process, one thing became clear to  us: There isn't much sense in rebuilding without ensuring the region  can withstand major weather events in the future. So it is not just  about fixing what was damaged; it is about making sure future  infrastructure will not be damaged because it has been brought up to  standard.   So one piece of the bill we will be voting on this week will be to  allow the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite a study on the so-called  coastal spine that will run up and down portions of the gulf coast.  This is a new multilayered system of storm surge and flood mitigation  improvements to address our most acute vulnerabilities. The crucial  first step is fully funding the proper engineering study, and that is  what we are going to do in this bill.   I want to emphasize, this is not just some parochial matter. It is  not just something that matters to the city of Houston and the gulf  coast region. This is an important national resource. It is important  to our national security, and it is vital to our national economy.   A second thing this bill does for Texas is authorize a project from  an area known as the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay. Across more than  4,000 square miles of South Texas, this bill will update the levee  systems and, in some cases, construct new ones in order to better  protect the area from storms and hurricanes.   In places that were dramatically affected by Hurricane Harvey, like  Clear Creek and Brays Bayou, funds will be used to widen channels,  construct detention basins, replace bridges, and renovate dams.  Importantly, these projects include cost-share requirements, a  reflection of the partnership between the State and local officials and  the Federal Government when it comes to flood mitigation.   As Texas communities continue to rebuild from Hurricane Harvey and  prepare for future storms, it is critical that we take these steps to  ensure the coastal region can better withstand major weather events. I  am grateful that once we vote on this bill, we will be one step closer  toward completing these important projects, as well as many others.   Finally, it is important to note that in many ways, the provisions of  this bill represent a continuation of efforts we began last fall. As my  colleagues will recall, in the weeks and months following Hurricane  Harvey, Congress passed three separate aid bills totaling $147 billion  for Harvey and other natural disasters.   Then, in February, my colleagues and I secured nearly $4 billion in  the Omnibus appropriations bill to advantage the Sabine Pass to  Galveston project I just mentioned.   So as we move toward passage of this important piece of legislation,  it is important to remember, this is sort of the bricks-and-mortar work  Congress needs to do. It doesn't gather a lot of attention. There is  not a lot of controversy. Unlike a Supreme Court appointment, we don't  see thousands of people gathering in the Mall or in the halls or in  front of the Capitol, but it is simply the fundamental, basic building  blocks we need to construct in order to keep our country safe and  prosperous.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
