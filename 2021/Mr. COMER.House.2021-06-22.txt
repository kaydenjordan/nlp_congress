 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Terry Hamby of Trigg  County, Kentucky, for receiving the Distinguished Public Service Award  for his outstanding leadership as chairman of the World War I  Centennial Commission. Under Terry's leadership the commission  completed the construction of the United States National World War I  Memorial here in Washington, D.C.   There is no one who better understands the sacrifices of our  servicemembers than Terry. He served for 26 years in our Nation's  military, first in the Naval Air Wing during the Vietnam war before  joining the U.S. Army Reserve.   After his retirement, Terry continued to honor and serve our Nation's  military, and was appointed to the World War I Centennial Commission,  and elected chairman in 2017. In just four years under his leadership,  the United States National World War I Memorial was completed and  opened to the public.   I am privileged to represent Terry in Congress, and I appreciate all  he does to recognize our Nation's military. I join Terry's family,  friends, and all of those impacted by his life of service in  congratulating him on this enormous contribution to our Nation.                        Congratulating Vernon Anderson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Vernon  Anderson of Calloway County on his induction into the Kentucky  Trapshooters League Hall of Fame.   Vernon has qualified 10 times for the Kentucky State trapshooters  team and has been a member of the Kentucky Trapshooters League's board  of directors for the past 12 years. He humbly describes himself as a  consistently good trap shooter, but anyone who can hit 99 out of 100  moving targets at various distances is nothing less than a great shot.   Vernon has always paved the way for younger generations to  participate in trap shooting. In 2015, his activism led trap shooting  to become an official high school sport in Kentucky. He then became  Calloway County High School's coach, where he has passed on his  knowledge and passion for the sport to students.   Once again, I would like to congratulate my friend Vernon on this  great honor and thank him for his continued service to the students of  Calloway County, Kentucky.                     economic issues and rising inflation     Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the current state of our  economy.   With ill-advised lockdowns finally ending, our economy should be  firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately, we are, in many ways, stuck in  the mud.   America has seen a string of disappointing jobs reports that fall  short of expectations, and excessive government spending is driving up  what is effectively a tax increase on every American--inflation.   Over 8 million jobs are available, even as the government pays people  not to work. This is creating a dramatic workforce shortage and forcing  our job creators to compete with the heavy hand of government. In fact,  our labor participation rate sits at just 61 percent, the lowest total  this century when you exclude the opening months of the pandemic.   And the massive spending rammed through by President Biden and  Speaker Pelosi is only hurting us. Inflation is surging, affecting the  price of everyday items Americans buy, like milk and gasoline.   This $2 trillion in new spending came despite an economy that was  reopening and on the mend, and it made Americans less likely to work  and the government more likely to waste hard-earned tax dollars.   But for our Democrat friends, this wasteful spending knows no bounds.  President Biden has proposed an outrageous $6 trillion Federal budget  that is a slap in the face to every American taxpayer.   Instead of focusing on a responsible infrastructure bill that repairs  our roads and bridges and puts people to work, we see a focus by this  body on ramming through the Green New Deal and more wasteful spending.   As leaders, we must change course to create a stronger recovery. As  our economy reopens, we must respect taxpayers, support small  businesses, and empower Americans to prosper through the dignity of  work.    Honoring the Life and Service of Private First Class Ernest Robertson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Private First Class  Ernest Robertson of Russell County, Kentucky, who served and paid the  ultimate sacrifice in the Korean war. Ernest was killed in action at 24  years old, but his remains have never been recovered.   After basic training at Fort Knox, Ernest was assigned to the U.S.  Army's Far East Command, M Company, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th  Infantry Division. On April 23, 1951, he suffered a terrible injury and  was captured by North Korean forces. On May 6, one day after his 24th  birthday, Ernest was killed in action.    The service and sacrifice of our troops must never be forgotten, even  long after they have perished. It is truly a tragedy that some brave  soldiers have not yet made it home after their horrible death. We must  appreciate their sacrifice and remember the cost of freedoms we enjoy  here in the United States.   I join with all the First District of Kentucky in thanking Private  First Class Robertson for his service, and his family for their efforts  to remember him. He will always be in our thoughts.                            ____________________
