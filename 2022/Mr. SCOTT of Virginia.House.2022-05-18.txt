 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 7791) to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to  establish waiver authority to address certain emergencies, disasters,  and supply chain disruptions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7791         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Baby Formula Act       of 2022''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7791, the Access to  Baby Formula Act of 2022.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, across the country, the ongoing shortage of formula is  disproportionately hurting women and children who rely on the benefits  through the WIC program, leaving them with few options to purchase safe  formula for their infants. That is because about half of the infants in  America participate in the WIC program.   In times of crisis, one of our core responsibilities as lawmakers is  to ensure that families in need can continue to feed their children and  keep them healthy.   While I am encouraged that the Biden administration and Abbott  Nutrition have reached an agreement to restart formula production  following the company's recall, the immediate consequences facing our  children require additional action.   That is why the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes) and the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel) and I took action to help  vulnerable Americans provide their babies with the nutrition they need.  One of the flexibilities in the WIC program that the Access to Baby  Formula Act provides will allow families in need to use WIC benefits to  purchase other safe and available infant formula products.   WIC vouchers can be limited to one brand product. This makes sense  because a WIC program can require companies to bid for the privilege of  participating. Having the power to limit participation to just one  brand encourages vendors to agree to huge discounts.   Unfortunately, in a time of shortage, a voucher for a product not on  the shelf is of no value. This bill allows flexibility in such a time  so that parents will be able to purchase whatever brand is actually  available.   This legislation reflects our commitment to ensuring access to  formula for those who need it most, during both the current crisis and  into the future.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut and the  gentlewoman from California for their urgent leadership on the Access  to Baby Formula Act, and I urge my colleagues to join in taking a stand  for our Nation's children.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the United  States House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chairwoman of  the Oversight and Reform Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  letter from dozens of health, nutrition, education, and child advocacy  organizations urging passage of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                                       May 18, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer, and       Leader McConnell: Parents across the country are increasingly       anxious about the diminished availability of infant formula       in traditional retail channels after Abbott Nutrition       instituted a nationwide recall of its most popular products       in February 2022. The undersigned organizations urge swift       action in Congress to provide federal agencies with the       flexibilities and resources needed to shore up supply, assure       the safety of infant formula available on the market, and       provide families with options that ensure babies have access       to essential nutrition.        Although breastfeeding is the optimal source of infant       nutrition, sustained breastfeeding is not an option for many       mothers. Infant formula is an essential product constituting       the majority--or even exclusive--source of nutrition for many       infants and some older children and adults with metabolic       disorders. Since Abbott Nutrition announced the infant       formula recall in February 2022, the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) has led an interagency effort to address       supply challenges and encourage increased production among       the limited domestic manufacturers. The infant formula       manufacturing sector is highly concentrated, with only four       companies--Abbott Nutrition, Reckitt Benckiser (Mead       Johnson), Nestle (Gerber), and Perrigo--commanding nearly 90       percent of the domestic infant formula supply. As the nation       navigates through the Abbott recall, manufacturer assurances       of increased production have not yet translated to increased       stock on the shelves, leaving many families with limited       options and acutely impacting individuals who need specialty       formulas to accommodate for allergies, digestive issues, or       metabolic disorders.        More than half of all infant formula purchases in the       country go through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program       for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which typically       limits the 1.2 million infants receiving formula benefits to       a specific brand. Though WI C's State-based, sole-source       contracting process has been a successful cost containment       strategy, limited options posed a unique challenge during       this unprecedented failure of the manufacturing sector.       Starting in February 2022, a patchwork of waivers from the       U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and contract       flexibilities exercised by State WIC Agencies allowed for WIC       families have more options--including additional container       sizes and brands--to ensure that low-income families could       obtain infant formula amid limited supply on the shelves.        As with the commercial market, WIC's program structure did       not anticipate the possibility of the widespread shortages       that are felt today by all parents of formula-fed infants.       The bipartisan Access to Baby Formula Act advances common-      sense, but essential, flexibilities that will provide       regulatory relief and maximum flexibility to State and local       providers as they support low-income families during product       recalls and public health emergencies. This legislation also       works to build contingencies into State contracts with infant       formula manufacturers and promotes collaboration between USDA       and FDA to assure a coordinated, public-private response to       infant formula recalls and supply disruptions. These steps       empower WIC with the flexibility to ensure that the most       vulnerable infants have access to adequate nutrition when       supply is strained or limited.        Additionally, the Infant Formula Supplemental       Appropriations Act of 2022 would provide $28 million in       funding for FDA to address product shortages and strengthens       the agency's capacity to assure safety of infant formula,       especially as new products enter the domestic market. FDA's       limited bandwidth to monitor for safe manufacturing practices       at infant formula production sites is concerning, and this       additional funding will be essential to building a safe and       more resilient supply chain that delivers quality product to       support infants' nutrition needs.        Together, these two bills provide a substantial next step       in the federal response to the Abbott recall and will better       position agencies and low-income families to weather the       crisis. But more must be done to identify and remedy the       structural factors that allowed for the domestic infant       formula supply to be so substantially impacted by the closure       of only one manufacturing facility. We look forward to       ongoing efforts in Congress and federal agencies to assess       the competitiveness of the infant formula manufacturing       sector and assure that any given manufacturer's operations       are sufficiently diversified to deliver essential product to       parents in need.        We thank you for your attention to this issue, which       remains top-of-mind for so many parents across the country,       and we urge swift action to deliver change and build a better       future for the next generation of Americans.

I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning of debate, one of our core  responsibilities as lawmakers during times of crisis is to ensure that  families, particularly those most in need, can continue to feed their  children. This is precisely the goal that the Access to Baby Formula  Act seeks to achieve.   By providing additional flexibilities in the WIC program, we have a  critical  [[Page H5157]]  opportunity to assure that families can continue using their WIC  benefits to get safe and available formula products that their children  need.   Simply put, the Access to Baby Formula Act is legislation we need to  ensure access to formula for children and families who need it most,  both during this current shortage and into the future.   I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes) and the  gentlewoman from California, (Mrs. Steel) for their urgent leadership  on behalf of our Nation's children and families.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7791, the Access to Baby Formula  Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
