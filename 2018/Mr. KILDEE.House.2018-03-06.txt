 Mr. Speaker, this week is Great Lakes Week.   As a Michigander, I am proud of the fact that Republicans and  Democrats in Congress continue to work together to highlight the  importance of our shared water resources and to protect the Great  Lakes.   The Great Lakes generate billions of dollars in economic activity and  provide drinking water to 40 million people. We have to do everything  we can to protect them from harm.   Unfortunately, President Trump recently unveiled his proposed budget,  which cuts funding to the Great Lakes by 90 percent. An important  restoration initiative that has succeeded and has had bipartisan  support, the President nearly eliminates.   Protecting our Great Lakes has never been a partisan issue. Democrats  and Republicans have come together before to restore funding cuts that  were proposed by President Trump. I am confident that we will come  together again.   This Great Lakes Week, as every week, I stand up for the Great Lakes  and those who depend upon them. They are a critical water resource that  must be protected.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his persistence in offering  this legislation. As he said, in committee, we had a successful markup  where we were able to unanimously support this legislation. It is  important legislation.   We don't agree on everything. One doesn't have to go very far. Back  in committee, right now, where we have a rather contentious markup on a  budget using estimates, as I said in that meeting: When we do agree, we  should come together. Representative Barr and I have talked about this  issue for quite some time, and I am really pleased to see it move  forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2226, the  Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, which would allow certain  mortgages that are originated and retained in portfolio by a bank with  less than $10 billion in total assets to be considered as qualified  mortgages.   In the lead-up to the financial crisis, there were a number of  mortgage lenders that did not do their due diligence in underwriting  mortgages. We saw a number of exotic products being offered to  individuals and families premised on a continually rising housing  market.   These included ``no doc'' loans where the lender did not document or  verify a borrower's income. There were real consequences for those  sorts of loans. Many of these borrowers never really had any hope of  paying back those loans. As those mortgages went into default, the  foreclosures helped lead to a financial crisis that devastated the U.S.  economy, and millions of families were stripped from their single  source of wealth: the equity in their home.   In the wake of that crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act and  required lenders to assess a consumer's ability to repay their mortgage  loans.   We also provided statutory penalties for mortgage lenders that did  not follow these new underwriting standards.   Congress also directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to  enact regulations to create a safe harbor for creditors, where it would  be presumed that the creditor evaluated the borrower's ability to  repay.   In 2013, under the direction of former Director Cordray, the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau released its ability-to-repay and qualified  mortgage rule. This rule defined how lenders could take advantage of  that safe harbor.   Qualified mortgages, commonly referred to as QM loans, are a special  category of loans that have strong underwriting standards and certain  nonpredatory loan features that help make them more likely that  borrowers will be able to afford their mortgages.   So if a lender originates a QM loan, it means that the lender met  certain requirements, and it is assumed that the lender followed the  ability-to-repay rule as drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. This also allows the lender to be shielded from certain types  of liability associated with originating bad loans.   I and my colleagues were pleased that the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau tailored the rule to ensure that lenders who serve  rural and underserved communities have flexibility in serving their  customers.   While that was a very good first step, Congress has pushed to expand  this tailoring to include even more community banks and credit unions,  consistent with safe and sound operations. H.R. 2226, as amended in the  committee, provides this targeted and, I think, reasonable relief.   As Representative Barr and I have indicated, there are additional  refinements to the bill that I would have still liked to have seen  adopted, such as additional guardrails on the types of products  offered. I am glad, however, and as Mr. Barr indicated, the leadership  of the committee, the majority, agreed to crucial language offered by  Mr. Capuano to improve the bill.   As amended, lenders are required to continually hold these loans in  portfolio, and not only consider and document, but verify a borrower's  income information.   Congress should not be in the business of allowing lenders to  underwrite and offer mortgage loans that borrowers have no ability to  repay.   I am supportive of this bill for that reason, but also because I  believe it will help in areas of the country that have weaker housing  markets. This has really been the reason that I have been interested in  the issue of portfolio lending.   As many know, I represent Flint, Michigan, which not unlike a number  of communities across the country have very weak and very low cost  markets. You can purchase a single family home in Flint for $25,000-- not $250,000--$25,000.   Under the QM rules, financial institutions sometimes, justifiably,  struggle to make these small mortgages, resulting in even more stagnant  markets--it is a vicious cycle--and weakening these markets  permanently. If we can't get people financed into mortgages, these  communities and the market will never recover.                                time  1345    This bill will encourage community banks and credit unions to make  those smaller mortgages, to help weaker markets.   It is for that reason and many others, but particularly for that  reason, that I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It  is a big step in the right direction for weak markets. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, just to reiterate, we don't agree on everything. Even  some of the debate in this conversation, I think we could find areas of  disagreement. But when it comes to the specifics of this legislation, I  think it strikes a good balance. The balance, for me, being the notion  that we can deem these mortgages held by smaller institutions, as long  as they are held in portfolio, as meeting the QM requirements.   In exchange for that, what we get is, in weak markets, we get a  chance for folks who essentially have been locked out of home ownership  to be able to get a small mortgage literally on a $25,000, $30,000, or  $40,000 home and begin to build equity that will return value to that  family and to that community for a long, long time.   For that reason, I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues  to join me in voting ``yes'' on it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4725, the Community Bank  Reporting Relief Act, which would reduce reporting requirements through  first and third quarter call reports for depository institutions with  less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets.   This bill provides targeted regulatory relief to many of our smaller  financial institutions, as has been the desire of both Democrats and  Republicans on the committee and in this Congress for some time.   Under the Obama administration, the Federal banking agencies began  taking a series of steps to reduce and streamline various bank  reporting requirements. Many of these requirements had existed for  decades, including the quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and  Income for a Bank, which is commonly referred to as a call report.   These efforts by regulators have included creating a simpler call  report for most community banks with less than $1 billion. Regulators  have already been exploring raising the threshold to a comparable level  that is proposed by this legislation. The regulators also allow for  some data to be reported semiannually, as this bill would allow, or  annually rather than quarterly.   I am pleased that H.R. 4725 would give the regulators discretion to  decide what information should be included in a reduced call report. It  is also key that the bill would require a full call report every other  quarter for banks under $5 billion, including at the end of the year,  to make sure that regulators and the public have sufficient information  on the health of financial institutions.   Furthermore, this bill would permit regulators to limit the  regulatory relief, as appropriate. This would, for example, exclude  banks with foreign offices or ones that are affiliated with much larger  banks, as they do today.   This bill would appropriately maintain robust oversight of our  Nation's largest banks while providing targeted relief for smaller  institutions.   As I said, we don't agree on everything. Many of us on this side  believe that the robust protections built into Dodd-Frank have  strengthened the financial system but that there are ways that we can  improve and refine those restrictions in order to support particularly  smaller institutions. This is a step in that direction, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 4725.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will just close by reiterating what I said  earlier. From time to time, it is clear that we can come together on  solutions to problems that we come across in any regulation, in any  aspect of the Federal Government. Even in areas where we might find  broad disagreement on the importance of many of the protections that  were put in place after the financial crisis, across the aisle, we can  often find common ground around particular solutions; and, when we do  that, we should act.   I think that is why so many of us were pleased to see this  legislation come forward to give us a chance to demonstrate that this  is a step in the right direction, particularly supporting some of our  smaller institutions. I support this legislation and urge my colleagues  to do the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if ever there is a time for Democrats and Republicans to  come together in a bipartisan fashion, it would be around this issue,  around an issue to combat the financing of transnational criminal  organizations. That is what H.R. 4768 would do. Specifically, it would  require the Secretary of the Treasury to lead the effort, in  consultation with other key agencies and departments, and update the  strategy to fight these organizations at least every 2 years.   Additionally, the legislation requires the administration to assess  the key threats, financial support networks, and methods used by  criminal groups to launder the proceeds of illicit activities. In  passing this legislation, we will not only build upon but also cement  the importance of the interagency approach taken by the prior  administration in combating the impact of global criminal enterprises.   Indeed, in 2010, the Obama administration conducted a comprehensive  assessment of organized crime, the first such review that had taken  place since the mid-1990s. The assessment came to the alarming  conclusion that the threat of global criminal networks had become more  complex, volatile, and destabilizing and that such groups were  proliferating, striking new and powerful alliances, and engaging in a  growing range of illicit activities such as we have never seen before.   To combat this growing threat and lessen its impact both domestically  and on our foreign partners, the Obama administration, in 2011, issued  a comprehensive interagency strategy that identified 56 priority  actions across five strategic objectives. One of these key objectives  included breaking the economic power of transnational criminal networks  and protecting strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from  penetration and abuse by transnational organized crime. This strategic  objective, in particular, resonates with me, as I have always believed  strongly that following the money and using our economic leverage is  the best way to counter illicit activity. This is especially true in  countering transnational criminal organizations, whose primary  objective is economic gain.   In a number of ways, this legislation before us will ensure that the  Treasury, as well as the intelligence and broader U.S. national  security apparatus, remains focused on some of the emerging threats  posed by transnational organized crime groups; including, kleptocrats,  human traffickers, drug traffickers, and cybercriminals.   Additionally, the legislation explicitly requires the administration  to examine how such groups exploit the use of shell companies, misuse  digital currencies and other cyber technologies.   I am also pleased that, with the concurrence of the chairman and the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), the committee agreed to adopt  an amendment offered by Ranking Member Waters that sharpens the bill's  focus on the methods by which transnational organized crime groups  launder illicit funds using real estate and other tangible goods, such  as art and antiquities. These significant vulnerabilities have been  identified as major threats to our national security and the integrity  of our financial system by a broad range of bipartisan experts,  including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Financial  Action Task Force.   For example, just last year, FinCEN noted in a public advisory that:  ``Real estate transactions and the real estate market have certain  characteristics that make them vulnerable to abuse by illicit actors. .  . . For these reasons and others, drug traffickers, corrupt officials,  and other criminals can and have used real estate to conceal the  existence and origins of their illicit funds.''   The entities and individuals that have sought to exploit real estate  to conceal illicit funds includes Iranian banks subject to U.S.  sanctions, Russian oligarchs and Russian-organized crime rings, as well  as Venezuelan officials found to be engaged in narcotics trafficking.    The fact that these vulnerabilities are not merely theoretical and  have been used by a wide range of criminal groups should disturb all of  us. We also know that money laundering through the global art and  antiquities market is another key method for washing illicit funds, and  that is undoubtedly being exploited by well-organized transnational  criminal groups. Indeed, we know that the looting and trafficking in  cultural heritage is a source of revenue that has funded ISIS' heinous  activities, and we know that the opaque characteristics of the high-end  art market and its lack of basic anti-money-laundering requirements  make it a target for illicit funds.   So I am pleased that the members of this committee were able to agree  that real estate and art market vulnerabilities should be given due  consideration when it comes to transnational organized crime. Again,  this is one of those  [[Page H1397]]  subjects around which bipartisanship should be assumed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join in this bipartisan effort and  to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema), a cosponsor of this legislation and a  distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, obviously, as I said, we need a national  strategy to combat the financing of transnational criminal  organizations.   This legislation requires that such a strategy be put together. It is  an issue that crosses virtually every partisan or ideological line. It  is an example of legislation that we all can embrace and should  support.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to do so, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
