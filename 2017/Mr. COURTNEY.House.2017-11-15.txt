 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal for his tireless leadership pointing  out the trail of broken promises that are in this bill for middle class  families, who will pay dearly with higher costs for healthcare, home  ownership, and, in many cases, Federal taxes.   I would like to zero in for a minute during National Apprenticeship  Week on the broken promise that the bill represents to growing the U.S.  economy, which has a shortage of skilled workers. The obliteration of  the student loan interest deduction, which will add $24 billion to the  cost of higher education; the taxation of graduate students' tuition  waivers, 60 percent of which are concentrated in STEM curricula; and  the elimination of tax-free employer-funded tuition assistance, to  enhance workplace skills, often using apprenticeship programs, moves  this country in exactly the wrong direction to close the skills gap in  our workforce, which we all know every Member in this body has heard  about from employers back home.   Indeed, America's CEOs told the President last February at a White  House manufacturing summit: Jobs exist, skills don't.   In fact, the Trump's Labor Department reported 6.1 million job  openings in the month of September, a near record high.   Sadly, this antigrowth tax bill robs American job seekers and  employers of the tools to fill those jobs, ironically, during National  Apprenticeship Week.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members of this body to vote ``no.''
