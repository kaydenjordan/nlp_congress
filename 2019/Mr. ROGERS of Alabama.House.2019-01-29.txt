 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 424, the Department of  Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act.  [[Page H1256]]    President Trump has directed a major security clearance and  background information overhaul across the executive branch. This  effort is underway, and significant progress has been made to reduce  the backlog and improve the quality of background investigations. The  bill we are considering today complements this initiative.   H.R. 424 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct an  inventory of the department's positions that require security  clearances, which currently number over 100,000, and determine what  positions may be duplicative or are no longer necessary. It is just  good government to periodically review the positions that require a  ``need to know'' and to ensure DHS is not allocating funds for  unnecessary background investigations. Security clearances are costly  to investigate, adjudicate, and maintain.   The bill would ensure that DHS conducts a thorough accounting of its  workforce needs and reduces the number of positions with security  clearances if determined appropriate. The bill would also require  additional transparency on how security clearances are adjudicated,  including when there are reasons to suspend or deny a security  clearance.   Chairman Thompson's legislation is an example of the accounting that  each Federal department should be conducting today and would lead to a  leaner and more secure Department of Homeland Security.   Mr. Speaker, the bill is identical to the version the House passed  last Congress, and I would just reiterate this is good government,  bipartisan legislation. I urge its support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 495, the Office of State and  Local Law Enforcement Information Sharing Review Act, introduced by my  friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The Office for State and Local Law Enforcement is part of the  Department of Homeland Security and currently resides in the Office of  Partnership and Engagement. The Office provides information on DHS'  resources that are available to State and local law enforcement agency  partners and a point of contact for questions regarding DHS' policies  and programs.   This bill requires the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to  provide a report on the efforts of the Office to improve information  sharing between DHS and law enforcement agencies, an overview of the  performance metrics used to measure success and any feedback provided  by the State and local stakeholders, and an overview of ongoing  activities of the Office.   This reporting requirement is intended to assist the Office in  identifying areas of improvement in the Department's information- sharing efforts and coordinating with the relevant DHS components to  close any identified gaps.  [[Page H1257]]    I am pleased the bill includes a sunset on the reporting requirement  after 5 years. While the information gathered through the report will  be valuable for congressional oversight, it is important that we do not  overburden the Department with never-ending reporting requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate, this is good  government policy, and I fully support and urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
