 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service,  sacrifice, and recent nomination of one of my constituents, Rear  Admiral Michael E. Boyle.   Admiral Boyle has served as director of Maritime Operations for the  U.S. Pacific Fleet since June of 2020. Admiral Boyle was designated a  naval aviator in January of 1990.   In his 30 years of dedicated service, he has held numerous positions  throughout the United States Naval Command. Whether it was operational  tours, like aboard the USS Forrestal in support of Operation Provide  Comfort in Northern Iraq, or aboard the USS Saratoga in support of  Operation Provide Promise in Bosnia, Admiral Boyle has shown what  leadership, fortitude, and duty look like in the United States Navy.   I commend the Secretary of Defense, General Lloyd Austin for his  nomination of Rear Admiral Boyle to the rank of two-star flag officer,  rear admiral, in the United States Navy. His work in keeping our Nation  safe and securing American interests abroad have not gone unnoticed.   I want to personally thank Rear Admiral Michael Boyle for his service  to this country and his steadfast duty in defense of our Constitution.   Congratulations, Admiral. Semper Fortis.                 Honoring Assistant Chief of Police John Jock     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished  service of Assistant Chief of Police John Jock of the Orange Park  Police Department.   Over the past 25 years, Assistant Chief Jock has worked under three  police chiefs, four town managers, and has become a valued member of  the force in our community. Starting as a patrol officer for the OPPD  back in 1996, he has earned promotions three times, achieving the rank  of assistant police chief, and even receiving his master's degree in  the process.   He graduated from the FDLE Florida Leadership Academy in 2011, and  served on the Clay County SWAT team for over a decade. Mr. Jock has  been on the front lines of law enforcement for a quarter century and,  in that time, has investigated and solved criminal cases, provided  disaster training and communication, and has been a valued community  leader.   As a citizen of Orange Park for the last 22 years, Assistant Chief  Jock entered retirement earlier this month after 25 years of service.  As the wife of a fellow SWAT team member, I want to wish him and his  family a happy, safe, and productive retirement.                          Honoring Captain Mark Elam     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life and service of Captain Mark Elam of the Putnam County Department  of Corrections.   Captain Elam served in the Putman County Sheriff's Office for nearly  20 years and, in that time, proved himself to be a hardworking servant.   Before joining the sheriff's office, Mark served 4 years in the  United States Marine Corps. But the role that he excelled at the most  was as a family man. He was a devoted husband to his wife, Lachrisha,  for 15 years and a father to two children. Before Captain Elam's death  last week, Mark and his wife were in the process of adopting five  siblings.   He had a servant's heart and so much compassion to give. His loss  leaves a hole in the Putnam County law enforcement community, but his  memory will live on in the work and good deeds he did in life.   I want to extend my condolences to his wife, children, and the entire  Putnam County Sheriff's Office in their enormous loss.   God bless Captain Elam and his family.   You've got the watch.                                time  1215    Honoring Gilchrist County Sheriff's Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy                               Taylor Lindsey     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember  Gilchrist County Sheriff's Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor  Lindsey who were both gunned down in the line of duty 3 years ago  today.   On April 19, 2018, Sergeant Ramirez and Deputy Lindsey were eating  lunch at a restaurant in Trenton, Florida, when a coward fired through  a window and killed both officers in the line of duty. That man--whose  name does not deserve to be mentioned--killed those two officers,  consumed by a radical hate for law enforcement. That same hate for law  enforcement that we saw then I continue to see today.   Now more than ever we need to publicly and boldly support our law  enforcement officers.   Noel and Taylor's deaths remind us of the constant vigilance that an  officer needs to have in order to return home safely to their families  every night. Being an LEO is a difficult and often thankless job.  [[Page H1895]]    I want to take a moment to thank Sergeant Ramirez and Deputy Lindsey  for their service and sacrifice to our community. We honor their legacy  by continuing to say their names and remember their sacrifice and love  for our hometown.   I pledge to always have our brothers and sisters in uniform's six.                            ____________________
