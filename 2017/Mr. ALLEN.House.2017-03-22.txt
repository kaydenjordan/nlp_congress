 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on  this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1101, the Small Business  Health Fairness Act.   Since 2008, the number of small businesses offering health insurance  to its employees has dwindled nearly 36 percent. The culprit? Well,  ObamaCare.   You know, the American people deserve choice. I have lived this  reality. I owned and operated a small business for over 40 years back  home in Georgia. I know how ObamaCare premium increases hurt and, in  some cases, affect a business' ability to provide health care for its  employees.   I believe the greatest gift God gave me as a small-business owner was  the ability to give others a good job along with the dignity and  respect they deserve to provide for their family, their community,  their church, and, yes, this Nation.   All hardworking American small-business owners should be able to give  their employees these same opportunities. For this reason, I am a  strong supporter of the Small Business Health Fairness Act legislation,  which would allow small businesses to band together and purchase health  care for workers and their families at a lower cost.   Folks, this is innovation. This is what the small business community  does. Small businesses are the backbone of America. I will fight for  their strength and their survival.
