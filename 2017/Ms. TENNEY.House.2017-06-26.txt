 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Food Bank  of the Southern Tier in Broome County and Tioga County for being 2017's  Food Bank of the Year, nationally. Out of 200 locations across the  country, the Food Bank of the Southern Tier was ranked number one.   Last year, our food bank distributed more than 9 million meals  throughout the southern tier. Over 40 percent of those meals were given  to children and 14 percent to seniors.   Through their work with mobile food pantries and the BackPack  Program, the food bank has increased access to healthy food for all,  distributing 2.2 million pounds of fresh produce to southern tier  families.   Today, I would like to thank President Natasha Thompson and the  incredible volunteers who have worked tirelessly in their mission to  build and sustain hunger-free communities. Your work has had a profound  impact on ending hunger in our community. Thank you again for your  dedicated service to the families of the southern tier.                            ____________________
