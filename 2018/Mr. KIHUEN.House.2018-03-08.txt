 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Keri  Galvan.   Keri attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas on October 1.  She was a mother of three and a wife to her husband, Justin Galvan. She  worked as a cocktail server at Mastro's Steakhouse, where she worked  for almost a decade.   She was known by her friends as supermom, and was always there for  anybody. Keri never forgot anybody's special occasion and constantly  made sure everybody was okay. She is remembered for being a devoted  wife and mother who put others before herself.   I would like to extend my condolences to Keri Galvan's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
