 Madam Speaker, I saw a political crossword puzzle this  week. It asked for a six-letter word to describe President Biden's  first year in office. So I thought, divisive? No, that is eight  letters. Weak? No, that is four letters.   But the word is crises, Madam Speaker. From the crisis raging at our  southern border to the economic crisis affecting Arkansans, small  businesses, and Americans across the Nation, the Biden administration  has continually failed to address these challenges head-on.   The border crisis isn't a seasonal problem, as argued. It is the  direct result of repealing the Trump-era border policies and replacing  them with absolutely nothing until recently.   Federal Reserve Chair Powell says, inflation isn't transitory, Madam  Speaker. It continues to rise to a 40-year high. Americans are paying  more for just about everything from gas to groceries.   Under President Trump, we saw increasing real wages. Under President  Biden, we are seeing real wages decline, meaning our pay is decreasing  when accounting for inflation.   Democrats' solution? Continuing to push their constant tax-and- spending spree. We need leadership, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
