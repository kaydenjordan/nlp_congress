 Mr. Speaker, the debt limit debate is a study in contrasts  between responsible Republicans and dysfunctional Democrats.   On one side, you have responsible Republicans who have been working  from the beginning to avoid default and reduce out-of-control spending.   Speaker McCarthy called on President Biden to negotiate on January  12. When President Biden ignored him for nearly 100 days, House  Republicans passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act, the only plan that avoids  default, lowers spending, protects Medicare and Social Security, and  reduces our dependence on China.   By contrast, dysfunctional Democrats have ignored the exploding  national debt, even though it was their reckless spending that brought  us here in the first place.   President Biden knew the debt limit deadline was coming, but for  months, he did nothing. Now, with only 8 days until Secretary Yellen's  June 1 default deadline, he continues to act irresponsibly.   Mr. Speaker, my message to President Biden is simple: Get serious.  Act urgently. Listen to the American people, not the far left in your  party.                            ____________________
