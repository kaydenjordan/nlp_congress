 Mr. President, the subject the Senator from Delaware  speaks of--climate change especially--affects my State of Florida, as  we are ground zero with so many of the consequences of climate change-- the sea level rise. I will be addressing that topic within the next  couple of days. I have addressed that problem over and over, but I want  to give a concluding speech on that topic.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the November  15, 2018, vote on the motion to table the motion to discharge S.J. Res.  65, a joint resolution relating to the disapproval of the proposed  export to the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain of certain defense  articles and services. I would have voted yea on the motion to table.                            ____________________
