 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Murray-Calloway  Chamber of Commerce for their designation as the 2019 National Chamber  of the Year.   This national honor was awarded at the ACCE National Convention in  Long Beach, California, on July 15. This is the second win for the  Murray-Calloway County Chamber, the first being in 2012.   The National Chamber of the Year Award recognizes the area's business  leaders whose community contributions are unparalleled. ACCE only  invites a limited number of the chambers to apply, and the application  process considers the chambers' structure, finances, member engagement,  services, and programs upon honoring a chamber. The chamber's efforts  have benefited not only the Murray-Calloway County area, but positively  impacted communities throughout western Kentucky.   I would like to thank President Michelle Bundren and Board Chair  LaCosta Beane-Hays, as well as the directors, staff, and chamber  members for their unwavering dedication to the betterment of local  industry.   I look forward to future accomplishments of the chamber and am proud  to represent the thriving business leaders in Murray and Calloway  County, Kentucky.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in opposition.   Madam Speaker, we are here today debating a premature and ill-advised  resolution to hold Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of  Commerce Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.   In the eyes of the Democratic majority, their crime is not  cooperating enough with the Democrats' investigation into the  reinstatement of the citizenship question on the 2020 Census.   First, this contempt citation is a misuse of one of the most powerful  tools available to this body.   Second, the idea that the Trump administration is stonewalling this  investigation or even, in Chairman Cummings' words, engaged in a  coverup from the top, is simply wrong.   The bottom line is, the Department of Justice and the Department of  Commerce are cooperating with the committee's investigation into the  reinstitution of the citizenship question on the 2020 Census. The  administration has produced a total of 31,000 pages of documents to the  committee, 14,000 pages from the Commerce Department and 17,000 pages  from the Justice Department.   The committee had heard testimony from six witnesses, with more  interviews expected this month. Secretary Ross himself testified for  over 6 hours about his decision to reinstate the citizenship question  on the Census.   The real issue we should be debating is why the Democrats are afraid  to ask how many citizens are in the United States of America.    Let's remember, just 1 month ago, the Supreme Court ruled that asking  a citizenship question on the Census is constitutional. Since the  Supreme Court ruling, the President has said a citizenship question  will not appear on the 2020 Census.   To put away all doubt about asking a citizenship question on the  Census and all future Censuses, I introduced a bill last night to add a  citizenship question to the 2020 Census. My bill is intended to put  away all doubt about asking a citizenship question on this and future  Censuses.   If the Democrats can't impeach President Trump, they will, instead,  hold his Cabinet in contempt of Congress. This is just another episode  in political theater. This exercise is not a responsible use of the  contempt authority.   This is just another attempt for the Democrats to delegitimize the  efforts to accurately count the number of United States citizens in the  United States, something that should not be controversial. This is all  part of the same game plan to manufacture controversy around anything  associated with the Trump administration.   These are the sort of abusive tactics that we should reject. These  are the sort of tactics that give Congress a bad reputation. We should  be better than this.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to vote against moving  this partisan contempt legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).  [[Page H5944]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows), one of the great leaders  of this body.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the great minority leader.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  for each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the  Oversight Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).  [[Page H5949]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think that just about everyone who spoke on our side  of the aisle made the factual points that this is not necessary. This  resolution is an ongoing attempt by the majority party to try to  do anything they can to disrupt the Presidency of our President of the  United States.    Every country, just about, in the world asks the citizenship  question. Mexico and Canada ask the citizenship question. In fact, the  United Nations recommends that countries ask the citizenship question.   I don't for the life of me know why we would resort to this type of  action in this body, especially after what happened yesterday. I  wonder, Madam Speaker, is this an attempt to try to move the direction  of the American people from their frustration at the lack of  achievement by the majority party from a legislative standpoint to try  to somehow enrage their anger at the President?   This is unnecessary. This is more political theater, and I urge the  Members of this fine body to oppose this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
