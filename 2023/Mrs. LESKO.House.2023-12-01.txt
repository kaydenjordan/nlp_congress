 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank our colleagues for standing in respect of a great woman. She was  not only a great woman for Arizona but a great woman and trailblazer  for all women across America.   As was said, she was the first female majority leader to serve in the  Arizona Senate. She went on to be the first woman to serve as a Supreme  Court Justice. She stood up for truth. She stood up for justice. She  was not only a wonderful woman and representative of Arizona but a  wonderful American.   We are saddened by her passing, but she set the trail for all of us  women. She was a great Republican, a great American, and we praise her  each and every day.
