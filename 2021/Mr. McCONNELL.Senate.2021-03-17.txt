 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Last week, our Democratic colleagues had to resort to  a rare tactic to rescue the stalled nomination of Xavier Becerra to run  the Department of Health and Human Services.   The distinguishing feature of this nominee's resume is not his  expertise in health, medicine, or administration. That part of the  resume is very brief. What stands out are Mr. Becerra's commitments to  partisan warfare and his far-left ideology.   He has supported the sweeping government takeover of healthcare they  call ``Medicare for All,'' which would actually end Medicare as we know  it and would rip away families' private insurance plans.   As the administration's policies continue to create a border crisis,  Mr. Becerra is someone who believes we should not just have blanket  amnesty, but that entering the country illegally should not even be a  crime.   And even amid a global pandemic, the most significant health-related  experience on the nominee's record is his efforts to wield the legal  system against religious Sisters to make them violate their faith and  conscience.   Up to now, every person who has ever been confirmed as Secretary of  Health and Human Services has either been favorably reported by the  Finance Committee or discharged by unanimous consent. There is ample  reason why this nominee would be a glaring exception.   I continue to urge a ``no'' vote.                            ____________________     Madam President, fortunately, the Senate will first be  confirming a thoroughly qualified nominee to be the new  administration's top trade official.   Katherine Tai is just the kind of qualified and mainstream person who  is positioned to serve President Biden and the country quite well. That  is why she received broad bipartisan support from the Finance Committee  and why the vote to advance her nomination yesterday was 98 to 0.   I look forward to working with Ms. Tai to embrace trade and push back  on abusive practices from China and other anticompetitive countries.   Trade is a huge strength of America. It drives job creation and  economic growth. Just look at my home State, for example. Exports  support more than 140,000 jobs in Kentucky. Hard-working Kentuckians  supply nearly 200 countries with everything from agricultural goods to  medicines, to aerospace parts and motor vehicles.   In the last Congress, we modernized our trade with our neighbors to  the north and south through the USMCA. We gave Kentucky farmers,  workers, and consumers a long-awaited boost.   But our job creators still face unfair barriers, including those  targeting American spirits. The Bluegrass is proud to craft 95 percent  of the world's bourbon, but, currently, tariffs put Kentucky distillers  at a disadvantage in their largest export markets.   Ms. Tai should address these unfair international headwinds facing  Kentuckians. I would encourage her to focus on expanding markets and  reducing barriers for products and services from all 50 States.   Americans would welcome the growth in opportunity and prosperity.  And, if you ask me, the whole world could benefit from a little more  Kentucky bourbon                            ____________________     Madam President, tomorrow, the Secretary of State and  the President's National Security Advisor will have their first face- to-face meeting with Chinese officials. I am glad our officials met  with regional allies like Japan and South Korea right beforehand and  have been in touch with Australia and European allies as well. It is  essential that we and our friends present a united front.   Now, the United States and the whole world need the President's team  to deliver a strong message tomorrow.   During the campaign, President Biden spoke dismissively about the  threat from China. But thus far, in office, his team has shown signs  they understand that Communist China threatens America, our allies, and  the prevailing international system.   The world spent years presuming that welcoming China into the  international community would inevitably cause its rulers to play by  the rules. Twenty years ago, President Clinton said: ``[E]conomic  innovation and political empowerment . . . will inevitably go hand in  hand.'' But since then, rather than the rest of the world exporting  liberty and transparency into China, Beijing has found more success  exporting authoritarianism and corruption beyond its borders.  [[Page S1580]]    In Japan, on Tuesday, Secretary Blinken called out the ``coercion and  aggression'' that China deploys at home and abroad. He said this  administration will push back on Beijing. That clear-eyed talk is  certainly welcome, but it is just the first step.   Walking the walk will mean actually responding in tough ways to  espionage and cyber attacks, to violations of human rights, to military  bullying, to stealing intellectual property and cheating on trade. If  the administration is up to the task, they will find strong partners in  this Republican conference.   Here is one big test: Are they willing to keep investing in our own  defense?   Our financial commitment to defending America is our most important  policy lever in this competition with China. Our allies and adversaries  do not heed American Presidents because they are charming or good- looking. The world has respected America for our overwhelming military  and economic superiority. When that edge erodes, we invite trouble.   As a share of our economy, American defense spending has fallen  significantly, not just from Cold War-era heights but even just  recently. Meanwhile, China used its growing prosperity to modernize its  military, develop new and longer range weapons to hold U.S. forces at  risk from further away, and turn a particular eye towards space and  cyber space.   Defense spending is about protecting our homeland. It is about  projecting power. It is about preserving global influence, supporting  our allies. It is really a barometer of our national will.   It is also about innovation and the future. Many life-changing  innovations throughout our economy were first rooted in military R&D.   Unfortunately, reports suggest the Biden administration may plan to  freeze defense spending. Of course, that means a reduction, after  inflation. Dozens of Democrats are pressuring the administration for  even steeper cuts than that. If the administration is serious about  competing with China, deterring Russia, and preserving American  leadership, the most important test will be in the President's budget  submission.   Some of our Senate Democratic colleagues have expressed interest in  crafting bipartisan legislation related to China. If any issue is ripe  for a regular-order, bipartisan process, it would be that one.   Defense spending is the crucial first step, but there are a whole  variety of subjects concerning our competition with China that could  benefit from a serious look.   There is bipartisan support for improving security reviews of foreign  investment and protecting against forced technology transfer, for  cracking down on Chinese espionage and political influence campaigns,  for supporting the people of Hong Kong, and human rights, and deterring  aggression against Taiwan. There is bipartisan support for fostering  specific industries of national-security importance, such as  semiconductors, and for broadly strengthening American R&D.   There is an opportunity for fruitful discussion here. Certainly, this  is an area where bipartisanship will be especially crucial, so  strategies don't change schizophrenically with every election. As one  of our Democratic colleagues said in a hearing yesterday, ``the U.S.  will not out-compete China . . . with short-term legislation and never- ending uncertainty.''   That is another great argument for not trashing the legislative  filibuster. Imagine if every action the Senate takes with national  security implications were constantly subject to being wiped clean.  While China plans years and decades at a time, our Federal legislation  would be reduced to a shelf life of a couple years.   These issues need to be addressed thoughtfully and deliberately.  Identifying critical technologies and the best ways to promote and  protect advancements needs to be a smart, fact-based process, not a  political guessing game or throwing cash at industries with the right  connections.   Our work on this front should strengthen our ties with our allies and  partners, not try in vain to simply go it alone.   And the Democratic majority must resist the temptation to pile a long  list of unrelated policy wishes into a big package and try to label it  ``China policy.'' It would be quite a remarkable coincidence if our  Democratic colleagues' vision for a so-called China bill ends up being  indistinguishable from a list of things that just happen to delight  liberal interest groups.   Getting America on a stronger footing will not require some sweeping  far-left transformation of our economy. It will mean continuing to  complement the principles and ideas that are our greatest strengths,  and it will mean working on these issues the right way, across the  aisle                            ____________________
