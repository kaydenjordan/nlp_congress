 Madam Speaker, the word ``hero'' is used a little too  often these days. But make no mistake, John Lewis personified the word.  He was, without question, a true American hero.   The fearlessness he demonstrated throughout the civil rights  movement, but especially on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March  7, 1965, demonstrated to people across the globe how to stand up for  equality, justice, and basic civil and human rights in the face of  overwhelming odds. Quite simply, his heroic actions transformed our  Nation and our world.   Early on in my time in Congress, I had the pleasure of meeting  Congressman Lewis for the first time. When he found out I was from  Cincinnati, he immediately asked me a question that I would hear from  him many times in the coming years, how was his friend and fellow civil  rights leader, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, doing.   The two men had worked together throughout the 1960s, along with Dr.  Martin Luther King, organizing marches, sit-ins, and freedom rides.  Like John Lewis, Reverend Shuttlesworth remained committed to civil  rights throughout his life and worked diligently to improve conditions  in Cincinnati.   Not surprisingly, when I would see Reverend Shuttlesworth back home,  he would ask how John Lewis was doing up here. As a result, I was kind  of a messenger between these two-larger-than-life civil rights icons,  and they will always be inextricably linked in my memory.   Madam Speaker, the world needs more heroes like John Lewis and the  Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. Now, more than ever, their dedication to  overcoming inequality and changing hearts and minds through nonviolent  protests points the way forward as we continue to strive to come  together and achieve a more perfect Union.
