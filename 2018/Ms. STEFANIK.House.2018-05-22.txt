 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan bill that will help ensure our technological superiority  over the next decade.   As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and  Capabilities, I am proud of our portion of the bill which energizes our  science and technology enterprise, strengthens our cyber warfare  capabilities, enables our Special Operations Forces around the globe,  provides resources and authorities to counter terrorism and  unconventional warfare threats, and advances programs and activities  that counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction.   I am especially pleased with the subcommittee's work to review and  understand our adversarial threats, most notably, from China and  Russia.   We have maintained our focus on emerging technologies such as  artificial intelligence, directed energy, hypersonics, synthetic  biology, and robotics.   The bill before the House incorporates four broad subcommittee  themes. First, the bill better organizes the DOD to oversee,  accelerate, and integrate AI and machine learning across the defense  enterprise by including H.R. 5365, a bill I introduced with  subcommittee ranking member, Jim Langevin. This will establish a  national security commission on artificial intelligence to conduct a  thorough review of the wide ranging military applications of this  decisive technology.   Second, we build upon previous NDAAs and advance prototyping and  testing of directed energy weapons and hypersonic vehicles and  accelerate these technologies by authorizing an additional $100  million. This bill also demonstrates our resolve to protect our  servicemembers from the threat posed by our adversaries' deliberate  efforts to develop and field new technologies, ranging from unmanned  aerial systems to quantum sciences.   Third, the bill strengthens our whole of government cybersecurity  posture by establishing a pilot program that improves coordination and  partnering between the DOD and Homeland Security to prevent and respond  to cyber attacks against our critical infrastructure. It also  reinforces international partnerships in cyber warfare to counter  aggressive adversaries, such as Russia, China, and North Korea, and it  also includes support for our NATO partners to enhance cooperative  cyber and information warfare capabilities.    And finally, the bill authorizes U.S. Special Operations Command's  programs and activities, including ongoing efforts in Iraq, Syria,  Afghanistan, Somalia, and Eastern Europe. The bill will also strengthen  congressional oversight of ongoing counterterrorism and sensitive  activities and streamline DOD's oversight of countering weapons of mass  destruction.   Before I conclude, I want to thank Chairman Mac Thornberry for his  leadership, as well as my subcommittee ranking member Jim Langevin of  Rhode Island for his leadership.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  [[Page H4374]]         Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment to strike section  1225, which is an important and necessary provision in the fiscal year  2019 NDAA.   Iran is a significant threat not only to Israel but to the stability  of the entire region, and this provision provides an effective plan to  counter their destabilizing efforts.    Iran has supported militias in Syria, provided weapons to Hezbollah  in Lebanon, and helped the Houthi militia to overthrow the government  in Yemen. They continue to pose a threat to Israel by building up  forces near Israel's northern border and to U.S. forces in the region  as well.   This provision not only emphasizes the importance of multilateral  cooperation, but it encourages the Secretary of Defense to establish a  framework for critical mutual investments in ISR assets, ballistic  missile defense, and cybersecurity and cyber defense.   At its core, section 1225 supports the National Defense Strategy by  highlighting the importance of partnerships and the responsibility of  all affected nations to contribute in order to achieve shared  objectives. It is only through this level of shared responsibility that  the United States can expect to manage the threat from Iran, as well as  those from Asia and Europe.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
