 Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  have the Chief Justice rule on motions to subpoena witnesses and  documents and to rule on any assertion of privilege, and I ask that it  be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Van Hollen] proposes an       amendment numbered 1298.        At the appropriate place in the matter following the       resolving clause, insert the following:        Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the       Presiding Officer shall issue a subpoena for any witness or       any document that a Senator or a party moves to subpoena if       the Presiding Officer determines that the witness or document       is likely to have probative evidence relevant to either       article of impeachment before the Senate, and, consistent       with the authority of the Presiding Officer to rule on all       questions of evidence, shall rule on any assertion of       privilege.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table
