 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and thank Air  Force Lt. Col. Renette Hilton. Renette has been serving as a Department  of Defense fellow in my office this year, and she has been an asset to  the people of Arizona and the U.S. Congress.   Arizona is home to key parts of the U.S. Air Force working every day  to keep our Nation safe and secure. Luke Air Force Base is home to the  world's largest fighter wing, the 56th Fighter Wing, where they train  on and operate the F-35 Lightning. The F-35 is America's preeminent  fifth-generation fighter. Luke Air Force Base also trains pilots for  our partner nations, strengthening or relationship with and the  security of our allies. Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is similarly  critical to our national security. Davis-Monthan has a diverse mission  that includes search and rescue, Air Force Southern Command, electronic  warfare, and the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group. Arizona  also has one of the most capable Air National Guard units in the  country. They organize the busiest aerial refueling operation and  continue to innovate to stay on the cutting edge of Air Force  capabilities.  [[Page S8908]]    In the year she has worked in my office, Renette has become an  essential member of the team and a valued connection to the Air Force.  She has worked with my policy team to host over 30 meetings with  Arizona constituents on a range of topics related to the Nation's  defense. She has assisted in making informed recommendations on  confirmation votes, cosponsorships, and hearing preparations. She has  helped us draft thoughtful and influential policy that I know will help  the servicemembers and families of Arizona. Renette has been a  steadfast protector of Arizona military missions and communities.   Moreover, Renette went above and beyond to adapt to dynamic staffing  in my office. She led our defense team for several months, including  coordinating with a legislative correspondent, policy aide, and our  defense outreach team across three geographically dislocated offices.  In this role, she planned, organized, and directed a staff delegation  to multiple bases throughout Arizona and engaged with senior leaders in  the military, as well as business, academic, and community  stakeholders. She also successfully supported my requests to the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.   I am incredibly proud of the work accomplished by Lieutenant Colonel  Hilton throughout this challenging year. She has set an outstanding  example for others, and my team and I will miss her.                            ____________________
