 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday the Federal Reserve raised  interest rates by half a percentage point, the biggest rate hike in 22  years. The effort is underway to stop inflation. For millions of  American families who are struggling to pay their bills and afford the  basics, this can't come fast enough. The U.S. economy has added nearly  1.7 million jobs this year. Consumer spending is strong, but higher  costs for groceries, gas, housing, and more are straining family  budgets and making people very anxious about their future.   In announcing the interest rate hike yesterday, Federal Reserve  Chairman Jerome Powell said the following: The biggest drivers of  inflation today are higher prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine and  rising COVID cases in China, which can further disrupt supply chains.  In other words, the Federal Reserve Chairman said two of the biggest  drivers of inflation are really global; they are complicated; and they  aren't going to be solved by America alone.   Fortunately, there are some simple solutions we can take to help  families save money. Let me tell you about three of them. The first is  to cut gas prices. I can't think of a single cost of living that is  more visible. Every street corner in America has a sign declaring what  the cost of a gallon of gasoline is, and people compare these in their  mind even as they drive down the road. Some people make a hobby of it.  Anyone who has filled up a gas tank in the last few months has felt the  sticker shock of Mr. Putin's war on Ukraine.   President Biden has already made two changes that will reduce gas  prices. A little over a month ago, he announced the United States will  release 1 million barrels of oil a day from its Strategic Petroleum  Reserve--in  [[Page S2345]]  other words, to increase the supply in an effort to bring down the  price--1 million gallons a day for 6 months, while oil companies ramp  up domestic production to make up the shortage caused by Mr. Putin's  war.   President Biden also has issued an emergency fuel waiver allowing E15  gas--that is gas with a higher blend of ethanol--to be sold across  America this summer. Normally E15 isn't sold in the summer, but the  White House estimates that by allowing gas stations to sell it, it will  save Americans 10 cents a gallon.   Of course, if we are really serious about cutting gas prices and  reducing the power of tyrants like Putin whose nations happen to sit on  big oil reserves, we can do that by investing more in electric cars and  clean energy sources that don't break the bank or bake the planet.   Here is another solution that can save millions of families hundreds  of dollars every single month. Let's agree to cap the monthly cost of  insulin for diabetes at $35. In 1923, almost 100 years ago, researchers  in Canada were awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin to  manage diabetes. They sold the patent--listen carefully--for this drug  discovery for $1. They wanted to make sure that no one would ever  profit from this lifesaving drug.   Fast forward 100 years. Something has gone terribly wrong. The same  vial of Humalog insulin that Eli Lilly sells for $40 in Canada, it  charges $350 for in the United States--40 in Canada, 350 here. The  maker of Lantus insulin has raised their price more than 26 times since  the year 2000: from $35 to more than $300 today--26 price hikes in 22  years.   The cost of insulin can range from a couple hundred dollars a month  to more than $1,000 a month. That is the price this year. Who knows how  much it will be next year. Who bears the burden of these costs?  Patients and families. There are 37 million Americans who have  diabetes. The number goes up every year.   Senator Warnock of Georgia has introduced a critical bill, the  Affordable Insulin Now Act, to cap the monthly cost of insulin at $35 a  month. I am a cosponsor. Many Senators are. Senator Collins and Senator  Shaheen are spearheading a similar bipartisan effort to support it.   I urge more of our Republican colleagues to listen to the people they  represent. There are lots of people struggling to afford insulin in  their States as well as the blue States. Let's do this together. Can't  we agree on one thing in the U.S. Senate that we are going to do to  help America this year? I think this is a good project and a good goal.   The third way we can reduce inflation is a little more complicated,  but it is worth talking about. We need to rein in the excessive fees  charged by Visa and Mastercard for their products.   We had a hearing yesterday. It was in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  It was on something called a swipe fee. Of course, the swipe fee is the  amount of money that has to be paid in order to move that piece of  plastic through the machine. Most consumers don't even know it exists.  Every retailer knows it exists.    It was the first hearing our committee has held on this topic in 16  years--16 years. And I was there 16 years ago. I walked into the Senate  Judiciary Committee, chaired by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen  Specter, and the hearing was on swipe fees and interchange fees. I had  never heard of the term before, and I sat down and I learned.   What happened in that meeting was an exposition of the current  situation for every restaurant that you go to buy a meal in, every  store that you shop in, all the grocery stores. Any store that takes  plastic knows what a swipe fee or an interchange fee is.   Here is how it works. Visa and Mastercard control over 80 percent of  the credit and debit card markets in the United States--starting point.  It isn't as if you can walk away from these two companies and be a  retailer in America. If you are going to take plastic, you are going to  take these cards.   And every time a card with a Visa or Mastercard logo is swiped at the  retailer, Visa and Mastercard charge a fee that takes a cut out of  whatever the transaction amount turns out to be. Now, some of that cut  Visa and Mastercard keep for themselves. Most of it is given to the  bank that issues the card.   The fee that Mastercard and Visa require the card-accepting merchant  to pay to the card-issuing bank is the interchange fee. It is usually  charged as a percentage of the transaction plus a flat fee, for  example, 2 percent of whatever the transaction cost is plus 10 cents.   How does that work out in practice? Just an example: Say you buy $100  worth of groceries or kids' clothes on your credit card. After the fees  are deducted, the merchant gets $98, maybe a little less. For merchants  operating on tight profit margins--and that is most of them--these fees  can add up to a big problem.   Laura Karet was one of our witnesses yesterday. She is an amazing  woman. What a resume. She is the CEO of a supermarket chain known as  Giant Eagle. It is a regional, American-owned chain of grocery stores  based in Pittsburgh, PA. At our hearing yesterday, she explained that  her industry--groceries--typically operates on a 1-percent profit  margin--1 percent. So the 2-percent swipe fee wipes out their entire  profit.   What do they do? Well, there is only one obvious answer: They raise  the prices to cover the high swipe fees required by Visa and  Mastercard, and customers end up holding the bag.   Remember, we started this conversation about inflation. Make no  mistake, what I have just described to you is inflationary.   Swipe fees aren't just annoying to the retailers; they are anti- competitive. Ms. Karet told us the story that on April 22, she received  the latest modification of the swipe fees being charged to her  businesses by Visa and Mastercard. She said the modification was 300  pages long, almost unintelligible. She handed it over to her  accountants and to her lawyers and said: Make some sense out of it.  What are they doing to me?   The banks get the swipe fees, but the banks do not set the fees.  Banks let Visa and Mastercard do the behind-the-scenes work and fix the  fees. That means that all the thousands of card-issuing banks in the  Visa and Mastercard network receive the same exact schedule of swipe  fees from merchants regardless of whether they are efficient or  inefficient, regardless of whether or not they are preventing fraud. It  is a free lunch for the banks.   When the fee rates go up, as they did just a few weeks ago, banks  make more money every time people use plastic--debit or credit cards-- and they issue more cards. That benefits Visa and Mastercard, which  take their cut, called a network fee, out of each swipe. So Visa and  Mastercard have an incentive to keep raising fees.   What can merchants do? Well, you might think they would sit down at  the table and say: We are going to bargain about this fee, Visa and  Mastercard. We object to it being raised, and we want to let you know  that if you want to do business with our business, that is the way it  will be.   That doesn't happen at all. This is noncompetitive. Visa and  Mastercard control 80 percent of the plastic market in America. They  say to the grocery store, to the restaurant, to the shop: Take it or  leave it. Play by our rules or you won't play at all. We just won't  even let people present their cards at your business.   Visa and Mastercard tell merchants, if they want to be able to accept  payment from thousands of banks in their networks, the merchants must  agree to Visa and Mastercard's fees and terms. Take it or leave it.  Only merchants can't leave it. Visa and Mastercard, as I have said  repeatedly, control 80 percent of the credit and debit card market.   Incidentally, the figures from 2020 show--I am going to roughly  approximate these, and I will clear them up in the Record--86 billion  transactions using debit cards, 41 billion transactions using credit  cards in the year 2020. How does that compare with cash and check?  Cash, if I remember right, was 32 billion compared to 120 billion for  plastic. And what about checks? How many people are writing checks? It  was 5 billion transactions compared to plastic, which was over 120  billion.   The reality is, when swipe fees go up--and they do regularly--that  cost  [[Page S2346]]  gets built into the price consumers pay at the checkout counter and at  the gas pump.   Remember those gas prices? You wonder why they are hitting $4 a  gallon, $5 a gallon? They include the swipe fees, the credit card fees,  the debit card fees that are being added on to the cost of gasoline.   Take a look at this chart. In the 16 years between the first hearing  in the Senate Judiciary Committee--one that I attended on swipe fees-- and now, Visa and Mastercard have imposed $794 billion in swipe fees-- fees passed on directly to American families and consumers. That is a  staggering amount--$794 billion, for the hidden fee you never see.   Visa and Mastercard just raised these fees again 2 weeks ago. Senator  Marshall, my Republican colleague from Kansas, and I sent them a letter  saying this is exactly the wrong time to be raising your fees. It is  tough enough for these businesses trying to hire people and get back  into business after COVID-19, tough enough for families who are  fighting inflation. Why do you have to raise them now? You are very  profitable companies. The banks are doing quite well, too, I might add.  They did it anyway.   These fee increases are adding to inflation. The market can't fix the  problem because the credit and debit card market isn't competitive. The  retailers have no voice in what this fee is going to be. It is ``take  it or leave it.'' Visa and Mastercard have what they call a duopoly-- not a monopoly, one company controlling everything--but these two  companies, Visa and Mastercard, control over 80 percent of the plastic  market.   What can we do about it? Well, in our hearing, we talked about  several responses. First, let's bring transparency to the market. The  last thing that either Visa or Mastercard want to see is sunlight-- people understanding what they are charging, why they are charging, the  impact it has on prices, the impact on inflation. They want this to  continue to be a deep dark secret buried in 300 pages of legal  gobbledygook that they sent to the retailers.   If consumers knew how much their Visa and Mastercard purchase cost at  the local restaurants or businesses, they might try using a less costly  card and there are some out there. It would be like giving the business  a tip, and it would help bring down prices.   So why not require banks to show on their monthly statement that they  send to us with their credit-debit card transactions how much of that  was swipe fees? They could do it in a second. They wouldn't dare. They  can't ever embrace transparency. That is just about part of this  process. It is all in secret, in code, and legal gobbledygook. I will  bet that would open a lot of eyes if you saw each month how much we are  paying in swipe fees.   Incidentally, Ms. Karet talked about her supermarket chain. She said:  The three main expenses we have for my supermarket chain in  Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio are No. 1, labor costs--understandable;  No. 2, rent--that is understandable as well; No. 3, credit-debit card  swipe fees. She estimated that it is going to cost her $1 million or  more in her businesses based on what Visa and Mastercard just did two  weeks ago to raise the fees.   Here is another way we can reduce inflation. Let's prevent Visa and  Mastercard from hiking swipe fees up to unreasonable levels.   Yesterday, I pointed out that in Canada, the most commonly used debit  card system, called Interac, operates with interchange fees of zero.  There is no interchange fee. All the arguments that the banks and  credit cards make in this country about why they have to charge these  retailers these hidden fees disappear in Canada because why? The  government stepped in. They said: We are going to regulate this. We are  not going to let the banks and credit card-debit card companies dictate  the policies in our country.   They are not alone. The European Union did the same thing. There is a  long list of other countries that are moving in that same direction. It  operates quite well in these countries with low fraud and high consumer  satisfaction.   We don't have to eliminate interchange fees all together, but for  goodness sake, we ought to make sure they are not excessive and not  adding to inflation.   There are two ways we can do it: Promote something called  competition. Are you a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist; do you believe in a  free market? I bet you believe in competition, don't you? There is no  competition in these fees. It is ``take it or leave it.'' These plastic  companies dictate these terms to the retailers that honor their cards.  We can promote competition by giving merchants more options on each of  the swipes or place reasonable limits on their fees. Other countries,  as I said, figured it out. Many countries around the world say that  swipe fees are a fraction of the cost of what they are here because  those nations limit Visa and Mastercard.   We are afraid to tackle the giants. Our government and the people  that work in this Chamber--many of them are frightened by the size of  Visa and Mastercard. I didn't get that message. We can do better here.  If we do, consumers and competition will benefit.   The bottom line is this: If you are serious about reducing costs for  American families, get serious about reining in swipe fees. Visa and  Mastercard swipe fees are adding to the fires of inflation every single  day and they are doing it in secret. Is that what we want in our  economy? Is that what American families need at this moment in history?  I think not.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4155         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Alien Tort Statute       Clarification Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Since its founding, the United States has been a       proponent of international law and a champion of universal       human rights. Section 1350 of title 28, United States Code       (referred to in this section as the ``Alien Tort Statute''),       originally enacted as part of the Act entitled ``An Act to       establish the judicial courts of the United States'',       approved September 24, 1789 (1 Stat. 73), continues to serve       important purposes in providing remedies to victims of       violations of international law and for holding perpetrators       of human rights violations accountable.        (2) Some international law violations have been addressed       in part by other statutes. But the Alien Tort Statute remains       an important tool for addressing international law       violations.        (3) Human rights abusers continue to seek refuge in the       United States, including foreign government and military       officials and leaders of death squads and other violent       groups. This undermines the standing of the United States and       its capacity to speak with authority on matters of human       rights.        (4) When corporations commit or aid and abet human rights       violations directly and through their supply chains, they       should be held accountable. Failing to do so erodes the       foreign policy interests of the United States and the       priorities of Congress.        (5) Impunity for corporations who violate human rights       unfairly disadvantages businesses that respect and uphold       human rights. Companies that respect human rights should have       a level playing field with companies that do not, such as       those that would continue to do business in areas of the       world known for mass atrocities or war crimes, including the       Xinjiang region of the People's Republic of China or in the       Russian Federation amidst the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.        (6) In many countries where human rights abuses occur,       victims are unable to obtain justice because of ongoing       conflicts and violence, corruption, and inadequate rule of       law. In many such cases, a suit under the Alien Tort Statute       is the only option for redress and accountability.        (7) The international law violations for which the Alien       Tort Statute provides a remedy are universal and the Alien       Tort Statute is a testament to the rule of law in the United       States.        (8) The Alien Tort Statute should be available against       those responsible for human rights abuses whenever they are       subject to personal jurisdiction in the United States,       regardless of where the abuse occurred.
