 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Justice  for the Living victims of Lockerbie Act. This bill would create a  process to seek justice for a group Pan American World Airways pilots  who lost their careers and pensions following the bombing of Pan Am  Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the subsequent bankruptcy and  closure of Pan Am.   On December 21, 1988, the State of Libya committed an infamous act of  terror by bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing  270 innocent civilians. Despite Pan Am's greatly improved financial  position in 1988, the media coverage of the terrorist attack wreaked  havoc on Pan Am sales leading to its bankruptcy in 1991.   In 2008, the U.S. entered into the U.S.-Libya Humanitarian Settlement  Agreement, in which Libya paid $ 1.5 billion to settle claims by U.S.  citizens for Libyan-sponsored terrorism. After payments by the State  Department to families of death victims from Lockerbie and the La Belle  Disco bombing in Germany, compensation to other victims was to be  determined by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Commission  could only consider further claims referred to it by the State  Department.   One of these claimants was a group of senior Pan Am pilots, most of  whom were veterans, who were over the age of 50 and lost and  livelihoods when Pan Am went bankrupt and closed. Due to the federally  required retirement age of 60 at that time, and the airline industry's  seniority system, they were unable to get new pilot jobs with other  airlines. Two of these pilots reside in Maine--Ron Fitch of Poland  Spring and Schafer Bean of Diamond Cove--and I have heard their stories  and their pleas for justice on behalf of their own families and the  others who suffered as a result of Libya's acts of terrorism.   Mr. Fitch served nearly ten years in the Air Force and flew rescue  helicopters during the Vietnam War. Mr. Bean served in the Navy where  he was stationed at the former Brunswick Naval Air Station during the  1960's. Both of these veterans told me that lost their jobs, pensions,  health care, and savings as a result of the Pan Am bombing.   This group's initial lawsuit against Libya, which had been joined  with the families of those who died at  [[Page S2296]]  Lockerbie, was dismissed by the courts due to sovereign immunity.  Following the 2008 settlement agreement with Libya, the group of pilots  approached the State Department in 2009 seeking the necessary referral  to have their claims heard by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.  For more than four years the State Department failed to refer the  group's claims to the Commission, but following bipartisan letters to  then-Secretaries Clinton and Kerry signed by myself and more than 60  other members of Congress, the State Department finally referred the  claims in 2013.   After an initial denial of claims in a preliminary ruling by the  Commission in July 2016, the group of pilots was granted a hearing in  December 2016. So many of the pilots and their families attended the  hearing that it was moved to a U.S. District Court courtroom in  Washington, D.C. Three senior Pan Am executives testified at the  hearing, including the former Pan Am CEO, Thomas Plaskett; former Pan  Am Senior Vice President for Finance, Ramesh Punwani; and former Pan Am  Vice President of Strategic Planning, Peter Pappas. Each explained why  the Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent media coverage directly caused  the airline's collapse.   In January 2018, more than a year following that hearing, the  Commission ruled against the pilots. Using an undefined standard of  proof and applying international law, the Commission argued that Pan  Am's demise was not caused by the Lockerbie bombing, contrary to the  testimony of the former Pan Am executives themselves. The pilots'  referred claim was the very last of the Libya claims adjudicated by the  Commission, and the Libya settlement fund is now exhausted from the  claims it approved prior to the final adjudication of the pilots'  claims.   Mr. President, these terrorism victims were denied an opportunity to  even make their case for four years by the Department of State, and  when finally referred to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, they  were forced to wait another three years for a preliminary ruling and  another two years for a final decision, by which point the Commission  had already awarded claims that essentially exhausted the settlement  funds provided by Libya. That simply is not fair, and I believe these  Mainers and other Americans deserve a quick and fair process to  compensate them for their losses.   I urge my colleagues to join me in working toward justice for all of  the victims of the Lockerbie bombing perpetrated by Libya.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 1432. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to establish an  electric grid resilience grant program and an electric grid resilience  research and development program; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.
