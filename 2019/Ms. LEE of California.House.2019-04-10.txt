 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  1664, the Save the Internet Act, which just passed the House this  morning. This important bill would restore net neutrality by  reinstating FCC regulations that were repealed under the Trump  administration.   Now, let me be clear. Net neutrality protects America's access to  open, free, and fair internet. It also prevents internet companies from  blocking websites or slowing down their load time simply because they  disagree with what the website says.   Your ZIP Code, income, or geography should not determine the quality  of access to the internet that every American should have. That is why  this legislation is so important. It empowers the FCC to stop abusive  corporate practices online, promotes competition and innovation, and  supports broadband access and adoption for low-income communities.   Mr. Speaker, we need net neutrality because consumers, not service  providers, should control what you can access online. So it is time to  give power back to the people once and for all.   I am pleased that the House passed H.R. 1644 today, and I hope that  the Senate will take up this bill immediately.                            ____________________
