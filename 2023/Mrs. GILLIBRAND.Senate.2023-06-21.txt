 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am honored to stand in support of  Natasha Merle, whom I was proud to nominate for the U.S. District Court  for the Eastern District of New York.   Ms. Merle is a deeply experienced litigator. She has practiced at  virtually every level of the legal system, and she has litigated in  both State and Federal courts, handling both civil and criminal  matters.   Ms. Merle doesn't just have the experience and training necessary for  the Federal bench; she also brings a crucial and unique perspective as  a former public defender. If confirmed, she would not only be the  fourth Black woman on the district court but also the first person with  experience as a public defender to fill this role in nearly 30 years.   Ms. Merle has demonstrated fairness in the courtroom and will uphold  the rule of law as a judge. Nineteen senior lawyers from prominent  national and international law firms submitted a letter in support of  her confirmation. And I can tell you that her high ethical standards  and reputation for fairness will leave a powerful mark on our  communities and on the Eastern District of New York.   I hope she will receive a swift confirmation.   I yield the floor.
