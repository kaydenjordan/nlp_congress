 Mr. Speaker, Detroit is a city of firsts, likely the  site of the first urban freeway built in the U.S., where Henry Ford  manufactured his first car, and the birthplace of the U.S. auto  industry.  [[Page H293]]    Yes, this city bleeds authentic Americana and yearns for a  renaissance. However, my district is at a crossroads.   In the 13th Congressional District, businesses are beginning to hire  more people, which means more traffic on the roads and more people  using our public transportation system.   Metro Detroit was renowned for having one of the worst public  transportation networks of any large city in the Nation even before the  COVID-19 pandemic.   While others work from home, many jobs require in-person work. Public  transportation is still necessary, and demand might rise in the future.   I applaud the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  during the last Congress. Still, there needs to be a strong emphasis on  infrastructure goals.                            ____________________
