 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Mimi Walters, for her special order. It is a reminder  again that Vietnam has not lived up to the agreement they made in Paris  to end the Vietnam war.   They promised they would turn over remains. They promised they would  give lists of our POWs and MIAs. They lied. They didn't do that. They  still have that information.   In fact, there was one year I agreed with the national Chamber of  Commerce's position on most everything, but I disagreed on a trade  agreement with Vietnam because I could not vote to give some special  deal to people who will not honor their agreements that lie about  Americans dead and who were prisoners of war and missing in action and  remains of which they know and have never disclosed.   This is one more reminder that one thing we can do in this House is  show courage and say we are not dealing with countries, no special  deals at all, with countries that harm Americans. We need to protect  our own.   I am so glad that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are  calling attention to that fact, led by Congresswoman Walters. It is  important to remember.   I hope and pray that we will do the right thing here in the House. I  know the President has a heart for getting Americans back when they  have been improperly detained, or, in some cases, when they have been  properly detained, but especially if they are being mistreated. Vietnam  needs to wake up. And this House, the Senate, and the President need to  make abundantly clear to Vietnam that, economically, we are going to  come after you. You better let our people go.   I also want to address a matter tonight. Having been a former judge,  when I hear courageous judges stand up for the Constitution, or I read  opinions wherein courageous, intelligent judges have taken a stand for  the Constitution, it warms my heart. It inspires and encourages me.   I have heard many friends in the media who have given accolades to a  Virginia Federal judge named T.S. Ellis--not T.S. Eliot, but T.S.  Ellis--who is the judge who is handling the case involving Paul  Manafort.   This is from a May 4 article by Jeff Mordock. It says: ``A Virginia  Federal judge Friday blasted prosecutors from the Office of Special  Counsel Robert Mueller, demanding to know how decade-old bank and tax  fraud allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul  Manafort''--I think he was chair for about 100 days--``could relate to  Russian election interference,'' which, of course, is 2016.   ``'You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,' District  Judge T.S. Ellis said during a morning hearing. Judge Ellis said  prosecutors were interested in pressuring Mr. Manafort because he could  provide information that would lead to President Donald Trump's  `prosecution or impeachment.'   ``At times, Judge Ellis appeared frustrated and even lost his temper  with attorneys from Mr. Mueller's team. He grilled them on how  allegations against Mr. Manafort for activities''--the copy I have ends  there, but it says: ``'How does bank fraud in 2005 or 2006 have  anything to do with coordination with the Russian Government?' Judge  Ellis said. `What is really going on, it seems to me, is that this  indictment is to put pressure on Mr. Manafort, but in and of itself has  nothing to do with your appointment.'''   ``Judge Ellis appeared to agree with the defense, but did not issue  an immediate decision. He repeatedly barraged prosecutors about their  authority to pursue decade-old charges against Mr. Manafort. At one  point, Judge Ellis asked how the Manafort case differed from the FBI  raid on President Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. The Cohen matter was  referred by Mueller's team to prosecutors with the Southern District of  New York for investigation and possible prosecution. In contrast, the  Manafort case is being handled directly by Mr. Mueller's officer.   ``He then appeared to guess the prosecutor's answer, saying the Cohen  investigation did not `further our core effort to get Trump.'   ``Later, Judge Ellis summarized prosecutor Michael Dreeben's argument  as, `We said what this investigation was about, but we are not bound by  it, and we were lying.' He then looked at Mr. Dreeben and said, `C'mon  man,' referencing a catchphrase from ESPN's NFL pregame show.''   Further down: ``At issue in the memo is the definition of `arise.'  The order gives the special counsel the authority to investigate any  matters that `may arise directly from the investigation.' But  prosecutors admitted Friday that the Manafort probe had been ongoing by  the Department of Justice before Mr. Mueller was appointed special  counsel. Mr. Dreeben said the charges against Mr. Manafort came because  they had to `follow the money' to discover Mr. Manafort's financial  records and ties to Russia through his lobbying work in the Ukraine.  The comments provoked a sharp rebuke from Judge Ellis. `It didn't lead  to that,' he said of the Manafort charges and Russia probe. `It was  given to you by the Department of Justice.'''   Well, that sounds like a courageous judge, Judge T.S. Ellis. It  sounds like a judge who calls them as he sees them. But, as the saying  goes, where the rubber meets the road, his courage, his constitutional  conviction, took a back seat to convenience.   So he got accolades for calling out the Mueller investigation for  exactly  [[Page H7821]]  what it is. It is unconstitutional. Mueller has taken an investigation.  He was not appointed by the President. He was not appointed by the  Attorney General. He was picked by the same guy who was involved in the  Russia investigation of Russia's effort to get uranium. He hired  another lawyer named Weissmann who was involved in that investigation.  They have all kinds of ties together. They have all kinds of reasons to  cover for each other.   But the fact that Rosenstein is Deputy Attorney General, the fact  that he wrote a memo saying fire Comey and the President acts on that  memo and fires Comey based on Rosenstein's recommendation, or with his  recommendation, and then Rosenstein uses the President's action in  accordance with Rosenstein's memo to say that probably was obstructing  justice, we need a special counsel. Are you kidding me?   There has been a failure of justice and of the justice system.  Federal District Judge T.S. Ellis saw that, and he commented on it.  When he had the chance to use the Constitution and say enough already,  justice has run amok, and Paul Manafort, probably guilty of some of the  things charged here, if not all of them, but you are not the one  authorized to prosecute.   The DOJ already had this investigation. It did not arise because of  the special counsel. But the special counsel took it over, showing,  again, his lack of integrity, as well as that of Mr. Weissmann. They  had limitless, basically, authority given to them, which is  unconstitutional.   And Judge Ellis, in his opinion, where he ran away from his  courageous words in May, said, in part, in his opinion, ``The intended  purpose''--and he does a good account of the 1978 law creating special  counsels.   He said, ``The intended purpose of the 1978 act was to create a  mechanism for the investigation and prosecution of high-ranking  government officials.   ``In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1978  act despite substantial separation of powers challenges,'' which, by  the way, just because one Supreme Court says one thing, they are not  100 percent right all the time. That is why they reverse themselves  frequently.   But, as he pointed out, ``Congress reauthorized the 1978 act for the  final time in 1994. It is important to note that despite the fact that  Morrison''--the case that took this up--``was decided 7-1, Justice  Scalia's dissent presented a compelling and powerful argument against  the constitutionality of the 1978 act. Beginning with an eloquent  description of the Founders' motivations in enshrining separation of  powers principles in the Constitution, Justice Scalia's dissent went on  to describe the ways in which the 1978 act infringed upon executive  power.''   And this is from that dissent from Justice Scalia, a great man, a  funny guy, a great sense of humor, but brilliant intellect, and I miss  him very much. Justice Scalia said the independent counsel's  investigation was commenced, not necessarily because the President or  his authorized subordinates believe it is in the interest of the United  States, in the sense that it warrants the diversion of resources from  other efforts and is worth the cost in money and in possible damage to  other governmental interests, and not even, leaving aside those  normally considered factors, because the President or his authorized  subordinates necessarily believe that an investigation is likely to  unearth a violation worth prosecuting, but only because the Attorney  General cannot affirm, as Congress demands, that there are no  reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.                                time  2115    The decisions regarding the scope of that further investigation, its  duration, and, finally, whether or not prosecution should ensue are,  likewise, beyond the control of the President and his subordinates.   But he goes on, quoting Justice Scalia: ``If to describe this case is  not to decide it, the concept of a government of separate and  coordinate powers no longer has meaning'' because ``it is ultimately  irrelevant how much the statute reduces Presidential control.''   Of course, any impingement on Presidential control over the executive  branch was unconstitutional. Justice Scalia also noted significant  appointments clause problems with the `78 act, arguing the independent  counsel was not an inferior officer because neither the President nor  the Attorney General could remove the independent counsel.   Ultimately, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist and the other Justices  involved in the case were not of the same mind as Justice Scalia. The  Court ruled seven to one that the `78 act passed constitutional muster,  even though I would submit, parenthetically, it really didn't, but  including the appointments clause.   In 1999, through a bipartisan consensus, Congress agreed to allow the  `94 Reauthorization Act to expire. Lawmakers at that time concluded the  `94 Reauthorization was seriously flawed in several important respects,  as experience had shown.   Both Republicans and Democrats had come to the conclusion that, in  practice, the 1994 Reauthorization Act and its predecessors had become  more often a political weapon to be unleashed in the ongoing--indeed,  escalating--culture wars, than a tool for ferreting out and prosecuting  crimes ostensibly committed by high-ranking government officials.   Later, in `99, the DOJ, acting pursuant to distinct statutory  authority, promulgated regulations ``to replace the procedures set out  in the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994.''   Thus, to provide a special counsel with a large budget and tell him  or her to find crimes allows a special counsel to pursue his or her  targets without the usual time and budget constraints facing ordinary  prosecutors, encouraging substantial elements of the public to conclude  that the special counsel is being deployed as a political weapon.   Furthermore, although the regulations required the Attorney General  to provide a special counsel with a factual statement of the matters to  be investigated, notably missing from the regulation is any requirement  the Attorney General specify any particular crime or statutes that are  believed to have been violated.   He goes on in his opinion, I think, 31 pages, but he also comments,  given the investigation's focus--he is talking about Mueller's--on  President Trump's campaign, even a blind person can see that the true  target of the special counsel investigation was President Trump, not  the defendant.   Further, he says the wisdom of allowing all links between individuals  associated with President Trump's campaign and the Russian Government  to be subject to investigation, irrespective of how stale those  connections might be, is seriously in doubt.   Nevertheless, he says that the grant of investigatory authority is  written broadly and does capture the connections at issue in this case,  which Judge Ellison already talked about. It was too broad.   When you look at the people Mueller has hired, not content to have  hired what, 17 lawyers--two of them left recently, as I understand it-- he went looking for somebody else who hated Trump as much as he did and  Weissmann did and was successful. Apparently, the two who left didn't  hate the President as much as Mueller wanted them to, which is one of  the flaws in having someone so unaccountable--unaccountable because  they answer to a man who is in--well, it is an old word where I come  from--cahoots with Mueller, Weissmann, and the original Russia  investigation that let Russia end up with 20-plus percent of our  uranium, knowing they were acquiring it illegally.   The Obama council on foreign investments in the U.S. voted to let  them go, well, sure, because Mueller, Rosenstein, and Weissmann made  sure that their guy behind the scenes wasn't talking. They kept the  information quiet about Russia's illegal actions, and, gee, that ended  up leading to $145 million in contributions to the Clinton Foundation.  A lot of money changed hands. Pay to play, some people call it.   We know for certain that Hillary Clinton's private server was hacked,  and the fact that the current FBI Director, Director Wray, would allow  a statement to go out last week fraudulently deceptive says the FBI has  not cleaned itself up yet. Yes, there have been some people fired, some  people demoted, and some people moved over, but it is still  fraudulently deceptive and dishonoring the hard, honest work  [[Page H7822]]  of thousands and thousands of FBI agents across this country.   The intel community Inspector General and his investigators learned  that Hillary Clinton's private server was, in fact, 100 percent  certainty, hacked. It was reported by Richard Pollock.   I know who hacked, I know where the information went, and I can't  dispute what Richard Pollock wrote last week. He said that Chinese  intel were getting every one of Hillary Clinton's messages, including  some of our most sensitive classified information.   Now, I didn't remember the story from November 6 of 2016, but I saw  it recently, and it pointed out that Hillary Clinton was not only  exposing our Nation's secrets and those who worked secretly for our  Federal Government around the world; she was exposing people to extreme  danger and potential loss of life through her unsecured, illegal, and,  it turns out, criminal use of that server, not to mention the  obstruction of justice when she got a subpoena and had the information  sought destroyed.   But the good thing for her was that her friends controlled the  Justice Department. They hated Donald Trump, and they were going to do  everything they could to help her get elected. That is why I knew Peter  Strzok was lying when I asked him about the investigator of the intel  community, IG Frank Rucker, coming to him and Dean Chapelle and telling  them: We now know for certain China has hacked all of Hillary Clinton's  emails coming in and going out and gave them specifics.    We know Peter Strzok. We know from his texts from all he was doing,  he was doing everything he could to protect Hillary Clinton from  criminal prosecution and to help her defeat whoever the Republican  would be, and especially Donald Trump. So it was certainly a lie when  he says: Yeah, I remember Frank Rucker coming over and briefing; I  don't remember what he briefed about.   He does remember what he briefed about because, when he heard those  searing words that Hillary Clinton's server has been, for certain,  hacked, he knew there was a problem, and he covered it up.   It takes courage to clean up a dirty justice system, especially when  the dirt is at the very top. I was brokenhearted to read the words in  Judge Ellis' opinion, a man who is clearly very intelligent, stays on  top of the law, saw wrongdoing, saw impropriety, and I would compare  him--I am tempted to compare him, but I won't compare him to Pontius  Pilate because then some liberal would say: That means Gohmert is  saying Manafort is Jesus, and I certainly am never going to say that.   I know Jesus. Jesus is a friend of mine. He is my savior, and I can  promise you, Paul Manafort is no Jesus.   But the action of a judge saying ``I see a problem with your  prosecution here'' and then refusing to use the power within his  control to right the wrongdoing of a justice system, and in this case  the unconstitutionality, defies the judge's own words when he says:         Let us hope the people in charge of this prosecution,       including the special counsel and the Assistant Attorney       General, are such people.    Because just before, he had said:         The case is a reminder, ultimately, that our system of       checks and balances and limitations on each branch's powers,       although exquisitely designed, ultimately works only if       people of virtue, sensitivity, courage, not affected by the       winds of public opinion, choose to work within the confines       of the law.    Then he says:         Let us hope the people in charge of the prosecution,       including the special counsel and the Assistant Attorney       General, are such people.    I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, they are not.   The judge says:         Although this case shall continue.    That is heartbreaking. The former judge and Chief Justice, you want  people who are in judicial positions to have the courage to do the  right thing. These people in charge of a runaway prosecution are  attempting to commit a coup d'etat. They are engaged in a civil war to  take down a President, the origins of which operation were fraudulent  and were paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.   What has happened to the Department of Justice at the top and the FBI  at the top is heartbreaking to people who have spent their lives  dedicated to truth, justice, and our American constitution.   It turns out Judge Ellis--brilliant, knowing--intentionally walked  away from his responsibility and did not show himself to be a person of  virtue, sensitivity, and courage not affected by the winds of public  opinion. That is a tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, September 5, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
