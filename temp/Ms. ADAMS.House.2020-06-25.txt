 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  7120, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Enough is enough. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere. Too many of our neighbors have died at the hands of law  enforcement. Valuable people, beloved people, people who were siblings  and coworkers and parishioners, members of our communities, parents,  children, grandchildren are now hashtags. They are household names who  would have all traded that fame for just one more day, one more day  with their friends, their families and loved ones.   Across this country we have learned too many names, but not as many  people know their ages.   Walter Scott was 50. Tony McDade was 38. Alton Sterling was 37.  Philando Castile was 32. Sandra Bland was 28. Breonna Taylor was 26.  Botham Jean was 26. Freddie Gray was 25. Ahmaud Arbery was 25. Stephon  Clark was 22. Michael Brown was 18. Laquan McDonald was 17. Tamir Rice  was 12. Aiyana Stanley-Jones was just 7.   In Mecklenburg County in my district, we have too many names, over 50  since the year 2000, people of every race and background. Keith Lamont  Scott was 43. Reuben Galindo was 29. Danquirs Franklin was 27. Clay  McCall was 26. Jonathan Ferrell was 24. Darryl Turner was 17. Laquan  Brown was 16.   Since January 1, 2015, at least 155 people have been shot and killed  by police in my home State of North Carolina, and at least 5,428 people  have been shot and killed by police across the United States.   David McAtee, 53, was killed by the Kentucky National Guard while  protesting these injustices. Eric Garner, 43, and George Floyd, 46,  were put in chokeholds. They begged they couldn't breathe.   Imagine how many of these killings didn't have to happen. Imagine how  many years of life we could give back to these men, women, and  children. Imagine what God will say to us on judgment day if we fail to  act.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a first step to righting  these wrongs. Importantly, the bill bans chokeholds so that a death  like George Floyd's or Eric Garner's never has to happen again.   Additionally, it will force police departments nationwide to  reexamine the use of chemical agents like tear gas, bringing us closer  to a day when protestors exercising their constitutional right won't  choke, both figuratively and literally, on injustice.   It was a tragedy that George Floyd will, in the words of Roxie  Washington, never get to walk his daughter down the aisle. But like  their 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said, ``Daddy changed the world.''   So let's do right by Gianna. Let's make good on her promise of  change, and let's pass the Justice in Policing Act. Let's pass it  today.                            ____________________
