 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy  heart to remember former Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming.   Senator Enzi was an exemplary statesman. Whether promoting a  responsible budget as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee or  fighting for Wyoming's energy sector, he was always putting Wyomingites  first.   He was a dedicated public servant, having served two terms as mayor  of Gillette, time in the Wyoming legislature, and four terms in the  Senate.   Senator Enzi was a problem solver, always willing to work with others  to get the job done. In his 24 years on Capitol Hill, he had more than  100 of his bills signed into law by four different U.S. Presidents.   He was a man of great faith and greater compassion. His kindhearted  ways made an impact on every individual he met.   I had the privilege of traveling with Senator Enzi, a brother Eagle  Scout, to numerous National Scout Jamborees.   Senator Enzi lived his life staying true to the Scouting principles  of duty to God, duty to country, and service to others. He will be  deeply missed.   My heartfelt sympathies go to Diana, the Enzi family, and his  friends.                            ____________________
