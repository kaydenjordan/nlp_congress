 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of one of Arkansas' great coaching legends, Mr. Charles Ripley, who  passed away this week at the age of 74.   In his 27-year tenure at the Little Rock School District, Coach  Ripley led the Parkview Patriots to five boys State basketball titles  and an overall record of 487-152.   In 1995, Coach Ripley was hired as the head basketball coach of  Westark Community College in Fort Smith and then returned to Little  Rock to serve as the athletic director and men's basketball coach at  Arkansas Baptist College.   Coach Rip is a real hero to so many in our community and is in the  Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame.   The Arkansas Baptist College Foundation has established the Rip It  Scholarship Fund to fund and honor his long-time efforts to fund and  assist student-athletes at Arkansas Baptist College.   I join all Arkansans in honoring this remarkable life.   Madam Speaker, I also want to say that I congratulate the House on  concurring with the Senate on extending the PPP program date until  August 8. This will help small businesses all over our country.                            ____________________
