 Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise to  recognize former Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon as we reflect on the  20-year anniversary of his passing.   The O'Bannon family and the Mrvan family have had great partnerships  over the decades. My father was a State legislator for over 40 years  and partnered on countless occasions to take positive and impactful  action for the people of Indiana as Frank O'Bannon served in the  General Assembly and as Governor.   I remain grateful for the example they have provided in how to work  together with members on both sides of the aisle and with all levels of  government to find common ground and achieve success.   In particular, I appreciate their priority to improve educational  opportunities and affordable healthcare options for all members of our  community.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the service of Governor  O'Bannon to Indiana, our Nation, and let us keep in mind his commitment  to public service and solving problems as we move forward with  addressing the issues of today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
