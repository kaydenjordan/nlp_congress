 Madam Speaker, the dedication of the World War II  Memorial in 2004 on our National Mall culminated a 17-year effort in  Congress to construct the first national memorial dedicated to the 16  million Americans who served in the Armed Forces during World War II  and the more than 400,000 who gave their lives. It honors the 20th  century's greatest accomplishment, the victory of liberty over tyranny.   As the Representative who introduced the original legislation to  construct the memorial, I rise tonight in support of the National World  War II Commemorative Coin Act.   This bipartisan piece of legislation, which I am honored to introduce  alongside my friend and colleague Representative Peter King from New  York, authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of  the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.  [[Page H8140]]    The coin will serve as an important emblem of the spirit, sacrifice,  and commitment of the brave Americans who fought to defend our great  Nation and its democratic allies and to advance peace and freedom  throughout the world.   I ask all of my colleagues to look at our bill, and I urge them to  support this legislation.                            ____________________
