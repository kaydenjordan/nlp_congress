 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mr. James Blackburn, who passed away on January 22 at the age  of 94.   Mr. Blackburn dedicated his life to practicing law and using his  craft to make the Savannah area a better place to live. He was sworn in  to the bar over 70 years ago and worked as the city attorney for the  city of Savannah until he was 86. He even continued to legally  represent the Savannah Airport Commission until just last year, when he  was 93 years old.   But his service to the public went much further than the law. He  served in the United States Navy during World War II as a radarman on a  tugboat, was a recorder with the Alee Shrine, and was a former  president of the Kiwanis Club of Savannah. Through all of his work, he  believed in treating all people with fairness, dignity, and compassion.   His family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________
