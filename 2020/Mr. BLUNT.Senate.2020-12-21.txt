 Mr. President, pursuant to Senate rule XXXIII, I wish to  inform all Senators that on December 18, 2020, the Committee on Rules  and Administration adopted the ``U.S. Senate Alternate Vehicle Parking  Regulations,'' which supersede and replace the current ``Regulations  Governing Use of Bicycle Racks Hart Office Building Garage.''   The updated regulations describe the eligibility and process Senators  and eligible staff use to request, register, and obtain parking permits  for alternate vehicles. The proposed regulations also expand the use of  the garage parking racks beyond bicycles to include newer commuting  technology such as electric scooters.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the  regulations as adopted be printed in the Record.
