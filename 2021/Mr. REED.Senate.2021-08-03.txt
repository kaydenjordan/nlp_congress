 Madam President, on behalf of Senator Inhofe and myself, as  the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  we rise to commemorate and celebrate the Office of Naval Research and  its contributions to our Sea Services, national defense, and the  advancement of scientific and technological discovery on the occasion  of its 75th anniversary.   World War II underscored how science and technology could determine  winners and losers on the battlefield. In the aftermath of the war,  Congress established the Office of Naval Research on August 1, 1946, to  ``plan, foster, and encourage scientific research in recognition of its  paramount importance as related to the maintenance of future naval  power, and the preservation of national security.''   Since then, the Office of Naval Research has been at the forefront of  groundbreaking research that has resulted in lasting military supremacy  not only on and in the seas, but also in the skies, on land, and in  space. Its model of effective collaboration between military,  government, academic, and industry entities also paved the way for  further technological advancement, recreated not only in the other  military services but also through National Science Foundation and  DARPA. Put simply, its impact is seen and felt not only in our Armed  Forces, but in the lives of all Americans.   In its earliest days, the Office of Naval Research pioneered key  fields of computing and directed energy. The office brought humans to  the highest heights and the deepest depths, and its work led to some of  the most consequential technological advancements of the 20th century,  including: the laser; Project Whirlwind, one of the first digital  computers; the first autonomous robot; and the atomic clock, which made  precision satellite navigation possible. The invention of virtually  every important sensor and undersea vehicle that has allowed us to  explore and better understand our vast oceans is a result of the  stewardship of the Office of Naval Research.   Moreover, nearly every platform used by the Navy and Marine Corps  relies in some way on technology developed or advanced by the Office of  Naval Research. From lifesaving medical advances such as QuikClot, to  more lethal and effective ships and weapons, the Office of Naval  Research has changed the way we fight and win wars. The Office of Naval  Research will continue to shape the future as well; its programs are  continuously advancing the fields of artificial intelligence,  autonomous weaponry, networking, directed energy, warfighter  performance, maritime awareness, and next-generation power.   We are proud to honor the achievements of the Office of Naval  Research, and we hope the Members of the Senate will join us in  recognizing the incredible innovation and scientific leadership this  distinguished organization has provided not only to our sailors,  marines, soldiers, airmen, and guardians, but also to the American  people over the past 75 years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators .
