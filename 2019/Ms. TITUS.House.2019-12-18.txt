 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my statement  supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump.   For 35 years I taught American government to university students.   When we discussed impeachment, I never thought I'd actually be  participating in the process, but this president has left us no choice.   He tried to rig the 2020 elections by soliciting foreign  interference, and then engaged in an unprecedented cover-up once he got  caught.   No president can be permitted to abuse the power of the office for  personal, political gain, nor try to hide his misdeeds by demanding  that his subordinates withhold key documents and refuse to testify  before Congress.   President Trump's allies have offered lots of crazy excuses for why  he shouldn't be impeached, but even they will not deny that he wouldn't  have asked Ukraine to investigate Biden if the former Vice President  weren't a leading candidate for president.   I have analyzed the evidence thoroughly. It is consistent and  convincing. That is why I am casting my vote to impeach President  Trump.
