 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise because too often in our  schools the sounds of students talking and lockers clanking in hallways  are giving way to silence and violence.   Today, I rise because desks that should be covered in gum are too  often covered in blood, the blood of students and their teachers.   Today, I rise because three 9-year-old children and three adults are  dead in Tennessee, as well as the person who killed them.   Tennessee State representatives Justin Jones, Justin Pearson, and  Gloria Johnson wanted to bring attention to this tragedy. They wanted  to honor the victims of the mass shooting at The Covenant School with  action instead of insulting their memories with silence. From the floor  of the Tennessee House, they led the public gallery in chants of ``no  more silence,'' ``we have to do better,'' and ``gun reform now.''   Tennessee Republicans were so afraid of this message that they  expelled Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, the two Black  representatives, for their actions.   These two courageous young men knew, as we do, that we cannot wait to  be saved from the gun epidemic. They knew there would be more dead.   Unfortunately, since the mass shooting in Nashville on March 27, over  900 additional people were killed by gun violence in our country, 22 in  Tennessee alone.   It really makes me sick. It makes me livid that we continue to accept  the status quo and that we are comfortable living in a country where at  any time our friends, our families, our neighbors, even our children  and our grandchildren, can die a horrible death because they were in  the wrong place at the wrong time when the wrong person had a gun.   We will be judged if we don't act, not only by history, not only by  our God, but by our children who will inherit our country with this  metastasized gun cancer still attached.   I am a Christian. As someone who knows and reads and lives Scripture,  I can tell you beyond a doubt that the AR-15, the assault rifle, is the  golden calf of Washington, D.C. Too many people in the people's House  worship this idol and treat it with reverence. However, just like in  Scripture, if we continue to worship this idol, the result will be  physical and spiritual death.   I stand with representatives Justin Pearson and Justin Jones in  saying: No more silence. We have to do better. Gun reform now. No more  silence. We have to do better. Gun reform now.                            ____________________
