 Mr. President, we are in the midst of quite a  productive week in the Senate. Yesterday, this body did its part in  fulfilling an important promise to our Nation's veterans. We passed the  VA MISSION Act by a wide, bipartisan margin.   Having already passed the House, this truly landmark bill will now  head to the White House where the President will soon sign it into law.   It will bring more options and greater flexibility to veterans who  have spent years driving long distances to the nearest VA care  facility, only to face long lines and waiting lists when they got  there.   It will bring more peace of mind for veterans of all eras and their  families who have faced uncertainty and limitations as their needs for  care have evolved.   This legislation continues, expands, and improves the successful  Veterans Choice Program that has already helped millions of veterans  nationwide, including more than 23,000 Kentuckians last year alone.   Thanks to the stalwart leadership of Chairman Isakson and the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, the hard-and-fast time and distance  thresholds that kept too many veterans out of the Choice Program will  soon be gone.   The providers we trust to provide top-notch care for our heroes will  have clearer guidelines for prescribing opioids and more tools to  attract and retain experienced professionals.   I have heard from Kentucky veterans exactly what this bill will mean  to them. One wrote: ``Kentucky disabled veterans greatly appreciate  Congress is finally taking action to correct deficiencies in the  Caregiver Program.''   Another explained that the legislation ``strikes the right balance to  make sure we strengthen the VA system and provide veterans with the  best care possible.''   I thank my friend Chairman Isakson once more on this achievement. I  am proud the Senate stepped up to the plate and showed America's  veterans that, on our watch, a promise made is a promise kept.   What is more, we have already confirmed two executive branch nominees  and will process two more before the end of the week. First up is  Jelena McWilliams, President Trump's well-  [[Page S2890]]  qualified pick to chair the FDIC Board of Directors.   This week, we have also seen an impressive proposal to reform the way  Congress handles workplace claims, especially claims of harassment. The  Democratic leader and I strongly support this proposal, as do our  colleagues Senator Blunt and Senator Klobuchar.   All this comes in addition to two major Senate-passed bills that  passed the House this week and are now heading to the President's desk  to become law: the legislation championed by our colleague Senator  Johnson, which will give terminally ill patients the right to try  experimental drugs that are still making their way through the full FDA  approval process, and the mainstreaming of Dodd-Frank regulations for  small lenders and community banks, thanks to the leadership of Senator  Crapo. This legislation will help secure access to credit for middle- class families and small businesses, and the President will sign it  just a few hours from now.   There is also important activity underway at the committee level.  Chairman Barrasso is leading the Environment and Public Works Committee  through consideration of measures to improve and expand America's  waterways infrastructure. Chairman Shelby and the Appropriations  Committee today have already begun their work on the annual funding  bills. Following the committee's robust discussions, I look forward to  bringing the appropriations bills they craft to the Senate floor.  Earlier this week, the Armed Services Committee began considering this  year's Defense authorization bill. They have a solid foundation on  which to build, thanks to the historic agreement reached earlier this  year that delivered the highest year-on-year increase in funding for  our Armed Forces in 15 years.   One bill after another, one confirmation after another, the Senate  continues to produce major accomplishments that will directly improve  the lives of the American people.
