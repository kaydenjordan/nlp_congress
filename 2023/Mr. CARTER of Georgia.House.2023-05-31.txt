 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Cleve Fountain who was involved in his community with a deep commitment  to public service.   Early on in his life, he was a member of the YMCA and the Boy Scouts  of America. He joined the U.S. Army at age 15 and served in the Pacific  theater during World War II and finished his service with the rank of  second lieutenant.   He moved to Port Wentworth, Georgia, my hometown. He owned Fountain  Funeral Home and Westview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. He was our  mayor. He was our county commissioner.   In 1988, I set out to achieve a goal of mine and that was to own my  own business. I went to two banks. Both of them turned me down. I went  to the third bank. They gave me the loan.   They gave me the loan because Cleve Fountain called and told them  that I was a fine young man and that I came from a good family.   Mr. Speaker, in our lives there are people and places we remember. I  will always remember Cleve Fountain for what he did for me and what he  did for my family.                            ____________________
