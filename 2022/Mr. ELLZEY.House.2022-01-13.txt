 Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize an outstanding  constituent of Texas 6, Battalion Chief David Maeker, who has dutifully  served the people of Waxahachie for the past 26 years.   David was Battalion Chief in 2018 but was leading in and out of the  fire station well before that. Throughout his career, he has set the  tone for what it means to be a good leader.   I am incredibly proud to announce that Chief Maeker was named  Firefighter of the Year for Waxahachie in 2021, an outstanding honor  for which he deserves to be recognized.   David also helps his community. He has done so by starting a  nonprofit called Compassion for the Fatherless, which works with an  orphanage overseas in fulfilling the needs of children by providing  them with a strong foundation to be successful in life.   David, you truly lead by example. I, and the citizens of Waxahachie,  thank you for your incredible service and leadership in our community  and to those who need it most.   Congratulations on the well-deserved honor.                            ____________________
