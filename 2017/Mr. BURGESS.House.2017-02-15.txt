 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 123 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 123         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 43) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule       submitted by Secretary of Health and Human Services relating       to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients       in selecting subrecipients. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the       Minority Leader or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 69) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule       of the Department of the Interior relating to ``Non-      Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and       Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska''.       All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.  On any legislative day during the period from       February 17, 2017, through February 24, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 4.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 3 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 123 provides for a rule to  consider two Congressional Review Act resolutions which will undo  burdensome and harmful regulations put into place by the Obama  administration during the final hours of his Presidency. The rule  brings before the House these resolutions so that Congress may remove,  through the proper legislative process, rules promulgated by  bureaucrats who remain unaccountable to the American people. This  process allows those who are accountable--the elected Representatives  in the Congress--to fight for their constituents' rights and liberties.   House Resolution 123 provides for a closed rule for each of the  Congressional Review Act resolutions, both H.J. Res. 43 and H.J. Res.  69, the standard procedure for such resolutions, since the sole purpose  of each is to remove a harmful regulation from the Federal Register.   The rule allows for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the  majority and the minority leader or their designees, for H.J. Res. 43,  and 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the Chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for H.J. Res. 69. On each  resolution contained in the rule, the minority is afforded the  customary motion to recommit.   H.J. Res. 43 is a joint resolution which would repeal the Obama  administration's midnight rule that takes away States' ability to  direct funding within their own borders to certain healthcare providers  that conform to the States' values.   In her final days in office, Secretary Mathews Burwell pushed forward  a rule that would require States to fund, with public dollars,  facilities that perform abortions, potentially against the will of the  people of that given State. This flies in the face of the 10th  Amendment which grants to States the authority to make such decisions  within their borders and to prioritize which healthcare providers  should receive funding based on the greatest need in their own  communities.   Those of us who care about the carefully crafted Federal system which  our Founding Fathers set up, which allows different States to operate  differently based upon their own values and priorities, recognize the  Obama rule for what it is: a power grab by the Federal Government. This  is why the House will take up this resolution today--to continue to  fight for states' rights--and will repeal this burdensome regulation  that ties the hands of every State legislature and ties the hands of  every Governor in the Nation.   H.J. Res. 69 is a Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal an  overreaching regulation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  which usurps Alaska's ability to manage its own lands within its own  borders. Federal law has long recognized that Alaska--that Alaska--and  her elected officials are in the best position to make the decisions on  what actions to permit on the public lands in that State, whether those  lands are Federal, State, or private.   Despite this long precedent, codified by Congress in the Alaska  National Interest Land Conservation Act, the Obama administration moved  forward in its waning days with a rule that imposes Federal  restrictions on lands that have been, up until the end of the Obama  administration, successfully regulated by the State of Alaska. Like  H.J. Res. 43, this resolution recognizes the important 10th Amendment  protections put in place by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution  which protects states' rights to govern within their own borders.  [[Page H1194]]    The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining  accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more  apparent than over the past few weeks where this Congress has needed to  step in and remove burdensome and unbalanced regulations put in place  by President Obama and his team just as they were walking out the door.   House Republicans today will stand up for the rights of our  constituents against an out-of-control Federal bureaucracy. I urge my  colleagues to support today's rule and the two underlying Congressional  Review Act resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to point out that H.J. Res. 43 would repeal  the Obama administration's rule and allow States to enjoy the freedom  and flexibility to distribute title X grant money in a way that serves  the needs of their constituents.   Just in the way of background, December 16, 2016, the Obama  administration finalized a rule that prevents States from eliminating  abortion providers from title X grant distributions. Title X is a  family planning program authorized in 1970, and was intended to provide  family planning services to low-income women. The Obama rule was widely  perceived as an attempt by the Obama administration to require States  to fund Planned Parenthood, the Nation's largest abortion business.   Prior to the Obama administration's rule, States were free to direct  their title X funds to healthcare providers that did not participate in  abortion. When States had this freedom, they were able to choose to  invest in women's health care instead of investing in Big Abortion.   States should be able to choose to prioritize family planning funds  to health clinics that offer a full range of healthcare services,  including family planning, but do not participate in abortion.   States can fully support family planning and other health services  without funding abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Planned  Parenthood only comprises 13 percent of approximately 4,100 title X  service sites.   Redirecting funds away from abortion providers does not reduce funds  for the title X program. When States set criteria that eliminates  abortion providers from title X distributions, those funds are then  directed to other clinics.   Eighty-seven percent of current title X service sites are comprised  of local health departments, local hospitals, and Federally qualified  health centers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I reference a letter that was sent to Speaker Paul Ryan  and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy by a number of sports-related  organizations.   They say: ``We write representing organizations that collectively  include millions of wildlife conservationists . . . wildlife  enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists, in strong support of H.J. Res. 49  from Cong. Young of Alaska. . . . Our community exhausted all Executive  Branch appeals and remedies urging the FWS to slow down the Proposed  Rule, and revise it to reflect a proposal mutually agreed to by the  State of Alaska and the FWS; all to no end. It is time for Congress to  nullify this final rule.''   They go on to say: ``This final rule boldly preempts the authority of  the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both  recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority of the  state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska  National Interests Land Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife  Refuge System Improvement Act. The FWS final rule was premised on a  meeting as a priority the FWS policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity  and Environmental Health. . . . Many members of our organizations enjoy  Alaska's bounty of fish and wildlife resources and their habitats for  unrivaled hunting, fishing and outdoor experiences. The sustainable  management of these natural resources needs to be led by the State  working in cooperation with the FWS. We urge that you favorably  consider H.J. Res. 49 which will restore the jurisdictional state- federal relationship as Congress has previously directed.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter written to  the Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell signed by 110 Members of the House  and Senate to express strong opposition to the Department of Health and  Human Services' September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled  ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in  Selecting Subrecipients.''                                  Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2016.      Hon. Sylvia Mathews Burwell,      Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Burwell, We write to express our strong       opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS) September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled       ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients       in Selecting Subrecipients.'' Although we appreciate the       Department's intent to follow proper regulatory procedure       pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, HHS's purpose       for engaging in the rulemaking appears on its face to be an       attempt to subvert the will of elected representatives.        Moreover, apart from the Department's impetus for the       notice of proposed rulemaking, we also question whether the       Department's stated rationale adequately supports its       conclusion that providers with a reproductive health focus       are more ``effective'' than other health providers that offer       comprehensive care for women and men. Nowhere in the proposed       notice of rulemaking does HHS clearly define what it means to       provide Title X services in an ``effective'' manner. It does       appear to assert that a number of factors--such as the range       of contraceptive methods on-site, the number of clients in       need of publicly funded family planning services served, and       the availability of preconception care--distinguish providers       with a reproductive health focus as more ``effective'' and       ``high quality'' than other types of providers. However, that       list of factors falls far short of all of the attributes and       recommendations included in the Centers for Disease Control       and Office of Population Affairs report entitled ``Providing       Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and       the US Office of Population Affairs.''        To further complicate the argument about quality and       effectiveness, the data cited in the notice of proposed       rulemaking is not adequate for determining patient outcomes.       The Department relies heavily on utilization and demographic       statistics, but appears to lack hard data regarding actual       patient outcomes and need, as the Department does not require       grantees to track patients or verify their income. As you       know, the issue of inadequate data has previously been raised       by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), after the HHS Office of       Family Planning in 2007 asked IOM to provide a critical       review of the Title X Family Planning Program. In addition to       finding ``no clear, evidence-based process for establishing       or revising program priorities and guidelines,'' IOM stated       the following in its May 2009 Report Brief:        ``The committee concludes that the program does not collect       all the data needed to monitor and evaluate its impact.       Therefore, the committee proposes a comprehensive framework       to evaluate the program and assess how well clinics meet the       family planning needs of the program's clients. The committee       concludes that additional data will be needed in the areas of       client needs, structure, process, and outcomes in order to       assess the program's overall progress.''        We welcome evidence that this recommendation has been fully       adopted, but are unaware of any clear evidence confirming       that to be the case. If HHS cannot clearly define an       ``effective'' or ``high quality'' provider, it is unclear to       us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so       in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also       therefore unclear how HHS will be able to accurately       determine in every case whether state or local project       recipients--who are generally closer to and more familiar       with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical       region--have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating       subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the       federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for       that of state or local governments--particularly when the       criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that       judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts.        Finally, if HHS is going to assert the authority to adapt       its rules in order to address changing circumstances, we       implore HHS to consider the recent general shift in health       care policy toward comprehensive care. As HHS states on its       website, in addition to assisting individuals and couples in       planning and spacing births, part of the mission of Title X       is to contribute to ``improved health for women and       infants.'' HHS's suggestion that subrecipients like federally       qualified health centers--which provide greater preventive       and primary health care services than providers with a       reproductive health focus--are per se less ``effective'' than       providers with a reproductive health focus does not comport       with that stated mission.        We urge HHS to reconsider this overreaching and ill-      supported rule. We will continue to closely monitor this       proposed rulemaking, and intend to submit this letter as a       formal comment. We look forward to a detailed response from       your Department.            Sincerely,      Joni K. Ernst,        United States Senator.      Diane Black,        United States Congressman.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of two  critical Congressional Review Act resolutions to repeal burdensome  Federal regulations dropped on the doorstep of the American people in  the waning hours of the Obama administration. The rules the House will  be voting to repeal today would infringe upon states' rights to govern  themselves within their own borders and would impose new Federal  requirements and oversight in contravention of the 10th Amendment. This  is why removing these regulations is critical. It is critical to  maintaining the proper State-Federal balance that our Founding Fathers  so carefully crafted in our Constitution.   I thank Representative Diane Black and Representative Don Young for  their work on these pieces of legislation to protect states' rights. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the two  underlying resolutions.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 123 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the  [[Page H1199]]       Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own       manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to amend the       rule because the majority Member controlling the time will       not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same       result may be achieved by voting down the previous question       on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question       is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led       the opposition to ordering the previous question. That       Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an       amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
