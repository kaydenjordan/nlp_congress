 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the amazing  life and, as The New York Times put it, the outsized career of Richard  Ravitch, who passed away 2 weeks ago.   A lawyer, a builder, a public servant extraordinaire, Lieutenant  Governor of New York, he ran the subway system. The Times' obituary  labeled Dick ``the rescuer of New York.'' As someone who had a chance  to work with him, I can attest he was that and much, much more.   He was a tireless student of government. He sought to understand its  inner workings, and he would be quick to share his insights with  others. His was a strong voice for thoughtful, sound, creative policy.   Those skills are what enabled him to work to rescue the subway in a  dire time in New York, to improve municipal finance in that city,  unscramble New York State finances, and help Detroit and Puerto Rico  navigate bankruptcy.   He was a respected, successful businessman; pioneered integrated  public housing. He was an adviser to organized labor, involved with  Major League Baseball, and, along with his friend, Paul Volcker, an  outspoken advocate for public finance and sound State and local  budgeting.    Well into his eighties, he was still teaching at Yale Law School. He  seemed to know everyone and have a story or two that involved each. He  displayed a vast memory and boundless energy.   He was a practitioner of the political arts at the highest level. He  spent his final months keenly focused on the upcoming election for  Congress. He invested untold hours and significant resources helping  men and women make their way politically. Dick was a proud member of  the governing wing of the Democratic Party.   He never ceased to amaze me with the breadth of his interest,  expertise, and skill. He was a master woodworker, and his Central Park  apartment was filled with amazing pieces that he had crafted.   Dick took great pride in his family, his sons, Michael and Joey. His  marriage to Kathy Doyle brought three stepdaughters into the family.  There were 13 grandchildren, a tremendous source of pride and joy to  Dick.   I was lucky to call him a friend and mentor. His biography, ``So Much  to Do'' should be required reading for everyone who would be a public  servant, an elected official, indeed, anyone who takes their  citizenship seriously.   Even though it was written a decade ago, anyone who cares about  government and the civic fabric has much to learn from Dick's life  story and his many accomplishments.   I, along with countless others, benefited immensely from Dick's  friendship, mentorship, and wisdom. His passing is a significant loss  to New York City, New York State, and, I would say, for the country.   But his life, indeed, was a blessing. The lessons he left us and the  leaders he helped shape will carry on his legacy for generations to  come.                            ____________________
