 Madam President, as the deadline for Britain's withdrawal  from the European Union fast approaches, there is an enormous  opportunity before us--an opportunity for free trade with the United  Kingdom. Such an agreement would provide tremendous economic and trade  benefits to both nations and would strengthen and preserve our special  relationship.   As this deadline approaches, the United States should stand ready and  willing to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Britain, which is the  purpose of the resolution before us today. This resolution simply  declares that it is the sense of the Senate that, one, the United  States has and should have a close and special relationship--one that  is mutually beneficial as a trade partnership and otherwise--with the  United Kingdom and that that relationship should continue without  interruption; and two, that the President, with the support of  Congress, should lay the groundwork for a future trade agreement with  the UK.   Some of my colleagues have raised objections to it. Some have  objected, for example, that this resolution didn't go through the  Senate Finance Committee. First, it is important to point out here that  the vast majority of resolutions expressing a sense of the Senate  normally don't go through the committee process at all. Second, a  straightforward assertion of friendship, of support, and of economic  partnership with one of our oldest and closest allies is not by its  nature and should never be controversial.   Others have claimed that the point of this measure is somehow to  lambast the EU. This misses the point entirely, which is simply to  preserve a unique and important alliance and promote America's economic  interests.   Others have said that by encouraging a free-trade agreement with  Britain, we would be ``picking sides'' or somehow affirming Brexit.  Significantly, however, this resolution says precisely nothing about  whether Brexit should or should not happen. That decision is up to the  British people. But it is up to us to decide whether to stand with  Britain--the nation that has been one of our greatest partners, not  only in trade but also in the fight for freedom, peace, and prosperity  throughout the world. We should stand with the UK and strengthen this  special partnership by supporting this resolution today.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the consideration of S. Res. 137, submitted earlier today. I further  ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, this isn't complicated. All we are trying  to do here is to say that the United States has and probably should  have without interruption an ongoing, special, vitally important trade  relationship with the United Kingdom and that the President and the  Congress of the United States should work toward an agreement to that  end.   That isn't rocket science. It is not complicated. It is not even in  itself a framework for a specific statute or for a specific trade bill.  It is laying out a very broad principle--one that I would hope every  one of us would accept and would embrace.   We have to remember that one of the reasons we are a country, one of  the reasons we don't fly the Union Jack or sing ``God Save the Queen,''  one of the reasons we declared independence nearly two and a half  centuries ago has a lot to do with the fact that, as Americans, we  understand that what we need access to is not so much proximity to  government, proximity to the Crown, as proximity to other people. It is  how human thriving occurs. It is how the human condition is able to be  elevated. It is a free market system that has elevated more people out  of poverty than any government program ever has, ever could, or ever  will.   Yes, what we need is access to markets. That is part of what prompted  the American Revolution, the fact that our merchants, our  manufacturers, and our farmers were being excluded from markets and  were being discriminated against by the Crown. We understood that would  necessarily limit economic mobility within the country and was  artificially holding us back. That is why we became our own country.  That has a lot to do with why we declared independence.   Over time, we have benefited substantially from free markets, from  free trade. We have seen the greatest economy--in fact, the greatest  civilization the world has ever known--in the United States of America.  That occurred not because of a government; it is not a result of who we  are; it is a consequence of what we do, the decisions we have made. A  lot of those decisions have been based on free markets.   With respect to my distinguished colleague, my friend, the Senator  from Oregon--with respect to his suggestion that this is somehow  weighing in on the merits of a political cause that he might not like  in another country, that is really not our business, and this  resolution is completely agnostic on that point. This resolution  doesn't require us to hold hands with Great Britain. This resolution  doesn't require us to say that the United Kingdom can do no wrong. This  is not a bill calling for us to make America Great Britain again. No.  This is here only to protect and promote free trade because free trade  makes us free. Free trade makes us prosperous. We should not walk  [[Page S2180]]  away from one of the greatest trade partnerships we have on this  planet.   Thank you.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate recess  from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. today.
