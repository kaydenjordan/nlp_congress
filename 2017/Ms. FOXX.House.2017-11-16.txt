 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Bible  Week.   For thousands of years, the Bible has been a source of guidance and  strength for humanity. During times of turmoil and confusion, I can  think of no more important source of comfort than the wisdom provided  in the Good Book.   The Bible serves as a profound influence in my life, as well as  others in this Chamber. Many of us gather weekly for prayer breakfasts  and Bible study.   The Bible offers us hope when circumstances are dire and is a source  of strength when human frailty brings us low. As we read in the Gospel  of Matthew: ``Come unto me, all ye that labor under heavy laden, and I  will give you rest.''   Next week, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, my prayer is that it will be  a time of healing and unity for all. As we reflect on the blessings God  has provided, I hope we will also celebrate the gift God provides us  daily through His holy word                            ____________________
