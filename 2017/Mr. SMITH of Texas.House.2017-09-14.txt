 Mr. Speaker, here are recent examples of the  liberal national media's ignoring inconvenient news:   The economy grew by 3 percent last quarter, the fastest pace in  years, but you might not know this good news because of the media  blackout of the story by broadcast networks.   The media blackout extended to a story by The New York Times on a  current Senator's corruption trial, which failed to mention he was a  Democrat in a 1,200-word story.   The media hyped the claim that climate change was responsible for  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but the media blacked out the fact that the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that hurricanes are not  increasing in intensity or frequency.   This is what the liberal media do: they ignore the facts that  contradict  [[Page H7387]]  the liberal view they want to promote with their readers and viewers.                            ____________________
