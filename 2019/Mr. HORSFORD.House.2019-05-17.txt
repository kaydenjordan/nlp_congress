 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of  Nevada Assemblyman Tyrone Thompson, who recently passed.   Tyrone's passion for service and community was reinforced by action.  He was constantly on the front lines advocating for children in family  court as a CASA advocate. Through his life-coaching and mentoring  efforts, he spearheaded the annual Clark County Summer Business  Institute, providing summer college and career exploration for high  school students.   When Tyrone had the opportunity to be appointed and then elected to  the Nevada Assembly in District 17, he made it his mission to propose  new ideas to move Nevada forward and bring an experienced and pragmatic  voice to the challenges our State faces. He became a leader and  champion for increased funding, for more equitable education for all  students, and for making our schools and communities safe from gun  violence.   Tyrone was always present, leading the way to make the North Las  Vegas community and the people in it stronger, whether it was working  tirelessly to improve education, addressing racial equity and  inclusion, volunteering with Camp Anytown, supporting Project Homeless  Connect and Family Connect, or launching the My Brother's Keeper  initiative.   At the age of 52, he still had so much more to offer to his  community, in public service, and most importantly, to his family.   I am proud of the work my dear friend accomplished, and I am honored  to ensure that his legacy is permanently enshrined in the Congressional  Record.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
