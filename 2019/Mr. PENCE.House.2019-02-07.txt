 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this body to act on the  national crisis that currently exists along our southern border.   This crisis plays itself out not only in the border towns of  California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, but in communities across  the Nation, including my very own, Indiana's Sixth District. The  statistics speak for themselves:   In my home of Bartholomew County, the sheriff's office booked 34  individuals with an immigration detainer 2  [[Page H1433]]  years ago. Last year, that number jumped to 132.   Hoosiers also feel the effects of the border crisis in the form of an  opioid crisis that now kills more Americans than car accidents, gun  violence, or breast cancer. This crisis is tearing families apart. The  Department of Corrections says one in three Hoosiers residing in State  prisons are battling addiction to opioids.   In the last year, Customs and Border officials have reported dramatic  increases in meth, heroin, and fentanyl along our southern border.  These are some of the very drugs that claimed the lives of more than  1,800 Hoosiers in 2017.   President Trump is right. We must create an immigration system that  is safe, lawful, modern, and secure. It is not just the border States  feeling the effects of illegal immigration; it is communities like ours  in the Sixth District of Indiana that are being ravaged by the massive  scourge of drugs coming across the southern border.   We must end this crisis. Mr. Speaker, it is time to secure the  southern border and build the wall.
