 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Blue Water  Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 (H.R. 299).   When our brave men and women sign up to serve, the American people  make a promise to them. We assure them of clearly defined benefits that  are guaranteed upon completion of their service. Unfortunately, for  many veterans of the Vietnam era who served offshore of the Republic of  Vietnam, our government fell short of this solemn duty.   In 1991, Congress passed the Agent Orange Act, legislation that  instituted the presumption of service connection for certain diseases  linked to exposure to defoliants and herbicides like Agent Orange. This  law built upon the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation  Standards Act of 1984 that directed the Department of Veterans Affairs  to develop a system of disability compensation for Vietnam era veterans  who had been exposed to Agent Orange.   However, these laws failed to acknowledge that veterans who served in  the territorial seas during the Vietnam War, known as Blue Water Navy  Veterans, were also exposed to Agent Orange. In addition to handling  toxic chemicals onboard naval vessels, many of these chemicals polluted  rivers and streams in Vietnam that ran into the territorial seas. This  contaminated water was then used by the U.S. Navy for drinking,  bathing, and other purposes.  [[Page H3751]]    H.R. 299 finally acknowledges that our Blue Water Navy Veterans were  exposed to these toxic chemicals. It remedies the inequity among  veterans of the Vietnam era by extending the presumption of service  connection for certain conditions to those who served offshore, and it  is a long overdue step towards making these veterans whole. I hope that  the Senate will swiftly take up this legislation once the House passes  it today.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and finally welcome back home our Blue Water Navy Veterans.
