 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 3621.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive  Credit Reporting Enhancement, Disclosure, Innovation, and Transparency  Act, legislation sponsored by Representative Ayanna Pressley of  Massachusetts. This package of bills builds upon reforms that members  of the Financial Services Committee have been developing for several  Congresses.   Mr. Chairman, credit reporting is unlike any other business.  Consumers are not customers of credit reporting agencies; they are the  product. Credit reporting agencies package up consumers' data to sell  to lenders, employers, and other businesses.   Unfortunately, our system of consumer credit reporting is badly  broken, and consumers have little recourse. It is typical for credit  reports to be filled with unacceptable errors that are difficult for  consumers to correct. A Federal Trade Commission study found that one  in five consumers have verified errors in their credit reports, and 1  in 20 consumers have errors so serious that they would be denied credit  or need to pay more for it. This means about 42 million consumers have  errors in their credit reports and 10 million have reports that can be  life-altering.   Consumers are frustrated with the current system. In 2018, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 126,300 consumer  complaints on credit reporting, which was more than one-third of all  complaints submitted. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received  more complaints about credit reporting than any other issue.   This legislative package makes critical reforms to help consumers by  addressing problems with the credit reporting system.   The legislation includes H.R. 3642, the Improving Credit Reporting  for All Consumers Act, a bill sponsored by Representative Alma Adams,  which would address burdens consumers experience when trying to remove  errors from their consumer reports, including by providing a new right  to appeal the results of initial reviews about the accuracy or  completeness of disputed items on the report.   The package also includes H.R. 3622, the Restoring Unfairly Impaired  Credit and Protecting Consumers Act, a bill sponsored by Representative  Rashida Tlaib. This part of the bill would limit how long adverse  credit information stays on consumer reports, and it would protect  consumer victims by removing adverse information relating to predatory,  discriminatory, or otherwise unlawful loans made by a financial  institution. It would also prohibit reporting debt relating to  medically necessary procedures and delay reporting by 1 year for other  medical debt.   In addition, the package includes H.R. 3614, the Restricting Use of  Credit Checks for Employment Decisions Act, a bill sponsored by  Representative Al Lawson. This part of the bill would prohibit  employers from using credit reports for employment decisions, except  when a credit report is otherwise required to conduct a background  check by Federal, State, or local law or for a national security  clearance.   Then there is H.R. 3621, the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act,  a bill sponsored by Representative Pressley, which is also included in  the legislation. This part of the bill would help student borrowers who  may have been delinquent on paying their private student loans to  repair their credit after they demonstrate a history of timely loan  repayments for these loans, similar to how the credit reports of  borrowers with Federal student loans can be rehabilitated.   Another key measure included in this package is H.R. 3629, the  Clarity in Credit Score Formation Act, sponsored by Representative  Stephen Lynch. This legislation would direct the CFPB to provide  oversight and set standards for validating the accuracy and predictive  value of credit score models, and it would promote innovation by  requiring a study on how the use of nontraditional data might impact  the availability and affordability of credit for consumers with limited  or no traditional credit histories.   Finally, the package includes H.R. 3618, the Free Credit Scores for  Consumers Act, sponsored by Representative Joyce Beatty, which would  direct the nationwide CRAs to give consumers free copies of their  credit scores that are used by creditors in making credit decisions, as  determined by the CFPB, whenever consumers obtain their free annual  consumer reports.    I am pleased that this bill also includes a provision that I have  worked on with a range of other Members that excludes from credit  reports any adverse information about a Federal employee and others who  are affected by a government shutdown.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support these commonsense reforms  to improve the Nation's consumer reporting system and benefit  hardworking American consumers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this really should be a bipartisan bill,  but my friends on the opposite side of the aisle have not been willing  to really work in a bipartisan way. His bill was rejected in the Rules  Committee because it was not germane. If he agrees with us on all of  the items he identified, he should be supporting this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Pressley), who is a sponsor of this important legislation.                                time  1330     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty), who is the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Diversity  and Inclusion and a sponsor of legislation that is a part of this bill,  H.R. 3621.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams), who is a sponsor of one of the bills in  this comprehensive legislative package, H.R. 3621.    Mr. Chair, our next speaker is a sponsor of one of the  bills in H.R. 3621. She will have an opportunity to correct the ranking  member, who indicated the bill would remove negative credit after 2  years. It does not. She will clear that up and make sure that he  understands the facts of our bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), who is chairman of the Task Force on  Financial Technology, and a sponsor of H.R. 3629, one of the bills that  is making up this package.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson), who is the sponsor of H.R. 3614, one of the bills  in this comprehensive package.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is the chairwoman of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire, through the Chair,  if my colleague has any remaining speakers on his side.   I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the Americans for  Financial Reform and the 85 undersigned consumer, civil rights, labor,  and community organizations who wrote to express their support for H.R.  3621, and a letter from the National Association of Realtors.                                  Americans for Financial Reform,                                                   January 27, 2020.        Dear Representative: The 85 undersigned consumer, civil       rights, labor, and community organizations write to express       our support for HR 3621, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting       Enhancement, Disclosure, Innovation, and Transparency Act of       2020 (Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020).        Credit reports and credit scores play a critical role in       the economic lives of Americans. They are the gatekeeper for       affordable credit, insurance, rental housing, and sometimes       unfortunately even a job. Yet they suffer from unacceptable       rates of inaccuracy. This bill would enact a sea change that       would make the American credit reporting system more accurate       and fairer to consumers.        The Federal Trade Commission's definitive study showed that       21% of consumers had verified errors in their credit reports,       13% had errors that affected their credit scores, and 5% had       errors serious enough to cause them to be denied or pay more       for credit. Trying to fix these errors can be a Kafka-esque       nightmare in which the Big Three nationwide consumer report       agencies (CRAs)--Equifax, Experian and TransUnion--      consistently favor the side of the creditor or debt collector       (``the furnisher'') over the consumer.        The American credit reporting systems suffers from a number       of other flaws and defects. Consumers are unfairly penalized       by negative credit reporting when they have been the victim       of abusive practices, such as predatory mortgages or student       loans resulting from for-profit school fraud, or due to       circumstances out of their control, such as temporary job       loss, illness, or financial abuse by a family member.       Healthcare bills contribute greatly to credit reporting       harms, with over 50% of debt collection items resulting from       medical debt.        Consumers also lack the right to a free annual credit       score. Furthermore, many consumers who attempt to obtain a       free annual credit report or to obtain their scores are       misled into purchasing high-priced credit monitoring or other       subscription services. These services are also marketed to       prevent identify theft, yet they are far less effective in       doing so than a security freeze. This legislation       comprehensively addresses all of these abuses, and more. This       bill would:        Fix the broken system for credit reporting disputes by (1)       giving consumers a new right to appeal the results of initial       disputes; (2) requiring CRAs and furnishers of information to       dedicate sufficient resources and provide well-trained       personnel to handle disputes; (3) requiring CRAs to conduct       an independent analysis of disputes, separate from that of       the furnisher; and (4) requiring furnishers to retain records       for the same time period that negative information remains on       reports.        Improve credit reporting accuracy by directing the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish accuracy       regulations, including requiring CRAs to better monitor       furnishers for high error rates and to use stricter criteria       to match information from a lender to a consumer's file,       preventing the worst type of credit reporting error, the       ``mixed file.''        Restrict the use of credit information for employment by       limiting it to two narrow instances--when required by local,       state or federal law or for national security clearances.       This will severely limit a practice that discriminates       against the long-term unemployed, has a disparate impact on       communities of color, and has very little evidence       demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting job       performance.        Help victims of abusive lending and overly punitive       negative reporting practices by (1) reducing the current       overlong retention periods that adverse credit information       remains on reports to four years (seven years for       bankruptcies); (2) allowing borrowers victimized by the       unfair, deceptive or abusive practices of mortgage lenders or       servicers to have adverse mortgage-related information       removed; and (3) requiring the removal of negative       information about private education loans that were obtained       to attend for-profit colleges found to have engaged in unfair       or deceptive practices.        Protect consumers from the unfair impact of medical debt by       prohibiting CRAs from including medical collections on       reports until 365 days from the date of first delinquency and       prohibiting the reporting of any debt for medically necessary       procedures. This will ensure that consumers have time to       resolve their complex, confusing medical bills. The bill also       mandates that all paid or settled debt, including medical       collections, be removed within 45 days from reports.        Help consumers understand their creditworthiness by giving       consumers the right to a free credit score at the same time       that they obtain their free annual consumer report. The bill       also creates several new instances in which consumers are       entitled to receive both free reports and scores, including       requiring auto, private education and mortgage lenders to       provide prospective loan borrowers the same free reports and       scores that the lenders used in their decision-making before       consumers sign those loan agreements.        Address misleading marketing of credit monitoring       subscriptions and increase access for security freezes to       prevent identity theft by (1) prohibiting the misleading       practice of automatically converting free trial periods into       paid, monthly subscription services by requiring CRAs to       provide explicit opt-ins at the end of the promotions and (2)       providing free credit freezes for security breach victims and       vulnerable consumers, and capping the cost for all other       consumers.        Give a second chance to struggling private education loan       borrowers by allowing them to rehabilitate impaired credit       records through requiring removal of adverse information       about delinquent or defaulted loans if they are able to make       nine out of ten on-time, monthly payments.  [[Page H661]]         Correct provisions in last year's deregulatory law, S2155,       that unwisely preempted states from further improvements to       the credit freeze laws and provided servicemembers with a       credit monitoring right without a remedy.        These credit reporting reforms are urgently needed in order       to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and that the       credit reporting system that underlies so many daily       transactions works better for the public.        We look forward to working with you to swiftly pass this       bill to better protect consumers.        Thank you for your attention.

Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On       behalf of the 1.4 million members of the National Association       of REALTORS (NAR), NAR is pleased to support H.R.       3621, the ``Comprehensive Credit Act of 2020.''        Nearly 70 percent of home sales are financed and a       borrower's credit report and credit score form a critical       gateway to obtaining a mortgage. Unfortunately, inaccurate       credit reports and unfair credit reporting methods raise the       cost and/or limit access to mortgage credit for many       prospective borrowers. To this end, NAR applauds H.R. 3621,       the ``Comprehensive Credit Act of 2020,'' which include the       following bills.        H.R. 3618, the ``Free Credit Scores for Consumers Act of       2019''        H.R. 3621, the ``Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act''        H.R. 3622, the ``Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit and       Protecting Consumers Act''        H.R. 3642, the ``Improving Credit Reporting for All       Consumers Act''        H.R. 3629, the ``Clarity in Credit Score Formation Act of       2019''        REALTORS believe that balanced financial       regulation and appropriate consumer protection will result in       a more vibrant housing market and overall economy.       Furthermore, creditor and consumer confidence is critical in       the home financing process. REALTORS thank you for       your diligent work to improve the accuracy, consistency, and       availability of quality credit scoring and appraisal       information.            Sincerely,                                                    Vince Malta,                                2020 President, National Association                                             of REALTORS.     Mr. Chair, first, I would like to thank all of the  participants in this comprehensive package. I would like to thank Ms.  Pressley, as the sponsor of this comprehensive piece of legislation,  Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, Mrs. Beatty, Mr. Lynch, and Ms. Tlaib, for all  of the work that they put in to ensure that we were covering the years  of complaints that we have gotten about our credit bureaus and the  mishandling of our consumers and a lack of protection for consumers who  have suffered at the hands of our credit bureaus who did not take into  consideration these very serious complaints.   So, Mr. Chairman, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting Enhancement,  Disclosure, Innovation, and Transparency, this act, makes much-needed  and overdue reforms to improve the credit reporting system. The issues  addressed by this bill are important for the economic well-being of  millions of Americans and our economy.   As we have discussed, the bill is supported by, again, Americans for  Financial Reform, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and  the National Association of Realtors. So, with all of this support, and  with consumers who have been waiting for years for their  Representatives to do something about the fact that their data is all  in the hands of these credit bureaus who are determining whether or not  they can acquire credit; whether or not they are going to be able to  get a loan; whether or not they are going to be able to have a decent  quality of life because they have done everything that they could do to  have good credit; and that when they have said to the credit bureaus,  there is an error, they have got me mixed up with someone else, and  they cannot get this straightened out for them, and they suffer.   So the time has come, and I am so very pleased that my committee is  answering all of the requests from our constituents and your  constituents and all of the constituents of Representatives in this  body, to do something. The time is now, and we are doing that. This  comprehensive piece of legislation will absolutely deal with these  concerns that have been identified for so long.   I urge all Members who care about their constituency, who have been  hearing these issues for so many years, I urge them to vote ``yes'' on  this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
