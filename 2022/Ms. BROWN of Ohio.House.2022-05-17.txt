 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1119,  I call up the bill (H.R. 6531) to provide an increased allocation of  funding under certain programs for assistance in areas of persistent  poverty, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6531.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6531, the  Targeting Resources to Communities in Need Act. H.R. 6531 is a  bipartisan bill introduced by Majority Whip Clyburn and Representative  Hal Rogers.   According to the latest decennial Census statistics, 37 million  people in our country live in poverty. H.R. 6531 takes an important and  commonsense step to addressing persistent poverty in the United States.   As we know, poverty is a very real issue and is experienced by  Americans of all backgrounds in communities across the country.   The bill before us would provide additional transparency about places  that face persistent poverty and would direct increased investments to  those areas.   H.R. 6531 would require the Census Bureau to publish a list of all  areas of persistent poverty, and the Office of Management and Budget  would work with agencies to ensure that program investments get to the  places that need them most.   The bill also fosters accountability by requiring annual reports to  Congress about qualifying program investments and their economic  impacts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our  fellow Americans through this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 6531,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
