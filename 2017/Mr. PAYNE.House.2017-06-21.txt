 Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is not surprising that the House  Republicans haven't put forward a budget, despite passing their  deadline more than 2 months ago.   It has been nearly 800 days since the House Republicans agreed to a  budget. Hat-tip to the Huffington Post's Matt Fuller for that fun fact.   What we are seeing is an ongoing inability of House Republicans to do  their job. Republicans have introduced no jobs bill, given no  indication whether they will lift the debt ceiling to avoid default,  and offered no responsible spending legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this is dysfunction at its worst. The American people  sent us here to deliver results on jobs, on healthcare, on security.   I urge my Republican colleagues to take that responsibility seriously  and to work with Democrats to achieve progress. I know we can.                            ____________________
