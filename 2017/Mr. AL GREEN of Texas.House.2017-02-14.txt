 Mr. Speaker, on May 17, 1954, Chief Justice  Earl Warren delivered the shock that was felt across the Nation.   This was done when, on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court, he  announced:   ``We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of  `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are  inherently unequal.''   These 24 words, Mr. Speaker, had a far-reaching impact upon our  Nation. These words ushered in an era of de jure desegregation that has  changed the course of history that has created a new sense of destiny,  and literally these 24 words opened doors that were closed to many  persons and created new opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, before I go on, let me thank the many cosponsors of H.  Res. 79, which recognizes the significance of Black History Month, and  H. Res. 17, which honors the National Association for the Advancement  of Colored People, the NAACP, on its 108th anniversary. I thank the  many cosponsors and the many persons who have worked on these issues.    I have a staff that has worked tirelessly to make sure that we have  these resolutions prepared, such that they could be filed timely. I am  grateful to my staff. One such staff member is with me tonight. My  legislative director, Ms. Amena Ross, is in the Chamber with me. I am  appreciative that on Valentine's Day she has chosen to be here as  opposed to where she probably could be and will probably be going  shortly.   Mr. Speaker, given that in this month, the month of February, we  celebrate Black history as well as the founding of the NAACP, I think  that it is appropriate for me to speak on the topic from desegregation  to resegregation. Mr. Speaker, it can happen.   Mr. Speaker, while Brown v. Board of Education has not produced the  utopian society many hoped for--it has not ended the de facto  segregation that many prayed for. It has not engendered the quality  education for all children and has not transformed public schools into  perfect schools or equal schools--I still contend and firmly believe  that we are a much better nation with Brown v. Board of Education than  without it.   Mr. Speaker, I think that it is important for us to give empirical  evidence of these words that I have just spoken, my positions, if you  will. I would like to do so by allowing the words of a Southern judge.  I would like to allow his words to speak for themselves.   This is a message that was delivered by a Southern judge on October 4  of 1957. Mr. Speaker, I shall not call his name. I do not want to  embarrass his family. But he was the vice president of a bar  association. He was a circuit court judge. He received his BA from a  prestigious institution, and he taught sociology.   Mr. Speaker, please hear now his words so that people may understand  why Brown v. Board of Education was so important to so many in this  country. These are his words:   ``Segregation in the South is a way of life. It is the means whereby  we live in social peace, order and security.''   Mr. Speaker, I trust that many people can understand why persons of  my generation are concerned when we hear the terms ``law'' and  ``order,'' terms that indicate law enforcement will take law into its  own hands by some standards. In fact, there was law and order at the  Edmond Pettus Bridge on  [[Page H1174]]  Bloody Sunday, but there was not justice at the Edmond Pettus Bridge.   Many people seek justice when they look for law enforcement to  enforce and maintain order. They look for justice as well.   He goes on to say: ``Ninety-eight percent of both races prefer  segregation.''   He is now speaking for people that we now call African Americans. At  that time, they were called Negroes.   ``Integration is urged by the NAACP, a few Southern mulattoes''--this  is a means by which light-skinned African Americans were separated from  the darker African Americans.   He says that `` . . . a few Southern mulattoes, Northern Communist- front organizations and left-wing labor groups who would use the  unsuspecting Negro as their tool.''   It is remarkable that someone would think that people yearning to be  free would see those who are lending a hand as persons who are using  them as tools.   He goes on to say: ``It does not work any economic hardship nor  deprive the Negro of any of his constitutional rights.''   He is talking about segregation.   Then he goes on to say: ``The Negro has made great strides and the  Southern white man is largely responsible for these advancements.''   This is a judge. One can only imagine what it must have been like to  appear before him if you were Black.   He goes on to say: ``If in the South the Negro was permitted, as he  is in some Northern States, to obtain the ballot by simply reaching 21  years of age, it would mean that no qualified white man in many  counties throughout the South could ever hold public office. It would  also mean that in the halls of Congress, seats now held by competent  white representatives would be held by ignorant, incompetent Negroes.''   These are the words of a judge shortly after the Brown decision.   He explains: ``An exhaustive study of the program and results of  integration in the schools of Washington, D.C., which the NAACP and  other left wing groups''--thank God for the NAACP and leftwing groups-- ``fostering integration said would be a model for the rest of the  United States to follow, clearly reveals that the average white student  who was integrated in the class room with the Negro has been retarded  two to three years in his educational progress. Therefore, it is not to  the best interest of America that the white children, particularly in  certain congested sections, be retarded three years in their  educational advancement.''   He then states later on in his speech that `` . . . we have already,  by constitutional amendment, authorized our legislature as other  Southern States will do, to abolish the public schools if the Negro and  white children are ever integrated therein. Make no mistake about it,  we will abolish our public school system and establish private schools  for our white children, and we will still provide and see that the  Negro is educated separately. It will cost dearly, but we will do it.''   Finally, he concludes with these words. This is a judge. These are  facts in the sense that these are statements that he had made. The  history is there for those who wish to read it.   He indicates that: `` . . . As long as we live, so long shall we be  segregated, and after death, God willing, thus it will still be!''                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, I call this to our attention because it is important for  us to understand what the horrors of segregation were really like; that  this was not something that persons of African ancestry enjoyed; that  segregation caused many persons more than an inconvenience. It really  cost a good many people their lives.   So I thank God, Mr. Speaker, for the NAACP, for labor unions, and for  people of goodwill of all hues who worked hard to make sure we arrived  at this point in our history.   I thank God for Brown v. Board of Education, but I also understand  that the Brown case, Mr. Speaker, was as much about fate as it was  about facts. I contend that, but for the intrusive hand of fate, the  Brown decision could have been, at minimum, a partial endorsement of  segregation.   Unfortunately, because the Chief Justice at that time, whose name I  shall not mention--I need not embarrass his family--was a notorious  supporter of the doctrine of segregation.   However, Mr. Speaker, after arguments were made in the Brown case in  1952, and before the decision was announced in 1954, fate intruded, and  the Chief Justice suffered a heart attack from which he did not  recover.   A conservative President then had the duty to appoint a man to the  new seat as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. President Eisenhower  appointed a man who participated in the World War II internment of  Japanese Americans. This was Governor Earl Warren. He was appointed as  the new Chief Justice. With this appointment, many persons thought that  little would change on the Supreme Court. However, when Warren achieved  a unanimous decision outlawing segregation, President Eisenhower is  said to have stated that this was one of the biggest mistakes that he  made by appointing Warren to the Supreme Court as his Chief Justice.   The Brown decision, Mr. Speaker, was little less than a minor  miracle, and it has had a remarkable impact on our society. I probably  stand here today because of the Brown decision. At the time the  decision was rendered, there were two African Americans in Congress.  Today we have approximately 50 African Americans in Congress.   The Brown decision has made a difference in the lives of people.  Integration of schools has been of benefit to young people.   I have an article that I would like to read from. It is styled: ``The  Benefits of Socioeconomically and Racially Integrated Schools and  Classrooms.'' This is from the Century Foundation, a reputable  organization.   In the general sense, here is what the article addresses:   It indicates that students in integrated schools have higher average  test scores.   Students in integrated schools are more likely to enroll in college.   Students in integrated schools are less likely to drop out.   Integrated schools help to reduce racial achievement gaps.   Integrated classrooms encourage critical thinking, problem-solving,  and creativity.   Attending a diverse school can help reduce racial bias and counter  stereotypes.   Students who attend integrated schools are more likely to seek out  integrated settings after they leave school and enter life.   Integrated classrooms can improve students' satisfaction and  intellectual self-confidence.   Learning in integrated settings can enhance students' leadership  skills.   Finally, of the many things--and I have not cited them all--diverse  classrooms prepare students to succeed in a global economy.   Mr. Speaker, there is little question in my mind and in the minds of  many that integration has made a difference in the lives of people in  this country. Integration has not only been of benefit to us in  classrooms, but the truth is that we live in a society wherein  integration has allowed us, by virtue of Brown v. Board of Education,  to sleep where we sleep, to eat where we eat, to live where we live.   Brown v. Board of Education has had far-reaching implications beyond  that of the classroom. In fact, the economic order, the political  order, and the social order were positively impacted by Brown.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that I believe we have to,  in this country, protect the integration and desegregation that society  has produced.   I see that I have another colleague present. Mr. Speaker, can you  give me the amount of time that I have left?    I assure my colleague that I will provide  ample time.   Continuing, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the re-segregation of  our society. I believe that it can occur, and I believe that we must  guard against it. I believe that the voucherization of public school  funding has been and continues to be the enemy of desegregation and  integration.   Allow me to explain. After the Brown decision, as I have indicated,  many States sought to repeal the requirement that they maintain a  public  [[Page H1175]]  school system, and many did. After the Brown decision, vouchers were  seen as a means by which public schools could be privatized, so that  the public school system would exist with private tax dollars that were  in the form of vouchers, and would allow people to still go to the  schools of their choice. ``School choice'' was one of the watchwords of  the day.   After the Brown decision, in 1955, thereabouts, Milton Friedman,  Nobel Laureate, proposed that vouchers be used to allow children to go  to the schools of their choice, allow their parents to have this  opportunity to send their children to the schools of their choice.   Mr. Speaker, these vouchers, had they been used as proposed, would  have continued to perpetrate segregation and perpetuate it for years to  come. These vouchers were not used, thank God. I regret to say,  however, that many States are currently proposing voucher systems that  can lead to the re-segregation of society.    We have a duty to protect the gains that have been made, that have  been fought for by the NAACP, by labor unions, by people of goodwill of  all hues. We have got a duty and an obligation to protect these gains,  and not allow our country to slip back into a dark past that no one  wants to relive.   I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that as we continue our progress, we will  remember the past that we have been able to extricate ourselves from.  And in so doing, it is my desire that we give special attention to  these attempts to use tax dollars, to voucherize tax dollars so that  public schools can be privatized with tax dollars, which can lead to  separation, which can lead to the re-segregation of society.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I have my colleague, the Honorable Jim  Clyburn present from South Carolina. He is known as a historian par  excellence. I am so honored to yield to him so that he may speak on the  subjects related to Black history and the NAACP.   I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn).    I thank Mr. Clyburn for those wonderful  comments. They were most edifying, and I am sure that a good many  people have acquired a better understanding of Allen University.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will simply say this in my last  2 minutes. I am grateful that the NAACP was there not only for me, but  for this country. The NAACP filed and won many cases, but Brown v.  Board of Education has to be one of the most outstanding pieces of  litigation that it engaged in.   Of course, you can't talk about Brown without mentioning the  Honorable Thurgood Marshall, who was the lead counsel in the Brown case  who went on to become a Justice on the Supreme Court.   The Brown case has transformed American life. It desegregated and  integrated American society, the economic order, and the political  order as well. I am blessed to be here because of  [[Page H1176]]  Brown v. Board of Education, and my hope is that we will understand  that desegregation and integration are here now--and we will fight for  them--but we have to also understand that we can go from desegregation  to resegregation. We must be careful, we must vigilant, and we must  protect the gains that we have made.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
