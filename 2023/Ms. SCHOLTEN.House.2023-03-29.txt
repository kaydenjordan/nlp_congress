 Mr. Chair, permitting reform, we all want it. There is  a simple solution. Separate the question.   But why not? We need to ask why not.   Because this bill includes massive handouts to big corporations and  incentivizes them to leak methane into the atmosphere.   Let's just look at the bill's name: LECA. They are telling it like it  is, folks, and we should be listening.   There is a choice being made here by House Republicans, Mr. Chair.  They are not doing this to make our system more efficient or to lower  costs for the American people, quite the opposite.   This bill repeals $4.5 billion in home electrification, a program  that the Department of Energy estimates could save Americans thousands  of dollars annually.   If we were focused on lowering costs for American families, this is  what we would be focused on.   I talk to west Michiganders every single day about what they want and  what they need.   We want to protect the Great Lakes. We want to lower our energy  costs, and that means investing in conservation efforts and putting  smart regulations in place that support the longevity of the Great  Lakes economy. That means ensuring a future for the next generation of  west Michiganders.   The Big Oil giveaway act does none of that. It greatly expands  companies' ability to exploit public land.   Michigan-3 is home to a large portion of the Grand River watershed  and miles of beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline. I support protecting  our most beautiful protected areas, not stripping them for parts.   What House Republicans are doing is this: Holding an antiquated  permitting system hostage to extract benefits for Big Oil corporations.   If they want to come to the table in good faith on serious bipartisan  efforts to streamline the permitting process and lower energy costs for  American families, I will be the first in line.
