 Mr. Speaker, President Trump doesn't have many  fans in the political, media, or academic establishment. The definition  of ``establishment'' is a ruling class or a controlling group.   They oppose the President because he is not one of them. They hold  different views of immigration, trade, regulations, political  correctness, and media bias. Their beliefs are threatened by his world  view, so they are relentlessly trying to discredit his Presidency.   The President, I believe, sees himself as representing the working  men and women of America; Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.  This is the broad middle class and those who aspire to be part of it.   The establishment has linked arms and resists the President's  reforms, but all true reform starts with the voice of the people, and  they are on his side.                            ____________________
