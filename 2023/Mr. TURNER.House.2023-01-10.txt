 Mr. Speaker, last Congress, I served as the ranking  member of the Intelligence Committee. Chairman Jordan and I have  already been working to ensure that the intelligence community and the  Department of Justice, including the FBI, are not violating the civil  rights of law-abiding Americans.   Sadly, we already have very troubling evidence to begin our  investigation to ensure that our intelligence community and law  enforcement agencies are not violating Americans' constitutional  rights. Some of this information is similar to what has been publicly  disclosed by the Twitter files, which is a small portion of the  information that we have that is gravely concerning about the improper  use of government authority that this committee will be focusing on.   This subcommittee is about protecting rights, a task that everyone in  this body just took an oath to protect last week. Our committee will be  assisting this subcommittee. We look forward to working with Chairman  Jordan on this important issue, and we know that this is important to  the American people.
