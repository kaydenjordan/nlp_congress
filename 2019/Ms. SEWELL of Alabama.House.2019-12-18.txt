 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and a  profound sense of the gravity of this moment that I rise today in  support of the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump.   To be clear, I did not run for Congress to impeach a President.   I come to work every day on behalf of the hardworking people of  Alabama's Seventh Congressional District.   But the facts are uncontested. The truth is clear. And I have been  left no other choice.   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I sat in shock, in awe as  witness after witness came forward, their stories painting a clear  picture of the President's abuse of power.                                time  1615    They testified that the President had direct orders to withhold vital  military aid for Ukraine and a White House visit in exchange for  investigations into the Bidens.   To date, all the military aid has not been released, and there still  has been no White House meeting.   The bottom line is clear. President Trump endangered our national  security and the very essence of our democracy for his own personal  political gain. Then, President Trump sought to cover it up by  subverting the oversight authority of Congress.   If Presidential abuse of power is left unchecked, we all become  accomplices when he does it again. This cannot become the new normal,  not on our watch.   While President Trump's indefensible actions set in motion this  event, my vote for impeachment today is not about the President. It is  about my oath to defend and protect the Constitution of this United  States of America and to make sure that I uphold and honor the sacred  trust that my constituents gave me.   President Trump has betrayed his oath of office. Let us not betray  ours.
