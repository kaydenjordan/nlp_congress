 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Polis, for his  leadership on the Rules Committee.   I respect the chairman of the Rules Committee, but I respectfully  disagree. He has presided over a Rules Committee that has the most  closed rules in the history of the Congress of the United States.  Competing ideas, opposing views were not allowed to be considered in  either of the two bills the Republicans are going to put before the  Congress. One we have dispensed with already.   I oppose the rule and I oppose the underlying legislation. We are  facing multiple immigration crises of the President's own making, and  we must not be fooled by plans designed to cover that up.   This is not the fix we need for migrant families separated at the  border. President Trump's inhumane and morally repugnant policy to  forcibly separate children from their parents as they seek refuge in  America is beyond the pale. We cannot rely on the President's sudden  change of heart. We must forbid this barbaric policy by passing the  Keep Families Together Act, not this bill.   This is not the fix we need for Dreamers, despite what Mr. Sessions,  my good friend from Texas, just said. There are nearly 800,000  Dreamers, including 2,400 in my district. They need an opportunity to  work, to attend school, to contribute to our communities, and to become  the Americans they, in fact, are.   I had a Dreamer as my guest at the State of the Union address. She  came to this country at the age of 1. She has never been back to her  country of birth. She thought she was an American until she applied for  a driver's permit at the age of 16. She is a proud American, and we  would be proud to have her.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and to oppose  the underlying bill.
