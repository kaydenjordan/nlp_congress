 Madam President, today I wish to recognize Dr.  Steven M. Southwick on the occasion of his retirement.   For over 30 years, Dr. Southwick has dedicated himself to researching  combat-related PTSD. His impressive work has helped make great strides  in the efforts to alleviate suffering and promote resilience for  veterans. Much of the necessary progress in this field is thanks to Dr.  Southwick's diligent studies.   A graduate of Yale College, the George Washington School of Medicine,  and the Yale Psychiatry Residency, Dr. Southwick served in the U.S.  Army before attending medical school. During his service, he was  stationed in Germany. His time in the military would shape the path of  his future research.   In 1985, Dr. Southwick joined the faculty of the VA Connecticut  Healthcare System and the Yale Department of Psychiatry. Throughout his  career, he has worked not only with combat veterans, but also with a  range of trauma survivors, including athletes, astronauts, civilians  with PTSD, and former prisoners of war.   Some of his many notable accomplishments include leading the first  mechanistic neurobiology study of PTSD and, along with his colleagues  at the National Center for PTSD, being among the first to study the  biological and cognitive underpinnings of resilience among U.S. Special  Forces trainees. Through such research, Dr. Southwick pioneered the  study of human resilience and introduced a new perspective on trauma. I  have been fortunate to learn firsthand during visits to the center  about the progress he and his colleagues are making on this complex but  extremely critical condition that affects many veterans and first  responders, and I commend them on their vital work.   He now serves as the medical director of the clinical neuroscience  division of the VA National Center for PTSD and the Glenn H. Greenberg  Professor of Psychiatry, PTSD, and Resilience at the Yale University  School of Medicine. In these positions, Dr. Southwick has mentored  countless future leaders in the field of PTSD research.   Dr. Southwick is the recipient of numerous honors and takes part in a  number of journals, committees, and seminars in his area of expertise.  Though he is recognized for his immense contributions to the realm of  PTSD research, he is also highly regarded and beloved by his  colleagues, students, and patients.   I applaud his lifetime of service and hope my colleagues will join me  in congratulating Dr. Southwick on his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
