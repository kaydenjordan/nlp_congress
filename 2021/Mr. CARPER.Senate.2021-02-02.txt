 Madam President, I have the honor of serving on the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--a  committee you serve on--which oversees, as you know, the Department of  Homeland Security since the committee was first formed.   Almost two decades later, I remain convinced that the nominees we  confirm to lead that Department must possess sound judgment, integrity,  relevant experience, boundless energy, and the leadership skills that  will enable them to take on some of the most daunting challenges that  we face today as a nation.   The Department of Homeland Security is a Department with a budget of  over $50 billion and a staff of over 240,000 men and women. Its  Agencies protect our country from ever-evolving domestic and foreign  threats; they respond to natural disasters; and they help to secure our  critical infrastructure.   Unfortunately, in recent years, the senior leadership ranks of this  Department have come to remind many of us as something akin to  executive branch Swiss cheese, with critical positions remaining vacant  for far too long or without Senate confirmation at all. In fact, the  Department of Homeland Security has been without a Senate-confirmed  Secretary for 21 months. Think about that--21 months. Meanwhile, there  is no shortage of work to be done from the clear and present threat of  domestic terrorism to responding to the SolarWinds cyber breach to  helping distribute the COVID vaccine.   Now, more than ever, it is crucial for this important Department to  be led by men and women who have been vetted and confirmed by Members  of this body. The American people deserve a capable leader at the helm  of this Department, and I believe that leader is Alejandro Mayorkas.   Ali represents the best of America. Born in Havana, Cuba, Ali knows  firsthand what it is like for a family to flee its native land and come  to the United States in search of refuge. He is a man of integrity and  a person of principle who possesses a truly, truly remarkable work  ethic. What is more, he may well be the most qualified nominee we have  ever been asked to consider to lead the Department of Homeland  Security.   He has previously served admirably as its Deputy Secretary for nearly  4 years, and before that as the head of DHS's largest Agency, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services. As Director of this Agency, he  worked to combat immigration fraud. He directed and implemented the  DACA Program to protect hundreds of thousands of Dreamers and much  more.   As Deputy Secretary, he led the Department's successful Unity of  Effort initiative to improve morale in an Agency which previously had  the lowest morale of any large Agency in our Federal Government. In  fact, the Department that reported the greatest improvement in morale  in the final year of the Obama administration was the Department of  Homeland Security, in large part, due to Ali's leadership and that of  former Secretary Jeh Johnson.   As Deputy Secretary, Mr. Mayorkas also shepherded through Congress  cyber security legislation to enable the Department of Homeland  Security to better protect our dot-gov and private sector networks. I  think he may have also had something to do with reining in the Ebola  plague.   Those who know Ali well will tell you that he is no ideologue. He has  no partisan agenda. Rather, he is a thoughtful, policy-minded public  servant who has spent much of his career improving the Department of  Homeland Security so that the men and women who serve there can better  protect our homeland.   We have seen that he is willing to work with Democrats, Republicans,  and their staffs to get things done. That is one of the many reasons  that five former Secretaries of Homeland Security, Democratic and  Republican alike, have encouraged us to confirm him swiftly.   I know that Ali can do this job. He has already demonstrated that.  And I believe that many of our colleagues here today know it as well.  After all, Ali Mayorkas has been confirmed three times in the past,  including once as U.S. attorney for the Central District of Columbia.   Having said that, though, some of our Republican colleagues are  attempting now to use a 2013 IG investigation as a cudgel against his  nomination. As it turns out, we have seen this movie before. I should  note that a number of those colleagues were not serving in Congress at  that time in 2013 and most were not serving on the Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee when we considered Ali's nomination  that year to serve as Deputy Secretary.   I was privileged to serve as chairman of the committee at that time.  In fact, I led the fight to confirm him. It was the toughest fight I  have had in 20 years here. It is one thing to disagree with the nominee  politically, but to continue to question Ali's dedication and integrity  on the basis of an IG report, as some of our Republican colleagues have  done, flies in the face of available evidence, including his decades of  public service. At a time when our Nation faces so many crises, we  cannot afford less than full support for this nominee.   So I want to take a few minutes today to set the record straight, if  I can. Here are the facts.   In 2013, an IG investigation into Ali Mayorkas's oversight of a  program within U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, known as the EB-5  Program, was conducted in a highly irregular manner, including through  false leaks to the media literally on the eve of his confirmation  hearing. As a result of the IG's public leaks and his failure to  complete a report before the close of Congress, Ali was denied a chance  to have any concerns fully litigated ahead of his confirmation in the  Senate in 2013.   Ultimately, the IG who initiated the investigation stepped down later  that year amid bipartisan calls for his resignation. Last year, that  same former IG was charged by the Department of Justice with 16 counts  of fraud--16 counts of fraud   Following Ali's confirmation, my staff and I worked to ensure that  the subsequent IG completed the report into any allegations. In 2015,  that new IG, John Roth, produced a report building on the work of the  2013 investigation. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing by Ali.  None. What it did suggest, however, was that some of his actions as  Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services may have created  the ``appearance of favoritism.''   In particular, it asserted that Ali met with a number of well- connected individuals over time regarding their concerns over the EB-5  Investor Visa Program. After Ali joined the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services as its Director in 2009, he came to the conclusion  that this program was not well run. He was not alone in this  conclusion. Ali has testified that as Director of U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services, he received more complaints from Members of  Congress, on both sides of the aisle, regarding the EB-5 Program than  he did about any other program.   In response to these bipartisan concerns, as Director of the Agency,  Ali did what, in my opinion, many of us would expect an Agency head to  do. He rolled up his sleeves, and he worked with his employees to gain  an understanding of how the program was being run and to find out how  they might make it run better. He directed systemic changes that  included improving management and administration of the program in  order to reduce favoritism and to combat fraud. He also proposed  reforms of the program to Congress in an effort to prevent future  abuses--reforms which, unfortunately, were not pursued by Congress--our  fault, not his.   And yes, as Director, he set a precedent for getting back to Members  of Congress quickly in response to their inquiries, even if the answers  his Agency came up with was ultimately not what they wanted to hear.  [[Page S224]]    Completing the 2015 IG report was important to clear Ali of any  wrongdoing. But these findings and Ali's actions have been  mischaracterized by some of our colleagues who assert that he showed  favoritism by reaching out personally to the staff of former Senator  Harry Reid over an EB-5-related issue they had raised on behalf of a  constituent.   As it turns out, though, the report is clear. Ali Mayorkas did reach  out to that staff--not to deliver preferential treatment but, rather,  to let the staff know that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  would not be able to accommodate the request of that staff and their  Senator. And why? If responsiveness to inquiries by Members of Congress  and their staff, regardless of whether the response is favorable or  not, is a problem for my colleagues--any of my colleagues--that is news  to me.   Let me make one more point, if I may. As someone who knows Ali and  has known him for years--knows his family, knows his work, knows his  ethic--I believe the 2015 IG report was missing some needed context.  Let me try to provide it   Fortunately, though, Ali provided it in a 32-page response. The  response was almost as long as the IG report itself. Among other  things, it describes how he met not just with Democratic Members but  with a number of our Republican colleagues to address issues important  to them, including international adoption and fighting fraud in our  immigration programs. Following those meetings, just as with the EB-5  Program, Ali took appropriate steps to make improvements based on  feedback from his constituents. That is what leaders should do.   Those examples and others included right there in the 2015 IG report  serve to further illustrate Ali's commitment to doing what he thought  was right, to improving the Department by carrying out the law without  fear or favor, and by responding promptly and fully to inquiries from  Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.   If Ali Mayorkas is confirmed today, I am hopeful that many of our  colleagues and our staffs will have a chance in the years to come to  work with him and his team at the Department of Homeland Security and  witness for themselves the kind of leader he truly is. We are fortunate  that an individual as well prepared and qualified as Alejandro Mayorkas  may soon have the opportunity to lead the Department through the many  crises and challenges it faces and which our country faces today.   But you don't have to take my word for it. The late Tom Coburn, a  dear friend of mine and former colleague of many of us, led the fight  against Ali's confirmation in 2013, when he had been nominated to be  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. Tom was then the ranking member  of the Homeland Security Committee, and I was serving as its chairman.  Tom, sadly, is deceased. We lost a good man, a really good man, a  couple of years ago.   Tom's staff director of the committee, at the time, was a very  capable gentleman. His name is Keith Ashdown. I think it is important  to note that last week, Keith sent a letter to our committee. In it, he  wrote of his strong support today of Ali's nomination to serve as  Secretary of DHS.   Mr. Ashdown wrote these words. He said:         I first came to know Mayorkas when I was the Republican       staff director of this committee [the Homeland Security       committee]. At that time, I was working to block his       nomination to serve as Deputy Secretary of the Department of       Homeland Security.    He went on to say:         With the benefit of hindsight, I am glad my efforts to       block his nomination were ultimately unsuccessful.    How often do you hear that? Mr. Ashdown went on to write:         As Deputy Secretary, Mayorkas worked in a bipartisan manner       to respond to the Committee's requests and concerns.    He added:         Having been on the other side of this battle, I understand       the importance of vetting a [nomination] thoroughly. But no       one has been vetted more than has Ali Mayorkas.    Mr. Ashton concluded with these words. He said:         I urge the [United States] Senate to expeditiously confirm       Ali Mayorkas as [Department of Homeland Security] Secretary       without delay.    Without delay.   Signed:         Sincerely, Keith Ashdown.    Let me close today, by saying that I am grateful, and I know that the  Mayorkas family is grateful as well, to Keith Ashdown and to the  Republican Senators who have broken ranks in committee and on the floor  in last week's cloture vote, who have taken the time to fully consider  this nomination, and who now support it. We are grateful to you. I  sincerely hope that more of our colleagues will join them and us today.   I would say to my colleagues, I don't stake my reputation on a lot of  people, but I am more than willing to stake it on Ali Mayorkas, just as  I have three times before in this same Chamber. If you are undecided  today, colleagues, I hope you will join me this time. Ali Mayorkas will  make us and this country proud. In fact, I believe, he already has.   While we are waiting for folks to come onto the floor, I just want to  explain to people who ask: What is this EB-5 Program? It is a program  that is designed to bring foreign capital into this country to help  build businesses and provide jobs in return for the ability to come to  this country and eventually have legal residency here. That is what it  is about.    I want to say everything I do, I know I can do better. Every program  that we have, even the ones that I helped to create, we can make them  better. The EB-5 Program, which is a bipartisan program that was  created, I think, under partnership with Ted Kennedy and Senator Chuck  Grassley, if I am not mistaken, wasn't a perfect program, and it wasn't  administered in a perfect manner either.   The Constitution of our country has its Preamble, as we all know. It  starts off with these words: ``We the People of the United States, in  Order to form a more perfect Union.'' That is what it says: ``We the  People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union.''   That includes writing more perfect legislation and creating more  perfect programs. When we find that they are not and that they are  flawed, and that maybe some of the people who are administering them  are ill-equipped with their skills and technology and backgrounds to  oversee those programs, we have to make some changes. To those people  whose feelings were hurt and those people who maybe had to find a  different path in their careers, I reach out to you with a heavy heart.   But I want to close by saying: Ali Mayorkas is a good man. He is a  great nominee. He served us before, and he will do it again. Let's give  him our votes.
