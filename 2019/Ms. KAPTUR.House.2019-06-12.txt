 Mr. Chairman, I thank our able Chairwoman Nita Lowey and  Ranking Member Kay Granger for leading our Appropriations Committee in  doing the real work of America on a bipartisan basis.   Our Energy and Water bill makes critical investments in energy and  water systems to sustain life on Earth by combating climate change,  advancing energy science to yield innovation, building water  infrastructure and flood control systems, and investing in necessary  nuclear security programs.   First, I would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, who has  been a very constructive and able partner, and also thank our staff,  including Jaime Shimek, Angie Giancarlo, Mark Arnone, Mike Brain,  Marcel Caldwell, Scott McKee, Farouk Ophaso, and Matt Kaplan, for their  hard work in putting this good bill together.   This bill rejects the President's drastic and shortsighted proposed  cuts that would harm our Nation's interests. Instead, our bill  increases investments to meet serious national priorities in energy and  water and, of course, nuclear security.   Addressing the needs of the future, economically and environmentally,  requires that our Nation be at the forefront of global innovation. Our  bill moves our Nation forward on that front.   Further, American companies require means to ship goods efficiently  in a highly competitive global marketplace. Our bill helps them  succeed.   Finally, ensuring water and electricity for millions of Americans is  fundamental. We provide additional support toward those priorities.   How do we achieve this? By providing $7.4 billion for the Army Corps  of Engineers, an increase--yes, an increase--of $357 million above 2019  and $2.5 billion above the budget request. To understand why, simply  listen to any news program and what is happening across this country.   This bill invests in key water priorities across our Nation by  funding countless regional priorities, including robust funding for the  Soo Locks construction project, and by starting the pathway for the  Brandon Road invasive species Asian bighead carp control project to,  literally, save the Great Lakes.   This bill's robust funding for the Army Corps of Engineers is  critical to this Nation's economic vitality.   We provide $1.63 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation, an increase  of $83 million from 2019 and $523 million above the budget request.   Overall, our bill provides $37.1 billion for the Department of  Energy, an increase of $1.4 billion from 2019 and $5.6 billion above  the budget request.   We recognize the difficulties of serving a rising population with all  of the climate change challenges facing this and the next generation.  Within the Department of Energy, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Energy program receives $2.65 billion, $273 million above 2019 and $2.3  billion above the budget request.   This includes robust funding for the Weatherization Assistance  Program, which helps ensure low-income households and communities  across this country have energy-efficient, more livable homes.   Advanced Energy Research, ARPA-E, receives $425 million, $59 million  above 2019 and a rejection of the President's proposal to eliminate the  future. We fund this program.   The Office of Science receives $6.87 billion, $285 million above 2019  and $1.3 billion above the budget request.   Our bill responsibly funds our Nation's nuclear deterrent, as well as  increases funding for nonproliferation efforts while rejecting costly,  poorly defined, and duplicative activities proposed by the  administration.   The National Nuclear Security Administration receives $15.9 billion,  a $666 million increase above 2019.   And, finally, this bill ensures the executive branch cannot divert  essential Army Corps funding for a border wall.                                time  1445    In sum, this bill invests in innovation programs at the Department of  Energy to yield future opportunities and jobs. It promotes economic  prosperity and bolsters trade.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding me the  additional time.   Our bill helps address the many challenges facing our Great Lakes,  the largest collection of fresh water on the planet. Our bill prepares  our country to mitigate and adapt to climate change, with challenges  like the desertization of the West, as well as coastal resiliency on  the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Great Lakes coasts.   Our bill is more necessary than ever to build and gird America going  forward in the great spirit of the quote above the Speaker's rostrum  here in the House by Daniel Webster, uttered in 1825: ``Let us develop  the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its  institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also  in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be  remembered.''   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Do what is  right for America. Vote for this bill.
