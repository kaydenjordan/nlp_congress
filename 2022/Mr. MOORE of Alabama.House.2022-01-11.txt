 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss an  important issue in Alabama and across the Nation. Chronic wasting  disease is a neurological disease that affects deer, moose, and elk,  and it is 100 percent fatal. Unfortunately, there is no known cure. CWD  could absolutely devastate deer hunting in Alabama and the revenue it  brings in each year.   I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5608, the Chronic Wasting Disease  Research and Management Act, which passed the House of Representatives  last month.  [[Page H23]]  This bill will help research and prevent chronic wasting disease from  spreading further, protecting Alabama's deer herds, outdoor economy,  and traditions.   Last week, the first case of CWD was reported in Alabama. While there  is currently only one case, it is important that we do what we can to  prevent this terrible disease from spreading even further. I am hopeful  the Senate will answer the call and take up this legislation so  important to Alabama and our Nation.   I will do whatever I can in Washington to help prevent CWD from  taking hold in Alabama.                            ____________________
