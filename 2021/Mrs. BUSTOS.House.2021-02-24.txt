 Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank the citizen soldiers and  airmen of our National Guard for upholding their oath to the  Constitution.   Just 1 week after the attack on our Capitol, the inauguration of  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was peaceful. That  is thanks to the 26,700 National Guardsmen and -women who answered our  Nation's call to serve at this moment of need.   Their motto is ``Always Ready, Always There.'' During the past month,  their actions have fully embodied that motto.   Like Lieutenant Colonel John Bryk, who juggles his commitment to our  Nation with his commitment to the students he serves in Orland Park  School District in my home State of Illinois, he is one of more than  nearly 1,000 Illinois Guardsmen and -women who have been deployed to  Washington. There are still 500 here right now.   I met with some of them this morning. I will meet with more of them  tomorrow. Illinois' sons and daughters, who have chosen to serve and  protect this government body and this sacred building, we are stronger  for their sacrifice, and I thank them for their service.                            ____________________
