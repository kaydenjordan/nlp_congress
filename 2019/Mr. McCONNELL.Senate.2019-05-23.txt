 Mr. President, Monday, of course, is Memorial Day.  Americans will take time out of our ordinary routine and busy lives to  remember the men and women who paid the ultimate price for the security  of our Nation and the liberty we cherish.   We mourn every young American whose sacrifice has furthered the cause  of our founding ideals, and we acknowledge in a special way the Gold  Star families they leave behind--parents, spouses, and children whose  grief is only matched by the facts of a grateful Nation.   As President Reagan said one Memorial Day, across the river at  Arlington: ``Today is the day we put aside to remember fallen heroes  and to pray that no heroes will ever have to die for us again.''   So while this day is a day for honoring and remembering, in  particular, our fallen heroes, it is natural that our thoughts also  turn to the brave men and women who are currently serving. I am  thinking of the service men and women who are defending our country  overseas and especially those engaged in combat in Afghanistan and  Syria, all those stationed in the Middle East who are threatened by  Iran, and those holding the line in Asia against the threats from North  Korea.   We are tremendously grateful for our military's efforts these last 18  years to keep America safe from terrorism and their ongoing work to  combat al-Qaida, fight ISIS, and to help stabilize Afghanistan.   Of course, I am particularly mindful of the members of the Kentucky  National Guard and the many soldiers of Kentucky-based Active-Duty  units who are deployed in harm's way.   In light of the recent intelligence, we are also keenly aware of the  critical role our military is playing at this very moment to deter  Iranian aggression.   The administration engaged Members of Congress earlier this week to  brief us on the growing threat and detail the steps the administration  is taking to address it.   I am grateful our U.S. military has already taken proven steps to  improve the posture of our forces so they are ready to defend our  servicemembers, military vessels, and diplomatic facilities and deter  attacks by Iran or its proxies all across the region.   Nobody wants a conflict with Iran. We have heard clearly from the  President and his senior advisers that the administration's objective  is to deter Iran from engaging in threatening acts that increase the  risk of such a conflict.   We all know that, particularly when dealing with hostile actors,  peace is a function of strength. So it is essential that even amid  other partisan political disagreements, we remain one unified Nation.  America must give Iran no reason--no reason--to misjudge our resolve.   Whatever disputes my colleagues may have with the administration  about other issues, I hope we can avoid politicizing any differences  about this  [[Page S3066]]  particular threat and work together to keep America safe.   I also want to mention the American diplomats who are also hard at  work overseas. We know that many of them, too, are stationed in harm's  way, as we remember from repeated Iranian-backed attacks over many  years on our Embassy in Baghdad or the murder of Ambassador Chris  Stevens in Benghazi.   We are grateful for the talent and the hard work they have deployed-- often, hand in hand with our military--to advance American interests,  preserve peace, prevent miscalculation, and deter conflict. I know I  speak for all of my colleagues when I say I hope their efforts are  heeded.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different matter, as I stated, the  Senate will not adjourn this week until we have voted on legislation to  deliver long, overdue relief funding for communities that have been hit  hard by natural disasters.   None of my colleagues need to hear me recite yet again why action in  this area is such an important priority and why it is so urgently  needed. It is a shame that this overdue subject has been allowed to  languish for so long due to extraneous questions and, frankly, partisan  small-ball.   Wildfire victims in the Western States don't want to hear about House  Democrats' various disagreements with the White House on a variety of  issues. They simply want the relief they need and have been waiting  for.   The same goes for the flooded Midwest, the hurricane-ravaged  Southeast, and the Kentuckians I myself represent. They don't want to  hear about more Washington difficulties. They want an outcome.   And, of course, everyone is well aware that we have an ongoing  humanitarian crisis on our southern border and that our Federal  Government needs more resources to deal with it. Even the New York  Times editorial board wrote a few weeks ago:         As resources are strained and the system buckles, the       misery grows. Something needs to be done. Soon.    That is the New York Times.   The editorial went on:         [T]he program that deals with unaccompanied minors is       expected to run dry next month. . . . Democrats need to find       a way to provide money for adequate shelter.    That is the New York Times.   And here was the title of the editorial, believe it or not:  ``Congress, Give Trump His Border Money.'' That is in the New York  Times.   So on all these matters, it is past time--way past time to bring  these negotiations to a close.   I thank Chairman Shelby and all of our colleagues whose leadership  has brought a bipartisan and bicameral solution this close to the  finish line--this close. I implore our counterparts in the House and my  colleagues in this Chamber to quickly resolve the last few issues and  produce compromise legislation today. We need to do this today because,  one way or another, the Senate is not leaving without taking action. We  are going to vote this week, and I sincerely hope we will be voting on  a bicameral and bipartisan, negotiated solution that could become law  for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this week, Senator Kaine and I  introduced new legislation to raise the national minimum age for  purchasing tobacco products to 21. Now, it has generated some attention  that Senators from Kentucky and Virginia--States with some connection  to tobacco farming and production--are sponsoring this legislation,  but, as I said Monday, Kentucky farmers don't want their children  forming nicotine addictions in middle school or high school any more  than anyone else.   Well, it turns out a lot of people across the country feel the same  way we do. We have already seen more than a dozen experts, advocates,  and public health groups come to rally around our legislation. One such  organization said that the proposal would ``support smoking prevention  among a population that is particularly susceptible to addiction, whose  brains are still developing, and among whom nicotine use can have long- term developmental harms.''   When you consider the design of our approach, it is hardly surprising  that leading voices in this area are lining up with enthusiasm. It is  practical, it is within our reach, and it can become law. Our  legislation simply works from the foundation of existing law. We take  the existing mechanisms that are in Federal statute today to enforce  the 18-year minimum standard and replace ``18'' with ``21.'' It is  simple, it is straightforward, and it builds on what we know works.   Not only does this approach streamline implementation for addressing  a widely acknowledged public health crisis, but it also preserves the  freedom of individual States to go even further in their efforts to  protect vulnerable youth. Yet it ensures States cannot enact anything  less protective than the Federal T21 standard.   As I said earlier in the week, all youth below the age of 21 deserve  the same protections from the public health crisis of nicotine  addiction. Anyone who actually reads our bill will see that our  intentions are clear and above reproach. Partisan griping will not save  lives, nor will it prevent even more middle schoolers from yielding to  potentially deadly addiction. As one advocate put it, ``Every extra day  it takes to put this important legislation into effect is an  opportunity for thousands more kids to access a tobacco product that  can damage their developing brains.''   Now is the time for us to join together in a bipartisan manner and  actually get a result that our Nation's youth so obviously need. In  just 3 days since introduction, I have been encouraged by the support  the Tobacco-Free Youth Act has received. I look forward to working with  each of our colleagues to make it a reality and fight back against the  scourge of addiction among America's young people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 91,  H.R. 2157.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed be  agreed to.    I ask unanimous consent that the Shelby-Leahy  substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; that Senator Shelby or  his designee be recognized to make a motion to waive any budget points  of order; further, that if the motion to waive is agreed to, the bill,  as amended, be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, all week, Chairman Shelby and a number  of our colleagues worked tirelessly to get a supplemental funding  agreement for disaster relief over the finish line. He has prepared one  thoughtful, good-faith compromise after another.   In fact, this has been going on for months now: compromise offer  after compromise offer from Republicans--constant engagement and good- faith work. So I am pleased that, today, all of this hard work has at  long last paid off. Thanks to the efforts from a number of our  colleagues and thanks to the leadership of President Trump and his  administration--and, I might add, the occupant of the Chair, who has  been extremely persistent in this effort over the last weeks and  months--the Senate has now passed a compromise solution  [[Page S3086]]  for disaster funding, and we have sent it over to the House.   Regretfully, they are gone.   The President has indicated he supports it. So the Senate's  bipartisan vote is a big step toward making law and actually delivering  the relief that communities across our Nation sorely need.   I am sorry that our House Democratic colleagues blocked commonsense  efforts to include funding in this legislation for the ongoing  humanitarian crisis down on the southern border. Despite days of  negotiations, House Democrats insisted that we could not provide more  funding for our overwhelmed agencies, which are running on fumes,  without including other poison-pill policy riders. As a result, today's  agreement omits those needed resources.   This wasn't money for the wall or even law enforcement. It was money  so that the Federal Government can continue to house, feed, and care  for the men, women, and children showing up along our southern border-- money for agencies that are currently, literally, running on fumes.   This is money that is so uncontroversial--so uncontroversial--that  even the New York Times published an editorial titled, ``Congress, Give  Trump His Border Money.''   Even the New York Times blasted the ``political gamesmanship [that]  threatens to hold up desperately needed resources.'' That is what they  called it--political gamesmanship.   Well, I am sorry to say their political gamesmanship did hold up  these resources. Apparently, our House Democratic colleagues heard  ``President Trump'' and the word ``border'' in the same sentence and  decided they preferred no action at all to the sensible compromise that  even the New York Times had called for.   It is too bad that partisan spite has infected even such blindingly  obvious priorities as the humanitarian efforts on our own southern  border. I am sorry that our Democratic friends have become so committed  to ``the resistance'' that they are now to the left of the New York  Times editorial board.   Nevertheless, we should celebrate the progress we are making today.  The Senate passage of this legislation marks a huge step forward for  communities across the United States that have gone far too long  without receiving this Federal assistance to help them get back on  their feet.   Finally, the millions of Americans who have grappled with nature's  worst are closer to receiving the supplemental aid they urgently need  for the western communities that are still sorting through the ashes of  last year's record-breaking wildfires; our coastal states in the  Southeast and Puerto Rico, where hurricane damage punched holes in  homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure; the Deep South  communities victimized by tornadoes; and for those still grappling with  the floodwaters that have surged over farms and towns across the  Midwest and in my own State of Kentucky.   So I am grateful and relieved that Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy,  and colleagues of ours, including Senators Perdue, Isakson, Rick Scott,  Rubio, Ernst, Thune, Blunt, Sasse, and others have brought us to this  point with their tireless work on this subject.   I am grateful to the President for his leadership and focus on  getting an outcome. I am glad we passed this legislation and sent it to  the House. I urge our colleagues over in the House to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 78,  S. 1332.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today it is my high honor to pay  tribute to a genuine Kentucky hero. As a member of the greatest  generation, Alvin H. Perry of Wilmore, KY, personifies the greatest  values of our Nation. In the Second World War, he fought with the  Allied forces of freedom to defeat one of the greatest evils the world  has ever known. In doing so, Alvin earned the lasting admiration of his  countrymen and the gratitude of the free world.   To commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day, the largest amphibious  invasion in world history, the French Republic will express its thanks  and respect to Alvin in a special way. At a ceremony in Wilmore, the  Consul General of France responsible for Kentucky Guillaume Lacroix  will present Alvin, now 95, with his nation's highest distinction: the  Legion of Honor Medal.   The American and French people share a unique bond of friendship. As  our consequential ally during the War of Independence, our two  countries stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the pursuit of liberty and  equality. Years later, millions of American soldiers would fight in  France to defend those same principles. More than 100,000 of them would  make the ultimate sacrifice there, and tens of thousands of our heroic  fallen rest in French soil forevermore.   There is perhaps no better display of this brotherhood among nations  than the events during Operation Overlord. On the beaches of Normandy  and across the French countryside, American forces once more came to  the defense of our friends and our shared ideals. It was during the  Battle of Normandy that PFC Alvin Perry and his 331st Infantry  Regiment, 83rd Infantry Division, took their first steps onto the  European continent fighting for the liberation of France.   During the battle, Alvin was wounded, struck with a bullet in his  shoulder. He was unable to receive proper medical attention and, along  with other members of his unit, was later captured by the enemy. Alvin  spent the following 10 months as a prisoner of war near Munich, where  he endured brutal conditions and forced labor in a Nazi camp. He  struggled each day, relying upon aid parcels for survival. But through  all his hardships, Alvin never faltered or resigned to defeat. At long  last, it was the sight of an Allied tank that finally meant liberation  for this brave soldier. It also marked the end of his wartime service.  Like his father and brother who also served in uniform, Alvin bravely  defended our democracy and our American way of life.   When Alvin returned home to Kentucky, he was adorned with the  Prisoner of War Medal, the Purple Heart Medal, the Good Conduct Medal,  and the World War II Victory Medal for his intrepid service in France.  Now, after more than seven decades, Alvin will add another well- deserved decoration.   Originally founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, the National Order  of the Legion of Honor is bestowed only on those who render the highest  levels of service to the French Republic and her people. Receiving the  honor, Alvin joins a distinguished membership that includes Secretary  of State Colin Powell, General George C. Patton, and First Lady Eleanor  Roosevelt.   Our Nation's veterans deserve our utmost respect and gratitude, and I  am grateful for the chance to honor this particular hero. So, it is my  sincere privilege to congratulate Alvin for receiving this impressive  distinction. Through his service and sacrifice, he has made us all  quite proud. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me, the people of  Kentucky, and the French Republic in thanking Alvin Perry for his  service to the cause of human freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.
