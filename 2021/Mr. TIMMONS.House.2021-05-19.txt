 Madam Speaker, there are nearly 8 million job openings  in the United States right now, yet the Federal Government is currently  paying people to stay home instead of going to work.   Last year, the government took steps to protect and support the  American people during a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. It was the  right thing to do at the time. Now science tells us that we can resume  life as normal.   Federal money was able to support workers during the peak of the  pandemic, but now the best recovery plan is employment. The answer to  our supply chain issues, rising unemployment rate, and inflation is not  to continue to throw trillions of dollars at this problem. The real  solution is to get people back to work.   We need to follow the lead of States, like my home State of South  Carolina, and discontinue participation in the Federal unemployment  programs.   Vaccines are available to anyone who chooses to get one. Let's get  back to work.                            ____________________
