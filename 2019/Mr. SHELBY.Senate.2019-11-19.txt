 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of  James Bill ``Jimmy'' Koikos, beloved coowner of Bessemer's famous  Bright Star restaurant. Jimmy passed away on November 16, 2019, at the  age of 81. I had the honor of knowing Jimmy, as I frequented the Bright  Star many times during his 60 years of running the institution.   Jimmy was born and raised in Bessemer, AL, just miles from the  restaurant. He attended Arlington School and then Bessemer High School,  where he played high school football. Jimmy then attended the  University of Alabama until 1959, when a visit from his mother changed  his plans. She informed him of his uncle's decision to retire,  prompting him to move home to manage the Bright Star with his father,  Bill Koikos. Jimmy believed in the restaurant, and he knew he wanted to  be a part of the Bright Star's continued success.   Nine years later, Jimmy's younger brother, Nicky, joined him in  managing the restaurant. The two brothers went on to work side-by-side  as owner-operators of the Bright Star until Jimmy's death. As his  brother fondly remembered not long ago, ``He's the heart and soul of  the restaurant, and it's going to be hard to replace that.''   I will always remember Jimmy for his kindness and ability to make  customers feel at home when they visited the Bright Star. He generously  greeted each person who entered the establishment. He promised his  father he would take care of the restaurant, and that is exactly what  he did.   Because of the hard work of Jimmy and others who spent their lives  devoted to the Bright Star, it began to draw national attention. In  2010, the James Beard Foundation honored the Bright Star with an  America's Classics Award, distinguishing the restaurant for its  timeless appeal and quality food that reflects the character of the  community.   As a huge Alabama fan, Jimmy was always ecstatic when the Bright Star  attracted Alabama football coaches like Bear Bryant, Gene Stallings,  and Nick Saban. He would also frequent Alabama football practices,  bringing along some of the famous icebox pies for the coaches, players,  and staff.   Jimmy even went as far as to ensure that the Bright Star would be  taken care of when he was gone, asking a younger relative, Andreas  Anastassakis, to move to Bessemer and carry on the legacy of the Bright  Star. Anastassakis was honored.   Jimmy Koikos's legacy will live on through the people whose lives he  touched at the Bright Star, in the community and throughout the entire  State of Alabama. I offer my deepest condolences to his brother Nick,  his  [[Page S6668]]  sister Helen, and all of his loved ones. I am proud to have known him,  and I will always think of him when passing through Bessemer to visit  one of my very favorite places, the Bright Star.                            ____________________
