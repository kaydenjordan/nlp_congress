 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Fire Marshal Rick Later of Beaverhead County for his 40  years of service protecting the folks of Dillon and Beaverhead County.   Later's experience with firefighting began in 1974, when he joined  the Dillon Volunteer Fire Department as a volunteer. After decades of  volunteer service, Later became fire marshal in 2003. In his new role,  he was given the responsibility of not only managing fire safety and  prevention in Dillon, but overseeing the safety of Montanans across  Fire District No. 2.   The district stretches from Glen, to the south end of the reservoir,  to Horse Prairie to Bannack. Spanning over 5,500 square miles, the  county is roughly the size of the State of Connecticut.   As fire marshal, Later ran the fire hall diligently every day. He  oversaw equipment maintenance and managed fire investigations and  building inspections. He also worked closely with the Dillon City  Council and developed a relationship with the Beaverhead County  Planning Board and Zoning Commission.   Later's service to his community and commitment to volunteering is  exemplary of the Montana spirit. I commend him for 40 years of service,  and I join the folks in Dillon and Beaverhead County in gratitude for  his insight and leadership over the years.                            ____________________
