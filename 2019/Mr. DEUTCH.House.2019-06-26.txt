 Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this entire  [[Page H5184]]  amendment, in particular, the Jayapal-Deutch amendment to bolster the  Federal Election Commission's enforcement of prohibitions against  foreign interference in American elections.   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said: ``Frankly, the  United States is under attack,'' and, ``The intelligence community  continues to be concerned about the threats of upcoming U.S. elections  . . . in 2020.''   FBI Director Christopher Wray said that our adversaries are  ``adapting'' and ``upping their game'' as we head into the 2020  elections.   The people charged with protecting our national security are ringing  alarm bells. That is why it is so troubling to hear President Trump say  that he would listen to a foreign power's election assistance and  maybe--maybe--call the FBI.   Well, FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub responded to the President's comments  with alarm, when she said: ``I would not have thought that I needed to  say this. . . . Let me make something 100 percent clear: It is illegal  for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a  foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.''   It is true, she shouldn't have to say that, and Representative  Jayapal and I shouldn't have to file this amendment. It should be clear  to every American that our elections are for Americans to have a say in  their government and should be defended against foreign interference.  But, apparently, the President needs some clarity.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and support elections  free from foreign interference.
