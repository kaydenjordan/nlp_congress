 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment to H.R. 2740.   Last fall, President Trump signed into law the comprehensive opioid  package. Included in that package was the POWER Act, which provides  competitive grants to hospitals in high-overdose or rural areas. Sadly,  Congress has not yet funded that program.   The grants included in the POWER Act will help provide emergency  rooms the resources they need to offer overdose patients not only  short-term care, but the long-term treatment that is proven to help  prevent repeat overdoses.   This bipartisan amendment, introduced with my colleague from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), would fund the grant program with  the $10 million Congress has already previously authorized.   Madam Chairman, if we believe this is a good program and we voted to  authorize it, then let's vote for this amendment and fund it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, again, let's do something novel here.  Let's do what we say we were going to do. Let's fund this program. I  ask for support for this bipartisan amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
