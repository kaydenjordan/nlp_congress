 Mr. President, as you may know, small businesses are  thriving in one of the best economic climates that we have seen in  several years. The National Federation of Independent Business's Small  Business Optimism Index for August saw its highest reading ever over  its 45-year history and the MetLife and Chamber of Commerce's most  recent quarterly Small Business Index found that a substantial majority  of small business owners have a positive outlook of their business and  of the overall economy.   I believe that this uptick in small business confidence is due in  large part  [[Page S6808]]  to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed the Senate and was signed into  law last year. Over the 9 months since its passage, our country has  witnessed the positive impact that the law has had on our economy.  Companies of all sizes have directly benefited from various provisions  of the law and as a result are paying out bonuses, raising wages, and  purchasing new equipment for their businesses. As chairman of the  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I was a strong  supporter of the tax law because I believed it would allow small  business owners to keep more of their hard-earned money, make more  investments in their businesses, and increase the overall health of our  economy. Over the last few months, I have been making this series of  speeches to draw attention to the benefits this law provides for small  businesses.   Since passage of the law, many observers have given too much  attention to individuals and corporations that have benefited from  certain provisions of the law, but not nearly enough attention has been  given to the benefits that small businesses have received. I rise today  to spotlight how tax reform is benefiting Sko-Die, Inc., a small  business located just outside of Chicago in Morton Grove, IL. Sko-Die,  Inc., provides their customers with high-quality steel laminations,  heavy gauge metal stampings, and machining services. From design to  production, the company provides original equipment manufacturing  services for a variety of sectors including the food, power generation,  medical, and aerospace industries. Sko-Die is a family-run business  started in 1947 by the Steininger family. The current president,  Patrick Steininger, has led the company since 2002 and is the third  generation of the family to helm the company. Sko-Die has about 70  employees, boasts a 60,000-thousand-square foot production facility,  and operates numerous punch presses ranging in size from 5 to 300 tons.   Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this family-owned custom metal  stamping business has been able to pass on some its tax savings to  employees, raising the average wages of its employees by about 3  percent. Sko-Die also made a $1 million investment in new equipment,  which included a new die grinder and a new metal press. Before the  implementation of the new tax law, small businesses had to deal with a  complex expensing formula that took many years to take advantage of,  which made equipment purchases much less attractive to small business  owners. The accelerated depreciation of equipment purchases for small  businesses is one of the many reasons that I was a strong supporter of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Overall, the new tax law has been good for small businesses; has  allowed many small businesses to increase their capital investments,  hire additional workers, and increase wages; and will lower small  businesses' annual tax payments. I am happy to see that small  businesses like Sko-Die, Inc., are able to reduce their tax burden by  making use of this accelerated depreciation provision and are using  those tax savings to raise its employees' wages. I look forward to  watching the company's continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho is home to many innovative,  ambitious, and industrious small businesses. Today I would like to  honor a small business that represents all of these qualities. As  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct privilege to recognize Walsh  Engineering Services as the Small Business of the Month for October  2018. Walsh Engineering Services is a woman-owned design and  architectural engineering firm, which provides high-quality technical  and design services to various public and private sector customers  throughout Idaho and around the country.   Located in Idaho Falls, ID, Walsh Engineering Services was founded by  Stephanie Walsh along with a group of dedicated engineers. An Idaho  Falls native, Stephanie was raised in a potato farming family and went  on to graduate from the University of Idaho with a degree in mechanical  engineering. After graduation, Stephanie returned home and began  working for the Department of Energy's Idaho National Lab. While at the  INL, Stephanie recognized the emerging need for expert contractors at  one of our country's most important nuclear research centers. In 2005,  Stephanie finally took the plunge and founded Walsh Engineering  Services. Owning her own business and working with the INL as a  contractor allowed her to continue to work to meet the needs of the  INL, as well as those of a growing Southeastern Idaho.   Since its founding, Walsh Engineering Services has grown from a small  group of dedicated engineers and designer-drafters, to a full-service  engineering and architecture firm staffed by architects, cost  estimators, and support personnel. Their goal has always been to  provide high-quality, reliable, and responsive professional technical  services to their customers. Their clients have expanded over the years  from the INL to other DOE National Laboratories, the State of Idaho  Department of Public Works, and fabrication firms located throughout  the country. Stephanie is an outstanding example of Idaho's unique  entrepreneurial spirit and is an inspiration to women entrepreneurs  across the great State of Idaho.   As you may know, October has been designated as National Women's  Small Business Month. This month, we celebrate the critical  contributions that women like Stephanie Walsh make to our country's  economy every day. There are more than 9.9 million women-owned small  business in the United States, employing over 8 million people. In  2017, women-owned small businesses generated over $1.4 trillion in  sales. I am pleased to honor a great women-owned small business this  month in Walsh Engineering. Stephanie Walsh and her employees at Walsh  Engineering exemplifies the perseverance and hard work that lead women- owned small businesses to success.   Stephanie's team at Walsh Engineering Services is committed to  supporting INL's mission of clean energy, national security, science,  and the environment. While Stephanie founded the company to support the  changing needs of the INL, Walsh Engineering Services is also focused  on training the next generation of workers to continue the history of  professionalism and success at the INL. The firm not only offers jobs  to recent graduates of Idahoan universities but also develops the next  generation of engineers through the firm's internship program.   Stephanie is proof of Idaho's unique entrepreneurial spirit. Through  her hard work, expertise, and reputation for quality work, Stephanie's  company has grown over the past 13 years and now employs approximately  75 Idahoans who provide valuable contracting services to public and  private entities. Stephanie Walsh is a great example to both young  female engineers and woman entrepreneurs throughout Idaho and the  Nation. I would like to congratulate Stephanie and all of the employees  at Walsh Engineering Services for being named the Small Business of the  Month for October 2018. I wish you good luck in your future endeavors  and look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
