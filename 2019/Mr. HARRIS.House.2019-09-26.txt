 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, a physician, a  father, and a grandfather, it has become clear to me that certain  provisions under the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, have proven to  be completely unaffordable and unsustainable. These stifling  regulations have simultaneously forced an increase in insurance  premiums and a decrease in patient choice.   That is why Representative Budd and I introduced H.R. 4484 yesterday,  the Flexibility Through Lower Expenses Healthcare, or FLEX Act. This  bill will codify into law the Trump administration's rules on short- term limited duration insurance and association health plans.   It will allow small businesses and self-employed workers the  opportunity to secure more affordable health insurance by banding  together to act as one large employer, and it will open the door for  individuals to purchase temporary affordable health insurance for up to  1 year.   The FLEX Act will provide the necessary flexibility and affordability  that Americans have been seeking in their healthcare, free of the  strain and expense that have, unfortunately, become the new normal  under ObamaCare.                            ____________________
