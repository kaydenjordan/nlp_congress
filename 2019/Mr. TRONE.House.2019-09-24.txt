 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of more than 23 million Americans who are in recovery.   September is National Recovery Month. In 2019 we are celebrating 30  years of that designation. We are marking that today in Congress with  an effort we are calling ``Congress Goes Purple''.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Denver Riggleman, Annie  Kuster, and Brian Fitzpatrick for partnering with me to make this  happen.   Those among us who are struggling with mental health concerns or  substance use disorder need to know there is no shame in seeking help.  Their journey to recovery is something to be celebrated.   These disorders don't discriminate, and neither should we in helping  find people a path back. I came to Congress to help make recovery a  real possibility for more Americans.   Starting in the mid-1990s, we have seen opioids invade and destroy  families across America. From the district I represent in Maryland to  big cities and small towns across the country, there is not a single  community that has not been fully spared from the devastating effects  of the opioid epidemic. It is a true crisis.   For the first time in 100 years, we have seen life expectancy decline  for 3 straight years in this country. Americans are dying sooner than  their parents' generation, and we can blame the opioid epidemic.   The numbers are staggering. Last year, we saw over 70,000 people die  of a drug overdose. More Americans have died in 1 year of drug overdose  than from the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined.   Behind each one of those numbers is a person. Behind each one of  those numbers is a family and a community that feels the immense pain  and loss. My family was one of those.   In 2016, on New Year's Eve, my nephew Ian Jacob Trone died of a  fentanyl overdose. He was 24 years old, and he died alone in his hotel  room.   I worked with Ian for over 5 years while he was struggling with  addiction. We tried treatment centers and halfway houses and mental  health specialists. I worked closely with him to do everything I could  to get him the help he needed, and we still lost him.   Unfortunately, it is not just addiction numbers that are staggering.  SAMHSA estimates in 2017, over 19 million people in the U.S.  experienced substance use disorder, but of that group, 8.5 million also  had a co-occurring mental illness.   This is the most important issue in America. We must act now and stop  more people from losing their lives. I know if we are going to make a  difference, then all of us, including the Federal Government, need to  act. That is why, as a new Member of Congress, ending the opioid  addiction epidemic is my number one priority.   I have started a bipartisan freshman working group, which is now  composed of 64 lawmakers from 31 States all dedicated to ending this  epidemic. Together, we are pushing bills that will bring consistent  funding and resources to those on the front lines who are fighting this  every day. Most importantly, we are doing this together, both Democrats  and Republicans. Every action we take is bipartisan. We need to work  together if we are going to end the stigma around mental health and  substance use disorders.   Right now someone suffering from substance use disorder is being  thrown into jail instead of getting the treatment they need. We need to  start treating this like the disease that it is. Instead of locking  people up in jail, we need to reach out and give those that are  struggling a helping hand.   That is why the message of National Recovery Month is so powerful. We  can be that village. Together, we know this is a disease, not a crime.  Together, we can put the focus on recovery so that no one has to do  this alone.   Madam Speaker, I pledge to do everything in my power to make sure we  end it. I thank the Representatives wearing purple today for  recognizing the importance of National Recovery Month.                            ____________________
