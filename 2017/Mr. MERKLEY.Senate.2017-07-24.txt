 Mr. President, I rise to address the Republican plan to  have a vote to proceed to a healthcare bill tomorrow. The only  challenge is that we have no idea what bill we are being asked to  proceed to. This is hardly the way a democratic republic operates in  which the leader of the majority says: We want to come to the floor  with no committee deliberation, no consultation with healthcare  experts, no dialogue with the public, no amendments in committee of any  kind, and vote on a mystery bill.   The biggest mystery to me is how it is possible that the majority of  Republicans are taking seriously a plan to rip healthcare from 20  million-plus Americans in order to give fabulous giveaways to the  richest among us. The bill they entertained previously would have given  $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--$33 billion. I have mentioned  this number before. Some journalists have quoted it as $33 million, and  some citizens have said that I meant $33,000. No. It is $33 billion to  the richest 400 Americans--enough funds to pay for Medicaid for 700,000  people.   What individual would say it is moral to rip healthcare away from 20  million people in order to give tax breaks to the very richest among  us? In some misguided, mysterious way, something has gotten ahold of  the hearts and minds of my colleagues and made them think this was some  kind of good idea to do so much damage to so many.   In fact, we have been having this conversation since January. It was  earlier this year, when President Trump was sworn in, when the majority  said: We are going to come to the floor of the Senate, and we are going  to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans in short order.   Here we are 6 months later, and it has not happened yet--in part  because when people look at the details, they start to raise questions.   It took a long time for the House to send a bill over to the Senate,  and then the Senate proceeded to work on this bill with a group of 13  secret Senators--working in a secret room, in secret meetings--with the  public not allowed, with fellow Senators not allowed. They came up with  a bill that looked very much like the House bill, and we will talk more  about that later.   The President said in his campaign and throughout much of this year:  You are going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the  cost, and it is going to be so easy.   Well, it has not been that easy. We have seen the President back a  plan from the House and invite everyone over to celebrate at the White  House and get the champagne bottles out and say how wonderful it was  that the House had passed this healthcare bill--this bill that would  strip healthcare from more than 20 million Americans. Then, a couple of  weeks later, someone explained to him what was in that bill, and he  said: Oh, well, that bill is mean and heartless. Then the secret 13  here in the Senate meet, and they come out with a very similar bill.  And now Trump is all excited; now we have a really good bill, except  that in a single year, it would do even more damage to healthcare in  America.    Along the way, the President moderated his dialogue a bit and said:  Who knew healthcare could be so complicated? Well, Mr. President, most  of the people in America realize we have a complicated healthcare  system. We have an overlapping system of six different systems of  healthcare. It really is quite messy and difficult. It would be great  if we could, in fact, adopt a much simpler system. And I certainly have  [[Page S4159]]  been advocating for us to have a much simpler system, so just by right  of being an American, you are born into this world and you have  healthcare. That is the way most developed nations do it, but not here  in the United States of America. We have a great healthcare system for  the very wealthy, and we have a very complicated, stressful system for  everyone else.   What are we going to vote on tomorrow? I wish the majority leader  would come to the floor and tell us. Will we vote on a motion to  proceed to a bill that looks like--what? What can you tell us? Is it  TrumpCare 3.0? How does it differ from TrumpCare 1.0 or 2.0? Will it  have the Cruz amendment in it for fake insurance, the provision that  would do enormous damage on both ends of the insurance market,  providing fake insurance policies to the young and the healthy and  destabilizing healthcare and putting it into a death spiral for  everyone else? Or, Mr. Majority Leader, maybe you could come and tell  us if you are planning a straight repeal of the ACA--a straight repeal  that would raise costs and premiums even higher and not just rip  healthcare from 20-plus million people, but from 30 million-plus  people, a plan that would be even more devastating than the previous  plan. Is that what you want us to vote to proceed to tomorrow?   I can tell you that we shouldn't be voting to proceed to any version  on healthcare, something that so affects the peace of mind and the  quality of life of Americans. We should be operating like a democracy,  like a democratic republic--holding committee hearings, holding a  conversation. This is what we did when we talked about the ACA those  several years ago. We had more than 100 committee meetings,  roundtables, and walk-throughs here in the U.S. Senate. We had the  single longest markup of a healthcare bill in the HELP Committee ever  in the history of the United States. We had the second longest session  marking up the bill in the Finance Committee. We had the entertainment  of hundreds and hundreds of amendments, and we adopted over 100  Republican amendments. There was a very public, extended process, with  a ton of time to go home and consult with healthcare experts and  stakeholders in our own States and with the most important  stakeholders--the citizens of the United States of America--the men and  women and sons and daughters and grandparents. How did they feel about  these changes?   Well, as everyone knows, President Trump did call the House bill mean  and heartless, but we just keep getting bills that are meaner and more  heartless. The House bill would kick 23 million people off insurance  over the next decade and 14 million just next year. The subsequent  bills don't look that different.   The secret 13 here in the Senate went and did their deliberations,  adopted pretty much the same thing as the Senate, only they made it  worse. That June Senate bill would kick 15 million off in a single  year, rather than 14 million. And then we had the brilliant idea of a  repeal-only bill, which would do even worse, kicking 17 million people  off in a single year and 32 million off within the 10-year period.   Then we have the bill that isn't even on here because we didn't get a  Congressional Budget Office score on it; that is, the special Cruz fake  insurance amendment bill--the one that would say: Hey, insurance  companies, you can offer policies that are not worth the paper they are  written on. Oh, they are very appealing. There is a health insurance  policy. You only have to pay $40 a month. Isn't that great? And then  the policyholder who has it, they get in a car accident, they get a  broken bone, and they find out the emergency room is not covered, the x  rays are not covered, the cast is not covered, the doctor is not  covered. Nothing is covered. That is why it is fake insurance. That is  why it costs only $40 a month. It might as well be 40 cents a month,  for all we care, because it just doesn't cover anything.   Then, your spouse--your wife--has the great, joyful news that you are  going to have a child together, and guess what. Maternity care is not  covered. Can you imagine in this modern era not covering maternity  care? Yet, before the Affordable Care Act, many, many policies in  America didn't cover maternity care.   Well, in addition, these brilliant plans by my colleagues would cause  premiums to skyrocket. Then, we have, of course, the fact that they do  diabolical things to those who have preexisting conditions.   Now, let me spend a little more time on the special Cruz fake  insurance version of this. Yes, it gave those very cheap policies that  aren't worth the paper they are printed on to the young and the  healthy. But then, those who are older--those who are sick or have  injuries or have preexisting conditions or are concerned that they may  develop difficult medical issues--they need to buy a policy that  actually covers the things that one would expect, that has an essential  benefits package, the same as every single policy in America today has.  But, because the young and the healthy are buying the fake policies,  that means that the costs skyrocket on the policies with the essential  care benefits. As a result of that, more people bail out who feel like  they are not directly in danger of getting sicker or injured, and then  the cost of the policy goes up even more. It is a death spiral  for insurance: fake insurance at one end, destruction of the insurance  market at the other end.    So my colleagues decided to not even share the Congressional Budget  Office analysis of that bill. It was that bad.   Let's see what some folks said about this. Larry Levitt, senior Vice  President of the Kaiser Family Foundation said: ``If there were a Joy  of Cooking for insurance, this would be the perfect recipe for  destabilizing the market and turning the marketplaces into high-risk  pools.''   That is his comment about the Cruz fake insurance plan.   Let's turn to a joint letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield and from  America's Health Insurance Plans about the Cruz insurance plan, the  Cruz fake insurance plan. Their letter says: ``It is simply unworkable  in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing  medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread  terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the  individual market.''   Or how about an article in the Atlantic by Vann Newkirk, published  just a week ago, July 14 of this year: ``The Cruz amendment creates  almost a textbook scenario of wide-scale adverse selection--whereby  riskier and more expensive patients wind up concentrated in risk  pools--and entirely undermines any tools for managing that adverse  selection.''   That is a fancy way of talking about the death spiral in insurance  for those who are not young and healthy.   Then we go to the conversation that CBO says is the worst option of  all: 17 million would lose coverage in the first year and 32 million by  2026 under the repeal-only plan. Next year, in just 1 year, premiums  would skyrocket above what they might have gone to anyway by an  additional 25 percent.   Now, our majority leader likes to say that wouldn't actually happen  because provisions in the bill don't go into effect for 2 years. Well,  these estimates and these commentaries take that into account, because  the destabilization in the marketplace begins immediately. Does anyone  really think insurance companies are going to stick around the  marketplace that they don't know is going to exist in 1 or 2 years?   This repeal-and-run strategy would throw our healthcare industry into  chaos. If you think it is a good plan, well, I have some beachfront  property in Arizona you might want to buy.   Every version of this Republican TrumpCare plan is worse and worse  for the American people, yet these are the options that are being put  forward. The majority leader wants us to vote to proceed to this set of  undesirables tomorrow, these undesirable--in fact, ``undesirable'' is  just too kind of a word for these policies. These are despicable. These  are destructive. These are, as the President said, mean and hard- hearted.   Shouldn't we try to pursue options that will make our healthcare  system work better? That is what we need to do. Let's start by nailing  down the cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs. These payments are a  lifeline to more than 12 million low-income Americans. They lower the  premiums, and they lower the deductibles. They are important sources of  stability for  [[Page S4160]]  insurance companies. But our President has said: I am not sure I want  to release these CSR payments. So what happens with that? Insurance  companies have to assume they are not going to get them, so they are  raising their rates or perhaps bailing out of the market completely.   If these CSR payments are terminated, insurers may leave these  exchanges altogether. For those who do stay in, the average premiums  for silver plans would need to increase by 19 percent just to  compensate for the loss of the CSRs. Because insurance companies are  like any other business, they need to know how much they are going to  be paid if they provide a product, and right now, they don't know.   Let's hear what some have had to say. When the insurance company  Anthem pulled out of Ohio in June--last month--the company cited  ``continual changes in Federal operations, rules and guidance'' as the  main reason for exiting the marketplace.   The company also said that ``the individual market remains volatile  and the lack of certainty of funding for cost sharing reduction  subsidies . . . does not provide a sustainable path forward.''   Then there is Brad Wilson, the president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of  North Carolina, who said:         The biggest single reason for that rate increase is the       lack of the federal funding for Cost Sharing Reduction       Payments in 2018. We cannot assume nor should we that the       money is going to be there based on what we know today.    At another point Mr. Wilson was quoted as saying:         The failure of the administration and the House to bring       certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our company       to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that       is materially lower. . . . The rate increase would be 8.8       percent if the CSRs were guaranteed for 2018.    A single-digit increase versus more than a 20-percent increase, and  they have to go with the higher increase because they don't know if the  President is going to make the payments that he is obliged to make.   I think a piece from the Baltimore Sun from May 5 describes the  situation we find ourselves in best, when it says:         It's not the problems in the Affordable Care Act exchanges       that are driving the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare.       It's the Republican effort to kill Obamacare that's causing       problems in the exchanges.    President Trump and the Congressional Republicans are trying to  exacerbate them. He closes by saying: ``No wonder rates are going up.''   This really does make clear the situation. The President wants to say  the exchanges have problems so we need to repeal and run or repeal and  replace. Our answer to the exchanges having problems is to drive 20  million people-plus off healthcare, maybe 30 million people off  healthcare. In fact, the exchanges are having problems because they are  being sabotaged by President Trump and our Republican colleagues;  first, by wiping out the reinsurance proposal, which enables companies  to go into a new area and compete but only if they have insurance  against getting a disproportionate share of the really sick people.  That is a very logical part of an insurance plan which encourages  companies to go into new markets to compete, and my colleagues  sabotaged it.   The cost-sharing reduction payments we just talked about, a very key  part of lowering premiums and making the policies affordable so  struggling, hard-working Americans can buy those policies and have  lower premiums and lower deductibles, but my colleagues and President  Trump have sabotaged it.   That is not a service to the American people. Maybe they feel they  are doing a service--to whom? To the rich who can buy insurance without  any of this effort to provide insurance throughout our society. Do my  colleagues really want a world in which we only have wealth care? That  is healthcare that only the wealthy can buy. Do they really want to  denigrate, tear down, and destroy the quality of life of millions of  their constituents by pursuing this path?   It was not that long ago that Franklin Roosevelt said: ``The test of  our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who  have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.''   But in their bills, my colleagues have been saying: We want to give  massive tax giveaways to those who have the most by ripping healthcare  away from those who are struggling, hard-working Americans.   It is the opposite. It is the opposite of the belief that we are all  in this together, and we want a foundation for every family to thrive.  I want a foundation for every family to thrive. That means peace of  mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will get the care they  need. It is the peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they  will not end up bankrupt.   We are not just talking about ripping healthcare insurance away from  more than 20 million people. We are talking about ripping peace of mind  away from 20 million people. We are not just talking about those  individuals. We are talking about undermining the rural and urban  healthcare infrastructure which helps everyone.   I have been out in very rural, Republican parts of my State holding  townhalls. I am hearing from those who are in clinics, and they have  improved considerably. Some of them have doubled their number of  employees over the last 8 years because of the support for healthcare  clinics in the ACA and also because their uncompensated care--the  number of people they were serving who couldn't pay their bills--has  dropped enormously.   So not only have they been able to employ a lot more people providing  healthcare in the community, but they have been able to do additional  things. They have been able to provide more preventive services, more  mental health services, and so forth. So it has been a big win for  rural America, and my colleagues want to tear that down. That just  doesn't make any sense at all.   That is why everyone here should vote unanimously to oppose going  onto a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow. There is so much we could do  together if we want to improve healthcare: fix those CSRs; provide a  fix to reinsurance; proceed to have a full enrollment period rather  than cutting it short; retain and reinforce the individual mandates so  those who have insurance are covered throughout the spectrum, from the  young and healthy to those who are older; provide the sort of  advertising that enables people to sign up and make the signup process  a lot easier than it is right now. There is so much we can do together  to make our healthcare system work better.   My colleagues have come to the floor tonight to say this really  matters. Quit playing games with people's lives, quit trying to destroy  the foundation for our families to thrive, and vote no on a motion to  proceed to a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
