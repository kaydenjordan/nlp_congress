 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time  to me.   Mr. Speaker, at this moment I would like to speak on behalf of the  people who I represent, the people of the Virgin Islands.   I am thankful that this House has decided that they wanted to work in  a bipartisan manner on supplemental aid for the unprecedented disasters  that have occurred in the Virgin Islands.   I did hear the voice of so many of my colleagues who said that they  would be willing to do whatever was necessary to support the people of  the Virgin Islands.   But right now, as I stand here, people of the Virgin Islands, almost  60 percent of them, still do not have power.                                time  1545    I have no power in my own home, and those of you in Florida, Texas,  and in other places would not stand for that. But you expect us to  stand for it. We are supposed to muddle through.   We are only supposed to have hope this Christmas of what is supposed  to come?   Mr. Speaker, you can have hope at your Christmas dinner because you  have got some lights on. My house I will go empty to, it will be cold,  and it will be dark there until my husband and I crank up the generator  and get it going for a couple of hours so that maybe we can wash, cook  some food, and turn it back off again later in the day.   Today, I am urging my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4667, not  because I don't want supplemental support, not because the people of  the Virgin Islands don't need it, but because I understand that I have  said, when this measure was unveiled, that the funding in this bill is  woefully insufficient, and it has not improved since that time.   This measure provides only $81 billion to be split between Texas,  Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other places. If history  is any indication, that money is not going to get to the people of the  Virgin Islands, because while the California delegation and the Texas  delegation can lobby in late hours to get what they need in the bill, I  am the only person from the Virgin Islands here to support the people  of the Virgin Islands. Not only do I not get invited to those  negotiations, I don't even have a vote when the bill that comes to  providing for the people that I represent comes on this floor.   One of the things that is noticeably absent from this disaster  package is funding for Medicaid programs, the same type of funding that  was put in, in discussions for Katrina, for the people of Texas and  Louisiana.   The government of the Virgin Islands cannot shoulder the current  burden of the local matching requirements for Medicaid funding which  the government of the Virgin Islands has recently submitted to be $64  million and an additional $50 million. The government of the Virgin  Islands has respectfully requested that the Medicaid provisions, that  the cap be removed, the arbitrary cap be removed for us for a period of  time for us to be stabilized and for 100 percent the same way it was  for Katrina in other places be given to us.   Now, the people of the Virgin Islands and the people of Puerto Rico-- I know it may be news to many people--but we are U.S. citizens. We  decide to live on an island because that is where we were brought.    Because of that, we have been treated  disproportionately and unfairly in the ways that some of this funding  has come about.   In addition, the bill does not include important local cost-share  waivers for the Virgin Islands and contains unnecessary limitations on  the ability of the Virgin Islands to use Federal assistance to rebuild  with more resilience.   Furthermore, the Virgin Islands cannot wait for the community  development funds provided in this bill. HUD should immediately award  community development funds to the Virgin Islands on the damage  assessments that have been completed.   Those are things that I can get around. Those are real support in a  real bill that is really working in a bipartisan way to help all  Americans--not just delegations who can get together in the dark of the  night and in the cold of the night and make provisions for themselves  leaving those of us. I have told my colleagues on this side of the  aisle that they are going to pick off Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands, we are going to be left out.   Some of you are going to get what you want, and you are going to vote  for  [[Page H10393]]  this. Once again, the people who have no vote on this floor, the people  who have no say in this country, although they are U.S. citizens, are  going to be left out.   Mr. Speaker, I am urging all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
