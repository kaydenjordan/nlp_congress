 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment  be modified with the form I have placed at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, salmon recovery is economically and  culturally important to the country.   Recovery efforts must be rooted in science to address the most  prevalent threats: fish passage at dams, pesticides, fishing pressures,  interactions with hatchery fish, and habitat loss.   Currently, there is very little scientific evidence that sea lion  predation has played a significant role in the overall decline of these  salmon stocks.   My amendment would rectify this lack of scientific evidence by  requiring the Secretary of the Interior study and report to Congress on  the effects of lethal takings of sea lions on the recovery of salmon  stocks in the Columbia River system.   If we are going to expand the lethal takings of sea lions, we should  make sure it will help the salmon recover.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
