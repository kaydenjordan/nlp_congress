 Mr. Speaker, the brownfields  program has been a notable success in our Nation's history, and I want  to applaud all of the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee as  well as the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for supporting  this legislation.   The brownfields program has helped to transform and clean up  countless abandoned, idled, or potentially contaminated commercial and  industrial sites all across the United States. These once blighted  areas within our communities are now valuable tracts of land thanks to  the brownfields program.   As a Congresswoman from north Texas, I have seen firsthand the  benefits that brownfields redevelopment brings to a community. A 72- acre site in my district now known as Victory Park was transformed by  the brownfields program from an industrial wasteland populated by an  old paint factory and an abandoned packing house. Since then, and  thanks in large part to the brownfields program, this same plot is now  home to the American Airlines Center and other retail and commercial  space and high-level housing.   This is just one example in my congressional district and across the  country of how successful we can be in converting depressed, decaying  areas into vibrant economic and cultural centers that can increase  employment and productivity in a region, placing sites on the tax roll  rather than the tax dole.   This is why I stand together with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support H.R. 3017.   The bill will take the important step to reauthorize brownfields  approval through 2022. While the bill represents a flat  reauthorization, it makes crucial changes to the program that will  improve the way States, cities, counties, and other stakeholders are  able to utilize brownfields sites.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we will support this legislation.
