 Mr. President, reserving my right to object, the Senator  from Oklahoma, as he always does, has very thoughtfully identified a  problem that is affecting our military forces. And he has also  identified the complex interplay between different aspects of the law:  article 32, article 10, the authority of the Governor, the authority of  the Secretary of Defense, legislation we might have passed.   This is an issue that, I think, bears close scrutiny, and I would  like to assist in such scrutiny. But in terms of preemptively adopting  a statute tonight without such scrutiny, I would be compelled to  object.   So, Mr. President, with all due respect to the Senator from Oklahoma,  I would object.
