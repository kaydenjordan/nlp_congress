 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding. This is just annoying to me that everyone on the Republican  side is so concerned about the children before they are born, and once  they are born, they want nothing to do with them.   So these children land in the hands of grandmama who is trying to  raise them alone. The only time I see them is when they are on the  floor fussing about grandmama's Social Security and her Medicare,  trying to take away her food stamps while she is trying to take care of  Nina's children, Jose's children, and all of these children. Shame on  you. You have never carried a baby for 9 months. Shame, shame, shame.
