 Mr. President, when I was a kid, I used to like to read  the comics in the newspaper every day. Usually, it was some interesting  caricature of real life that was particularly funny. Yet the sorts of  caricatures we have been seeing in the past few days about the  President's nominee to the CIA are not funny and are not comical at  all. What we have seen is a gross caricature of this woman's  distinguished 33-year career. I am talking about Gina Haspel at the  CIA.    Our Democratic colleagues are stuck in the past. They are trying to,  really, tag her with some of the more controversial episodes during the  aftermath of 9/11. The fact is, that is a caricature of her three  decades of hard work and service in spanning the globe while working in  the intelligence community and trying to keep America safe. They, of  course, need to get their facts straight regarding the episodes they  complain about. The fact is that they have all been investigated, and  Gina Haspel has been exonerated. They are wrong to ignore everything  else she has done in her career, as well as the fact that she will be  the first woman Director of the Central Intelligence Agency--someone  enormously popular with the rank and file in her having come from  within their ranks.   The particular episodes that we will hear talked about tomorrow at  the open hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  involve enhanced interrogation techniques that were used in isolated  instances in the days immediately following 9/11. These programs were,  of course, vetted by all appropriate legal advisors and were depended  upon in good faith by intelligence officers and the Department of  Defense. Congressional leaders were briefed on them and had no  objection because the threat immediately after 9/11 was that al-Qaida  had been meeting with some Pakistani nuclear scientists, perhaps with  the objective of getting a nuclear device that they could use to kill  more Americans and more innocent people. This was, truly, an emergency  situation, and policymakers were demanding that our military and  intelligence community do everything they could to prevent another 9/11  attack.   It is fundamentally unfair for some to want to change the rules after  the fact now that we are feeling safe and secure, and it is obscene to  hold intelligence officials responsible for policy decisions that they  did not make but which they were charged with executing. We expected  them to be executed--``we'' being the policymakers in the executive and  legislative branches.   I mentioned the declassified 2011 Michael Morell memo yesterday,  which exonerates Ms. Haspel from this allegation that she somehow  played a part in destroying videotapes of enhanced interrogation. In  the memo, Morell, who was then the Acting Director of the CIA, found no  fault with Ms. Haspel's performance and indicated that she acted  appropriately in her role as it related to carrying out her  supervisor's orders. Again, she was not the one who actually destroyed  the tapes but, rather, acted on her supervisor's instructions to draft  a cable that she expected to be vetted with the appropriate authorities  and policymakers within the CIA structure.   Mr. Morell himself added a statement following the memo's release  that Ms. Haspel did not destroy the videotapes of the enhanced  interrogation techniques that were used on post-9/11 detainees. He said  that she did not oversee their destruction either, and she did not  order their destruction.   Nevertheless, I will bet one is going to hear a lot about this at  tomorrow's hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is  unfair to focus on an isolated event in an attempt to try to suggest  that she acted inappropriately when her supervisors, including the  Acting Director of the CIA, found no fault with her actions, and any  allegations that she bore personal responsibility for destroying the  videotapes have been affirmatively disproven.   We know from her career timeline that was produced by the CIA that  Ms. Haspel spoke French and Spanish prior to joining the CIA and  learned Turkish and Russian. That is interesting because, in fact, we  can't know a lot in a public setting of some of her classified  activities as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. That is the  nature of the work, that being that intelligence officers willingly  accept the responsibility to keep classified information secret so as  not to expose sources and methods that would endanger lives and  undermine our ability to get intelligence to our policymakers so they  can make good decisions.   Clearly, she is a student of languages and cultures around the  world--exactly the kind of person you would want to lead an agency that  operates internationally, like the Central Intelligence Agency. We know  from declassified documents that she had field assignments in Africa  and Europe in the late eighties and nineties and then went on to become  station chief at multiple locations before becoming the Deputy Director  of the CIA. When she worked abroad in the eighties, she encountered  none other than Mother Teresa and helped arrange a phone call between  Mother Teresa and President Reagan. Then she visited a local orphanage  with the famous nun.   Of course, as I said, we can't talk about all of the details of her  invaluable years of service here on the Senate floor because much of  that information remains classified. Indeed, tomorrow, we will have an  open, declassified setting, followed by a closed, classified setting so  members of the committee can get answers to their questions. Yet we do  know about some of the successes that the CIA and the U.S. Government  achieved during the 30-plus years she served, and some of those are  worth mentioning here.  [[Page S2535]]    I am talking, first and foremost, about killing al-Qaida's key  leaders and undermining the terrorist group's operations. We, of  course, remember the raid that killed Osama bin Laden 7 years ago,  which was the culmination of many years of advanced intelligence  operations by people just like Gina Haspel. The CIA is responsible for  collecting the dots and then connecting the dots so that policymakers  can make important decisions, as in President Obama's decision to take  out Osama bin Laden once he had been located. The CIA and Gina Haspel  deserve tremendous credit for the indispensable role she and they  played.   There are also things like the disruption of Najibullah Zazi's plot  to bomb the subway in New York in 2009--another major intelligence and  law enforcement success. An al-Qaida recruit, Zazi trained with the  group in Pakistan and returned to the United States to build explosives  for what could have been a devastating attack. According to news  reports, it was through our intelligence collection efforts that we  identified Zazi and that he was eventually arrested and convicted. The  CIA is involved in far more than just counterterrorism operations. It  deserves credit for all other equally important work, as well, some of  which Ms. Haspel and her colleagues, undoubtedly, participated in.   We know the intelligence community targets all aspects of  international criminal organizations, for example, and, of course,  there are many more successes that will never see the light of day  because those wins must be kept secret so that ongoing operations and  sources that supply information and tactical methods are protected so  they can remain useful in the future.   As Jane Harman--a 9-term former Democratic Member of the House of  Representatives--wrote not long ago:         The [Intelligence Community] has been the tip of America's       spear for decades. Selfless men and women have put their       lives on the line--often doing work their families are       unaware of--to keep us safe, and they have. Yes, there have       been some tragic failures, but far more impressive successes.    That is from one of our former Democratic colleagues. Her words, of  course, apply to Ms. Haspel's career as much as they do to any other  intelligence professional's.   Ms. Haspel has put her life on the line to keep us safe, not for the  glory, because most of what she has done has happened undercover in a  way that does not reveal important sources and methods or expose other  people to retaliation or attack. When we consider her nomination this  week, we must see it in the light of all of the CIA's successes, not as  a caricature and misrepresentation of a couple of events that occurred  post-9/11. Men and women like her do what they do not because of the  notoriety. It is just the opposite. They do it because they love their  country and want to prevent it from harm. Ms. Haspel is no exception,  and she is deserving of our profound appreciation. To demonstrate that  appreciation, we need to get her confirmed.
