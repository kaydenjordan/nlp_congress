 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of El  Paso native Special Agent Anthony Salas.   Anthony was with the DPS for 9 years. Prior to that, Anthony served  in the Marines. He was a true patriot.   Anthony sadly passed away on January 22. He is survived by his wife,  Lizzett, and his three children: Alessandra, Isabella, and Luke.   Anthony was a special operations group operator involved in a traffic  crash during the arrest of six migrants in Eagle Pass. Maverick County  sadly has become the epicenter of the border crisis.   Agents put their lives on the line every single day. My heart goes  out to his family, and America is grateful for his service.                            ____________________
