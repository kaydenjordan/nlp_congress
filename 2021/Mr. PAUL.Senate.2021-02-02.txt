 Madam President, I voted to confirm the nomination of Pete  Buttigieg to be Secretary of the Department of Transportation. As a  former mayor, Secretary Buttigieg understands that infrastructure in a  state of good repair is crucial to economic growth. For too long,  American infrastructure has gone without proper investment, while we  simultaneously engage in a two-decade-long adventure to remake and  rebuild the Middle East. Rather than increase gas taxes, I hope to work  with Secretary Buttigieg and the rest of the Biden administration to  put an end to endless wars, stop building infrastructure in  Afghanistan, and start building infrastructure in America.                            ____________________
