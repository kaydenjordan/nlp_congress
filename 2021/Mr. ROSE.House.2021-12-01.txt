 Madam Speaker, today, the United States Supreme Court will  hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a major pro-life  case that focuses on protecting the unborn, not restricting the rights  of women.   Instead of prioritizing the abortion industry, we as a Nation should  be focused on prioritizing the sanctity of human life.   As the father to two sons, Guy and Sam, and having lost a son, Mack  Wayne, at 19 weeks in the womb, I strongly believe life begins at  conception and that an unborn child is a human life.   Thanks to modern medical advancement, we know that: at 5 weeks,  unborn babies have a heartbeat; at 10 weeks, unborn babies have  developed arms and legs and fingers and toes; at 12 weeks, unborn  babies feel pain; at 15 weeks, unborn babies have a fully developed  heart.   This landmark case gives the Supreme Court a chance to correct the  mistake it made nearly 50 years ago and the opportunity to acknowledge  that our Constitution does protect an unborn child's right to life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for  yielding to me tonight. And in fact, Putnam County is my home county.   Madam Speaker, Tennesseans and Americans throughout the country who  are already hurting from higher prices, widespread shortages, and fewer  choices believe President Biden's Build Back Better agenda will cause  inflation to skyrocket even further.   This social spending scam breaks President Biden's zero-cost promise.  Contrary to what President Biden and his far left Democratic allies  have consistently maintained, this bill is not fully paid for. In fact,  it is not even close.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, it  is expected to add $367 billion to the national debt. That is a massive  amount of deficit spending that our children and grandchildren will  have to pay back, but it doesn't even begin to tell the whole story.  The Democrats used a long list of budgetary gimmicks to artificially  lower the CBO score spending number of $367 billion.   The highly respected Wharton School of Business performed their own  expert analysis without budget gimmicks, and they found that the actual  amount of deficit spending from Biden's socialist Build Back Better  legislation will, in fact, add over $300 billion to the national debt.                                time  1715    Americans all across the country and from all walks of life can sense  how bad this bill is going to affect our economy and add to our already  sky-high inflation rate.   Democrats' Build Back Better bill is not just extraordinarily costly,  it is also destructive. To put it simply, as radical as this tax-and- spend spending spree is, other aspects of this bill are just as bad.  While far left Democrats and Speaker Pelosi proudly revel in the  passage of this bill, it is clear they have no connection to the needs  and wants of the hardworking Tennesseans whom I represent, nor the  majority of Americans across the country.   As my colleagues and I have covered, the provisions within this bill  amount to a wish list of far left socialist policies that will have  devastating consequences on American businesses, households, and  families.
