 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Linda Wilson, who recently retired from the U.S.  Department of Education after over 33 years of service to the American  people.  [[Page S380]]    Linda earned a degree from University of Arizona in 1980 before  embarking on a career dedicated to public service. Linda began her  service as a congressional staffer for Representative Millicent Fenwick  from her home State of New Jersey. She then served the people of  Illinois as a legislative aide for Representative Bob Michel. In 1989,  Linda began her service at the U.S. Department of Education, engaging  with State and local officials and congressional offices in both the  Intergovernmental Affairs Office and the Office of Legislation and  Congressional Affairs, serving 9 of the 12 U.S. Secretaries of  Education across political parties.   Linda has been an indispensable resource in my work on the Senate  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Senate  Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member. She assisted me to  solve innumerable problems and concerns important to my constituents.  She provided information about various administrations' implementation  of important Federal programs, such as the Alaska Native Educational  Equity Program, the Native American Language program, the State-Tribal  Education Partnership program, and Impact Aid, in addition to providing  insight into the Department's budget priorities. In addition to her  expertise on these issues, she always approached my questions and  concerns with the utmost diligence and attention, providing the support  necessary for me to craft legislation that meets the needs of my  constituents and the American people.   I am grateful for Linda's professionalism and dedication. I thank her  and congratulate her on her upcoming retirement and wish her well in  the future.                            ____________________
