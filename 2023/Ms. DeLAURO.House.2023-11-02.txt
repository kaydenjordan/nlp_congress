 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Pingree for their work on  this legislation. I would also say thank you to the majority and the  minority staff, particularly Rita Culp, Jocelyn Hunn, and Farouk  Ophaso.   When it comes to caring for the environment--ensuring our air is safe  to breathe, our water is safe to drink, and we are resilient in a  changing climate--this bill takes the side of the most egregious  polluters and climate deniers. This legislation stakes an aggressive  anti-environment stance with a crippling 39 percent cut to the  Environmental Protection Agency. The ensuing collapse of our means of  protecting the environment and public health would mean more asthma  cases, more cancer diagnoses, and more unmitigated natural disasters  afflicting American families.   Let me share a portion of a letter sent to Members of this body from  the League of Conservation Voters and cosigned by 61 environmental  organizations, including the Trust for Public Land and the National  Parks Conservation Association.   They said of this bill:   Following `` . . . a summer full of record heat waves, horrific  flooding, and wildfire smoke blanketing much of the Nation, this bill  would gut the agencies charged with protecting our environment and our  health and would massively undermine last year's historic climate  legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. It would also introduce an  onslaught of extreme anti-environmental policy mandates that have no  place in the appropriations process. This attack on our health, lands,  wildlife, biodiversity, air, water, oceans, and communities is  unacceptable and must be rejected.''   The bill cuts the EPA's clean air program by at least $200 million  and eliminates funds for environmental justice. It cuts the EPA's  infrastructure grant programs by a staggering $1.8 billion. These are  not numbers on a page. We are talking about the air in our skies and in  our lungs. This is the water we drink, bathe in, and cook with. These  are basic life necessities that we have a simple obligation to protect  for the American people.   In addition to endangering the global climate and public health, this  bill slashes funding for the arts, including the National Endowment for  the Arts' flagship Grants for Arts Projects program which benefits  individual and community well-being and supports the economy in all of  our 435 congressional districts. This bill will prohibit the  Smithsonian from highlighting the contributions of Latinos in U.S.  history and culture by not making it possible to move forward with the  national museum of the American Latino making Hispanics invisible. This  is shameful, and it does not represent America's values.   The ramifications of cuts in this bill would reach every corner of  the Interior Department. It damages our public lands, promotes dirty  energy, jeopardizes biodiversity, and disarms America in the face of  the climate crisis. Sharp cuts to the National Park Service means fewer  seasonal employees and furloughing existing permanent park employees.  The funding loss translates to dozens of employees who are trying to do  their job every single day at Yellowstone National Park, Glacier  National Park, Sequoia National Park, and Zion National Park, and many  more of our Nation's prized national parks being furloughed. These are  beloved public lands, and these cuts will mean longer wait times and  fewer services available when our constituents  [[Page H5245]]  and visitors from around the globe travel to experience these jewels of  our Nation's geographic diversity.   The majority is also opening our public lands--the property of the  American people--for oil, gas, and mineral leasing, in some cases going  as far as blocking judicial review of these transactions. The majority  is hindering clean energy projects while promoting fossil fuels lease  sales, and the majority is accelerating ecosystem decline by abandoning  protections for our most vulnerable apex predators like the gray wolf  and grizzly bear.   I have proudly worked across the aisle to protect our environment for  Americans past, present, and future, and I am immensely disappointed to  see the majority abandon their commitment to conserving America's  fragile lands and natural resources. I would not think Republicans need  reminding of their own party's history, but this bill is a notable  reversal from the proud and bold conservation efforts of the  Republicans I have worked with in decades past. I need not remind my  colleagues which President created the EPA: Richard M. Nixon.   Finally, as we continue to see in each of these partisan bills, this  legislation includes riders that prohibit funding diversity, equity and  inclusion, and accessibility in the Federal workforce, none of which  belong in any bill, but especially appropriations.   With its dangerous and costly cuts and indefensible riders, I must  vote against this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. It  will take bipartisan support to get the 2024 Interior bill signed into  law, and this bill does not achieve that. I appeal to my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to end this partisan charade and join with  Democrats at the negotiating table.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we live with deepening crises around the world, and  America's leadership is being challenged like at no other juncture in  our history. You can be sure Putin is watching. Ayatollah Khamenei is  watching. Are they going to see a united and strong America that shows  why we are admired and why we are exceptional?   This Congress is called to respond to the crises in Ukraine, Israel,  the Indo-Pacific, and here at home on our border, and I hoped we would  be debating a bill that rose to the seriousness of these crises without  delay. However, this bill fails Israel, and this bill fails the 1,400  Israelis and 36 Americans who were slaughtered in their homes and on  the streets in cold blood.   Those brutal massacres recalled the Holocaust. This is a holocaust, a  different kind of massacre, that demanded that Israel act against Hamas  with the support of the United States.   What the House Republicans have done is unprecedented and will mean  any aid to Israel will be delayed.   First, it puts a poison partisan bill that removes funding to ensure  the richest Americans and corporations pay taxes. It is supposedly paid  for with cuts to the IRS of $14.3 billion, which the CBO says will  nearly double the cost of this bill and add $12 billion to the deficit.  It furthers the Republican goal of keeping billionaires and the big  corporations from paying taxes.   Second, it is conditioning an emergency appropriation. We do not  condition emergency appropriations.   Understand, this is the first time we have conditioned aid to Israel.  Is Israel less important than other national emergencies? Is Israel  just a budget line? Is it just more fodder for the partisan wars that  polarize America?   It is outrageous that a major emergency funding bill in response to  the worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust is tied to  offsets. Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, is reeling from a  terrorist attack and urgently needs our support.   This bill tells our allies that should they find themselves in an  existential war for their democracy and their freedom, we will not put  aside our partisan wars.   This bill abandons Ukraine. We will not abandon Israel, and we will  not abandon Ukraine, but their fortunes are linked.   Ukraine's fight for democracy and sovereignty requires decisive  action and absolute support from the free world. We must act like the  leaders of the free world.   This bill tells America's border communities that they cannot count  on us for security or support.   Let me go to another critical part of this bill. It provides only  military aid. It provides no humanitarian aid for the innocent  civilians caught in the middle of this war. Are you watching the  unfolding of this war and have no humanity?   Let me remind the Speaker of his colleague's nominating speech.  Congresswoman Stefanik recalled ``In God We Trust'' emblazoned over the  Speaker's chair. The Speaker reiterated ``In God We Trust.'' The  Speaker said to look to the Bible to know his thinking, and I, too,  look at my Catholic faith.   In this critical bill, we remove all help for the civilians being  killed in this war.   Hamas is responsible for spreading a humanitarian crisis as it builds  its armaments deep inside civilian centers, but the bombing of the  Jabalia refugee camp created unacceptable civilian losses.   We need a humanitarian pause, and that is why we need a serious bill  that addresses all the national security crises facing our country and  that reaches for support in both parties.   House Democrats are ready to work with House Republicans on  legislation that supports our allies abroad, including Israel and  Ukraine; protects our national security; provides humanitarian  assistance; secures our border; and makes much-needed domestic  investments. House Republicans so far refuse to join us at the  negotiating table.   We need to prove, as we did in the years after World War II and  throughout the Cold War, that we can protect, defend, and nurture  global democracy as the preeminent form of governance at the same time  we serve the American people.                                time  1530    Our allies and the American people have no more time to wait. We must  now act to defend our allies, protect civilians, and serve the American  people's urgent needs. This bill does none of the above, so I urge my  colleagues to withhold their support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development.    Mr. Speaker, to remind my dear friend from Arkansas that  this bill, for the first time, would condition aid to Israel, which is  something we have never done before.   Thank you Ranking Member DeLauro.   Mr. Speaker, the United States faces two immense national security  crises at one time.   Russia's illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine, and Israel's  military response to the barbaric Hamas terrorist attacks of October  7th.   I commend President Biden for swiftly sending a comprehensive  emergency appropriations request that addresses attacks on both  democracies and addresses the crisis in Israel and Gaza.   I fully believe Israel deserves support for its security after  children and families were hunted down and attacked in their own homes  by Hamas terrorists. At the same time our country cannot ignore the  suffering of children and their families in Gaza who are in immediate  danger and desperately need humanitarian assistance and a safe place to  be.   That is why it is so disappointing that a fringe, extreme minority in  the Republican Majority has insisted on bringing this bill to the  floor.   On numerous votes, more than 300 House members on both sides of the  aisle are on record supporting Ukraine's fight for freedom, along with  the Senate and the President.   The Republican bill ignores the urgent need to sustain support for  our NATO allies and Ukraine, effectively abandoning their democracy and  their ability to protect their people against Russian aggression. Putin  himself claims ``if the aid stops tomorrow. [Ukraine] will live for  only a week [until] they run out of ammo.''   This bill fails to include urgently needed humanitarian assistance  for Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are in immediate harm's way.   The situation there currently for families and children is rapidly  deteriorating because countless Palestinians lack access to food, safe  shelter, medical supplies, and even potable water.   Humanitarian assistance must flow faster.   All hostages must be released.   And we must work with the United Nations and regional partners on a  ceasefire that every involved party is held to.   We must work together to bring the conflict to an end before it  escalates further.   Until then, declared safe areas must be truly safe for innocent  civilians in Gaza fleeing violence.   For the security of both Israeli and Palestinian families--the  violence must stop.   Finally, this bill ignores the longstanding bipartisan precedent of  providing emergency appropriations without an offset.   This so-called pay-for cuts funds from IRS tax enforcement that will  only enable more tax evasion by rich tax cheats costing taxpayers  money.   President Biden has alread said he will veto this ill-conceived bill.   We are wasting precious time on a bill that's dead on arrival.   Therefore, I stand in strong opposition and urge my colleagues to  oppose this bill that fails to meet the moment.   We cannot let a handful of extremist MAGA Republicans dictate our  foreign policy.   I yield back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Financial Services and General Government.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the ranking member of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman cared about what is  happening to women, children, and babies, there would be humanitarian  assistance in this package.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, on September 29, the gentleman who just  spoke voted for a billion-dollar cut to Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey, on September  29, voted for a billion-dollar cut in aid to Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Goldman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
