Mr. President, I yield back the time.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Mulvaney  nomination?    Madam President, I also rise today to oppose the  nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   I believe the President should be able to assemble his or her own  team, and I understand that elections have consequences and that a  President should be able to put forth his or her policy agenda. I voted  on this floor many times in support of nominees with whom I have policy  differences, but they have been qualified persons, experienced in their  field, who believe in the fundamental mission of the agency they are  tasked to lead. That is not the case with Attorney General Pruitt. Mr.  Pruitt has extreme environmental policy views, and he has zero  experience running the Environmental Protection Agency. In fact, he  does not believe in the fundamental mission of the EPA. Attorney  General Pruitt made his name opposing EPA rules that protect human  health and the environment--fighting against clean air and clean water,  disregarding the science behind the EPA's protections for human health  and the environment on behalf of for-profit special interests, not the  public interest.   He has brought 19 suits against the EPA. Eight are currently pending  in courts, and if confirmed, he won't recuse himself from all the  pending cases. As a lawyer and especially as your State's top lawyer,  you shouldn't change sides in litigation. It is just not right. There  may be an ethics violation here. I have never heard of a lawyer  representing both sides of a case.   Let's look at just a few examples from his litigation records,  starting with his opposition to clean air. Mr. Pruitt is leading  litigation against the EPA's ozone or smog rule. In 2015 the EPA  revised its ambiant air standards  [[Page S1379]]  for ground level ozone. The EPA was long overdue in revising its ozone  standards to protect public health. It even had to be sued by States  and environmental organizations to make sure the standards adequately  protected human health. High concentrations of ozone are bad for public  health, children, and older adults, and people with lung diseases such  as asthma are especially vulnerable.   The EPA set a standard of 70 parts per billion. This standard is  based on the best science, which included thousands of studies  analyzing the effects of ozone on public health. In addition, the EPA  built in flexibility for States that would have trouble meeting the  standard. But the Oklahoma attorney general currently leads a four- State charge to do away with the rule.   Mr. Pruitt thinks it is OK for powerplants to emit unhealthy levels  of mercury and other toxins into the air. In 2011, the EPA passed the  mercury and air toxics standards. This rule limits emissions from  powerplants of mercury, arsenic, and other metals. Like the ozone  standard, this rule was long overdue, and the EPA was forced by the  courts to develop the standard.   The science is well established that these toxins are a serious  public health threat. Fortunately, there are proven and available  technologies to limit the emissions. Scott Pruitt fought the mercury  and air toxics standards, and he is still litigating in court against  the standards even though the vast majority of powerplants in the  Nation are currently in compliance with the standards.   Just to show you how serious this is in my home State of New Mexico,  pregnant women and children can only eat a very small amount of fish  from the streams of New Mexico. Our streams are polluted with mercury.  The levels are so high that vulnerable populations are advised to  severely limit their consumption. Scott Pruitt wants to continue this  pollution of our streams.   Mr. Pruitt testified in the hearing before the EPW Committee that he  saw a role for the EPA to address pollution that crosses State  boundaries, but his litigation history does not support that testimony.  As Oklahoma attorney general, he fought the EPA's cross-state air  pollution rule, a rule designed to reduce powerplant emissions across  State lines that cause smog and pollution and health problems in  downwind States. Especially, the cross-state air pollution rule reduces  sulfur dioxide, or SO 2, and oxides of nitrogen or NOX  emissions. NOX emissions contribute to fine particle and  soot pollution and to ground level ozone formation, otherwise known as  smog. Even though this pollution affects the air and health of downwind  States, Mr. Pruitt sided with the powerplants.   Air pollution is not the only problem that crosses State lines. River  and stream pollution does not stop at State boundaries either. The EPA  and the U.S. Army passed the clean water rule in 2015. The rule  clarified a dizzying set of Supreme Court cases defining protected  water. The EPA and the Army reviewed the best science, reviewing more  than 1200 peer-reviewed public scientific studies to define protected  waters.   New Mexico is an arid State. We have very little surface water. We  need to protect all of our surface water for domestic, agricultural,  industrial, and recreational uses. By the way, the EPA and the Army's  definition of surface waters is no broader than my own State's  definition of surface waters. New Mexico's definition is appropriate  and reasonable to protect our precious surface water.    The attorney general of Oklahoma is fighting the clean water rule,  too, even though it protects against cross-state pollution.   Here is one more example--the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan  is our country's best effort to address climate change. We know that  climate change is happening. We know that the climate change is  primarily caused by humans. We know that powerplants are a major  contributor. We know that we need to take action and that we need to  take action fast to protect our planet. The Clean Power Plan  significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions from existing, modified,  and future powerplants. The Clean Power Plan was developed based on the  best science. It was developed based on a tremendous amount of input  from the States, industry, environmentalists, and others. It provides  States with a lot of flexibility with how to comply. Mr. Pruitt, true  to form, is litigating against the Clean Power Plan. Mr. Pruitt  apparently does not understand the science of climate change.   In the National Review in 2016, he wrote: ``Scientists continue to  disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its  connection to the actions of mankind.'' During his confirmation  hearing, he similarly stated:         Science tells us that the climate is changing and human       activity in some manner impacts that change. The human       ability to measure the extent of that impact is subject to       continuing debate and dialogue as well as they should be.    That is not what science tells us. That is maybe what fossil fuel  special interests tell him, but that is not what science tells us. His  views are not consistent with the scientific consensus on climate  change. The 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change found it ``extremely likely'' that more than half of the global  warming that occurred between 1951 and 2010 was a consequence of human  emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.   So many of the decisions made and the regulations passed by the EPA  rely heavily upon good science. It is absolutely critical that the EPA  Administrator understand and use the best science.   I am not convinced that Mr. Pruitt understands and will use the best  science if he is confirmed to lead the EPA.   When developing regulations, the EPA must first follow the law's  requirements to protect human health and the environment. Then, within  the law's requirements, the EPA should take account of input and  information from all sources--from industry, environmentalists, States,  and public agencies.   I am not convinced that Mr. Pruitt will follow the law's requirements  to protect public health and the environment, and I am not convinced  that he will take into account the input of all stakeholders.  Throughout his career as attorney general, Mr. Pruitt has aligned  solely with industry and against public health and the environment. He  has no record of aligning with the public or of securing our  environment for the future.   As attorney general, he engaged in a scorched earth policy against  environmental regulations. He dismantled his environmental protection  unit. He became very close politically to the energy industry. He  adopted letters written by energy lobbyists almost verbatim, and then  submitted them on behalf of the State of Oklahoma in Federal legal  proceedings.   As chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association, he became  even more closely aligned with the fossil fuel-related companies.   Mr. Pruitt's record is one-sided and extreme, and it does not give me  confidence that as EPA Administrator he would have any commitment to  protecting the public health now or protecting the environment for  future generations.   Finally, I am concerned that Mr. Pruitt has not shown and does not  have the proper respect for tribal sovereignty. Oklahoma is home to 39  tribes. Mr. Pruitt's litigation history as attorney general has  consistently been anti-tribe. As vice chair of the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs, I pay special attention to a nominee's record on tribal  issues, especially nominees for agencies that will deal with tribes on  a government-to-government basis, like the EPA.   As Oklahoma's top attorney, Mr. Pruitt routinely sought out ways to  fight tribal sovereignty--even all the way to the Highest Court in the  land. In Dollar General Corp. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians,  Mr. Pruitt filed an amicus brief in support of a corporation that  refused to submit to tribal jurisdiction. Mr. Pruitt's side lost. This  case is a prime example of Mr. Pruitt's misguided views of tribe and  their inherent sovereignty. Indian Country needs an EPA Administrator  who respects tribal sovereignty. I am not convinced Mr. Pruitt does.   Just recently we had in town the National Council of American  Indians. They submitted a letter on January 18. I ask unanimous consent  that it be printed in the Record.  [[Page S1380]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                National Congress of                                                American Indians,                                   Washington, DC, January 18, 2016.      Re Indian Country's Concerns with EPA Administrator Nominee           Scott Pruitt.       Hon. John Barrasso,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public           Works, Washington, DC.      Hon. Thomas Carper,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and           Public Works, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: On behalf       of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the       oldest, largest, and most representative American Indian and       Alaska Native organization serving the broad interests of       Tribal governments and communities, I am writing to express       our deep concern with the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney       General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on his history of       fighting environmental regulations and the new       Administration's statements denying the existence of climate       change. The continuing impacts of climate change are a major       concern of Tribal Nations and, before this Committee votes to       move forward with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to       lead the EPA, it must thoroughly consider the potential       impacts that his nomination will have on climate change, the       protection of natural resources, and protection of Tribal       trust and treaty rights.        American Indians and Alaska Natives are disproportionately       impacted by climate change due to our geographical areas and       direct connection and reliance on the surrounding       environments. It is threatening to destroy our lands, waters,       and natural resources, which will impact our traditional and       customary ways of life that has been sustainable for       thousands of years. The well-documented plight of Alaska       Native villages is probably the most profound manifestation       of the climate crisis and requires focused, high priority       attention from the federal government. NCAI's Tribal       leadership and members have spoken strongly on climate change       by passing four resolutions in the past four years calling       for action and setting Tribal Climate Change Principles       calling on further federal action and partnership with Tribal       governments.        The federal government's treaty and trust responsibilities       to protect Indian lands includes the duty to protect lands       from the impacts of climate change, which requires not only       that sufficient federal resources be equitably allocated to       address climate change, but that Tribes be included as       partners to solve these issues. Federal programs and policies       must allow Tribal Nations to engage effectively in adaptation       and mitigation strategies that will help ensure the integrity       of our cultures, homelands, infrastructures, and services.       Further, it is imperative that federal agencies enforce       Tribal treaty and reserved rights to both on- and off-      reservation resources.        The EPA's mission to protect human health and the       environment means that it plays an essential role in fighting       climate change-related impacts. Due to its charge, EPA also       has a sacred responsibility to uphold and protect Tribal       trust and treaty rights through the protection of Tribal       natural resources. In fact, the EPA acknowledges the       importance of reviewing how agency actions will impact treaty       rights in its recent policy guidance EPA Policy on       Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes: Guidance       for Discussing Tribal Treaty Rights.        Since the EPA is critical to combating climate change and       protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights, Indian country is       deeply concerned with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to       head the Agency. It is our understanding that, in his role as       Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, Pruitt has       repeatedly filed suits against the EPA for its regulations       seeking to protect the environment. Further, his nomination       comes from an incoming Administration which claims that       climate change is a ``hoax'' and questions whether the EPA       should continue to exist.        This Committee must ensure that attorney General Pruitt       understands and acknowledges the realities of human impacts       on global climate change, the need for the EPA and federal       regulations to protect the environment, and the importance of       EPA's role in protecting Tribal lands, waters, and natural       resources. We must get his commitment on the record to       sustain the EPA's role in fighting climate change and       protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights. Without these       acknowledgements, Indian Country cannot support Attorney       General Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the EPA.        We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing       climate changes effects from human-made sources. Indian       Country, the United States, and the world cannot afford to       take a backseat role in fighting climate change.            Sincerely,                                                   Brian Cladoosby,                                                         President.     Madam President, I would like to just read a couple of  paragraphs from the letter.         On behalf of the National Congress of American Indians       (NCAI), the oldest, largest, and most representative American       Indian and Alaskan Native organization serving the broad       interests of tribal governments and communities, I am writing       to express our deep concern of the nomination of Oklahoma       attorney general Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency based on his history of       fighting environmental regulations and the new       Administration's statements denying the existence of climate       change. The continuing impacts of climate change are a major       concern of Tribal Nations and, before this Committee votes to       move forward with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to       lead the EPA, it must thoroughly consider the potential       impacts that his nomination will have on climate change, the       protection of natural resources, and protection of Tribal       trust and treaty rights.        American Indians and Alaskan Natives are disproportionately       impacted by climate change due to our geographic areas and       direct connection and reliance on the surrounding       environments. It is threatening to destroy our lands, waters,       and natural resources, which will impact our traditional and       customary ways of life that have been sustainable for       thousands of years.        We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing       climate change effects from human-made sources. Indian       Country, the United States, and the world cannot afford to       take a backseat role in fighting climate change.    In conclusion, my concerns about Mr. Pruitt's record on environmental  policy aren't just because we disagree on policy. Mr. Pruitt has made  his reputation in litigating fiercely against the EPA's most important  regulations to protect public health and the environment, clean air,  clean water, toxics on land--you name it--regulations that comply with  Federal environmental laws that are based on good science, that have  taken years to prepare, and that have taken fair account of all  stakeholders' input.   I cannot support a nominee to lead this Agency whose record is so  hostile to the environment. For all of these reasons, I must vote no on  Mr. Pruitt's nomination to be EPA Administrator.   Finally, we have today the court's ordering Mr. Pruitt to release a  large number of records that are relevant to this particular  nomination. He has refused to release them. The administration, in  vetting him, did a very poor job. As you know, they do not vet anybody.  They throw it up here, and we have to do the vetting. That is our job  to do the vetting. This is a critical part of the record--a vast number  of emails that should be looked at.   Many of us believe we should have the time to look at these emails,  to deliberate about them, to maybe even ask some written questions to  Mr. Pruitt about them, but this nomination is being rammed through. In  a couple of hours, we are going to have a vote. Luckily, Senator  Merkley is going to urge that we vote to delay this so we can have a  chance to look at those emails. It is so that all of us--all of the 100  Senators--have the opportunity to have a full, complete record on Mr.  Pruitt.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
