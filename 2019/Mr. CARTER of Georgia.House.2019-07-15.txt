 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Reverend Carolyn Cubbedge on her retirement from the ministry and  Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church.   Reverend Cubbedge has made a tremendous impact throughout the First  Congressional District of Georgia as Wesley's senior adult pastor. One  of her most notable projects includes her work with Morningstar  Children & Family Services in Brunswick, which provides therapy to  children who have multiple diagnoses of intellectual disabilities. But  this project is only the tip of the iceberg.   Through her work helping the most vulnerable--organizing church  events, her dedication to the ministry, and her breadth of knowledge of  God's word--she has helped Wesley to increase its congregation and  engage those members to make our community a better place to live.   Reverend Cubbedge retired on June 30, and I am both thankful and  proud that we were able to have a woman like her doing God's work in  the First Congressional District of Georgia.   Enjoy your retirement, Reverend Cubbedge                            ____________________
