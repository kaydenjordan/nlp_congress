 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Nevada's Third  Congressional District, I rise today to congratulate the robotics teams  at Nate Mack Elementary and Greenspun Junior High School for advancing  to the VEX Global Robotics Competition.   Nate Mack and Greenspun schools will be representing Nevada in the  global robotics competition in Louisville, Kentucky, beginning April 27  through May 1.   Though these communities served by Nate Mack and Greenspun face  challenges, these students will proudly show the rest of the world the  great diversity and intellect in Nevada's Third District.   On International Women's Day, it is only fitting that I recognize  that these teams embrace girl-powered movement in STEAM and are 50  percent girls.   Just this week, I visited the Nate Mack and Greenspun teams and  talked to the students about their experience. I even got to test-drive  a robot, which was pretty cool.   Today, I want to congratulate the Nate Mack Elementary and Greenspun  Junior High School robotics teams, thank them on behalf of the people  of Nevada's Third District for representing us at the VEX World  Robotics Competition, and wish them the best of luck.                            ____________________
