 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, in the aftermath of disasters,  billions and billions of dollars in claims are often worked out between  local governments, State governments, and FEMA.   In many cases, because disasters are inherently unpredictable,  volatile, and folks are doing what they need to do to help their  communities recover and address these urgent needs, in some cases, not  every i is dotted, not every t is crossed. These minor issues often  become obstacles to these communities being reimbursed and their  ability to recover.   FEMA has an appeals process, Mr. Chairman. In that appeals process,  you basically have FEMA reviewing FEMA. I don't think that that is the  appropriate approach.   Section 618 of the underlying bill has an arbitration process, but  that arbitration process has other Homeland Security officials  reviewing the work of Homeland Security.   There was a better model that was used after the 2005 disasters  whereby an outside board that exists, the Civilian Board of Contract  Appeals, which is an independent body, was brought in to help review  some of these appeals that local and State governments brought forth to  the Corps of Engineers.                                time  0915    It was a better approach. It provided for more thorough evaluation  and, again, the independence of having an outside entity review this.  Our amendment simply improves upon the existing arbitration process in  section 618 of the bill.   I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this  legislation. I think it is very important, and I urge adoption of the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I just want to make note that I do appreciate my friend from Oregon's  comments, and I appreciate his sensitivity to timelines. But that is  what this amendment addresses: timelines. In many cases, our local  government simply cannot continue to carry these debts and not get  reimbursed.   In regard to the amount of money, perhaps $100,000 is not a lot of  money to the city of Portland, but I am going to guess to the city of  Coos Bay it may be important.   In regard to the details of the amendment, Mr. Chairman, I am from  Louisiana. If the gentleman from Oregon can help us make this even  better, then I would be happy to work with him on that. But I think  this is very, very important. Access to due process is important. The  existing process does not allow supplemental material to be considered  to respond to concerns that were raised by agency officials. This is a  good model. It has proven effective in the past, and I urge its  adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment, once again, is  a bipartisan amendment. My good friends Congressman Cedric Richmond,  Congressman Gene Green, Congressman Ralph Abraham, Congressman Clay  Higgins, and Congressman Brian Babin are all supporters of this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple amendment. Following our August  2016 floods in south Louisiana, FEMA came in and provided housing  solutions. The solutions included the utilization of trailers. Because  FEMA needs an acronym for everything, they were called MHUs, mobile  housing units. When you added up the cost to purchase, transport,  store, and set up these things, FEMA was in the hole anywhere from  $120,000 to $170,000 per pop.   Mr. Chairman, you could buy these same units right there in the  vicinity of the flood from local trailer dealers for anywhere from  $28,000 to I think the highest cost we saw was about $40,000, including  setup. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, Mr. Chairman, to realize  that you could get it faster and you are helping to revive the local  economy by using local solutions, as opposed to the case when FEMA is  doing this, when it took months and months and months to give people  even a single housing option in some cases.   So what this amendment does is it simply says that, if a local  entity, a local government entity, if a State entity, can provide a  housing solution for 50 percent of the cost, or less, as compared to  the alternative that FEMA provides, then they can be reimbursed. Mr.  Chairman, this is faster. It saves taxpayer dollars. It stops this  fleecing of American taxpayers that is occurring in the aftermath of  disasters.   Specifically, Mr. Chairman, in Livingston Parish, Sheriff Jason Ard:  his deputies were flooded. Literally, families didn't have anywhere to  go. They had looting in the parish. The sheriff stepped up, established  mobile housing units, trailers, for his deputies to live in so they  didn't have to worry about their families anymore, so they could get  back to doing what they were supposed to be doing: enforcing law in  these destroyed communities. And FEMA is rejecting them.   We have tried to work through the administrative process. I will say  it again: the only way they are reimbursed is if the cost of their  solution was 50 percent or less than that of the Federal Government  alternative, in regard to the mobile housing units.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am sure the gentlewoman from  Texas would be supportive of this, representing many of the flood  victims from Hurricane Harvey. It is important to keep in mind, Mr.  Chairman, that, in many cases, these flood victims don't have other  options. So you may have a trailer from your local trailer dealership;  you may have a tent. In many cases, that is very attractive compared to  being homeless.   I would love to work with the gentleman from Oregon and see if we can  work together to perfect this amendment to address any concerns that he  may have. In regard to the Chinese formaldehyde, I agree with you. If  we can get good old American formaldehyde in our trailers, let's do  that. I am kidding.   But I urge adoption of the amendment. I think this is very important.  We should be commending leaders like Sheriff Ard for stepping up and  providing efficient solutions for disaster survivors.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to state,  in response to the formaldehyde issue, let me be very clear,  formaldehyde was a major issue after Hurricane Katrina in the trailers.  We certainly learned from that, and we absolutely don't need anyone  exposed to it.   So I absolutely agree with the gentleman on that. But I think there  have been better standards, and certainly lessons learned, from what we  experienced with Hurricane Katrina when folks were in these trailers  for long periods of time, and they weren't designed for that purpose,  so I do agree with the gentleman there.   But on this amendment, Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, this is, once  again, a bipartisan amendment. We have the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Richmond), the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Al Green), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist), and other  cosponsors, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), all supporting this  amendment because it is common sense and it responds to true on-the- ground problems that were seen in the aftermath of disasters.   What happens is the current law in the Stafford Act says that any  time you have a flood, if you have a facility like a school, that FEMA  may deduct $500,000 from the recovery for rebuilding that school. Well,  what FEMA has done is they have taken the law that Congress established  where it said ``per facility,'' and they have taken it and they have  abused it. They have now determined that a facility is an individual  building.   So, Mr. Chairman, you may have a classroom building, you may have a  cafeteria, you may have another classroom building, you may have a  gymnasium, you may have a storage room, you may have a concession  stand--in that case, FEMA is applying $500,000 to each individual  building. Now, what adds insult to injury or makes this situation  untenable is the fact that these schools generate the revenue  oftentimes from property taxes in the destroyed community. So they are  losing property taxes, FEMA is hitting them with bills, in some cases,  in Ascension, Livingston, and East Baton Rouge Parishes, that are tens  of millions of dollars each. What this does is it victimizes the  survivors' children. So the kids  [[Page H3718]]  can't get back in schools because the schools can't afford to  reestablish their facilities.   So, look, bottom line is, this is all about preserving congressional  intent. Congress spoke on this. FEMA has trashed the interpretation,  and this is all about preserving congressional intent and getting our  kids back in schools to where they can have the education or  opportunities that they need to have, and they should no longer be  further victimized by FEMA's flawed interpretation of the law.   I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I am more than  happy to work with my friend from Oregon to address any concerns that  he may have to ensure that we have the best solution on this moving  forward.   I will tell you that Republicans and Democrats in Florida, in Texas,  in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin Islands, all across these disaster areas  that we have experienced in the last 2 years are running into this  exact same problem.   And let me just reiterate, Mr. Chairman, what this interpretation,  this flawed interpretation is doing. It is putting an unaffordable bill  before a community that has been destroyed, and it is only victimizing  children because they can't get back in their schools, they can't  resume their education. It is disrupting the resumption of their normal  lives and just further affecting them, and delaying restoration and  recovery of these communities.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
