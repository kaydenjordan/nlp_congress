 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the 33rd  Anniversary of National Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month.   This important commemoration serves to raise awareness and promote  respect for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities,  while also highlighting the importance of inclusion.   It is estimated there are over 4.6 million individuals in the United  States, and over 250,000 individuals in North Texas alone, with  intellectual and developmental disabilities. Texas' Third Congressional  District is home to incredible organizations, including Cornerstone  Ranch, My Possibilities, and LifePath Systems.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize these dedicated  organizations, staff, and volunteers serving as steadfast advocates  fostering opportunity for these individuals to realize their full  potential.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in thanking these organizations for their hard work and  recognizing those with developmental disabilities.                            ____________________
