 Madam Speaker, I will be happy to yield to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my friend, the majority leader of the House  for the purpose of inquiring about the week to come.    Only because we are no longer in the mix as well.    Madam Speaker, I look forward to a robust debate on the  unaptly titled bill, ``Save the Internet.'' I think a lot of people  shiver at the thought of the Federal Government saving us from the  internet.   The title II regulation that would be imposed would allow the  internet to be regulated like a utility. This is not the phone company  of the 1970s. This is probably one of the greatest innovations that  America has produced for the world, allowing us to be a world leader,  dominant leader, in a growing technology field. Primarily because the  government hasn't figured out how to regulate it, it has been able to  grow so robustly.   I would hope that we have that full debate and people are very aware  of the negative connotations and, ultimately, the damaging effects of a  Federal regulation of the internet that could slow down that dramatic  innovation that we have seen with the Federal Government not regulating  it. It will be a robust debate.   Hopefully, we debate a number of other issues. I know we had a robust  debate on the floor just a little while ago on the BDS movement. It is  a growing concern for all of us who feel passionately about Israel's  right to exist as a Jewish State.   I know the leader has been a leader in this Congress and a leader  throughout this country in an incredibly bipartisan way standing up for  that unique relationship, but we have seen threats from other  countries. You have seen heavy debate in Europe.   You have seen debate in areas in Palestinian circles that want to  undermine Israel's right to exist as a Jewish State by trying to  boycott products made in Israel, to crush Israel's economy. That is why  it is so important that we stand up against this BDS movement.   While we weren't successful in the motion to commit, there is  legislation that is incredibly bipartisan.   S. 1, a bill that has come over from the Senate, unfortunately,  hasn't been referred to committee, nor, also, H.R. 336, similar  legislation that would allow us to help support our friends around the  world who want to stand up against the BDS movement and stand with our  good friend Israel.   Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman, is there any plan  to allow either or both of those bills to come to the floor so we can  send a strong message to our friends around the world and to enemies of  Israel, as well, that we are not going to support this BDS movement.   I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, if I could further inquire, S. 1 has not  been referred to committee. Is there a plan to refer the bill to  committee and, ultimately, to allow it to move through the process, as  it has been incredibly bipartisan but also incredibly timely, that we  as the United States Congress stand with our friend Israel and stand  against what is a growing movement that should be of concern to all of  us?   I yield to the gentleman.    That is correct. And I know those pieces of legislation  are just resolutions, not actual policy.   And, ultimately, if we are going to make the stand, it has to be  legislation with teeth, with actual authorizing language and with the  ability for us to give true support to our friends--not just words, but  actions as well.   So, hopefully, we can move both, and I would just continue to urge.   And the gentleman from Maryland's support for Israel is unquestioned  and has been admired by people on both sides. I would just urge that  we, as a House, move those bills, one or both of the actual substantive  bills, to the floor as quickly as possible, as they have already moved  through the Senate.   S. 1 had 77 votes in support--so, strongly bipartisan--coming out of  the Senate, but still no referral in the House. Hopefully, we can get  that expedited.   And with that, on the idea of legislating by resolution, I know that  has been a growing trend in this Congress of this majority to move,  instead of substantive bills to deal with things like lowering  healthcare costs or helping create more jobs.   There have been a lot of bills that are just press releases,  resolutions that  [[Page H3089]]  don't actually change law or help change policy or work in a bipartisan  way to get bills to the President's desk that can address the growing  issues that our country faces.   Are we going to see a continued trend in this majority of just  resolutions, or are we going to finally get to bipartisan policy on  some of these big issues?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, opposed unanimously on our side, if I can  point out.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   It was heavily debated in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as it  should be, and I am sure it will be heavily debated on the floor.   A number of these other issues that the gentleman mentioned, you  know, we litigated those on the floor. The ones that went over to the  Senate, some with only Democratic votes, you know, H.R. 1, for example,  the Senate majority leader made it very clear that bill will not get  any time on the Senate calendar. There are a lot of others that we  would like to see real movement on.   I know there was concern of a lot of people that there were three  different committees in the House this week that spent the bulk of  their time going after the President personally again.   We have got the Mueller report coming. The summary has already been  laid out and made it clear there was no collusion with Russia. There  was no obstruction of justice. We will see the report.    What we talked about was that the report be filed in compliance with  law, and the law makes it very clear that things like classified  information aren't released. That is the law. I think we agreed that  that is how it should be, that you don't release classified  information. You release the pertinent date.   I look forward to seeing that, and we will see that. But, then, it  seemed like a continued assault in three different committees  continuing to focus on harassing the President personally, as opposed  to focusing on some of those policies.   But one of the policies that should be coming out of the House where  there is a real deadline is the budget. April 15 is the deadline.   I know, over and over again, Members of the Democratic leadership,  including the Speaker, herself, said: Show me your budget. Show me your  values.   There is no budget. And we have been concerned that the agenda  doesn't follow--the priorities in the budget are really what you lay  out. Those are your values. Those are your priorities.   While they are moving a bill that lays out caps, it is not  bipartisan. But, ultimately, when we get a caps agreement, the  gentleman knows it is going to have to be a bipartisan agreement.   Last night, the Budget Committee produced only a partisan, one-corner  deal--barely a one-corner deal. Typically, they have what are called  four-corner deals where the House, Senate--Republicans and Democrats-- come together and say: We are going to agree on what those spending  levels need to be so that we can then write our appropriation bills,  set the priorities of the country, and avoid a government shutdown.   That didn't happen in the Budget Committee. It was a very partisan  bill that was moved out; but, more importantly, it was not a budget.   I would hope that with the little bit of time that is remaining to  meet that legal deadline that the majority would try to actually  produce a budget and follow through on those over-and-over again  quotes: ``Show me your budget.'' ``Show me your values.''   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Hopefully, we can get a bipartisan agreement on what  those levels need to be to properly fund our defense, to properly do  the other things the government should do and limit the ways it can  possibly be carried out, and then, ultimately, to be able to get the  bills that follow it passed in time, well before the September 30  deadline.   One of the areas that there is very productive movement on is the new  trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, USMCA. I know  there are bipartisan working groups. The White House has been in  negotiations with the majority, the Speaker and your team.   Can the leader give any insight into where the conversations are  going in the House to get a timetable for when we can start having a  plan for that?  [[Page H3090]]    You look at Canada's House of Commons, they have their own deadline  of when they rise, and, obviously, we want to be aware of our other  partners that are included in this negotiation.   Is there talk of a timeline yet, if the leader could share where  those conversations are going.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   I am encouraged by the conversations that both I have been in as well  as the conversations that I am aware are going on on your side as well,  because this is a bipartisan win for the country.   This agreement would help ensure that, as we all support free trade,  we also want more fair trade, and this agreement, in many different  categories and many different industries, would help create more  American jobs and help American workers get treated even more fairly by  our neighbors to the north and south.    Finally, if I may inquire of the gentleman, we have talked a number  of times about the Born-Alive Act, the bill that we have made multiple  unanimous consent requests to bring up the discharge petition moving  through the process. There are other means to bring it up even quicker,  and one would be if the gentleman would schedule the bill for the  floor.   I would just inquire: Is there any plan to schedule the Born-Alive  Act on the floor through a direct means versus some of these other  tools that are being considered?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's candor.   We will continue to pursue other tools that we have available as the  growing momentum around the country builds, as people saw what happened  in New York with a law ushered in that allows babies to be murdered  after they are born alive, the Virginia Governor gruesomely describing  what he hopes to be a similar law in his State, other States taking  those same kinds of actions. So there is a growing bipartisan interest  that feels very strongly that we need a Federal law to protect babies  who are born alive outside the womb.   So we will continue to pursue all of those tools that are available  and look forward to the workweek ahead next week as we finish our work  prior to the Easter recess.   Does the gentleman have anything else?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
