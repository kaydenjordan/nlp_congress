POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Australia--Javelin FGM-148F Missiles         The Government of Australia has requested to buy up to two       hundred fifty-five (255) Javelin FGM-148F missiles (includes       five (5) fly-to-buy missiles). Also included is U.S.       technical assistance, consisting of Tactical Air Ground       Missiles (TAGM) Project Office technical assistance and other       related elements of logistical and program support. The       estimated total cost is $60.18 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve the Australian Army's       capability to meet current and future threats by maintaining       and increasing its anti-armor capability. Australia will have       no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime U.S. contractor will be the Javelin Joint Venture       between Lockheed Martin in Orlando, FL and Raytheon Missiles       and Defense in Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Australia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-11       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft, and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. They system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Light Weight       Command Launch Unit (LWCLU) and a round contained in a       disposable launch tube assembly. The LWCLU has been       identified as Major Defense Equipment (MDE). The LWCLU may       also be used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield       surveillance and target detection. The LWCLU's thermal sight       is a 3rd generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Australia.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
