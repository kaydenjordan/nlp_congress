 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  288th birthday of Amelia County, Virginia.   Located in the rolling hills of Virginia's southern Piedmont region,  Amelia County was founded in 1735 and named in honor of Princess  Amelia, the daughter of King George II.   Amelia County has since contributed to the rich history of the United  States, appropriate for it being located in the Commonwealth of  Virginia, the most historic of all States.   In fact, the Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1843 to  1845 for the 28th Congress, John Winston Jones, was born in Amelia  County.   During World War II, the county's Morefield Mine provided significant  strategic minerals that were very important to the successful American  war effort.   Just a few days ago, on May 13, I was honored to be able to join  Amelia County for its annual Amelia Day Festival to celebrate the  historic founding of this great county, now 288 years old.   Members from the Amelia County Public Schools band, Amelia Academy  chorus, and the Amelia County High School chorus performed to  commemorate this wonderful occasion.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the great people of Amelia  County, and I appreciate all that they contribute to Virginia's Fifth  Congressional District and our great Commonwealth.                      Shrink Washington and Grow America     Mr. Speaker, I commend our Speaker and this  House, this very body, for negotiating and passing a responsible bill  to raise the debt limit in exchange for spending cuts and reforms.   While the White House and the Senate stood on the sidelines for 90  days, this very body came together in initiating a debt limit increase.  While many of our Members did not want to increase the debt limit, we  negotiated that with responsible and reasonable spending cuts and  reforms.   Democrats in the White House and here in Congress would, if they had  their way, raise the debt ceiling by some $4 trillion with no reforms  or spending cuts, promising to do what Washington never does, cut  spending in some future undefined date.   Certainly, a default will occur if we continue on the current track  when we can no longer borrow, we can no longer sell our debt, and we  can no longer service our debt. Republicans here in the House are  determined not to let this happen, and that is why we have done our  job.   What have we passed out of this House?   Returning spending to pre-COVID levels for nondefense discretionary  spending. We put 1 percent caps on future growth in spending. We have  eliminated hundreds of billions of dollars in woke climate  environmental extremism that is in the phony inflation increase act and  the phony Inflation Reduction Act.   We have eliminated the half-a-trillion-dollar student loan transfer  scheme, eliminated the expansion of the IRS, and rescinded unspent  COVID funds, which are tens of billions of dollars more. Most Americans  understand that those are reasonable, and all of these should be  rescinded and eliminated.   We also have reinstated work requirements for able-bodied Americans  of working age without dependents in return for Federal assistance.  This is important not just to save tens of billions of dollars, but to  grow our economy and get back to the Trump-growth of 3 to 4 percent a  year, instead of the Biden growth of 1 percent a year.   We have got the REINS Act, which will require a floor vote on every  significant rule or regulation coming out of the regulatory bodies, the  unaccounted bureaucrats who run our agencies and departments.   We also have H.R. 1, our energy bill, which will return us to  American energy independence, which is critical for our national  security, as well as our economic security.   Default will not happen June 1, or any time thereafter, unless it is  willfully caused by the Secretary of the Treasury, who chooses not to  prioritize payments toward the obligations on our debt, Social  Security, Medicare, our veterans, and our defense.   As a matter of fact, I authored a letter to Secretary Yellen, joined  by many of my colleagues, asking: What is her plan to ensure we don't  have a default and to prioritize payments?   What will happen if we don't raise the debt ceiling? You would have  the forced reduction of $100 billion on a monthly basis in  discretionary spending.   Democrats in the House, the Senate, and in the White House will not  allow that to happen. We need to hold the line and have the Senate pass  the Save, Limit, Grow Act, which was passed 3 weeks ago in this very  body. They need to do their job and avoid whatever consequences there  might be for reaching the debt limit.   What we ought to do in this House body, rather than negotiate down  and weaken the bill that we passed, we ought to be adding H.R. 2, our  border security bill, as we see the hundreds of thousands of migrants  on a monthly basis that are invading our country as a result of this  President's border policies.   I applaud my House colleagues for doing our job to protect the  financial integrity of the United States, which is our number one  responsibility as the House of Representatives, and passing this  responsible spending bill that will avoid any consequence from not  raising the debt limit and will put us on a path of future fiscal  responsibility.                            ____________________
