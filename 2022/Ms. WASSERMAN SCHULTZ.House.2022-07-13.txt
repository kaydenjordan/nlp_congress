 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for  yielding and for his steadfast leadership in equipping our Nation to  face unprecedented challenges at home and abroad. I also thank Ranking  Member Rogers for his role in bringing a bipartisan NDAA to the floor.   I rise in support of my amendment requiring a joint briefing from the  Army and Air Force on the lack of a childcare center to serve Camp Bull  Simons at Eglin Air Force Base.   After hearing the stories of families stationed there, it is clear we  need to add transparency to a process that has left our servicemembers  and their families behind.   These brave men and women make immense sacrifices to protect and  serve our Nation. The least we can do is make sure that they do not  have to stress about affordable and accessible childcare while deployed  or on assignment.   Currently, the closest government-run CDC, a benefit our  servicemembers are entitled to, would add an average of 4 hours per day  to a parent's commute. The options that the services are proposing to  remedy the situation for those families are wholly inadequate.   As chair of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I understand the value of child  development centers and quality-of-life issues for our servicemembers.   I offered this bipartisan amendment with my colleagues,  Representatives Castor, Hudson, and Gaetz, to help find a solution that  meets the standard of care that we must deliver for our military  families.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for including this amendment in  the en bloc.
