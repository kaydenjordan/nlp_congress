 Madam Speaker, we are in the middle of the coldest season  of the year, which means Tennesseans and Americans across the country  are turning up their thermostats. Unfortunately, the price of staying  warm has skyrocketed after 1 year under the Biden administration.  Americans are paying an average of 32 percent more for their heating  costs compared to last year.   Most households are paying between $700 and $1,700 more this year to  heat their homes. This drastic rise in prices is not a shock to the  Biden administration. Back in October, the U.S. Energy Information  Administration predicted that this winter Americans would pay  approximately 30 percent more for natural gas, which is the most common  resource for heating our homes.   That prediction did not stop President Biden and far-left Democrats  from pushing radical energy policies, such as pausing new oil and  natural gas leases on public lands for several months, and implementing  senseless restrictions on the oil and gas industry that decreased our  Nation's overall supply.   President Biden needs to change his energy policies before we are  plunged into an even deeper crisis.                            ____________________
