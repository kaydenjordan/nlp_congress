 Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy 100th birthday to  Ruth Sellers of Mariposa, although the general consensus is she is  really in her midfifties. Skeptical or not, the town is going to  celebrate with her tomorrow. From our Nation's Capital, I want to join  them to express our love and respect.   An Army brat, she spent her youth in prewar China and the  Philippines. In the war, when she wasn't Rosie the Riveter at the  Newport shipyard, she was a USO volunteer, where she met her husband,  Earl.   After a successful career at IBM, she retired to Mariposa in 1986 and  has since been a terrifyingly inexhaustible force of nature in so many  community endeavors it would take an hour to catalog.   She will be celebrating many more birthdays in the year ahead, and  Mariposa will be better for it.   Happy birthday, Ruth.                            ____________________
