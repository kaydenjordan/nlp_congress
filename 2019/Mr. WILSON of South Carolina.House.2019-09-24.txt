 Madam Speaker, on Sunday, I was  grateful for the opportunity to participate in the ``Howdy, Modi''  welcome celebration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in  Houston attended by over 50,000 Indian Americans.   With President Donald Trump attending, this event was historic for  being the largest such welcome for a world leader in the history in the  United States. It was an extraordinary day to appreciate India as the  world's largest democracy, with America being the world's oldest  democracy.   The Prime Minister praised President Trump as a true friend in the  White House, describing the President as ``warm, friendly, accessible,  energetic, and full of wit.'' Mr. Trump praised Mr. Modi for doing a  truly exceptional job for India. He also paid tribute to the Indian  American community for its dynamic contributions with success in  America.   I appreciate being invited by President KV Kumar of the Indian  American International Chamber of Commerce and being hosted by  Ambassador Harsh Shringla and Consul General Swati Kulkarni.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the leadership  of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
