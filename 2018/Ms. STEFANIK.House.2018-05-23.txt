 Mr. Chairman, I rise to express support for my  amendment to create an independent national security commission on  artificial intelligence.   Mr. Chairman, this bill that I have introduced will direct a  comprehensive and national-level review of advances in AI and machine  learning and ensure these align with our national security needs. It  will provide actionable recommendations to the President and the  Congress to more effectively organize the Federal Government when it  comes to AI.   Artificial intelligence is a constantly developing technology that  will touch every aspect of our lives. The investments we make and  policies we establish will provide the foundation of our national  security and technological military advantage, but every day we run the  risk of that edge being eroded.   In order to preserve this, we must increase our research in public,  private, and academic institutions, build and educate a talented  workforce, embrace the technological advances that AI will provide, and  lead the international community in establishing the laws and norms  associated with implementing AI. This amendment makes advances in all  of these areas.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my ranking member, Jim Langevin of Rhode  Island, for cosponsoring this amendment.
