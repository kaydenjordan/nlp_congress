 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia for  yielding. I especially want to thank my colleague Congressman Higgins  from Louisiana for his leadership in bringing this resolution to the  floor.   And what does the resolution do? It simply says that we stand behind  our ICE agents, those brave men and women who are keeping America safe.  These are the people on the front lines of removing terrorists from our  country. These are the people who, by the way, last year alone, removed  100,000 criminals from our country.   And they want to vote ``present''? My colleagues on the other side  are talking about voting ``present.''   Mr. Speaker, when you look at the numbers, last year, ICE agents  rescued or identified 518 victims of human trafficking. What if those  ICE agents would have voted ``present'' that day instead of rescuing  those victims of human trafficking? Luckily, Mr. Speaker, they didn't  vote ``present.'' They showed up and did their job to keep America  safe.   What if, last year, Mr. Speaker, those ICE agents who rescued or  identified 904 people who were sexually exploited children voted  ``present'' that day, instead of rescuing those 904 sexually exploited  children? Luckily, they didn't vote ``present,'' Mr. Speaker. They  showed up and did their job.   We need to stand up for them. We need to stand up for what is  important at keeping this country safe.   Are we for open borders? Absolutely not.   On this resolution, there is one choice, one button to hit if you  support these men and women who are keeping us safe, who are keeping us  from open borders. That vote is ``yes.'' Any other vote than a ``yes''  vote is for open borders and somehow not supporting these men and  women.   Let's look at what is resolved in the resolution. We express our  continued support for those ICE agents. We denounce calls to abolish  ICE. And we support efforts of all Federal agencies--State law  enforcement, military personnel--who bring law and order to our  Nation's border.   The only vote on this resolution is ``yes.''    Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 340, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 341, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 342, ``nay'' on rollcall Nos.  343 and 344, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 345.
