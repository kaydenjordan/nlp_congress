 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 28, I call  up the bill (H.R. 266) making appropriations for the Department of the  Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 266, the fiscal year 2019 Department  of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.   Today is the 21st day of the Trump shutdown, and the damage it  inflicts on the families and communities across this country continues  to grow.   More than 800,000 Federal workers are without pay, and today will be  the first missed paycheck for those families. Many of our civil  servants are working without pay, and telling them that they have to  file for unemployment is outrageous and it is wrong.   Today, Democrats are offering this bill that provides critical funds  to reopen the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection  Agency, Indian Health Service, and other important agencies.   Our national parks, America's crown jewels, are under threat. This  administration continues to allow visitors to enter as if everything is  normal.   Our Park Service does not have the funding to ensure visitor safety,  address the most basic standards of cleanliness, and protect park  assets.   Joshua Tree National Park is experiencing significant damage because  there are not enough rangers to stop off-road driving in the park. New  tracks are being cut into the sensitive landscape, and many of Joshua's  trees, the precious namesake of this park, have been destroyed.   Just this past week, the Department of the Interior announced an  illegal plan to force parks to start redirecting funds from entry fees.  Now, those fees are designated for capital improvement projects, and  now they will be used to clean toilets.   There is no substitute for the park system's annual operation budget  of $2.5 billion. As I said, lasting damage is being done to our  national parks, and their long-term upkeep is being compromised.   We must ensure public safety and protect our pristine spaces; and  that is why I am calling on the National Park Service to close all  parks until the government reopens.   Congress needs to pass this bill to fully fund and staff and protect  our national parks. Passing this bill will allow the Forest Service to  get back to work on critical activities, like hazardous fuel  management. That work needs to happen now in order to prevent  wildfires.   The Environmental Protection Agency's mission is to protect human  health and the environment, but the Trump shutdown has furloughed more  than 13,000 employees, stopping inspections at drinking water systems,  stopping inspections at hazardous waste management facilities, and  stopping inspections at chemical facilities. This places the health of  the American people and their communities in jeopardy.   The Trump shutdown is particularly threatening to the health and  safety of our Native American brothers and sisters. Once again, we have  failed to meet our treaty responsibilities to Tribal nations. Basic  services like health clinics, Tribal justice services, and food  assistance for seniors, are being put at risk for nearly 1.9 million  Americans throughout Indian Country.   Approximately 54 percent of the Indian Health Service budget goes to  Tribal organizations to run their own programs. During the Trump  shutdown, critical programs in Indian Country run by Tribal  organizations stop. This includes the Domestic Violence Prevention  Initiative, the Indian Children's Program, the Suicide Prevention  Program, and Alcohol and Substance Abuse Programs.   Native American Lifelines is an example of a healthcare program that  is under contract with the Indian Health Service. Clinics focus on care  for the needy and the elderly, and I am outraged to report that, as of  today, these remarks that I deliver, well, those clinics have been  forced to close, and they will not be able to continue to coordinate  care for their patients, like the 80-year-old woman who depends on  Native American Lifelines to help her manage her type 2 diabetes.   It is time to reopen the government. The Interior bill before us was  drafted by the Senate, passed overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote of  92-6.   This bill also should be familiar to everyone as it was part of a  six-bill package that passed overwhelmingly on the House floor with  bipartisan votes last week. This bill provides $35.9 billion, which is  $601 million over the fiscal year 2018-enacted bill. It maintains  funding for nearly every agency at or above the fiscal year 2018- enacted level, including the Environmental Protection Agency.   It is important to note, however, this bill does not contain any new  partisan riders.   Now, clearly, I would have written things differently, especially  with regard to funding for Indian Country. However, this bill will  immediately open up the Department of the Interior, the EPA, and other  agencies, and give us a path forward to end the Trump shutdown.   Last year, Congress had the opportunity to pass the bill negotiated  by the Conference Committee, but Republican leadership controlled the  floor and they chose not to finish their work.   And then we thought there was an agreement to keep the government  open while the issues of homeland security were being worked out.  Senator McConnell brought the continuing  [[Page H488]]  resolution to the floor of the Senate and it passed unanimously. But  Speaker Ryan, along with President Trump, decided to shut down the  government, and Congress went home.   Now, nearly 800,000 employees are without a paycheck today, and  Democrats are doing everything that we can to quickly pass a bipartisan  bill to reopen the government. We need to finish last year's work so  that we can move forward to serve the American people in 2019. So I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more with my colleague  and the former chair. When we were developing the bill, we had a much  superior product as we came out of conference committee.  [[Page H489]]    But it is time to move forward. Speaker Ryan did not bring that to  the floor. We must move forward and begin our work, our important work,  on 2020.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), the chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, the time to pass the 2019 bill was  December of last year. We need to move forward. My priority is to get  the government open, to get it back working for the American people,  and to have the Federal employees who are working so hard and those who  are forced to be home to have a paycheck.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), who is the chair-designee of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have a rhetorical question, and that  would be: If we had been able to bring the continuing resolution to the  floor, if we would have been able to get the President to sign it,  would that have given us the breathing space to bring back the  conference committee reports and would the President have signed it? I  have not heard the President offer that as a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), a member of the Appropriations Committee, who proudly serves  on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, as I asked a rhetorical question earlier:  If the President would say, ``I am going to do a short CR; I will sign  it; we are going to let the conference committee refile their bills for  2019 to open up the rest of the government, get the people back to  work, and get the paychecks back into those families' hands; and while  we are doing that, we will negotiate the Homeland Security bill,'' I  would be all for that, but I have not heard that come from the  President of the United States.   So today, Mr. Speaker, I bring a bill to bring paychecks back to  people who don't deserve to be pawns in this government shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the Democratic Majority Leader.     Mr. Speaker, I also hail from one of the Great Lakes  States. The funding in the Senate bill and the House bill for the Great  Lakes was identical. So at least in this portion of the funding, it was  equal for both the House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Huffman), who is a member of the House Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to say, once again, I am sorely disappointed that, before the end of  December and before the new Congress came into being, some of the  suggestions here were to move forward with conference committee  reports, to bring them to the floor, to work with the President. Now  that we have the new Congress sworn in, for the President to say: You  get those conference committee reports going. We will do a continuing  resolution to keep government open. We will negotiate the Homeland  Security bill off to the side--but there is silence. There is no  commitment. Quite frankly, I don't know if the President would change  his mind again, if he did agree to that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee and serves on  the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman and I would both be concerned. I  quote from one of President Trump's tweets: ``Billions of dollars are  sent to the State of California for forest fires that, with proper  forest management, would never happen. Unless they get their act  together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money.  It is a disgraceful situation in lives and money.''   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to note that the bill that we will  pass today, hopefully shortly, will provide $1.76 million more than  House Republicans passed last year for the Department of the Interior  wildland fire management and $26 million more for the U.S. Forest  Service for wildland fire management.   Mr. Speaker, I think we should all grieve for loss of life and loss  of property for those who have been impacted by our wildland fires.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    As you know, Mr. Chairman, I feel as strongly as you do  about the health and protection of our public lands. In your view, as  chairman of the committee that oversees the Interior Department, is the  administration protecting the quality of our public lands during this  shutdown?    Will the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) yield  once more?    I agree with my colleague that this administration,  when it comes to public lands, is making matters worse, not better, by  choosing to keep some parks open during the Trump shutdown. This  political attempt to minimize the consequences of the shutdown will  only result in further damage to our national treasures and place the  safety of visitors at risk.   Using funds from fee collections to provide operations support to the  parks hurts the parks in two ways: This small funding stream cannot  replace the $2.5 billion we provide for park operations each year that  ensures the safety of visitors, maintains clean and orderly park  operations, and safeguards park assets. Redirecting these funds away  from their intended purpose delays the capital improvements needed to  sustain our parks for our future.   Because of this, I join the gentleman in urging the President to  close the parks for the remainder of this Trump shutdown or, better  yet, to sign this bill into law so that our parks can open fully and  safely.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles dealing with the  administration's illegal use of taking fees to keep our parks and  refuges open.                       [From the Hill, Jan. 6, 2019]  House Panel To `Demand Answers' on Interior's Move To Use Visitor Fees                             To Keep Parks Open                    (By Miranda Green and Timothy Cama)         The House Natural Resources Committee intends to       investigate the Trump administration's decision to dip into       visitor fees to keep parks open, the panel's chairman warned       Sunday.        Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said that his committee--which       oversees Interior--has plans to look into the legality of the       decision, saying the shutdown has done ``terrible damage'' to       the U.S.        ``President Trump and his advisors apparently just woke up       to the fact that the shutdown they created several weeks ago       has done terrible damage to our country,'' Grijalva said in a       statement Sunday.        ``This is not how a rational president behaves, and the       Natural Resources Committee will demand answers about whether       these moves are legally justified.''        The National Park Service (NPS) announced to staff Sunday a       plan to dip into ``entrance, camping, parking and other fees       collected from park visitors'' to pay staff to assist in       urgent maintenance needs at a number of national parks       overburdened by visitors during the recent government       shutdown.        ``As the lapse in appropriations continues, it has become       clear that highly visited parks with limited staff have       urgent needs that cannot be addressed solely through the       generosity of our partners,'' Daniel Smith, NPS deputy       director, said in a statement obtained by The Hill.        Smith said he and acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt       developed the plan to ``address the maintenance and       sanitation issues that have arisen at a number of highly       visited parks.''        ``We are taking this extraordinary step to ensure that       parks are protected, and that visitors can continue to access       parks with limited basic services,'' the statement read.        Bernhardt signed a memorandum Saturday to use the fees       known as Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act money, The       Washington Post reported.        Jonathan Jarvis, who led the Park Service under President       Obama from 2009 to 2017, slammed the strategy as a       ``significant departure'' from how the agency has       historically used the money parks.        ``Since [the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act's]       original passage, it's always been interpreted by the Park       Service as not available for operations,'' said Jarvis, who       worked in the agency for more than three decades, including       as director of the Pacific West region.        ``This is a significant departure. It wasn't even a       consideration during the 16-day shutdown when I was       director,'' he said, referring to the 2013 shutdown. ``That's       eating your seed corn.''        Jarvis worried that using the fee money in this way would       take it away from park maintenance, which has a backlog       nearing $12 billion across the country.        Jarvis had officials close parks entirely during the 2013       shutdown, despite criticisms from Republicans and others.       He's been highly critical of the Trump administration's       strategy to keep them open with little to no staff.        ``It sends a particular message that they don't really care       about the resource, and probably increasingly, they don't       seem to care about the visitor either,'' he said. ``They only       seem to care about the bad press that they're getting.''        The gates to most U.S. national parks were left open under       the most recent shutdown, which has extended since Dec. 22.       While visitors have been able to access parks, many services       including bathrooms and trash pick-up was suspended as       government employees were kept home. That's created a number       of headaches across the country at highly visited parks where       trash is piling up, bathrooms are at capacity and visitors       aren't being watched by experts.        At least one park, Joshua Tree National Park in California,       was shuttered due to ``health and safety concerns.''        While in the past access to national parks has been       restricted during a shutdown due to safety concerns, former       Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made keeping parks up a       priority during his tenure.        During the last shutdown last January, Zinke told reporters       the parks shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip in shutdown       negotiations.        ``Our public lands and our monuments really belong to the       people and not the government,'' he told CNN.        He said however, ``by law'' Interior wasn't allowed to       provide clean up services to parks.        ``Law enforcement is still there. But things like cleaning       the bathrooms . . . and telling the story of our parks, which       is important--that side of it, while the `Schumer shutdown'       is in, by law we're not able to provide those services,''       Zinke said, mentioning the GOP label for the shutdown at the       time.        In an interview earlier this week Zinke told The Associated       Press that the public should ``Pitch in, grab a trash bag and       take some trash out.''        Zinke's last day at Interior was Jan. 2. He resigned from       the agency in December amid multiple ethics investigations.        However, Interior's plan to dip from the fee pot was laid       out clearly in its 2019 shutdown contingency plan, which       read: ``Parks that collect fees under the Federal Lands       Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) will utilize available       retained recreation fees balances to provide basic visitor       services in a manner that maintains restrooms and sanitation,       trash collection, road maintenance, campground operations,       law enforcement and emergency operations, and staffing       entrance gates as necessary to provide critical safety       information.''        Spokesmen for Interior and NPS did not return requests for       comment.        Critics are questioning the legality of Interior's decision       to use the park fees, money that is assigned by Congress to       pay for other federal expenses, including the department's       multibillion-dollar maintenance backlog.        Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks       Conservation Association, called NPS's action the equivalent       of stealing.        ``Instead of working to reopen the federal government, the       administration is robbing money collected from entrance fees       to operate our national parks during this shutdown,'' she       said in a statement.        ``It's incredibly concerning that the Acting Interior       Secretary is putting political pressure on Superintendents to       keep parks open at the expense of parks' long-term needs and       protection.''        Out of the 418 park units across the country, 165 collect       fees, and they took in $285.2 million in fiscal year 2017,       according to a report last year by the Congressional Research       Service. Usually, at least 80 percent of that revenue has to       stay with the park that took it in, and the rest can go to       other parks.        At least one group, the National Park Hospitality       Association, applauded the agency's fee strategy. The       organization represents companies that operate businesses in       parks, like gift shops, restaurants and lodging.        ``NPHA has actively supported visitor fee retention by       federal recreation providers and use of collected funds for       visitor-related purposes,'' Scott Socha, the group's chairman       and president for parks and resorts at Delware North Cos.,       said in a statement.                                   ____                          [PBS News Hour, Jan. 9, 2019]   Government Restaffs Wildlife Refuges During Shutdown To Allow Hunters                                   Access                           (By Ellen Knickmeyer)         Washington.--The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is       directing dozens of wildlife refuges to return to work to       make sure hunters and others have access despite the       government shutdown, according to an email obtained Wednesday       by The Associated Press.        The partial restaffing of 38 wildlife refuges is angering       wildlife groups, who accuse the Trump administration of       trying to minimize the public impact of the more than two-      week-old shutdown to limit the political blowback for       President Donald Trump. Trump and Democrats in Congress are       locked in a dispute over Trump's demand for billions of       dollars for a wall on the southern U.S. border.        In an email sent Tuesday afternoon, Margaret Everson,       principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,       cites ``opportunities, including hunting'' that are being       lost in the shutdown.        Everson advises in the email that 38 wildlife refuges       around the country will bring back some furloughed staff       using carryover funds.        ``While many of our refuges have remained accessible, but       not staffed, the extended lapse in federal appropriations is       impacting both our ability to serve the public and to protect       natural resources under our care in some places,'' Everson       wrote.        ``For the next 30 days, using previously appropriated       funds, we will bring back a limited number of employees to       resume work on high priority projects and activities that       support the Service's mission and meet the public's desire       for access to Refuge lands,'' Everson said in the email.        Everson did not immediately respond to an email from the AP       seeking comment.        The shutdown has forced federal agencies to stop paychecks       for hundreds of thousands of government employees, limiting       government services to only the most pressing, such as       Transportation Security Administration workers providing       security at airports without pay.        Unlike as in some past shutdowns, the Interior Department--      which oversees both wildlife refuges and national parks--      initially had directed national parks to stay open but with       little staffing, leading to pile-ups of uncollected garbage       and human waste in parks. The National Park Service over the       weekend said some parks could start using visitor fees to       staff during the shutdown.        On Wednesday, the National Wildlife Refuge Association, the       Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and the U.S.       Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association  [[Page H497]]       urged the Trump administration to keep national parks,       wildlife refuges and other public lands closed to the public       during the shutdown.        ``It is simply impossible to steward these shared American       treasures properly, leaving thousands of lands and waters       accessible to the public with no staff on site, even for an       emergency,'' the groups wrote in a letter.        Desiree Sorenson-Groves of the National Wildlife Refuge       Association criticized the partial restaffing of some       wildlife refuges.        ``If it wasn't essential to have these refuges open for the       past three weeks, how is it essential now?'' she asked. The       bottom line was the Trump administration was trying to ``make       this less painful to the American public,'' she said.        According to the email, the wildlife refuges being       restaffed include Oklahoma's Wichita Mountains, scene of an       annual winter elk hunt. The other national refuges staffing       up again stretch from the Midway Atoll in Hawaii to Florida's       Merritt Island.     Mr. Speaker, responsibility of funding the government  is one of Congress' most important duties. Republicans failed to meet  this obligation, and they have allowed President Trump to peddle chaos.   The Trump shutdown is creating uncertainty for families, businesses,  and communities. More than 800,000 employees are not getting paid  today. For that, I am deeply heartsick. Vital services are being  disrupted and small businesses are being forced to lay off employees.   Democrats are ready to end the Trump shutdown. The Interior bill has  already received bipartisan support from the Senate. After this House  bill passes, Senate Republicans will have a choice: pass their own bill  and end the shutdown, or reject it and keep the government closed.   On Monday, the National Governors Association sent a letter asserting  ``a Federal Government shutdown should not be a negotiating tactic.'' I  agree with the Governors. I am sure that Federal employees whose  paychecks are being withheld today feel the same way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great reluctance that I read  again the tweet by the President of the United States:   ``Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for forest  fires that, with proper forest management, would never happen. Unless  they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to  send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives and money.''   That was the President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I don't even know where to begin with regards to the  President's recent threat to block disaster response funds to  Californians struggling to restore their lives, to get back in their  homes, after the devastating fires of last year, so I am going to spend  the rest of my time directly responding to this motion.   I think we can all agree, every single one of us, that preventing  wildfires is important, and my colleague and I just disagree on the  best path forward. I believe that the best path forward is to reopen  the government so the U.S. Forest Service can get back to work on the  activities that prevent wildfires, critical activities like the  hazardous fuel program that should be going on right  [[Page H498]]  now if we want to prevent fires this coming year.   Additionally, again, I would like to note that the bill that we  should pass today provides $1.7 million more than the House Republicans  passed last year for the Department of the Interior Wildland Fire  Management program and $227 million more for the U.S. Forestry Service  in wildland fire management.   Responsibly funding the Federal Government is one of the most  important duties of Congress. This previous majority failed to do so  with the most basic task of keeping the lights on.   Here we are, day 9 of the 116th Congress. We Democrats are ready to  reopen the Federal agencies that have been shut down by President  Trump.   This legislation has already garnered strong support--strong  bipartisan support, I would add--in the Senate. We need to ensure that  the Federal Government is open and that it is working for the American  people and that our Federal employees get the paychecks they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
