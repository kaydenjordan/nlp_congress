 Mr. Speaker, this week, as the House of Representatives  considers human trafficking legislation, I am proud to continue working  with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to raise awareness on the  heinous practice of human trafficking and to work together to eradicate  it from our communities.   I thank my friend and classmate, Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri  (MO-02) for organizing tonight's Special Order Hour.   Human trafficking--where people profit from the control and  exploitation of others--occurs both here at home and abroad on a daily  basis.   In fact, the International Labour Organization estimates that there  are 20.9 million victims of human trafficking globally--68% of them are  trapped in forced labor, 26% of them are children, and 55% are women  and girls.   And in my home state of Ohio, human trafficking for sex and labor is  on the rise.   According to recent reports from the Polaris Project, a nonprofit  that tracks trafficking in the U.S. and abroad, 375 Ohio trafficking  cases were reported from 1,352 calls to the National Human Trafficking  Hotline in 2016. In 2015, there were 289 cases based on 1,070 calls.  The 2016 numbers reflect a nearly four-fold increase over the Ohio  figures from 2013.   While the overall increase in reporting can be partly attributed to  greater awareness of the national hotline, we know, and officials  confirm, that trafficking is, unfortunately, chronically under- reported.   We must do more to help trafficking victims and to encourage people  when they see something that looks like an individual is being  trafficked, that they say something.   Victims of human trafficking often live in the shadows of our  society, so it is up to all of us to help identify and rescue victims  of trafficking.   While human trafficking spans all demographics, there are some  circumstances or vulnerabilities that lead to a higher susceptibility  to victimization.   Runaway and homeless youth, as well as victims of domestic violence  or sexual assault, are frequently targeted by traffickers.   Men and women, boys and girls, who are all alone, abused, and often  believe they have nowhere to go.   Well, we can help. We must do more to assist victims of trafficking  and provide them with the services and treatment necessary to regain  control of their lives.   We must also ensure the investigation and prosecution of human  trafficking crimes is focused on the traffickers, the people assisting  the traffickers, and the purchasers--the individuals who are the real  criminals in the enterprise.   Almost two years ago, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--or  the JVTA--was signed into law. The JVTA is helping to update efforts to  combat the scourge of human trafficking and provided essential  resources to survivors and law enforcement officials.   I am proud to have had a provision included in this comprehensive  legislation and to have taken part in its drafting, passage, and  enactment.   Mr. Speaker, since the JVTA's enactment, we have witnessed important  achievements, but we cannot stop here.   We must continue to work together to eradicate human trafficking and  support the victims. Tonight, I pledge to continue to working with my  colleagues to raise awareness and fight back against human trafficking,  because as we all know, one victim of human trafficking is one too  many.                            ____________________
