 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  The Coal Mine Safety and Health program area of       the Mine Safety and Health Administration, comprising 964       employees, with annual salaries aggregating $78,970,000, is       hereby reduced by 10 percent (comprising 96 employees, with       annual salaries aggregating $7,897,000).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I want to start out this evening by  recognizing the fine work of Chairman Cole. I can tell you that there  are many times in this Chamber that they want to pit members of my  conference against appropriators. This is not one of those times. I  just want to rise and acknowledge the great work of Chairman Cole and  Chairman Frelinghuysen, and, truly, of the entire Appropriations  Committee.   Regardless of whether my amendment passes or not, I plan to vote for  the underlying bill. Yet, with this commonsense amendment that we put  forth, Mr. Chairman, we are really looking to try to make sure that we  rightsize a group that has been under attack, and this is all about the  coal industry.   What we have found is that under the previous administration, there  was an unbelievable attack on all fossil fuels, but specifically the  coal industry.                                time  2030    This actually goes about rightsizing MSHA, which is the mine safety  and health group that will inspect the mines. What we found is we have  fewer mines to actually inspect. My amendment is real straightforward.  It is saying: let's rightsize that particular group. Let's cut the  number of employees that we have there by 10 percent. They have less  mines to inspect. I can tell you, coming from a State that has mining  in every one of the counties that I have the privilege of serving, what  we need to understand is that it is not about safety of mine workers,  because I am for the safety of mine workers; we really need to look at  being responsible with the hardworking American taxpayer dollars. That  is what this amendment is about.   Mr. Chairman, the hour is late, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to acknowledge my dear friend from  New York and her impassioned plea, but we have made news here tonight.  All of a sudden, the people on the aisle opposite are all about the  coal miners. Where has that debate been for the last 8 years?   We start talking about kids and family. What about the coal miners'  kids and families? We have got 35 percent less coal mines that are  being actually operated right now, 35 percent. We have 43 percent less  coal miners. We are talking about kids and all the things that we need  to be doing, and we have cut back on the coal mining. Why don't we cut  back on the inspectors who, according to our numbers, have 35 percent  less mines to actually inspect?   It is time that we rightsize the government. I strongly encourage my  colleagues to support it. I thank the work of the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
