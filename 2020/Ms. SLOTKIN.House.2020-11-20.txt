 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart to honor  and remember Trooper Caleb Starr of the Michigan State Police.   A son of the city of Mason, Trooper Starr fulfilled his lifelong  dream when he joined the force in 2018. For those who served alongside  him, he was an exemplary officer.   On the evening of July 10, while Trooper Starr was responding to a  call, a drunk driver swerved into his lane, colliding with his patrol  car head-on.   Trooper Starr battled in the hospital for 3 weeks before passing away  due to his injuries. He was just 33 years old.   The impact he had cannot be fully described in these remarks, but it  can be seen in his funeral procession, which included 100 vehicles from  15 different law enforcement agencies and three fire departments. It  can be found in the close-knit community of first responders who showed  up to his funeral, honoring him with shirts that read ``Starr Strong.''   Lastly, it can be found in the outpouring of love and support from  his wife, Rachael, and his two daughters, Evelyn and Rosalie.   Service to your country is the greatest love letter you can send. We  all owe a debt of graduate to Trooper Caleb Starr, and it is my  privilege to deliver these remarks so that he may live on in the Record  of the people's House.                            ____________________
