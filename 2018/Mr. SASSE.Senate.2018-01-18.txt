 Mr. President, I say thank you very much to the Senator  from Oklahoma and thanks to the Senator from Montana for spelling me. I  have been sitting in the Presiding chair during this colloquy, so I  have not been on the ground floor able to participate, but I would like  to associate myself with this colloquy and with the leadership of the  Senators from Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, and Montana.   I, too, know Micah, and it is an amazing thing. I wish all 100  Senators had a chance to know Micah and his family. I also want to  associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, as he  began this, that we are one of only four countries in the world that  allow elective abortion at any time for any reason. Our peers in this  are North Korea, China, and Vietnam, and it is a genuine shame. The  American people need to understand that, and this body needs to grapple  with that reality.   As the Senator from Missouri said, it is special to be a part of the  rally and march over the next 36 hours because the college kids who are  coming here understand this far better than the general public. There  is a movement in this country to want to respect and celebrate life,  and good things are happening generationally with this cause.   I want to associate myself with this colloquy and thank the Senator  from Montana for spelling me from the chair. Thank you.
