 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, I want to say  straightforwardly to my colleagues on the other side, this is as  straightforward and it is as simple as it can be: Nothing in this bill  can take effect unless and until the chief actuaries have certified  that this bill will do no harm to Medicare and Social Security.   Now, unlike Members of Congress who have a pension plan, who have a  Thrift Savings Plan, who also have Social Security, for one-third of  all seniors in this country, they rely on Social Security alone; and  for two-thirds of all seniors--and that is your mothers and fathers and  aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews and friends and family--90  percent of their income comes from Social Security.   Mr. Speaker, 10,000--10,000--baby boomers become eligible for Social  Security every single day; and yet, as Mr. Neal has pointed out, the  lack of hearings, the lack of any substantive debate on Social Security  and Medicare. It has been nonexistent.   I include in the Record a letter from Robert Greenstein from the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and I think it bears listening  to so that you get a full understanding and impact of what happens when  this so-called tax reform bill takes effect and its burden is thrust  squarely on the people who are in most need at the time.     [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Sept. 10, 2018]  Greenstein: House Republican Tax Proposal Repeats Flaws in 2017 Tax Law         CBPP released the following statement from Robert       Greenstein, president, on House of Republican leaders'       release of their ``2.0'' tax proposal:        Today's tax proposal from House Republican leaders doubles       down on the fundamental flaws of the 2017 tax law by further       expanding deficits and once again favoring people with the       highest incomes. The proposal calls for making permanent the       2017 law's individual tax provisions. Those provisions       benefit households in the top 1 percent twice as much as       households in the bottom 60 percent, measured as a share of       income.        Making these provisions permanent would cost roughly $650       billion over 2019 to 2028, according to the Joint Tax       Committee. Large as it is, this estimate significantly       understates the long-term cost because the bill largely       affects only the final three years of the 2019-2028 ``budget       window.'' We estimate that the legislation would cost roughly       $2.9 trillion over 2026 to 2035, the first full decade it       would be in effect.        The revenue loss would come at a time when the baby boom       generation will be retiring in large numbers and moving into       ``old-old age,'' causing Medicare and Social Security costs       to rise considerably. Indeed, 2026, the year in which most of       the new GOP tax legislation would start having effect, is the       first year in which all members of the baby boom generation--      including the youngest--will be eligible to draw Social       Security retirement benefits. It's also the year in which the       oldest baby boomers will turn 80; people in their 80s have       higher health care costs, on average, than younger seniors       do. The nation will need more revenues to help meet these and       other challenges, such as a decaying infrastructure, not       fewer revenues,        Policymakers should fix the flaws of the 2017 tax law, not       extend them and compound the damage.        The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a nonprofit,       nonpartisan research organization and policy institute that       conducts research and analysis on a range of government       policies and programs. It is supported primarily by       foundation grants.     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Greenstein says: ``We  estimate that the legislation would cost roughly $2.9 trillion over  2026 to 2035, the first full decade it would be in effect.   ``The revenue loss would come at a time when the baby boom generation  will be retiring in large numbers . . . causing Medicare and Social  Security costs to rise considerably.''   Indeed, when this bill kicks in in 2026, it is the first year in  which all members of the baby boom generation, including the youngest,  will be eligible to draw on their Social Security retirement funds. It  is also the year in which those in that generation will turn 80; and,  as we all know, that is the time when they need medical attention the  most and a time when the Nation will desperately need these revenues.   My Republican colleagues are paying for this tax reform on the backs  of American seniors, forcing devastating cuts to Social Security and  Medicare. Under the guise of tax reform, the trillions they are adding  to the deficit is no accident, and cutting Social Security and Medicare  has always been the next step.   News flash to my colleagues who refer to Social Security and Medicare  as an entitlement: It is not an entitlement. It is the insurance that  people have paid for, working all their life.   And how do we know this? How do we know this, America? Because all  they have to do is check their pay stub where it says, ``FICA,''  Federal Insurance Contributions Act.   Whose? Theirs, the hardworking people of America, who understand that  this is the insurance that they have paid for. This is what they need  in life. And at the very critical time when the full complement of baby  boomers are retiring, they get burdened and saddled with this debt.                                time  1030    I would like to hope that our colleagues would at least listen to  President Trump, President Trump, who said: We're not going to hurt the  people who are paying into Social Security their whole life, and then,  all of a sudden they're supposed to get less?   I hope our colleagues follow their President's lead, and understand  the vital importance of making sure, not only that we protect Social  Security, that we expand it at a time when it is most critical to all  of them.   It would be great if we ever have a public hearing on it; but I have  a profound inclination to understand that when Mr. Neal is chairman of  this committee, we will take this bill up.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
