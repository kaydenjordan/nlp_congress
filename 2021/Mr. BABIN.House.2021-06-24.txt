 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend of  more than 65 years, Lieutenant Colonel Wilbur L. ``W.L.'' Pate, Jr.   W.L. and I grew up together in Beaumont, Texas, where he was better  known by his nickname, ``Bubba.'' We became close friends playing  football together at Austin Junior High School, and eventually, my  family moved across town, which, unfortunately, sent us to different  high schools. I still remember the football game in 1965 when French  High School--led by W.L. Pate at quarterback--dealt me and my team,  Forest Park High School Trojans, a close loss.   The final score of 8-7 stung, but I couldn't help but be proud of the  skill and sportsmanship demonstrated by W.L. and his French High  Buffalos.   A year later, W.L. and I both ended up at Lamar University in  Beaumont and served in the same unit in the Army Reserves, as well. In  1969, he was commissioned as an infantry officer, and in 1978, he  graduated from Command and General Staff College.   After leaving the military as a lieutenant colonel in 1994, he dove  into another form of public service--serving his community on  Beaumont's City Council as mayor pro tempore, and on several boards,  including the Beaumont Rotary Club, Better Business Bureau, the  American Legion, Lamar Institute of Technology, and many more.   One of Bubba's most significant accomplishments was his advocacy for  the late Babe Didrikson Zaharias to be awarded the Presidential Medal  of Freedom. Babe was from our hometown of Beaumont, Texas, and was a  gold medal Olympian, and later, professional golfer, winning ten LPGA  major tournaments. She is considered by many to be one of the world's  greatest female athletes.   I was honored to attend the White House ceremony with W.L. when he  [[Page H3091]]  proudly accepted this award from President Trump on behalf of the Babe  Zaharias Foundation in Beaumont, Texas. W.L. Pate was the very man who  inspired me to run for Congress back when he nearly threw longtime  incumbent Representative Jack Brooks into a runoff. Bubba certainly got  Brooks' attention.   W.L. was a dear friend and a respected leader. My heart goes out to  his loved ones, his daughters, Suzanne and Jennifer; fiancee, Sherrene;  brother, Robert; sister, Pam; and many nieces, nephews, and cousins. My  prayers are with all of them.                            ____________________
