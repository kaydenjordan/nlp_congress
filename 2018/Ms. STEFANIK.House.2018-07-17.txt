 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from across the lake,  Peter Welch.   This is truly a bipartisan issue, as Mr. Welch identified. This is  important to our local ecosystem. It is important to our recreation. It  is important to our tourism. But it is also a job creator, bringing in  new people to our region.   I love the views as I look across the lake to Vermont, and I know  that we are really a joint economy around Lake Champlain.   I also want to thank Chairman Calvert and the Appropriations  Committee for their support of this important initiative in the  Northeast. As I said, this is truly bipartisan, and it fully funds this  important program.   So I thank Mr. Calvert again and his staff, and I thank Mr. Welch for  being a true partner on this issue, which is locally driven and such a  success story for our districts.
