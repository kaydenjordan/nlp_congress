 Mr. Speaker, last year, American culture experienced a  moment of reckoning. It doesn't matter what political party; it doesn't  matter what industry; it doesn't matter when or where: sexual  harassment and sexual violence are unacceptable.   America has been willfully blind to abuses of power for far too long.  The bravery of survivors of sexual assault and harassment has changed  that, has changed our country, and it is time for Congress to follow  their lead.   I am grateful to introduce this bill with my colleagues: House  Administration Chairman Harper and Ranking Member Brady; my counterpart  on the House Ethics Committee, Chairwoman Susan Brooks; all of whom  worked so hard to develop these reforms.   I am going to thank Representative Byrne for his commitment to this  effort, sharing his experience. And my colleague and friend,  Congresswoman Jackie Speier, deserves particular appreciation and  acknowledgment for her strong leadership not just in crafting this  bill, but throughout her career in standing up for the rights of women;  but, in this case, for crafting a bill that will produce lasting change  for the United States Congress.   This bill will allow survivors to speak out, ensure that legal  resources are available to them, and offer justice without fear of  retribution. This bill will not only strengthen our out-of-date  workplace protections, but it will send an important message to the  entire country that Members of Congress will be held accountable.   Also with this legislation, the Office of Compliance must provide the  House Ethics Committee with all of the information required for the  transparent pursuit of full accountability.                                time  1215    It is time to end protections for powerful abusers and to empower  survivors. Each survivor must be heard, allegations must be taken  seriously, and abusers and harassers must be held accountable.   Every congressional employee and every American deserves an equal  chance at success in their careers, free from sexual harassment and  free from retaliation for defending themselves and asserting their  rights.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to do the work necessary to change our  culture. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and ensure that  Congress does its part in that important work.
