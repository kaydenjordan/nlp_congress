 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  friend Ralph Vanni, the senior House audio technician who retired  earlier this month.   For 34 years, Ralph has been the man behind this microphone and every  microphone in this Chamber. When he took his job as the House  technician in 1985, Ralph was no stranger to Capitol Hill. At the age  of 16, he landed an internship with the then-Senate majority leader.   After two more internships and graduating college, Ralph had a hand  in nearly every corner of the Capitol building, from doorkeeper for the  Sergeant at Arms to working in the Senate Cloakroom.   In his most recent role, Ralph saw six Presidents give their State of  the Union speeches, but the day he has said he will never forget is  running audio from that perch right up there for Pope Francis' address  to this Chamber in 2015.   I remember meeting Ralph on my first day as a newly elected Member of  Congress during orientation in 2013. With the Speaker's permission, we  could take photos on the House floor that day, and I took a minute to  take one with Ralph and some of his team and the many folks who do a  wonderful job guarding this Chamber every day.   Ralph became my friend that day and has been my friend for the last  6\1/2\ years I have had the chance to serve in this great institution.  I wish him the best in his retirement. And I want to thank him  personally, on behalf of every Member of Congress who stands behind any  microphone in this institution.   Ralph made us sound better, and we appreciate him for doing that. I  wish him good luck in his retirement and thank him for all his years of  service.   I am going to miss Ralph, looking up in that perch, but I am going to  get to know the folks who have replaced him so well. He has led a great  generation into that seat to replace him now.   I thank Ralph Vanni.                            ____________________
