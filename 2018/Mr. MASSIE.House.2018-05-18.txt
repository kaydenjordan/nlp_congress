 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want you to imagine this scenario: a  heavily armed Federal SWAT team dressed in black from head to toe with  body armor on, guns blazing, military-style assault weapons, extra  magazines loaded, come in intent on crushing all opposition.   Now, what crime could they possibly be going after? Is it a human  trafficking ring? Is it a drug bust? No. They are after an Amish farmer  for selling milk straight from the cow.   I would like to tell you this is an imaginary scenario, but it has  happened and it keeps happening. Unfortunately, this isn't a joke.   So what is interesting about this is that Congress has never passed a  ban on raw milk, yet the FDA has imposed a ban on raw milk.   So what I seek to do today, and my colleagues, with this amendment is  to allow States which have legalized raw milk, to allow the interstate  transport of that raw milk between two States that have made it legal  to sell unpasteurized milk.   It is a very commonsense amendment. There are millions of people who  drink raw milk in this country. They drink it safely. They believe it  is much healthier for them than pasteurized milk. The Greatest  Generation in our country grew up drinking raw milk that was  unpasteurized. Twenty-eight States allow the sale of unpasteurized raw  milk.   So it is ridiculous for us, I believe, the Federal Government, to go  in and keep people from buying raw milk or transporting raw milk across  State lines so long as it is legal in those two States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out that this  amendment is a bipartisan amendment. This has been a very partisan  debate over a lot of these amendments over the farm bill, and I think  it is time that we have something that is supported by both sides of  the aisle.   This amendment is modeled after a stand-alone bill that has over a  dozen cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, and the sponsors of this  amendment are Congressman Polis and Congressman Rohrabacher in addition  to me.   It is very simple. If you understand federalism, you can understand  this bill. It says that, if two States have legalized the sale of  unpasteurized milk, no Federal department, agency, or court may take  any action to prohibit or restrict the interstate traffic of milk or  milk products between those two States. There are 28 States that have  legalized the sale of raw milk.   With a debt of over $21 trillion, the Federal Government doesn't have  the time, the money, or the resources to chase down and prosecute  peaceful farmers. This is an issue of both personal freedom and smart  government.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for mentioning  Louis Pasteur and the pasteurization process, because what we have  today is pasteurization without representation here in this country.   Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman), my friend.    Madam Chair, I know Big Milk opposes raw milk. The milk  lobby doesn't like my amendment. In fact, the lactose lobby is very  intolerant of freedom.   But I am here today to take up for consumers and small farmers and  States' rights, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this.  Reject pasteurization without representation. Vote to allow the  interstate transport of raw milk between two States where it is legal.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
