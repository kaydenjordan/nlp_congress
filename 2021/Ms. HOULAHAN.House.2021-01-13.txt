 Madam Speaker, last evening, an 11-year-old girl joined  our telephone townhall. Her question  [[Page H177]]  shook me to my core. She was worried about the future of this great  Nation, and I am, too. That is why I must move forward with impeachment  of this President. He has endangered this Nation. He has betrayed his  oath.   I do this now for all of us, for our Constitution, and for this  Republic. I do this to tell the world that this great democracy will  stand and no one is above the law. I do this for our future  generations.   I urge us all to unite and to vote ``yes'' on impeachment.
