 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following statement be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             Introductory Remarks for Erik Raven (as delivered)         u.s. senator jon tester--Senate Committee on Armed Services                              (March 22, 2022)         It is truly an honor to be introducing Erik Raven today at       his nomination hearing to be Undersecretary for the Navy.        It is an honor because there is no one more qualified or       capable than Erik is to serve the women and men of our Navy.        I know firsthand, because Erik is the Democratic Staff       Director for the Subcommittee on Defense of the Senate       Committee on Appropriations, and for the last year, I have       worked very, very closely with him in my role as Chairman on       that Committee. In that time, we've spoken every day--      something I know Erik has enjoyed very much.        Erik is a true professional. He is dedicated, he is whip-      smart, and he knows the defense budget better than anybody.        But that's only part of what makes Erik qualified and       deserving of being confirmed for this position at the       Department of Defense.        What makes Erik exceptional is that he deeply understands       the challenges and the threats we face, and he has dedicated       his life to our military, our national security, and to our       country.        For the last 24 years, Erik has served as a staff member       for some of the Giants of the Senate: Sen. Dianne Feinstein,       Sen. Ted Kennedy, and Sen. Robert Byrd--you may have heard of       them.        Erik served as Senator Byrd's Military and Foreign Affairs       Advisor from 2000 to 2007, and as his Legislative Director       from 2006-2007. He also served as a speechwriter for Senator       Byrd on national security matters.        Some of you may not know this, but my office in Hart is       Senator Byrd's old office. And welcoming Erik back into that       office after I became SAC-D Chairman is a fitting symmetry to       the end of his Hill career before he sails off to the       Pentagon.        But I'm not the only SAC-D Chairman who has benefitted from       Erik's wisdom and leadership.        For the past 15 years--7 as a Professional Staff Member and       8 as Staff Director--Erik has served Senators, the Senate,       and our nation.        As the Staff Director, he is the principal advisor to the       Committee on budgetary matters relating to the Department of       Defense and the national intelligence community.        And during his time on the Committee, Erik has been       responsible for the oversight of national intelligence       programs, national security space programs, Special       Operations procurement, Army aviation, and Navy research and       development matters, as well as staff lead on wartime       intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance initiatives.        Erik is as credentialed as he is experienced: he has       completed a master's thesis on the origins of China's nuclear       weapons program at the London School of Economics and       Political Science as well as an undergraduate honors thesis       on the international narcotics trade at Connecticut College.        This dude is a smart guy.        And he has good people in his corner: I want to recognize       his wife, Ann, who is here today--and thank you, Ann, for       sharing Erik with the Senate, and soon, I hope, with the       Department of Defense. The gratitude our country owes Erik       for his service, we also owe to you.        The bottom line is this: Erik Raven will serve as       Undersecretary for the Navy honorably and well. He is       exceptionally qualified and deserving of this Committee's       favorable endorsement, and I'm sure that the distinguished       members of this Committee will agree after getting a chance       to question him.        Erik, I just want to congratulate you on your nomination,       and get in there and give 'em hell, okay?        Thank you, Mr. Chairman.                            ____________________
