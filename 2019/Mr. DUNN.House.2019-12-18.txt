 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today a disappointed man.  I am disappointed in a broken and partisan process that has consumed  House Democrats.   We were told this investigation was going to be bipartisan and  transparent. Instead, the proceedings were held in secret behind closed  doors with no attempt at a fair hearing.   All this was done deliberately in an effort to undo the results of  the 2016 election.   Madam Speaker, my constituents in Florida want to see us get to work.  They are counting on us to actually fix the surprise medical billing,  to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Instead, we are here a week  before Christmas, voting to impeach the legitimate President, Donald J.  Trump, on the strength of nothing but rumors.   We have wasted almost a year on this process while House Democrats  chose political theater over serving the American people. This shameful  vote to impeach our President will be a lasting stain on our House.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
