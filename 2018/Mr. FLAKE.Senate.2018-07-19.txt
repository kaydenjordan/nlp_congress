 Mr. President, we are here to put forward a resolution and  ask unanimous consent for its adoption. This is the Flake-Coons  resolution, which Senator Coons will speak on and I will take it from  there.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr.  Coons, for helping to get together and working on this resolution and  for working with his colleagues.   I hope that we can pass it today. There may be an objection to moving  forward. If there is, we will bring it back again and again. This needs  to be passed. The Senate needs to speak here.   Mr. President, in his dystopian novel ``1984,'' George Orwell wrote:         The party told you to reject the evidence with your eyes       and ears. It was their most final, essential command.    Well, what we saw on air this week in Helsinki was truly an Orwellian  moment. What we saw earlier this week in Helsinki is what happens when  you wage war on objective reality for nearly 2 solid years, calling  real things fake and fake things real, as if conditioning others to  embrace the same confusion. Ultimately, you are rendered unable to tell  the difference between the two and are at critical times seemingly  rendered incapable of thinking clearly--your mind a hash of conspiracy  theory and fragments of old talking points deployed in response to a  question no one even asked. Ultimately, you fail to summon reality in  the face of a despot in defense of your country.   It wasn't a hard question. An American President was invited by a  reporter to denounce the Russian attacks on our elections and, in doing  so, to defend the country that he was elected to lead. This should have  been not much of a test at all for any American President. Yet it was,  and our President failed that test.   The findings of our intelligence community regarding the Russian  aggression are not matters of opinion, no matter how powerful and  strong Putin's denial. To reject these findings and to reject the  excruciatingly specific indictment against the 12 named Russian  operatives in deference to the word of a KGB apparatchik is an act of  will on the part of the President.   That choice now leaves us contemplating a dark mystery: Why did he do  that? What would compel our President to do such a thing?   Those are questions that urgently beg for an answer, and it is our  job to find that answer. But what isn't a mystery is that, by choosing  to reject objective reality in Helsinki, the President let down the  free world by giving aid and comfort to an enemy of democracy. In so  doing, he dimmed the light of freedom ever so slightly in our own  country. Such is the power that we vest in the Presidency. Such are the  consequences when a President does not use that power well.   I can add no further to the extraordinary and thoroughly justified  response of my fellow Americans from across the political spectrum to  the events in Helsinki, ranging from heartbreak to horror. But I will  say that if ever there was a moment to think of not just your party but  for the country, this is it. This is not a moment for spin, deflection,  justification, circling the wagons, forgetting, moving on to the next  news cycle, or for more of Orwell's doublespeak. No, when the American  Government offers an onslaught on unreality, it puts the whole world at  risk.   That is the lesson of Helsinki. That is the dose of reality that hit  hard. We have indulged myths and fabrications and pretended that it  wasn't so bad, and our indulgence got us the capitulation in Helsinki.   We in the Senate who have been elected to represent our constituents  cannot be enablers of falsehoods. This bipartisan resolution from the  Senator from Delaware and me, which we have here today, commends the  Department of Justice for its thorough investigation that has led to  the indictment of 12 Russian operatives who on behalf of the Russian  Government interfered in the 2016 election. It acknowledges that such  efforts by the Russian Government to undermine our elections, as  confirmed by our own Director of National Intelligence, continue.   Specifically, the Flake-Coons resolution rejects the denial of  election interference by Russian President Vladimir Putin, something  that our President failed to do when given the opportunity in a public  forum in Helsinki on Monday.   This resolution calls for the full and immediate implementation of  mandatory sanctions, passed by a vote of 98 to 2, to deter and punish  election interference by the Russian Government.   If there are waivers that are needed--and there are some needed for  the Indian Government, for example, for weapons they purchased from the  Russian Government or for hardware--there is a waiver process already  in law for that, and I would support that.   Finally, the resolution calls on the relevant committees of the  Senate to exercise oversight, including prompt hearings and obtaining  relevant notes and information to understand what commitments were made  by the President in the summit and the impact it will have on our  foreign policy going forward.   The Russian Ambassador last night said that ``important verbal  agreements were made.'' We need to know the details of those  agreements.   Empirical, objective truth has taken a beating for the last 18  months. I said from this pulpit in January that ``the dissemination of  untruths has the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and  conditioning the public to no longer trust them.''   As we saw in Helsinki on Monday, entertaining the untruths of a  dictator has the same effect. Passing this resolution will let our  constituents, the administration, our allies, and our adversaries know  that here in the Senate we do not entertain the deceit of dictators.   The truth is that Russia interfered in our elections in 2016, and  these efforts continue. Accepting that truth is the first step in  preparing us to confront this malign activity. Let's pass this  resolution.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 583, submitted earlier today. I ask unanimous  consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid on the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I think it is regrettable this was  objected to. We will bring it back. The majority leader said this is  just a symbolic vote. It is. Symbolism is important.   Obviously, we have underlying sanctions we ought to fully implement.  If there are waivers needed, there is already a waiver process in the  NDAA authorization. I support those waivers with regard to India. This  does not affect that. This says, in a symbolic way, that we in the  Senate don't buy Vladimir Putin's rejection or his denial of election  interference.   That was put in question this week, whether our government believes  that or not. We in the Senate should stand and say: We don't believe  it. We know the intelligence is right. We stand behind our intelligence  community. We need to say that in the Senate.   Yes, it is symbolic and symbolism is important. Our agencies of  government need to know that we stand behind them. That is what this is  about.   I hope we will pass this. I note, regretfully, that there has been an  objection to it, but we will bring it back. I believe this should pass,  and I believe it ultimately will pass.   I yield back.
