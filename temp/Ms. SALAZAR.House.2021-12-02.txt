 Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the fifth day of  Hanukkah, to give special recognition to my Jewish community in  Florida's 27th Congressional District.   As their Congresswoman, I have the distinct honor of representing one  of the largest Jewish communities in the country, which includes Temple  Beth Am, one of the largest congregations in the southeast United  States.   For over 65 years, Temple Beth Am has welcomed Jewish people from all  walks of life to worship, to study, and to seek refuge. For over six  decades, the synagogue has provided spiritual guidance and served the  Miami community in so many ways.   Much of this would have never happened without the leadership of Beth  Am Senior Rabbi, Jeremy Barras. There are so many great spiritual  Jewish leaders in our community along with Rabbi Barras; Rabbi Yitzi  Zweig of the Talmudic University Yeshiva in Miami Beach; Rabbi Yossi  Harlig of the Chabad Center of Kendall and Pinecrest; and Rabbi Eliot  Pearlson of Temple Menorah in Miami Beach. They are esteemed local  leaders and pillars of the Miami Jewish community, and I call them my  friends.   Over the next few days, our Jewish brothers and sisters all over the  world will continue to celebrate the Festival of Lights, God  permitting. I offer my best wishes to all of them.                            ____________________
