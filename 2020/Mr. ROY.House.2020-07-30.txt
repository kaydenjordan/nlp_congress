 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California  bringing up this important topic. The news these days tend to be  filled--it is not often filled with positive things that we ought to be  celebrating together as Americans and the great accomplishments that we  are achieving together, the great accomplishments we are achieving on a  completely nonpartisan basis and advancing our continued exploration.   Jim Bridenstine is a friend of mine. I am just thrilled with what he  is doing with NASA. I am certainly thrilled to be seeing that we are  returning to space vigorously and that we are doing so actively, and I  just appreciate their service. I love the rich tradition, the  connection between NASA and our military.    Madam Speaker, I know that Mr. Garcia is a veteran of our United  States Navy, and I thank him for his service. I appreciate him joining  me here tonight.   Madam Speaker, I come down here tonight for a few reasons.   First of all, a few weeks ago, a young lady, a 20-year-old named  Rebekah Wendt was campaigning in west Texas with another young fellow  from Trinity University. I represent Trinity University in San Antonio.  I got a call from my staff assistant, Jonah Wendt, that his sister had  been killed an hour or two before in a car accident in west Texas.   I will have more to say about Rebekah in the future, but she was a  bright star and a great defender of this country, out working hard,  volunteering, as many of our young folks do, on campaigns. She was a  member of the Young Conservatives of Texas. She was majoring in  history. She and another young fellow, again, I will talk more about,  Tyler, was with her. They were out trying to make this country better.  They were out trying to get someone they believed in elected. They were  trying to change this country for the better by standing up for Texas,  standing up for this country.   I want to celebrate her life, and again, I want to do it more in the  future, but her brother, Jonah, and his twin brother, Manfred, are very  dear to me and worked hard on my campaign 2 years ago and continue to  serve this country as well as serving in support of me.   And I mention that because I do want to talk more about her another  time, but I mention that because it got me to thinking about what this  is all about, what we are doing.   Now, for those few people at home watching on C-SPAN, I am here  alone, mostly, in the Chamber with the exception of the Speaker and my  friend from California. And I think about Rebekah, and I think about  all of those young Americans out there working hard every day, trying  to get someone elected or go fight for what they believe in. And that  is what this is about. This is the people's House. This is the House of  Representatives. It is really an unbelievable institution when you  think about what it meant in the history of the world.   I was in Independence Hall on July 2nd. I went up there because I  wanted to be up there when I was watching so many of our monuments and  so many of our statues under attack, and it is not the marble, it is  not the mortar, it is not the bricks that matter, it was the ideals  represented there.   I went up to Independence Hall, and it was on July 2nd, which many  will know is the day we separated from the crown, the day of the actual  vote. And the folks there were very kind to me. They were closed down  because of what we are dealing with with the virus. They were very kind  and allowed me to go into Independence Hall. I had the great blessing  of being in Independence Hall on July 2nd, 244 years to the day of the  vote. Then I got to go over to the other room, which is a different  room, where the first five Congresses of the United States met. Then,  of course, we have a history of then moving on to different capitols,  and we ended up here. And we have been in this Chamber for, I don't  know the history as well as I should, but 100 years or something in  this Chamber.   This people's House, in my opinion, is failing the people of the  United States. I am going to say that again. The people's House, the  435 Representatives that make up this half of Congress, one-half of  one-third of the Federal Government is failing the American people. It  is failing the American people because we literally never debate. We  literally never offer amendments and have any debate here on this  floor. We are ruled by a handful of folks who meet in rooms in back  chambers, drop bills on the floor of the House and then demand we come  down and vote on them. By the way, that is both Democrats and  Republicans.   The people's House is supposed to be the people's House. We are  supposed to actually debate, engage.   Do you want to know why things are so broken?   It is because if you even dare think about offering an amendment to a  bill, you have got to go to some Rules Committee to get blessed to be  able to even have the ability to offer it. You will get shut down in  Rules Committee, and then there is never any debate.                                time  2100    What kind of a people's House is that? I would posit that it is not  one.   We have so many issues right now that are tearing our country apart.  Why? Because there is no leadership coming from the Representatives  sent to Washington to represent the people. None.   If there were leadership, we would have actual debate. We would  actually sit down here and come up with ideas, offer solutions, and  then hammer them out. We would actually sit down at a table like a  small business or sit down at a table like a family and balance a  budget. We would have a debate about the proper policies to deal with a  pandemic instead of pointing fingers and politicizing a virus.  [[Page H4181]]    In what universe do you politicize a virus? Yet that is precisely  what the leaders of this great and august country have done.   Everyone in America is sitting around wondering what on Earth has  happened that we are now deciding how we make policy based on polls and  reactions to whatever the President says or whatever Speaker Pelosi  says.   It is absolutely amazing. The needle moved when President Trump said  that we ought to open our schools. Simple notion: Let's open up our  schools.   Why might that be important? I don't know. How about for all the  working-class Americans who can't afford daycare and are trying to  figure out how to have their children get educated.   Why aren't we having a robust debate about that instead of just  pointing fingers and saying, ``Uh-oh. Be afraid''? But that is what we  are doing.   It is really easy for all the latte-drinking, Peloton-riding, Volvo- driving White Americans to run around going off and saying: ``Oh, I am  going to go by and get my little drink, but somebody is serving me. And  those people serving me, how are they going to have their kids get  educated?''   It ain't going to be if we don't open our schools.   Can I tell you, Madam Speaker, what they are doing in Austin, Texas?  This is how genius it is in Austin, Texas. They are saying we can't  open our schools until late September or some undetermined date. Oh,  but don't worry. We will open the buildings, allow the YMCA to go in,  hold a group forum there to watch virtual education--which now, by the  way, I am seeing all sorts of stories of teachers saying: ``Well, we  don't want to do the virtual education either.''   What are we doing for our children? Why aren't we debating this right  now instead of having, ``Oh, President Trump said we should open our  schools,'' so we are going to have a 20 percent swing in how we view  opening our schools?   In what universe does that statement by the President change what we  should be doing as the people's House about opening our schools? Yet,  that is precisely what happened.   We have a current environment in the United States of America where  the very rule of law, which attracts people from all over the world to  come here, is being trampled upon by people--frankly, often self- identifying as Marxists--but people who are ravaging cities, literally  undermining the health, security, safety, community of our cities, our  States, our homes. A Federal courthouse is being targeted and burned in  Portland.   Now, what happens? Again, it becomes politicized. In what universe is  that political? I mean, I would suggest to anybody, go look at anything  I have ever said about federalism or about respecting States and  respecting local powers to make decisions that are best for the people.   But there is another point to all of this, which is the Constitution  talks about securing the blessings of liberty. It talks about what we  are supposed to do as a Nation in terms of defending the rule of law.   Of course, the Federal Government should defend the Federal  courthouse in Portland. To say otherwise is patently absurd.   Yet, what did my Democratic colleagues do this week? What did they do  when the Attorney General of the United States was here before the  House Judiciary Committee but sit there and talk over him and mock him  and relentlessly stand on the side of lawless Marxists who are trying  to destroy a city of the United States of America instead of standing  up alongside our law enforcement.   What are we doing? What are we doing as a country?   We are in an empty Chamber with three votes today at 6:30 tonight,  two votes or three votes tomorrow, and then head home. And then what?  Be gone for August while our businesses burn, literally and  figuratively, while millions of Americans don't have jobs?   Why are we going to adjourn? Why have we only met something like 15  out of the last 100 days, or whatever it has been?   It is an absolute embarrassment what has become of the people's  House. We should be ashamed. We should be ashamed that we are not here  doing the work of the American people.   More importantly, we should be ashamed that when we are here, we are  not sitting down at a table and working through the issues of the day  based on the rule of law, based on the Constitution, based on the  Declaration, based on our job as Representatives to represent the  people of the United States.   Our police officers stand up to defend the rule of law. People come  from all over the globe here. Why? Is it for what is enumerated in the  Bill of Rights? Is it for what was enumerated, or laid out, in the  Declaration of Independence, those unalienable rights? Yes.   It is all of those things, and it is equal justice under the law, all  the things that we should be fighting to strive for in order to reach  those ideals that, by the way, we will never reach because we are  flawed men and women. My faith teaches me that. But they are the ideals  that we will constantly strive to reach.   It is why, when I went to Independence Hall, I was proud to stand up  and say this is a great thing that happened here. I will never back  away from defending the United States of America.   I stopped off where Francis Scott Key wrote our national anthem, and  I did a video there. I am not going to back away from defending our  national anthem and defending our history.   I went from there to the Jefferson Memorial. I went to the Roosevelt  monument. I went to the Lincoln Memorial.   Two days ago, I took my 10-year-old son and my 9-year-old daughter to  Mt. Vernon so they could see the home of the Father of our Country,  George Washington, where I unapologetically taught my children about  the greatness of our first President. It is important, that part. I  unapologetically taught my children about the greatness of our country  and of the Father of our Country.   We are all flawed. We always will be because we are men and women. We  are made in the image of God, but we are not God. And thank the Lord  that he sent his son so that I might have eternal life because I am  flawed. But we should not look at our country with shame or disregard  because we have made mistakes.   Yet, the other side of the aisle seems hellbent on tearing down this  great country brick by brick, statue by statue, thread by thread of our  flag, word by word of our anthem.   It is a mockery of this House.   How on Earth can you explain to a veteran who is missing limbs, who  bled in the Middle East or bled at Normandy or bled in the Pacific? How  can you explain to a veteran that our country is bad?   Our country is not bad. Our country is great. Our country has done  more for more men and more women than any other nation in the history  of the world. I will debate that anywhere, anytime, with anyone who  cares to actually have a debate in this so-called people's House. I  will not sit here and listen to supposed representatives of this  country tear her down.   Right now, we have people who are hurting because of the virus,  people who are hurting because they have lost jobs, people who are  hurting because their businesses have gone out of business, people who  are hurting because streets have been torn down or burned or because we  have allowed looting to occur in the false name of social justice.   What are we doing for them? Adjourning? Heading home to campaign so  that people can score political points?   I have had people on my own side of the aisle say perhaps they  shouldn't do bills or work with certain Members on the other side of  the aisle. Why? Because they don't want us to avoid the ability to  score political points.   I know that has happened on the other side of the aisle. How do I  know that? Because Dean Phillips, a very good man, and I worked  together to pass the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act. And  Dean, to his great credit, because he is a gentleman, deferred to me to  introduce the bill because we had been working on the legislative part,  and he was working on the political part. We were working together. So,  I introduced the bill.   We had worked to get to an agreement. It was going to move through  this Chamber. Ah, but it couldn't be in the name of the Republican  freshman  [[Page H4182]]  from Texas, who, by the way, is in a district that might be on the hot  list for the DCCC.   Coincidence that they then took the same language and dropped it into  another bill with my friend from Minnesota--no fault of his own--and  put it under his name and then said, ``Great. Let's move it through''?  And it passed 417-1.   Yes, Madam Speaker, I am looking at Congressman Massie, with a little  bit of love.   Why? This is what the American people are sick and tired of. They are  literally just sick of it.   We can disagree, and we are going to disagree. Dean and I disagree.  The Speaker pro tempore and I disagree on issues. But we also agree.   I was proud to join the Speaker pro tempore in January, along with  Dean and another Democrat, three Republicans and an independent. You  can guess who the independent was. Why? To write an op-ed in The  Washington Post saying: Hold on here. Maybe we should rethink a 20- year-old Authorization for Use of Military Force.   Now, do I have all the answers to what we should do in Afghanistan,  Iraq, Syria, Iran? I do not. It is okay to say that, by the way. It is  okay to say you don't have all the answers.   But we got together to say maybe, just maybe we should rethink 20- year-old authorizations of force when there are men and women who are  now enlisting who weren't alive when we passed them.   Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a 12-tour veteran, I think a  marine, who killed himself. Twelve tours, Madam Speaker.   What are we doing? Why aren't we having a debate about that?   With all due respect to some of my friends on this side of the aisle,  endless wars are not an answer. Neither is allowing bad actors to run  amok around the world against our national security interests or that  of our allies.   So why must it always be, when we get to budget time: ``Well, we have  to have more money. We are going to keep defense. We are going to keep  things going. We are going to have OCO. We are going to do this. We are  going to spend more money to keep the wars going, whatever DOD wants''?   Why is it on the other side of the aisle too often: ``Well, an  endless amount of dollars for nondefense discretionary spending, but  whatever. We don't care about $26 trillion of debt. Let's just pass a  bill. Let's just get it done so we can do something. And you get what  you want, and you get what you want, and we spend another extra  trillion dollars''?   By the way, Madam Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Schweikert), a trillion dollars sounds kind of quaint, doesn't it?  A trillion dollars sounds kind of quaint now.   I don't even know where we are. Does anybody in this Chamber have the  first clue what our national deficit is going to be this year? No.   We don't have a clue because we are spending money hand over fist.  Why? Because we are trying to deal with a pandemic that, frankly, our  own public actions and public governments are causing a hell of a lot  of the very damage we are trying to bail out. State and local  governments are taking actions, which basically are tantamount to  takings, shutting down people's livelihoods. Then, they just walk away  and shake their hands, and they go, ``Well, I guess the Federal  Government will bail them out.''   Governors, mayors: ``Sorry, bars, shut down. Sorry, restaurants, shut  down. Sorry, barbershops, shut down. Sorry, live music venues, shut  down. Sorry, artists who have to sing in the live music venue, you are  shut down. Sorry, churches, you can't worship.''                                time  2115    Madam Speaker, I am sitting here in this Chamber, wondering what it  is going to take for the House of Representatives to actually  represent. We don't govern. That is not what we do in America. We  represent.   We each represent whatever we represent, 700,000, 800,000 people,  depending on the district. We are here to share their values and  beliefs and reach some point of actual responsible leadership and do  our job.   But I have to say something here. The President of the United States,  he draws a lot of fire. The President of the United States ran in 2016  on what? Build the wall. Drain the swamp.   And what does drain the swamp mean? I would tell you that, whatever  you think of the President, drain the swamp means everything I am just  talking about and 1,000 other things that are irritating the American  people every single day about why this government, and particularly  this Congress, can't do its job, why bureaucrats stand in the way of  what the people want, why judges make up the law, and why Congress  can't balance a budget. That is the swamp.   The swamp represents the frustration of the American people who,  while extremely willing to have people come to this country with open  arms, also want their border to be secure. They don't want cartels  running the border. They don't want 900,000 people coming to our border  being apprehended and having to deal with it. They don't want cartels  to abuse women and children on the journey. They don't want fentanyl  pouring across our border, and that is the state of our border.   If the President of the United States should dare to say we should  have a secure border, what happened? Colleagues on the other side of  the aisle went to the border and lied about the state of the border  with respect to kids in cages and kids drinking out of toilets.   I went there. My chief of staff went down there the week after claims  were made about kids drinking out of toilets, and they were toilets  that have water fountains attached to them.   But this is the hyperbole that drives public opinion, gets out in  social media, and undermines the one thing that almost all Americans  understand is critically important, and that is to have border security  where cartels don't run our border. That is not a controversial  statement.   By the way, it is not just my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. There are a whole lot of people on my side of the aisle who love  to sit there at the Rio Grande and have a little sign that says ``no  trespassing,'' and then they wink, wink, nod, nod, over here, and they  have a ``help wanted'' sign.   How about we have an honest conversation about what a secure border  looks like? Why don't we sit down at a table and actually do that? I am  sick and tired of Republicans who 10 years ago were saying to those of  us who thought we should have a secure border because we knew what was  happening, and we saw what the cartels were doing, and we saw the  hordes of human trafficking, and we saw the dead bodies in deserts, and  people in our own party were saying: Well, fences are a 19th century  solution to a 21st century problem.   Now, because it is a politically charged thing, the President is for  it and it has become partisan, they say: Well, yeah, we are all for it.   When are we going to do our job, Republicans and Democrats, to do  that, to secure the border of the United States, not because we don't  want to welcome immigrants, but because it is the responsible thing for  a government to do?   Why would we let the Reynosa faction of the Gulf cartel run the  border in the Rio Grande Valley? That is precisely what we are doing.   Why would we allow fentanyl to pour across the border? Why would we  allow addicts in our country to have a constant supply coming through  from Mexico, across our border, through Texas, through Arizona, through  to Mexico, through California? Why would we do that? It defies all  rationality. It makes no sense. Yet, that is what we do, and the  American people are sick and tired of it.   Giving credit where it is due, the President of the United States has  tried to attack that problem, and he has met resistance from the swamp  at every turn. He has met resistance from our Democratic colleagues,  met resistance from bureaucrats at DHS, met resistance from bureaucrats  throughout the administration when he is trying to do what the American  people elected him to do.   When we stand up saying that we should defend the rule of law and  stand beside law enforcement, what happens? The swamp pushes back and  says: No, we can't do that.   Heaven forbid we have Federal law enforcement protecting a  courthouse. Who would have thought?  [[Page H4183]]    The swamp pushes back. Right now, we are facing the struggles that we  are dealing with, with respect to the pandemic.   I suspect that my friend from Arizona is here to talk a little bit  about the data on that. I could be wrong. I think I am right.   There is a lot of stuff that we should be looking at about this  virus. It is a virus. It is not something you bottle up into a  Tupperware container and put on the shelf. It is a virus. It is out. It  is among us. It is in all 50 States. It is in every city and town. It  is a virus.   What are we going to do as a country to work through it? Cower in  fear? Be afraid to actually look at the data? Be afraid to actually  talk to doctors who might have an opposing or different view than the  powers that be at the CDC or the NIH?   Let me be clear. I don't know Dr. Fauci other than having interacted  with him in a hearing or a setting like this. I don't know Dr. Birx  other than similarly engaging as an official. But they are not the  President. They are not an elected Member of Congress. They are not an  elected Member of the Senate.   Why aren't we having hearings with different alternative views from  other health professionals, other doctors? There is a large number of  doctors, not insignificant, with differing opinions: Ioannidis at  Stanford University; Scott Atlas at Stanford; Oxford put out recent  reports; Dr. Risch at Yale, talking about the possible efficacy and  success with HCQ, hydroxychloroquine.    I am not a doctor. I don't know whether HCQ works, but I would like  to know. And I would like to have the right to try. Why is it, in the  United States of America, a supposedly free country, a doctor cannot  prescribe HCQ in certain circumstances? Or why are States preventing  that? Or why are doctors at the CDC or NIH preventing that when there  is evidence, studies, to the contrary, when it is sold off-the-shelf in  other countries around the world because it is a malaria medicine?   Why would we not have a debate about that? You have doctors going  across the street at the Supreme Court of the United States, doing a  press conference. I don't know them, but they are doctors, M.D.s, and  they give a press conference saying how they think HCQ works as a  prophylactic.   What happens? It is censored by Big Tech, shut down as being  potentially misleading. Does that not concern my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle?   That is a genuine question that I would actually like to know the  answer to. But I won't know because the 200-and-some-odd colleagues are  out doing whatever they are doing right now, going to dinner, doing  their thing, going home, will come in tomorrow.   We will rush in here, and we will have three votes. We will never  actually debate it, will we? We will not actually debate it.   Instead, everybody will go to Twitter. Everybody will go to the press  conferences. People will point. They will call doctors crazy. They will  say it is no good, and we will never know, or we won't know unless we  fight through it to try to figure it out ourselves, not doing the hard  work of this body to figure out whether HCQ is a good prophylactic or  not.   Again, I am not advocating for it. I am advocating for--it is  unbelievable to have to say this--I am advocating for actually  investigating it, debating it, finding the truth, and not censoring it.   But that is what is happening. Why are we always saying how bad we  are doing as a country right now? For the longest time: ``We are not  testing. We are not testing. We are not testing.'' We have done over 50  million tests. Are they the right tests? Are we testing the right way?  Maybe we should have a good, robust debate about that.   But we had over 50 million tests. We are testing at a rate only  surpassed by, I think, three other countries. I think we are fourth. I  could be wrong. I think that is right.   No, the rate, the testing, we are fourth. We have 50 million tests,  more than any other country in the world. We are testing by the  thousands in Texas. And all the eyes have been recently on Florida,  Texas, and Arizona. Again, I am sure my friend from Arizona will have  some data on this, but these States which have had, yes, an increase in  the last several weeks, tragically, we are concerned. We are watching  it. Our Governor is all over it. We are paying attention to it, but it  has become a political football.   The total numbers in all of those States still pale in comparison to  New York and New Jersey, in terms of fatalities. I have no real  interest in sitting here and pointing fingers at the Democratic  Governor of New York or the mayor of New York, talking about how they  failed versus how we succeeded or not succeeded, or whatever. Why are  we doing that?   Why aren't we just sitting down together and working together to try  to figure out what the right policies are?   Dare I talk about masks? Am I allowed to talk about masks? It is a  genuine question. Am I actually allowed to talk about masks? Yet, the  Speaker of the House of Representative said--by the way, putting aside  our constitutional duty to represent our constituents and vote on the  floor of this House--that somehow that is a breach of decorum.   And oh, by the way, I am sure all the 12 viewers of this, when they  take their viewers, my opponents will all say: ``Oh, he is an anti- masker.''   I have had this mask since April. My wife sewed a HEPA filter in  here. It is a really good mask. It is not one of those flimsy old  cotton masks that, by the way, were made fun of or said were inadequate  by the NIH 5 years ago in a study.   Yet, we go around, and as long as you virtue signal that you are  wearing a cotton mask, everybody says: Aren't you really important?  Aren't you just loving your country?   Are we doing what we are supposed to do to actually make our country  safer? Does anybody here know for certain? Does anybody know when I am  sitting on an airplane, and the guy two rows over has a cotton mask  kind of dangling down--it is just sitting there. And, oh, the flight  attendant says, ``Good job. You got your mask on.'' Is that making me  safer?   How about when you wear an N95 mask with one of those little valves?  Have we finally gotten around to the side of saying: Oh, we all raced  to get those, but no, you have got the valve. It is kicking too much  air out, and that is going to hurt people?   Why am I saying all that? I am not saying don't wear a mask. What I  am saying is, for goodness sake, this isn't the gospel handed down as  to what precisely is the right way to do it when our own Dr. Fauci was  questioning masks mere months ago, when our own NIH was questioning it,  when there was report after report about it, when Denmark and Sweden  and Finland and all of these other Nordic countries aren't wearing  masks.   ``Oh, no, he is talking about masks. He is an anti-masker.'' That is  what it is all about now. Get on Twitter, bash somebody. They are a  nutball.   When are we going to look at the data and try to do the thing that we  need to do to lead this country forward? Do we know what we are doing  to children right now? Do we have any idea?   We have our own CDC Director talking about the number of suicides  outpacing the number of deaths from COVID.   I love my 10-year-old son. I love my 9-year-old daughter. I would  give my life for them at any given moment, but they are going back to  school on August 20 because it is good for them.                                time  2130    But there are so many children in this country who are not going to  be going back to school because we have scared the bejesus out of the  entire country.   We are America. We cured polio. We put a man on the Moon. We beat  Nazi Germany. We beat Japan. And we are cowering in the corner about a  virus.   Let's look at the numbers. Let's protect the elderly. Let's protect  the people in nursing homes. But, for goodness' sake, let's open our  schools, and don't let teachers' unions hide behind a virus to pretend  they don't want something else when they do, and we know they do.   The President of the United States ought to call a hearing and bring  in Scott Atlas, bring in Dr. Ioannidis, bring in Dr. Rishi, bring in  some of the Oxford folks, and bring in other doctors to talk about the  science. Let's have a  [[Page H4184]]  full discussion about this. Let's show the American people they can go  back to work, they can go back to school, and they can do it safely.   We are destroying our economy, the greatest economy in the history of  the world. Forty-five percent of Black businesses have gone out of  business over the last 5 months.   Do you want to talk about Black lives mattering? How about those 45  percent of businesses?   I guess that doesn't look good on the mound for Major League  Baseball, does it?   I guess that doesn't fit on the back of a jersey for the NBA, does  it?   It doesn't fit on one of those cute little stickers that the NFL  likes to put on their helmets so they can feel good about themselves as  social justice warriors.   Who cares about those families that are destroyed because their  businesses are gone?   But that is what we are doing by our own judgment and by our own  decisions. We should be ashamed.   The people's House. Look at it, Madam Speaker, it is empty. I don't  know who is running your C-SPAN cameras. Take a broad view. Show the  American people the people's House in all its glory, cycling in your  Representatives to come in like robots and vote and walk out and then  vote and then walk out and spend all day voting but never actually  debating or talking.   By the way, 20 or 30 or 40 of them are voting from boats and voting  from their homes using proxy voting.   What is a proxy vote?   I am glad you asked. A proxy vote is when someone isn't actually  doing their constitutional duty of voting here in this Chamber. A proxy  vote is someone sitting at home and telling another Member to vote for  them, delegating the nondelegable. Our Constitution doesn't provide for  that.   In 1793, our Founding Fathers were fighting yellow fever. Five  thousand people had died in Philadelphia out of 50,000--10 percent.  Washington, Madison, Jefferson, and Adams found a way to meet. They  were debating: How can we do this adhering to the Constitution?   Heaven forbid we adhere to the Constitution. We have a duty to be in  this Chamber. We have survived wars and we have survived other  pandemics.   This stuff isn't foreign to me. My dad is a survivor of polio. It is  real. He has got a tracheostomy. He walks with a limp and he can barely  get around. But he is 77 years old, and he is alive because his mom  fought through being a single mom in west Texas after she lost my  grandfather, who died of cancer when my dad was 7, and here is my  grandmother finding out her son has polio in September of 1949.   My dad comes home from the hospital to say good-bye to his dad, whom  he had only known for 2 years because his dad had been in the Pacific  theater. Then my grandmother runs and becomes the first woman elected  county clerk in Nolan County, Texas. She helps my dad, gets up at 4 in  the morning, goes and does therapy. He was the first to go on to  college. I am the first to go on to graduate school, and here I am in  Congress.   It is the American story. It is the American story we ought to be  proud to share, proud to push, and proud to champion. But instead we  are sitting here in an empty Chamber running people through and voting  on things that likely have no chance of becoming law. In fact, we know  these appropriations bills have no chance of becoming law. We know it.  Yet we are showing the American people that we are ``doing something.''   Do you want to know what the swamp is? It is that. It is a disease,  Madam Speaker. Do somethingitis. We have to show the people we are  doing something when you are doing literally nothing. That is what this  Chamber is about. It should be about something better, more, and  bigger.   We can disagree violently about certain issues and policies, but why  can't we come together to balance our budget?   Why can't we come together to figure out how to fight a pandemic  without politicizing it?   Yet that is precisely what we are doing.   May I ask the Speaker how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, it was 9 years, last night, I was in an  emergency room in Austin, Texas. I had fluid on my lungs and I didn't  know what was going on. I found out 2 days later, 3 days later, it was  likely, and then turned out to be, stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma. It was  kind of a curve ball one gets when you have got a 4-month-old daughter,  2-year-old son, and a wife scared out of her mind.   I remember the prayers and I remember the calls. I remember all of it  like it was yesterday. I can't believe it has been 9 years.   Governor Perry, for whom I worked at the time, couldn't have been a  better man or gentleman trying to help us get through it. I went down  to MD Anderson and did a trial drug that is now the standard of care. I  am alive today because of that and because of the great doctor I had at  MD Anderson.   I remember when going through that, of course, you don't know what  the outcome is going to be. It wasn't until October I remember being  down there with my wife when we got the news that the cancer was clear.  I had to finish treatment through January of 2012. It changes your  perspective.    Now, everybody in this Chamber has personally dealt with something  like that. I can't even imagine what my friend Andy Barr is going  through in losing his lovely wife. I can't imagine what folks who have  known Representative Lewis for decades are going through. I can't  imagine what Chairman Nadler has been going through with his wife's  battle with cancer. We could go around the room. All of us deal with  these kinds of things.   But I will acknowledge that, for me, that was intensely personal,  getting a cancer diagnosis at age whatever I was at the time, 39. But  the reason I am bringing it up here is because as I think, through this  virus right now--it is a virus. I know it is bad. I know it is scary. I  know there are people who have lost loved ones. But our reaction to it  does not represent the greatest of this country, in my opinion.   I don't mean that we are not testing enough or we are not getting  enough announcements out about masks. I mean, loved ones who are dying  alone.   Let me be perfectly clear that if any of my loved ones get this  virus, they are not dying alone. No local judge, no local mayor, no  local Governor, no President, and no Member of this body is going to  stop me from seeing my loved one. But that is because I am stubborn.  But we are forcing that environment on a lot of people who don't know  how to fight a system.   Why would we allow that to happen in America? Why?   But that is what we are doing.   Why would we do what we are doing to children out of fear?   Again, I promised myself I would lay down everything I have to defend  and save this Republic for my kids and my grandkids, my now 10-year-old  son and 9-year-old daughter who are with me here this week. But I would  be doing them a disservice if I held them back from going to school.   I know all the arguments. Well, they go to school and then the  teachers will take it home to someone else.   Madam Speaker, if we look at the data, look at who is likely to get  hit by this virus, we should be adults about this. We are leaders. We  set the tone. Fear is not the tone we should be setting as a nation.  Yet that is precisely what we are doing.   We should not be letting loved ones die alone. We should not be doing  what we are doing to children.   By the way, I talked about cancer. I was blessed that I got a  diagnosis at stage III.   What if I had been sick this year? What if it had gotten into my  bones with stage IV? That is happening to Americans right now.   Do we ever talk about that on the floor, or is everybody running  around talking about 150,000 dead Americans because it is the  President's fault?   Why aren't we talking about the suicide rates? Why aren't we talking  about the opioid addiction? Why aren't we talking about the cancer  screenings that aren't occurring? Why aren't we talking about the  suicide?   Veteran suicides are increasing. People are feeling alone, and it is  scarring our children. That is not what a great country does.  [[Page H4185]]    Madam Speaker, we are a great country, and we should darn well start  acting like it again.   Let's debate on the floor here what we should be doing with our  military abroad authorizations of force.   Let's secure the border of the United States and not allow the swamp  to stand in the way of common sense.   Let's stand up for law enforcement, secure our communities, and don't  let people run over streets and burn down buildings.   Let's stand up in the face of a virus. Let's say we are going to  defeat it, and let's damn well defeat it. It is who we are as a people.  It is in our DNA. It has been since our founding. It has been there  through all the wars. It has been there through previous pandemics. And  it is with us here now if we will just tap into it.   This should not be partisan. I look at both directions when I say  that. It should not be partisan. I cannot believe we are sitting here  in an environment where we have allowed a virus to become partisan, but  that is precisely what we have done.   Madam Speaker, I am not going to take up too much more time. I know  that the gentleman from Arizona has been patiently waiting. I didn't  even start to bring up my charts and talk about numbers because I could  never do battle with the gentleman from Arizona when it comes to  presenting that kind of information. I know he will do it well.   But I do know this: We are a great country that is doing great things  right now to combat this virus. I do know that my physician is a great  man. Dr. Yunis grew up in Damascus, Syria.   I asked Dr. Yunis: Doc, I am stage III. I have a 4-month-old, a 2- year-old, and a wife. I am 39. What am I looking at?   Dr. Yunis looked at me and said: I am not going to give you a  percentage.   Later he gave me one because I made him give me one.   He said: I am not going to give you a percentage. For you, it is zero  percent or 100 percent. Choose 100 percent.   When are we going to choose 100 percent? When are we as a body, when  are we as the Senate, when are we as the White House, when are we  together on a nonpartisan basis going to choose 100 percent behind this  country, 100 percent for the rule of law, 100 percent standing  alongside of our law enforcement keeping our communities safe, 100  percent that we are going to have our kids go back to school, we are  going to get back to work, we are going to lift our economy up, and we  are going to prove that the 21st century is going to be the greatest  century that this country has ever known, not because we are cowering  in fear, but because we are facing these things head-on?   That is what 100 percent means. That is what being an American means.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
