 Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute to  the nearly 600,000 Michigan residents who have proudly served in our  Nation's Armed Forces.   Today's veterans have served on many fronts, from the beaches of  Normandy and Iwo Jima, to the rice fields of Korea, to the jungles of  Vietnam, to the Cold War, to the deserts of the Persian Gulf, to the  fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, and right here at  home.   This spirit of service lives on in so many different ways across our  State. Whether they are supporting military families, providing help  for fellow veterans, giving back through religious organizations and  community nonprofits, or inspiring the next generation while coaching  Little League or the local softball team, these patriots show us that  service is more than something you do once. Instead, it is a way of  life all of us should strive for.   Our veterans have done so much for us. It is our solemn duty to keep  the promises we have made to them.   We must also ensure that our veterans receive each and every military  honor they have earned while defending our country. I have been so  fortunate to get to know Jim McCloughan of South Haven, who was awarded  the Medal of Honor earlier this year for saving the lives of 10 of his  fellow soldiers during the Vietnam war. Like so many of our veterans,  Jim has spent the decades since then continuing to serve his community.   I know the sacrifices our veterans made because I have seen it  firsthand. My own father served in the Navy during World War II, and he  always said that veterans shouldn't stand in the back of any line, not  for healthcare, education, housing, the chance at a good job, or the  military honors, they have earned. He was absolutely right, and I have  made it my mission to ensure that every promise made to our veterans is  a promise kept.   Michigan's veterans are the best of us. On this Veterans Day--and  every day--we salute them, we honor them, and we thank them for their  service.   Thank you.                            ____________________
