 Mr. Speaker, for more than 50 years, community health  centers across the United States have delivered affordable, accessible,  and quality primary healthcare to patients regardless of their ability  to pay. They care for the whole person, bringing together medical and  behavioral health with pharmacy services.   In my district, I have seen the important work that goes on at  community health centers in Massachusetts, in Lowell, Lawrence,  Gardner, and Fitchburg. In 2016, these facilities and their staff cared  for more than 100,000 people.   Unfortunately, community health centers are facing a funding cliff if  the Community Health Center program is not reauthorized by the end of  this year. A lack of funding means too many of my constituents would  immediately lose access to care, putting the health of our communities  at risk.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together and  make sure this vital program is funded.                            ____________________
