 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to acknowledge that the 27th  of January marks the anniversary of the Auschwitz concentration camp  being liberated by the Red Army in 1945.   Let this day serve as a reminder that we must honor the victims and  the survivors. We must also pay tribute to the liberators, who rescued  millions of people who nearly fell victim to the Holocaust.   In fact, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the grandmother  of one of my D.C. staffers, who is a 93-year-old survivor of Auschwitz  and is also one of the few survivors of her family, who was tragically  lost at the hands of Nazi murderers.   Anti-Semitism is a plague in this Nation, and it is undoubtedly up to  us to ensure this kind of tragedy is never to be seen again.   This is a tribute to aging survivors and the Jewish community. We  must guarantee access to the services they need to live long and  dignified lives.   This day and every day, we give credence to the dark side of humanity  but strive for a better and brighter future.                            ____________________
