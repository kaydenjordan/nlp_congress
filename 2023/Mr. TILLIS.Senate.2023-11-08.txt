 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Chowan  University, a North Carolina institution of higher education that has  long served our great State and this Nation.  [[Page S5425]]    This year, Chowan University, located in Murfreesboro, NC, is  celebrating the 175th anniversary of its founding, which occurred on  October 11, 1848. Chowan's demisemiseptcenten nial is a time to commemorate the institution, honor the heritage, and  applaud the people who accomplished and are accomplishing extraordinary  things by creating positive change in the lives of others.   Chowan is a Christian educational institution founded by Baptist  families and named Chowan ``people of the south,'' to honor the Native  American Algonquin Chowanoke Tribe. In the spring of 1848, a group of  fathers gathered at the home of Dr. Godwin Cotton Moore, moderator of  the Chowan Baptist Association. These men were determined to have an  institution that would give their daughters a well-rounded education,  and they presented a resolution to the association. The association  appointed the first trustees for the ``female high school,'' to be  called Chowan Female Institute. Dr. Archibald McDowell of South  Carolina was elected first principal, and the institute opened on  October 11, 1848, with 11 students--thus began the institution, which  now boasts over 15,000 alumni who live around the world. These alumni,  friends, students, families, faculty, and staff are held in high  regard. They are transforming the world by solving problems, sharing  talents, and spreading Chowan University's rich story.   Today, we honor Chowan University's commitment to the education of  past, present, and future generations. I ask my fellow Senators to join  me in honoring Chowan University for its service.                            ____________________
