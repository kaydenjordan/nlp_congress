 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution  to repeal an almost two decades-long Authorization for Use of Military  Force against Iraq.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by saying thank you, thank you,  thank you to my colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee.   I was an activist back in 2001, leading the largest immigrant  advocacy organization and the largest march at the time against the war  in Iraq, because we knew that what was happening was wrong. And we were  looking at Congress, and saying, Congress needs to make sure they are  taking action, and Barbara Lee stood up at that time on her own.   The 2002 AUMF was based on a lie; a lie that has resulted in hundreds  of thousands of lives lost, including civilians, U.S. servicemembers,  journalists, humanitarian workers; a lie that was used as the legal  basis for military hostilities beyond Iraq, hostilities that were never  authorized by Congress.   Mr. Speaker, this must be the beginning and not the end of our work  to end endless wars. We must continue our work to forge a meaningful  engagement with the rest of the world toward a lasting peace. Mr.  Speaker, I also thank the chairman for his tremendous leadership.
