 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an important piece of  legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act. This funding is  vital to our national security and the readiness of our military.   As our Nation continues to face threats around the globe, our  soldiers must have the necessary equipment to complete missions and  return home safely.   Just 2 weeks ago, 4,000 of our troops returned home from South Korea  to loved ones at Fort Riley, Kansas. In a short number of weeks ahead  of us this fall, the Dagger Brigade, also from Fort Riley, will travel  to Europe for a 9-month deployment.   This legislation helps ensure readiness for brigade combat teams,  such as the Dagger Brigade, and gives our troops a much-deserved 2.4  percent military pay raise. It also allows for over 17,000 more  soldiers, and allocates $2.3 billion over the administration's request  for maintenance and repair, which is so necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I refuse to send our troops to a gunfight with knives. I  encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to give our men and  women in uniform the tools and support they deserve.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I agree with  the gentleman from Alabama. This bill is about our national security  and about protecting our country, which makes it all the more puzzling  that the Republicans think this is an appropriate place to be debating  amendments on transgender issues. But anyway, they are in charge, so  they can do whatever they want to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Thompson).
