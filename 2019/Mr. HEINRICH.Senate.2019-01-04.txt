 Mr. President, it is an honor to remember the  selfless and inspirational life of Sifu Charles Lin.   A lifetime master, Sifu Lin began studying the martial arts in his  homeland of Taiwan.   He studied under many masters of the martial arts, earning the title  ``Master'' or Sifu.   Sifu Lin moved to New Mexico in 1974 at the age of 23, with only $200  in his pocket.   For more than 40 years, Sifu Lin taught New Mexicans meditation and  self-defense through the martial arts of Ch'i Kung, Tai Chi, and Chuan  Kung Fu at Lin's Martial Arts Academy.   He and his wife also ran the Chinese Culture Center in Albuquerque, a  place for the city's Chinese population to build community, learn  Chinese language, and celebrate their culture.   The fireworks, martial arts demonstrations, and dancing dragons in  the center's annual Chinese New Year festival put Chinese culture on  display.   My thoughts are with his family during this time of mourning.   The lessons Sifu Lin imparted on all of his students will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________
