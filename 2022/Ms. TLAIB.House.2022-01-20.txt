 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and the committee  staff for working with me on this important amendment and for their  leadership on this bill. I can't thank him enough and look forward to  him one day coming to my district for a visit to our VA hospital that  we love and cherish.   Mr. Speaker, the transition of being on Active Duty to being a  veteran is not easy. The EVEST Act helps with that transition and makes  life easier for those who served our Nation.   This act is also a great opportunity to review the automatic  enrollment programs and learn what works and what doesn't, because  ensuring effective implementation is critical to its success.   Mr. Speaker, I am a social worker at heart, and we have to ensure  that our veterans' lives are changing for the better with this bill. My  amendment ensures the lessons learned during implementation of the  program are preserved for other agencies, as well as to learn, again,  what to do and what not to do.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the committee for working with me on this  and look forward to my colleagues' support of this amendment. I also  look forward to working with the committee on a number of other issues  impacting our veterans, especially veteran suicide and access to mental  health services.
