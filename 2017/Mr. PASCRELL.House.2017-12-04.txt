 Mr. Speaker, the President himself will see a financial  windfall. If the majority wasn't helping him hide his tax returns, the  American people could see the truth.   The bill exacerbates dramatic and historic health inequality, wealth  inequality. Adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt, as this bill  does, without benefiting the middle and working class is legislative  malpractice.   So while Republicans tout this as a middle class tax cut, some  taxpayers at every income level will pay more on this bill. A middle- aged married couple with no children earning $80,900 a year who itemize  could end up paying $4,330 more in 2018. Many of my constituents will  see a big tax increase after losing the full State and local tax  deduction. That is absurd.   The authors of this bill said all of the individual tax cuts will  expire after 2025, as well as change the measure of inflation, which  will slowly bump taxpayers into higher income brackets. Are we kidding,  and who are we kidding?
